PRESENTER: Welcome, everybody.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.560
Today's author Google
guest is Jeremy Rifkin.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.350
The book is titled "Zero
Marginal Cost Society:

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.130
The Internet of Things,
the Collaborative Commons,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.660

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.790
and are used in hundreds of
universities, corporations,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.590
and government agencies
around the world.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.040
In 2001, Jeremy Rifkin published
the New York Times bestseller,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.700
"The Third Industrial
Revolution."

book, his vision

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.800
of a sustainable
post-carbon economic era

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.550
has been endorsed by the
European Union and the United

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.570
Nations, and embraced by
world leaders-- including

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.340
chancellor Angela
Merkel of Germany,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.720

and "The Hydrogen Economy."

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.080
Jeremy Rifkin has been an
advisor to the European Union

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.142
for the past decade.

00:01:17.142 --> 00:01:20.740
He also served as an advisor

prime minister Jose Luis
Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.090
and prime minister
Janez Jansa of Slovania,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.760
during their respective
European Council presidencies.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.840
Mr. Rifkin is the

Economic Sustainability plan
to address the triple challenge

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.450
of the global economic crisis,
energy security, and climate

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.780
change.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.340
The Third Industrial Revolution
was formally endorsed

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.350
by the European
Parliament in 2007,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.240
and is now being implemented
by various agencies

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.190
within the European Commission,
as well as in the 27 member

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.550
states.

His monthly column
on global issues

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.750
has appeared over
many years in many

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.480
of the world's leading
newspapers and magazines,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.770

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.290
After this somewhat
long introduction,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.650
but worth reading it, please
welcome to Google, Mr. Jeremy

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.486
Rifkin.

00:03:17.486 --> 00:03:22.224
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:23.890
JEREMY RIFKIN: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.520
It's a pleasure to be with you
here at Google this afternoon.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.055
We're just beginning to
glimpse the bare outlines

00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:42.010
of a new economic system
entering onto the world stage.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.150
This is the first
new economic system

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.640
to emerge since the
advent of capitalism--

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.910
and its antagonist, socialism--
in the early 19th century.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.205
It's a remarkable
historical event.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:59.210
It has long-term
implications for every one

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.800
of us, our children,
and our grandchildren.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.560
This new economic system is
the collaborative commons.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.590
And what's triggering this shift
to a new economic paradigm,

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.120
a collaborative commons economic
system, is something called

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.890
zero marginal cost.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.390
Now, zero marginal
cost is something

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.630
you're very familiar
with here at Google,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.240
and certainly we are
the business community--

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.930
not very well known
in the public.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.390
Marginal cost-- the cost of
producing an additional unit

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.490
of a good and service after
your fixed costs are covered.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.090
Business people have always
wanted to reduce marginal cost,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.000
and they're always in
search of doing that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.700
And here's why.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.680
And I want to introduce
to you a paradox.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.730
There's really a
paradox deeply embedded

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.860
in the heart of the
capitalist system-- previously

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.770
undisclosed, really.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.690
This paradox has
been responsible

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.350
for the great
success of capitalism

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.520
and the invisible hand
of the marketplace.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.550
The paradox is this
invisible hand success

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.730
is now leading to
its potential demise,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.320
and the advent of
a new successor

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.950
paradigm to replace it.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.290
Let me explain.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.410
Sellers in a capitalist
market are always

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.130
attempting to find
new technologies that

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.480
can increase their productivity,
reduce their marginal cost

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.070
so they can put out
cheaper products,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.390
win over consumers
in market share,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.480
bring home profits
for their investors.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.760
Clear?

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.430
So business people have
always welcomed the reduction

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.090
of marginal cost in the
production and distribution

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.070
of goods and services.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.230
It's just that the
business community never

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.870
anticipated in their
wildest imagination

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.000
the prospect of a technology
revolution so extreme

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.940
in its productivity
that it could reduce

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.050
those marginal costs to near
zero across the value chain,

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.360
making goods and services
essentially priceless, nearly

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.075
free, abundant, and beyond
the market exchange economy.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.800
That's beginning
getting to happen.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.790
The first inkling of
this paradox, of course,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.322
was Napster, back in 1999.

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:23.030
All of a sudden,
millions of young people

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.155
that apparently had nothing
else to do after school

00:06:25.155 --> 00:06:29.400
but figure out new software
in order to share music

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.210
and bypass providing royalties
to the music industry.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.130
Then this zero
marginal cost phenomena

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.120
went on to invade the entire
information goods industry.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.490
Millions of consumers
became prosumers.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.230
And they began producing their
own information goods-- videos

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.960
on YouTube, news blogs,
e-books, and decimated

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.560
the newspaper and magazine
publishing industry.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.750
Newspapers went out of business.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.850
Magazines went out of business.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.140
And I'm in book publishing.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.932
I can tell you that free
e-books have decimated the book

00:07:06.932 --> 00:07:07.765
publishing industry.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.979
For a long time,
industry watchers

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:17.020
said, well, this is fine.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.486
We understand that more and more
people are becoming prosumers.

00:07:20.486 --> 00:07:21.860
And they're
producing and sharing

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.430
their own audio, their own
videos, their own text,

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.560
their news blogs.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.100
They're working together
and sharing information

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.750
on Wikipedia.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.320
We understand that.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.530
But we think that more and
more free goods and services

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.140
provides the basis so that
the premiums will allow people

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.900
to then go up to this-- the
freemiums will allow people

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.070
to go up and have premiums.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.950
In other words, if
you're a musician,

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.900
you give away your music.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.190
And then you hope that
the long tail will set in,

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.880
and enough people will then
decide to go from the freemium

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.030
to the premium, go
to your concert,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.690
and pay a lot of money.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.490
Or the New Your
Times will say, look,

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.020
we'll give out 20
articles a month free.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.730
And we hope that the freemium
will encourage a certain number

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:09.240
of people to subscribe to
our new service, the premium.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.750
It hasn't happened.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.070
This was wishful
thinking, or naive.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.240
The more and more we
are able, as prosumers,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.760
to produce and share our
own information goods,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.937
the less likely we are to move
from freemiums to premiums.

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:25.520
Because our attention
span is limited,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.900
and there are so much free
goods that they really

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.836
don't push us into
the premium category.

00:08:32.836 --> 00:08:34.169
And the proof is in the pudding.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.502
If you take a look at the
newspaper industry, magazines,

00:08:36.502 --> 00:08:39.230
book publishing, and
the recording industry,

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.419
they've never come back
from zero marginal cost.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.680
Economists, however,
have-- up until the moment

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.720
now-- our economists
have thought,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.230
well, we think there's
a firewall here.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.660
And that is, even though more
and more information goods

00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.350
are heading toward near zero
marginal cost in virtual worlds

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.480
that they will not
cross the firewall

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.816
into the physical world of brick
and mortar goods and services.

00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:09.315
No longer.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.530
What's happening now is that the
communication internet is now

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:22.970
expanding to an internet of
things, a physical internet.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.880
So what we're beginning to see
is the communication internet

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.160
is just beginning in
Europe, where I work,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.970
to converge with an
emerging energy internet

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.400
that we're laying across
Europe, and a nascent automated

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.830
logistics and
transport internet.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.130
The internet of things
is an expansive internet

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.570
that allows us to go
from the world of bits

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.580
to the world of atoms.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.300
And when we have these
three internets embedded

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.430
in one system-- a
communication internet that's

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.890
interacting continually
with an energy internet

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.320
and a transport and logistics
internet in one platform--

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.150
this internet of
things allows us

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.820
to begin moving near zero
marginal cost from information

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.790
goods to physical goods.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.950
The internet of things, three
interoperable internets,

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.150
then connect out
with sensors across

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.230
the entire economic value chain.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.850
Even though this
internet of things

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:24.290
is just in its early stages,
we have 14 billion sensors now

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.440
connecting resource flows.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.560
We have sensors connecting
warehouses, distribution

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.320
centers.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.280
We have sensors along
smart road systems.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.210
We have sensors connecting the
production lines on the factory

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:37.720
floor.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.480
We have sensors connecting
the new energy internet

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.300
so we know the price of
electricity moment to moment.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.740
We have sensors connecting
offices and vehicles and homes

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.410
and appliances, continually
feeding big data to these three

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.679
internets that operate
as one platform--

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:57.720
the communication, internet,
the fledgling energy

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.880
internet, the nascent automated
transport and logistics

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.270
internet.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.440
By 2020, IBM says we'll
be at 30 billion sensors.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.930
And a recent forecast
study a few months ago

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:14.760
says that by 2030, we will have
100 trillion sensors connecting

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.145
everything with everyone in
one global neural network.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.570
When we move from the internet
to the internet of things,

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.610
and we move from
bits to atoms, we

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.090
began to see a completely
new economic model

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.950
they can get us to near zero
marginal cost in the production

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.180
and distribution of physical
energy and physical products.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.130
So a prosumer, and millions of
prosumers-- and pretty soon,

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.970
billions of
prosumers-- are going

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.600
to be able to go up on this
expanded internet which

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.300
is already here.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.490
And they'll be able to access
the big data flowing back

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.430
from all the sensors
to the three internets

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.650
operating in that general
purpose technology platform.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.460
And with the apps that companies
like Google will provide

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.700
and others, they'll
be able to use

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.604
that data with
their own analytics

00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:11.020
to create their own algorithms,
because you can program it

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:11.910
right into the app.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.010
You don't have to be
a rocket scientist.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.490
And then any one of
millions of prosumers

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.590
will be able to increase
their productivity,

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.570
dramatically reduce
their marginal cost,

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:27.270
and produce, consume, and
share their own physical energy

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.860
and manufactured
goods with each other,

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.730
just like we now do
with information goods.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.390
While this is early on, the
trajectory is already clear.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:41.810
So if I had said to you in 1989,
a year before the World Wide

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:49.930
Web went online, that 24 years
later 40% of the human race,

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.870
equipped with a cheap
cellphone, a raspberry computer,

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.550
could send their own
audio, video, and text,

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.580
create their own
entertainment, their own news,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.114
their own knowledge-- any one
of those 40% of the human race--

00:13:04.114 --> 00:13:06.030
and then share it with
each other at near zero

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.790
marginal cost on
the World Wide Web,

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.670
what would you
have said in 1989?

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.240
We did it in less than 20 years.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.230
As we move to the expansive
internet of things,

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.090
and from bits to atoms, what
I'm suggesting to you here

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.780
at Google is we're going to
be able, in the next 20 years,

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.830
to move to near zero marginal
cost in the production

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.470
of energy and some
manufactured goods.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.550
Let me preface this.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:37.350
The big wild card here is food
and water and climate change.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.050
Because if we can't
address climate change

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.900
and we continue on this road,
if we can't produce food

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.780
and don't have access to
water in a reliable fashion,

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.110
everything I'm telling
you is derailed.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.860
Let me give you an example of
how this new system is already

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.230
in place in Europe.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.240
Let's take energy.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.530
We now have millions
and millions

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:05.610
of players, urban
dwellers, small businesses,

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.280
large companies
who are producing

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:13.210
their own solar and wind green
electricity on site in Europe.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.120
And that's at near zero
marginal cost right now.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.440
So it's not academic.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.006
The technology for
harvesting solar and wind

00:14:21.006 --> 00:14:22.630
is still a little
pricey, but the price

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:27.690
is on an evolutionary curve,
just like computer chips.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.026
We never expected in
1960 that computer chips

00:14:31.026 --> 00:14:32.400
would be on an
exponential curve.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.437
And here's where I agree
with Ray Kurzweil who

00:14:34.437 --> 00:14:36.020
I know is now here
with you at Google.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.000
Send him my regards.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.290
We did a lecture
together a few years ago.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.400
The pricing technology--
a solar watt

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.742
cost $60 to produce
a solar watt in 1970.

00:14:46.742 --> 00:14:50.490
It's $0.66 today,
and it's going down.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.400
We're in a 20-year exponential
curve for solar and wind

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.780
technologies.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.550
So we're going to see the
price of these technologies

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.250
be as cheap as the
price that we now

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:03.170
have for cellphones, mobile,
et cetera in 20 years.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.340
We see the curve.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.840
Ray Kurzweil says that
if we are doubling

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.890
on the exponential
curve every two years,

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.750
eight more doublings, 16
years, we're in the solar age.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.970
He may be little optimistic.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.580
I'd say within 25
years we're there.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.200
But here's the
interesting thing.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.080
The moment you put
up a solar panel

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.800
on your building,
or a wind turbine

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.210
on-site, even
before you pay back

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.690
the fixed cost-- and that's
usually three to eight years,

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.380
so it's not a long time.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.210
Immediately though,
your marginal costs

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.690
are near zero, because the
sun off your roof is free.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.470
The wind off the side of
your building is free.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.680
The geothermal heat coming up
from under the ground is free.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.770
Your garbage converted
in a bioconverter

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.230
to energy in your
kitchen, that's all free.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.930
And in Germany,
we've now seen this.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.840
I've been advising the
chancellor, some of you know,

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.423
and working with the
German government

00:15:53.423 --> 00:15:55.880
for a number of
years, many years.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.500
We're now at 25% green
electricity in Germany

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.380
in seven years.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.080
We're heading to 35% green
electricity in four more years.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.580
And you know who's
producing it all?

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.121
We have a million
buildings that have

00:16:06.121 --> 00:16:09.080
been converted to
micro power plants.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.920
And millions of small
players have joined together

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.710
in cooperatives-- small and
medium-sized businesses,

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:15.780
homeowners.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.560
They're generating
the new electricity.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.080
What about the big,
huge, global electricity

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:27.260
companies out of
Germany, EnBW, E.ON?

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.911
They're gone in less
than seven years.

00:16:29.911 --> 00:16:32.160
Remember what happened to
the recording industry, what

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.701
happened to newspapers,
what happened

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:34.910
to magazines and publishing?

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.690
This is happening to
the huge global power

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.020
companies in Germany.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.050
And they acknowledge it.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.430
This last week, one of
the directors of E.ON

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.510
said, we're out of it.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.980
They're producing less
than 7% of the new power,

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.500
and going down, down, down.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.550
They can't scale it.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.350
Because in the first and
second industrial revolution,

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.120
we have to scale with
vertically-integrated companies

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.600
that put everything
under one roof

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.270
in order to get
economies of scale.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.430
The internet of things is
designed to be distributed,

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.700
collaborative, peer-directed.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.535
And it scales to lateral
economies of scale.

00:17:07.535 --> 00:17:08.910
Think of millions
of young people

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.440
sharing music, wiping out
the recording industry.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.240
Or think of millions of people
sharing knowledge on Wikipedia

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.010
and wiping out the
Encyclopedia Britannica.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.400
Now this is actually
happening in Germany right now

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.660
with green electricity.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.560
It's a disruptive revolution
in the best sense of the term.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.490
Then let's take 3D
printed products.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:34.080
We now have several
hundred thousand hobbyists,

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.670
thousands of small and
medium-sized startup companies

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.120
that are printing out their
own 3D printed products.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.580
And they're attaching their
3D printing operation,

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.330
at least in Europe, into
this new internet of things,

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.360
this third Industrial
Revolution.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.470
So if you were a 3D
printer, whether you're

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:56.180
in Senegal or Berlin, you
go up on the internet.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.770
You download your software.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:58.820
It's all free.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.220
Most of this software
is free, open source.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:07.340
Then you use for your feed
stock recycled plastic.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.980
They're now using
recycled paper,

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.790
or even using sand and
gravel and melting it down.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:16.900
So you can get local feed stock
at near zero marginal cost.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.400
Then they're powering
their 3D printing factory

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.330
with green energy from
their energy internet

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.330
that's generated at
near zero marginal cost.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.990
Then they're marketing
their products

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:33.451
on global websites like Etsy
with very little advertising

00:18:33.451 --> 00:18:33.950
cost.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:37.130
You just pay a short
fee, low marginal cost.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.370
And then we're just beginning to
put in the logistics internet.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.630
So we have now
electric vehicles.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.500
And two or three years from
now, all the six major auto

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.240
companies will have
fuel cell vehicles

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.070
out-- trucks, cars, and
buses, mass production.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.629
You'll be able to power your
vehicle to send your 3D printed

00:18:55.629 --> 00:18:57.670
product to market with
your own green electricity

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.410
from the energy internet,
nearly free marginal cost.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.680
And the electric vehicles
in a few years from now

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.680
will be printed out.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.650
The first printed vehicle
now exists Canada, the URBI.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:09.710
You've probably seen it.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.090
It runs on solar.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.670
It's pretty impressive.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.410
And then you'll
have GPS guidance.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:18.010
And thanks to Google, we
will have driverless vehicles

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.440
that can move across
the system at will

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.716
near zero marginal cost.

00:19:23.716 --> 00:19:24.590
This is a revolution.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.160
The question becomes this.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.880
If millions, then hundreds
of millions of people

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:41.470
can begin to produce, consume,
or share their own information

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.620
goods, energy, and a lot
of their manufactured goods

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.730
at near zero marginal cost,
making them nearly free

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:54.310
and beyond the exchange model
of the capitalist market,

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.070
what kind of new
economic system do we

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.260
have to envision here at
Google, and other places,

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:05.640
to organize the world, the
one that I'm laying out here?

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.000
Economists will usually
say there's only two ways

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.360
to organize the economy--
either the government

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.190
or private enterprise, or
some combination of both.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.270
Capitalism, socialism,
or in Europe,

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.850
a social market economy.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:23.140
Our economists ignore
a third institution,

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.190
which is responsible in our
daily lives for a whole range

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.650
of goods and services
you and I rely on.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:32.850
And it's not market,
and it's not government.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.210
It's the social commons.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.490
Part of it's the formalized
not-for-profit sector.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.610
But it's the social commons from
cooperatives to credit unions.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.450
And a huge part
of the human race

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.190
is engaged in activities
in the social commons.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.655
And with cooperatives,
you share.

00:20:48.655 --> 00:20:50.570
And when people say,
how do you make money

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.200
if you're not in a
profit-making organization?

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.390
How do you make profit?

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.220
Wake up call-- there are
hundreds of millions of people,

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.040
actually billions of people,
who are parts of cooperatives.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.540
The entire world
electricity system, the US,

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.880
are world electric cooperatives.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.830
And it's almost 50% of
our transmission lines.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.330
When you get food
at the store, it's

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.030
coming from agricultural
cooperatives.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:14.110
Most people around the world
live in housing cooperatives.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.620
In Europe, banking
cooperatives--

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.161
if you're from
Europe, they're bigger

00:21:17.161 --> 00:21:19.160
than the commercial banks.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.470
And it goes on, and on, and on.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.620
So the social commons
is ignored by economists

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.245
because it doesn't
create finance capital.

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:30.590
It creates social capital.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.890
But it's a big revenue player.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.690
In 40 countries surveyed,
the social commons

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.750
is responsible for about
$2.2 trillion in revenue,

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.490
and it's responsible for over
5% of the GDP in many countries,

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.380
including the US.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.960
What's happening now
is the social commons--

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.280
which is a venerable
institution that we

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.660
rely on for educational
institutions that

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.570
are nonprofit, health
services, day care

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.470
centers for our
children, assisted

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.650
living for the elderly,
environmental organizations,

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.830
cultural sports, arts,
it goes on and on.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.910
If they were eliminated and
we just had the marketplace,

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.670
we would not have much
of a life on the planet.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.910
What's making this social
commons now more relevant

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:22.350
than anytime in the past
is this internet of things.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.700
Because the internet of things
is a general purpose technology

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.910
platform that's designed to
be the technological soul

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.860
mate of a social commons.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.700
The whole design is to be
distributed, collaborative,

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.200
scales laterally not vertically,
and it rewards collaboration

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.540
across these lateral networks.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.610
It creates a sharing community.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.480
And of course, who understands
this better than Google?

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.620
Because you helped us
create a sharing community.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.369
When we were kids, we
always said, boy, it

00:22:52.369 --> 00:22:54.180
would be nice if
there was a magic box.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.619
And all we have to do is
click in, and all of a sudden,

00:22:56.619 --> 00:22:58.660
within three seconds, the
knowledge of the world.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.740
You did it.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.950
You did it by cueing into a
communication internet that

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:07.380
allowed us to laterally scale.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.850
But that's just the
beginning of the story.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.710
So what's happening
now is this expansive

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.320
of internet of things
allows millions and millions

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.640
and millions of consumers
to be prosumers and join

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.200
with small and
medium-sized enterprises

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.360
and connect directly,
eliminate all the middle men

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.780
of vertically-integrated
global companies.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.750
It's the middle men in
vertically-integrated global

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:34.810
corporations, the Fortune 1,000,
that mark up their transaction

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.000
costs along the value chain
in order to have the margins.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.510
If you eliminate the middle man
with laterally-scaled networks,

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.530
you eliminate all
of those margins.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.610
And you can directly
engage each other.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.930
But it creates a new system.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.900
What I suspect we're seeing
here is a hybrid system-- part

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.365
capitalist market, part
collaborative commons.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.370
The capitalist market is
not going to disappear.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:06.740
There will be many goods that
are sophisticated and will

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.440
require a capitalist
exchange economy.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.860
And there'll be sufficient
margins for profit and return.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.150
But I do believe that
by the time some of you

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:20.477
are my age, mid-century,
most of our economic life

00:24:20.477 --> 00:24:22.310
is going to be on the
collaborative commons.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.080
It's just too
sweet to say no to.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.960
There'll be attempts to stop it
and thwart it and hold it up.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.664
But when the
technology's available,

00:24:32.664 --> 00:24:34.330
people will get it
one way or the other.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.410
The recording industry
was not able to stop

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.040
file sharing of music.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.540
The newspaper and magazine
industry and book publishing,

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.220
very powerful
industries, they were not

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.050
able to stop lateral
economies of scale.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.640
So I think the
capitalist market's

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.920
going to be a very
powerful player here,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.761
but probably a niche player in
a more dominant collaborative

00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:56.260
commons.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:01.920
And it will be an aggregator
of networks-- the Googles,

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.910
the Facebooks, the Twitters.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:07.670
There'll be a lot of this
aggregating of networks

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.800
to provide the technological
base for the internet of things

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.470
expansion, because that's
sophisticated software

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:14.970
and hardware.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.410
That's where you find
the edge in order

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.340
to have the capitalist
market work together

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.970
with a collaborative commons.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.250
In economics, we've
always believed

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.260
that the most
efficient economy is

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.580
where you sell at marginal cost.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.390
We just never expected
zero marginal cost.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.540
I'll let you in on something.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.940
This'll amuse you.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.800
And Larry Summers, if you're
hear this, my little thing

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.370
here with the folks at Google,
this is pretty interesting.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:46.080
Larry Summers was the president
of Harvard University, past US

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.950
Secretary of the Treasury.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.840
In 2001, after the bubble
burst, the dot com,

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.580
the Federal Reserve of Kansas
City held a special seminar.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.890
They wanted to talk about
the new data and information

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.140
industries that were emerging.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.684
And Larry Summers-- and
is it Bradford DeLong here

00:26:02.684 --> 00:26:04.100
at the University
of California?--

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.490
issued a paper to
start the conversation.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:08.890
They got what was happening.

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.230
They glimpsed the paradox.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.980
And so Summers and
DeLong said, we

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.610
have this new
technology revolution

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.660
that's going to be as
important as electricity--

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.470
data, information,
and computing.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.760
Now the problem we face,
though, is marginal cost.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.930
Because as this new
technology comes on board,

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.620
we're heading to near
zero marginal cost

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.540
in information goods.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.960
But when you get to
zero marginal cost,

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.570
we can't return
investment and get profit.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.316
So what do we do?

00:26:42.316 --> 00:26:43.850
You know what he suggested?

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:47.520
He did say that we agree
that the marginal cost is

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.609
the most efficient place in
which to price your product.

00:26:51.609 --> 00:26:53.150
But he said we can't
do this anymore.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.330
We're going to have to favor
monopolies-- monopolies.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.910
temporary monopolies--
to keep the marginal cost

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.945
above near zero cost so
we can return profits

00:27:01.945 --> 00:27:03.120
to the investors.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.780
You all got this?

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.740
He said the competitive market--
that's private enterprise

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.240
capitalism-- does
not work when you

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.300
get to near zero marginal cost.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.280
And he said, we don't know
what the replacement paradigm

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.410
will be.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.160
The fact that the
former Secretary

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.390
Treasurer and President
of Harvard University

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.180
actually suggested
there's a replacement

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.870
paradigm that the competitive
market doesn't function

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.750
and we need monopoly
is astounding.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.180
But he thought he was talking
to a small group of people

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.330
inside the Federal Reserve.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.130
It's in my book in chapter one.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.330
Yeah, it's amusing.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.090
So I'm waiting to hear from him.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:38.570
I did an opinion piece
in The Guardian on this

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:39.360
about a week ago.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.740
I haven't heard from him yet.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.120
He may say silent on this.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.950
But what's interesting is
he understood the dilemma.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.030
He and Bradford DeLong,
they understood it.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.770
But the dilemma is
also an opportunity.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.380
And there will be many
companies like Google

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.000
who can find ways to
aggregate networks

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.210
to allow this collaborative
commons to flourish and find

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.890
some value in doing that.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.290
Nowhere will the impact
of near zero marginal cost

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:15.420
have a bigger reach then
in labor employment.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.550
This is what comes up
every time I raise this.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.670
We're heading to near
zero marginal cost labor

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:26.230
with these new technologies--
with analytics, algorithms,

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.730
artificial
intelligence, robotics,

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.730
pattern recognition technology.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.610
Some of the older
people remember-- well,

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:33.984
we talked about
it at lunch-- you

00:28:33.984 --> 00:28:36.250
read my book "The End of Work."

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.370
Well, I projected in 1995--
you don't look that old,

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:44.090
either-- 1995 that we would
be moving to a workless world.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:45.990
It was controversial
at the time.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.670
But I notice that
now, in the last year,

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.461
this new spate of books
coming out at least

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:51.850
acknowledged that that was
right on target, that book.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.550
We have workerless
factories right now.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.360
We have virtual
retailing right now.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.750
We have eliminated
massive amounts

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.230
of blue collar, white
collar, and service workers,

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:06.580
and we're just beginning to
shift into an analytical world

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.430
that's basically supervised
with advanced analytics

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:11.140
an robotics and AI.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.604
We're now eliminating
knowledge workers.

00:29:13.604 --> 00:29:15.020
We don't need all
the accountants,

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.880
the attorneys, the radiologists.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.760
We can do it with the software.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.820
So the question then
becomes, in a world

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:25.130
where we're heading towards
zero marginal cost labor, what

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.960
do people do throughout life,
if they're no longer needed

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.460
in the marketplace?

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.420
In the mid-term,
short to mid-term,

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.190
we have one silver lining.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.080
There's going to
be one last surge

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.030
of mass and professional
wage labor in the next 30

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.900
years, one last surge.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.710
That's to do the build out
of the internet of things.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.540
It takes labor intensivity to
build out this infrastructure.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.610
In Germany, when we got
10% green electricity,

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.690
we'd already created
as many jobs--

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.460
350,000 jobs-- as the
entire rest of the energy

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.990
industry combined, only at 10%.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.760
So we have to build out and
change the whole energy system

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.060
from fossil fuels and
nuclear to renewables.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.520
We have to convert
every building

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.900
in the world, existing and new
ones, to your own power plant.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.850
We have to insulate them, seal
them up, get them efficient,

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.844
and put the technology on.

00:30:16.844 --> 00:30:19.010
As I say in Germany, we've
done a million buildings,

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.570
and lots of jobs.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:25.070
We have to transform the entire
electricity grid of the world

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:29.080
from servomechanical to a
digital laterally-scaled

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.840
internet.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.560
That's a huge amount of
professional and semi-skilled

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.230
and skilled work to lay it down.

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.530
And we have to put in
the automated logistics

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:40.310
and transport network, and
change from internal combustion

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:44.860
engine transport to
driverless fuel cell vehicles.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.800
So in the next 30 to 40 years,
we have to do the build out.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.700
My global consulting
team, TR Consulting,

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.240
has some of the major companies
in the world involved--

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.990
logistics, IT, electronics.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.820
We're actually working with
entire countries and regions

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.430
in the world right
now, and laying out

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.790
this internet of things
Third Industrial Revolution.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:03.540
It's not academic.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:07.630
Where will the new jobs be?

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.760
Well, first of all, if
millions and millions of people

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.170
are producing and
sharing their own energy

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.110
in 3D printed products
and information goods,

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:19.200
they're going to need less
income at zero marginal cost.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.090
They're still going
to need employment.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.910
If the marketplace
doesn't need them,

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:28.120
because we can produce the
energy and the products

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.070
in the marketplace with
just high technology,

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.470
where will you get
the employment?

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.420
In the social commons.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.820
The social commons creates
social capital, human beings

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.960
with the other human
beings, creating

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.820
communities-- cultural,
sports, arts, wellness, health,

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.221
quality of life.

00:31:46.221 --> 00:31:47.970
Those are, the more
important employments.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.440
Making widgets is
not as intellectually

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.170
challenging and motivating
to the young mind

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.990
as it is trying to create
a sense of human community,

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.750
a sense of
transcendence and sense

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.680
of finding meaning in the world.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:07.870
Between 2000 and 2010, the
social commons grew by 42%

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.510
in revenue.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.030
The GDP grew by 16% in revenue.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.030
Did you catch that?

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.950
It's already happening.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.500
And in the last 15
years, employment

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.420
in the social commons
kept going up, up, up.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.580
Employment in the marketplace
kept going down, down, down.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.600
And during the Great
Recession, employment

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.320
in the social commons went up.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.620
Employment in the
marketplace went down.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.689
When you survey
high school kids,

00:32:35.689 --> 00:32:38.230
it's interesting where they want
to be-- the millennials, not

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:39.525
the X'ers.

00:32:39.525 --> 00:32:40.900
Because the
millennials have gone

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.066
through the Great Recession.

00:32:42.066 --> 00:32:45.020
And this is kind of a
different group now.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.180
They asked 9,000 honor
students, the best and brightest

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.160
high school students, last
year, what kind of employment

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:51.680
do you want?

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.888
And they said, we don't care
so much about the money.

00:32:53.888 --> 00:32:58.660
We want meaningful
jobs that challenge us.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.320
And when they surveyed 200
companies or institutions

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.190
they could work
for, many of them

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.680
chose those institutions that
were in the social commons.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.090
And do you know what the
number one institution they all

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.390
chose to be employed in,
9,000 honor students?

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.040
It wasn't Google.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.670
It wasn't General Motors.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.600
It was St Jude's Hospital.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.630
Isn't that interesting?

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.500
I wouldn't have
even gotten that.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.980
A hospital where you
go in, you don't pay,

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.210
and you are provided for.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.120
Interesting.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.090
Now, economists will
say, well, wait a minute.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:32.880
Isn't this social
commons a parasite?

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.500
It isn't a
self-sufficient sector,

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.660
because it relies on government
grants and private philanthropy

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.830
to maintain itself.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.740
That's a myth.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.360
The Johns Hopkins University
survey of 40 countries

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:50.310
shows that 50% or
more of the revenue

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:52.540
in the nonprofit
social commons world

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.280
is fees for services
rendered-- health care

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.320
centers, educational
organizations,

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.120
environmental groups, et cetera.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.520
Only 35% of the revenue comes
from government entitlement,

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.230
and maybe 10%, 15%
from philanthropy.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.550
Well, on this scale,
you'd have to then ask

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:09.489
about the marketplace.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:13.960
Because 36% percent of all
the GDP in the United States

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.280
goes from the government
taxpayers to private enterprise

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.158
so that they can engage
in building out things

00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:20.699
that we need.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:23.040
So is that parasitic?

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.389
We provide more for them
than we do this sector.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:28.679
So I think what we have
here is a very interesting

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.409
dynamic unfolding.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:34.409
It's going to raise very
substantial questions about who

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.050
will control this
internet of things.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.840
Will it be open and transparent?

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.900
And let me say, Google has a
very big responsibility here

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.179
to lead.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.085
We are very worried
about network neutrality.

00:34:44.085 --> 00:34:46.498
And I know you are, as well.

00:34:46.498 --> 00:34:49.690
You know, network neutrality
was critical to the idea

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:51.600
of the World Wide Web.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.469
And if we're having
an internet of things

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:55.909
without network
neutrality, it fails.

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:59.080
It will be enclosed,
privatized, monopolized,

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.190
and we will not get to a
near zero marginal cost

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.040
collaborative commons world.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.690
In January, the US Court of
Appeals-- the second highest

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:12.950
court in the country-- five to
four, you can guess the vote.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:15.620
They struck down
network neutrality,

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.260
the central principle of
the Federal Communication

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.270
Commission overseeing
the internet.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.920
Because they said this was
not within their mandate.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.290
So now the FCC has
to go back and try

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:30.300
to recast this idea of network
neutrality with new protocols.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.880
But already, as you well
know, the cable and telecom

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.410
companies are saying, wait
a minute, we own the pipes.

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:37.140
We're getting tired of this.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.760
We want to make sure that
we get some return here.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.015
So we feel we ought to be able
to charge different prices.

00:35:45.015 --> 00:35:47.860
And network neutrality means
everyone's treated the same.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.000
You get a service
provider, you go up there.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.919
No one's left behind.

00:35:50.919 --> 00:35:52.460
No one's put at the
back of the line.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.207
No one's put at the
front of the line.

00:35:54.207 --> 00:35:56.040
But now the telecom and
cable companies say,

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:56.998
we want to change that.

00:35:56.998 --> 00:36:00.560
We want to provide different
kinds of premium services.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.050
So we can discriminate
and decide who gets what,

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.570
and on what time schedule.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.810
And we even would like to
control some of the data.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.710
It's going through our pipes.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.410
So it's going to be essential
that the internet companies

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.630
that have brought us
this social commons

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:18.585
make sure that we keep an
open network neutrality.

00:36:18.585 --> 00:36:21.040
Now let me say one more thing
that may step on a few toes

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.260
here.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.400
I love Google.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.200
I use Google every day.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.610
I don't know what I'd do
without Google as a research

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.000
tool for my office.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:31.930
I love Facebook.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:33.150
I love Twitter.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.130
I use Amazon.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:37.090
But we are now reaching
a point now where

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:41.230
these institutions which have
provided the social commons

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.300
are starting to look like
global public utilities,

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.760
social utilities.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.620
There's what, six
billion queries on Google

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:49.270
a day, I think?

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:52.400
And I think you're about--
I think you're around 67%

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.950
of the research engine market
in the US, and 90% in Europe.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:58.270
$50 billion in revenue,
you're doing well.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.370
And then you take
a look at Facebook,

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:02.460
one out of every six
people on the planet

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.620
almost is on Facebook.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.890
That's amazing.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.030
And Twitter, you have
640 million people.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.050
And on Amazon, one out
of every three purchases

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:12.490
start on Amazon, including mine.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:15.360
So we love these internet
companies, because they've

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.102
allowed us to create,
and began to facilitate

00:37:19.102 --> 00:37:20.620
a collaborative commons.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.400
But we're going to have to
find some way as you mature

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.330
as global institutions
that there's

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.330
the appropriate regulations
both internally and externally

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:33.800
to make sure that we facilitate
open, transparent sharing

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.050
on this collaborative commons.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.716
And that's the responsibility of
a younger generation and Google

00:37:37.716 --> 00:37:38.900
to make that happen.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.570
Then we can have the
best of the new world.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.930
Last thought.

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:46.550
I think is going
to be a rough road.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.342
I have to tell you that
the real wild card here

00:37:49.342 --> 00:37:51.940
s climate change
and cyber terrorism.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:55.470
The latter is more
addressable than the former.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.660
We can get to
nearly free energy.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.840
We're already there, nearly
free goods and services.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.600
But without food and
water, we don't survive.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.440
What's terrifying about
climate change is it changes

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.040
the water cycle of the earth.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.194
That's what this is all about.

00:38:11.194 --> 00:38:12.610
It's not well-known
in the public,

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.940
but for every 1 degree that
the temperature goes up

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.640
on the planet from
climate change

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.460
from industrial
activity, the atmosphere

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.680
is absorbing 7% more
precipitation from the ground.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.340
The heat sucks up
that precipitation

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:30.410
so you get more dramatic and
concentrated precipitation,

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:34.520
and more violent water events,
more violent winter snows,

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.730
more violent spring flooding,
more prolonged summer droughts,

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:41.770
more category 3, 4, and
5 hurricanes, tsunamis,

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:42.650
and typhoons.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:43.680
Sound familiar?

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.100
And here in California, drought,
the breadbasket of the world.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.310
And we don't know if we can even
feed people and provide water

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:51.130
for people.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:52.900
How do we repopulate
millions of people

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.620
in the western part
of the US in 30 years?

00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:01.220
So climate change is the
elephant in the room.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.870
What's important
to acknowledge here

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:05.900
is that the Third Industrial
Revolution, this internet

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:10.460
of things, allows us to move
quickly out of fossil fuels

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.820
and have millions of people
begin to produce and share

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.690
their own green energy.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:18.270
And this internet of things,
because its entire purpose

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:21.460
is to increase efficiencies,
to reduce marginal costs,

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.590
it means it shows us how to use
less resources more effectively

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:31.215
so we don't put a big burden
on the planet that we live in.

00:39:31.215 --> 00:39:33.840
So we have young people here not
only sharing information goods

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.080
and energy now, and
3D printed products.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.722
We've got young
people sharing cars.

00:39:37.722 --> 00:39:39.430
The front page of the
San Francisco paper

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.280
today is providing
parking spaces

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.900
for car sharing services.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.490
Young people don't
want to own a car.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.520
They just want to have
access to mobility.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.070
And for every car you share,
we take 10 cars off the road.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.210
And when we move to
electric vehicles shared,

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.790
we move to clean energy.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.320
And we have young
people now sharing

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.320
their homes and apartments.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.028
The big issue in San
Francisco this week?

00:39:59.028 --> 00:40:00.850
Airbnb.

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:03.940
And Airbnb's success is
near zero marginal cost.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.160
They have the web up.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.960
That doesn't cost them
anything after they put it up.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.455
And how much does
it cost somewhere

00:40:09.455 --> 00:40:10.840
who owns an apartment or a home?

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.410
They've already covered
their fixed cost.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.700
They're paying their mortgage.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.400
The marginal cost in renting
out the room is near zero.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.150
How do the hotel chains
compete with that?

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.140
They have to put
together a physical room.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.140
That costs money.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.410
But so we have car
sharing and bike sharing.

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:27.540
And now we're sharing apartments
and homes and clothes and tools

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.504
and toys.

00:40:28.504 --> 00:40:30.170
So we have a generation
that's beginning

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.840
to believe it's not
about ownership.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.320
It's access.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.690
And if more people
share what they have,

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:37.750
less has to be produced.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.540
It does have a
negative impact on GDP.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.320
But it has a positive
impact on quality of life,

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.720
and that's the way to
measure a good economy.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.150
Last thought.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.150
It isn't just about technology.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:52.995
Google is a tremendous
place to be.

00:40:52.995 --> 00:40:55.420
You've provided a
lot of technology

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.730
that's really helped us
create a better world.

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.900
It isn't just technology.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.550
We need to change
the human narrative.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:05.450
We need a new story
for the human race

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:09.060
to go with the technology
coming out of technology places

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.000
like Google.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.820
We have to move from geopolitics
to biosphere consciousness

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:17.550
in one generation, or
we're not going to make it.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:19.440
I'm telling you, I'm almost 70.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.340
Some of you in your
20s and 30s, I really

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.540
shudder at the possible world
we are creating with climate

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:29.360
change, unless we reverse
this quickly, really quickly.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.000
What is the biosphere?

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.170
That's the sheath from the
stratosphere to the ocean

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:36.557
depths, where-- 40 miles--
where all life interacts

00:41:36.557 --> 00:41:38.390
with the chemicals of
the planet to maintain

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.010
this Earth and life on it.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:42.720
I'm guardedly
hopeful, because we

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.370
have young 15-year-olds
coming home from school,

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:48.326
and they actually have biosphere
consciousness, a new thing.

00:41:48.326 --> 00:41:49.700
They're asking
their parents, why

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.430
do you use so much water
when you're in the bathroom?

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:53.730
Why do you have the TV on?

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.840
We don't use it.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.820
Why two cars?

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.026
Why not car share?

00:41:57.026 --> 00:41:58.400
And here's the
one I particularly

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.150
like-- why is that
hamburger on my plate?

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:02.960
A lot of 14-year-old
kids aren't eating.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.039
They're on strike.

00:42:04.039 --> 00:42:06.080
Did the hamburger come
from a tropical rainforest

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.485
in Central America?

00:42:07.485 --> 00:42:09.470
Did they have to
destroy the tree canopy

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.220
for four inches of
topsoil for my burger?

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.430
And the kids are smart enough
to know that those trees are

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.610
the habitats for rare
species that go extinct

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.820
when the tree canopy
is knocked out.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.410
And the kids also understand
when the trees are knocked out

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:25.730
to graze the cow for the
burger, the trees are no longer

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:29.350
absorbing CO2 from
industrial climate change.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.110
So the temperature of
the planet goes up,

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:33.200
and some farmer, she
can't feed her kids

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.710
because she has floods
and droughts on her land.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:38.050
They're learning
ecological footprint.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:39.230
It's a metric.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.190
They're learning that
everything we do intimately

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:45.490
impacts some other human,
some other ecosystem,

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:48.050
some other species
on this Earth.

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:49.700
So I'm guardedly hopeful.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.150
We've got a young
generation here

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.733
that's beginning to
see we live in one

00:42:52.733 --> 00:42:55.690
indivisible community,
the biosphere.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.200
And if we can
facilitate the process

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.690
where the Googles of this
world can help connect us

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:04.350
in a neural network so that
we can dramatically increase

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.170
efficiencies, reduce
our marginal cost,

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:10.930
and that means using less
resources more effectively

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:13.410
and taking a less
burden on the planet,

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:17.220
we may get to a better
world by mid-century.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.026
I don't know if we will.

00:43:19.026 --> 00:43:21.720
You will be the
judges on your watch.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.320
So it's essential that Google,
and the other companies

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.310
like Google, you need
to help lead this

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.770
so we have a chance of
rehealing the planet

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:31.490
and creating a future
for our children.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:32.400
Thank you.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.939
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:36.939 --> 00:43:39.949
You want to do a few questions?

00:43:39.949 --> 00:43:41.240
AUDIENCE: I'm not an economist.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.840
But I thought I had
a good understanding

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.540
of what zero
marginal cost meant.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:46.160
JEREMY RIFKIN: Near
zero, it's near zero.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.060
AUDIENCE: Near zero.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:51.490
But at least-- so I have
two questions on this.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:54.210
With regards to energy, you
kept talking about solar.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.230
I have solar on my house.

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:57.750
It's not zero marginal cost.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:01.420
I cannot produce more energy
that I want without putting

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.270
on more panels,
which has a cost.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.300
But it's zero in
the sense of I'm

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.850
not consuming things--
like with coal, right?

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:11.090
So I wasn't sure which
of those two distinctions

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.460
you were talking about, and how
you get to zero in that regard.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.720
And then I didn't understand
it at all in logistics,

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.220
because as far as I know, you
still have to drive miles.

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.942
And that cost isn't
really changing.

00:44:20.942 --> 00:44:22.900
JEREMY RIFKIN: Let's talk
about the solar panel

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.830
or the wind turbine or
the geothermal heat pump.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.690
You have to pay the fixed cost
of the harvesting technology.

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:31.023
It probably is going to take
you somewhere between three

00:44:31.023 --> 00:44:33.190
and nine years to pay
back on the solar panels.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:36.820
But the moment that channel's
up, you keep it clean,

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:37.760
the sun is free.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.810
Coal is not free.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:40.600
Natural gas, shale gas, uranium?

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.950
None of that's free.

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:42.980
But the sun is free.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:43.814
You just capture it.

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:44.521
The wind is free.

00:44:44.521 --> 00:44:45.220
You capture it.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.510
The geothermal heat's free.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.710
You capture it.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.280
So in that sense,
it's near zero.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.210
But you're only
advantaged if you're

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:55.630
in an energy internet that's
part of an internet of things.

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:57.370
Because you may
have a lull one day

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.920
where the sun isn't
shining, and you

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.650
haven't stored that
green electricity.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.370
Or maybe the wind's
blowing at night,

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:05.700
but you need electricity
during the day.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.040
So we have to create
an energy internet that

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.332
crosses continents.

00:45:09.332 --> 00:45:11.540
And that way, let's say in
Eastern Europe, where it's

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.040
night time, they
have a lot of wind?

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.880
The surplus goes up
on the energy internet

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.160
to the places which
are still daytime.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.740
Or if you have a lot of
sun somewhere in Europe,

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.570
in Western Europe,
during the day,

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:24.150
you put the surplus up on
the net and that energy,

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:27.340
and then it would take it
to another part of Europe.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.180
So these energies
are intermittent.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.630
And they change in
different times of day

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:33.540
in different parts
of a continent.

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.740
To the extent that we
have an energy internet,

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.470
we can share our surpluses
when other has lulls.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.085
And we can-- if we store
it correctly, hydrogen

00:45:41.085 --> 00:45:44.930
and other storage technologies--
we can deal with peak loads,

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:46.210
base loads across continents.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:48.800
That's we're attempting to
do in Germany and in Europe

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.850
right now.

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:52.830
And I was just in China.

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:54.620
That was a big surprise
to me with China,

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:57.387
because I didn't think they
were going to be players.

00:45:57.387 --> 00:45:59.470
"The Third Industrial
Revolution," my former book,

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:01.520
was published there
two years ago.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.280
And the new premiere
read it in English,

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.990
and instructed the
government to now

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:08.250
move on a distributed
energy internet

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:11.080
and to move toward an
internet of things.

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.370
I was there in September
with the leadership.

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:16.680
10 weeks later-- 10 weeks
later-- after my meetings

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.380
with government leadership,
the Chinese government

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:23.130
announced an $80 billion
four-year commitment

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.250
to move the distributed
energy internet across China

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.560
so everyone could
produce their own energy.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.140
By contrast, the US is going
to try to raise $3.5 billion

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:35.630
over 20 years for a
centralized smart grid.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.920
So I'm guardedly hopeful.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.140
But I think that these
are real challenges.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:43.010
And for you, the challenge
is your up-front cost.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.480
So you can pay them off, and
get to your marginal cost

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.230
being nearly free.

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:48.212
It's a challenge.

00:46:48.212 --> 00:46:49.670
AUDIENCE: What
about the logistics?

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:50.600
Can you explain that?

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.690
JEREMY RIFKIN: That's the newest
one, that's the newest one.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:54.065
And I deal with
that in the book.

00:46:54.065 --> 00:46:55.590
It's brand new, last 24 months.

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:57.364
We're dealing with
now, in Nord Calais,

00:46:57.364 --> 00:46:59.780
we're doing a master plan for
the oldest industrial region

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:00.580
of France.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:03.300
And they have Dunkirk,
a port facility.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.730
The logistics is the
most inefficient part

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:06.610
of the value chain.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:08.170
That's why it's costly.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:10.140
You have freight
across the country.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.190
When you see a truck, sometimes
it's only 20%, 30% full.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.610
Or it's dead and heading
back with no cargo.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:17.770
It's not systematized.

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:20.640
It's not efficient.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.180
What we're looking
at now is a transport

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.850
and logistics
automated internet.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:30.820
And this would allow you to
have everything modularized

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.950
so that you can move
shipments to any distribution

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:34.980
center you want.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:38.460
For example, there are 5,000
warehouse is in the US.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.430
So what?

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.440
If you're a big company,
vertically integrated,

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.080
you own maybe 20 of them.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.640
So you have to send your
stuff way out of the way,

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.330
hold it there, and then
take it to the destination.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.560
But what if all 5,000
warehouses, privately-owned,

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.440
came together in a cooperative?

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.310
So when they had space, it
would be open to anybody.

00:47:58.310 --> 00:47:59.220
You follow me?

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.560
Then with 5,000
distribution centers,

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.450
you could move to
whichever one you wanted,

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:07.540
and save a huge amount
of your transport time

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.900
moving it through the
system with GPS guidance.

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.387
But you'd have to have all
the containers modularized.

00:48:12.387 --> 00:48:14.470
Everything would have to
be on the same standards,

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:16.870
so you can move the package
across that internet

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:19.950
like you move all the packages
across the communication

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:20.900
internet.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:24.120
And then if you can move to
driverless vehicles and drones,

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.950
that's going to reduce your
labor costs substantially.

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:30.730
So you'll get toward
zero, but it'll still

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.050
be marginal cost, but
fairly low compared

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:34.490
to the cost we have now.

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:35.120
It's exciting.

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.350
We're just beginning this
discussion in the last 24

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:37.970
months.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:40.303
We're laying down the first
plan in northern France now.

00:48:40.303 --> 00:48:42.879
So we're on a learning curve.

00:48:42.879 --> 00:48:43.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.140
I have two
interrelated questions.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.310
One is, you're
mentioning Europe,

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:50.160
United States, and China.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.060
How about other countries, maybe
in the developing or emerging

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:57.770
nations, either because of
the access to technology,

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:00.370
or because their
economical situation?

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:01.860
And the second
question would be,

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:06.590
how about the disparity between
any given society between those

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:09.600
that have a lot and those that
have little in the present?

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.565
Is it going to be different
in the next economic system

00:49:12.565 --> 00:49:13.315
that you envision?

00:49:16.572 --> 00:49:18.280
JEREMY RIFKIN: In the
business community,

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.054
we did not see cell phones
coming to sub-Saharan Africa

00:49:22.054 --> 00:49:22.720
and rural India.

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.219
We didn't.

00:49:23.219 --> 00:49:24.910
It was never in the equation.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:28.090
All of a sudden, without any
marketing, millions of people

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:29.370
starting getting cell phones.

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:31.260
Then the cell towers came.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:36.200
And what we realized there was
the liability in the developing

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.570
world is actually their asset.

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:40.500
They have no infrastructure.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.260
It's easier and quicker
financially to build

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.832
from scratch then to mend
an old infrastructure.

00:49:45.832 --> 00:49:46.540
It's like a home.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.880
My wife and I have a
beautiful old home.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.900
We spent 24 years trying
to renovate this home.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:55.450
It's a big entropic
pit-- sorry, honey--

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:56.770
but it's an entropic pit.

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:59.030
Had we built a new
house from scratch

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:00.820
in six months, much cheaper.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:03.407
So the United
Nations has embraced

00:50:03.407 --> 00:50:05.240
the five-pillar, Third
Industrial Revolution

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.090
plan we've laid out toward
this internet of things.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:08.970
Why?

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:11.380
They think the developing
world can move quicker.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:14.200
Now in rural India, in the
last 24 months, and now

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.270
sub-Saharan Africa, young people
your age, startup companies,

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.570
are all over the map
in the rural areas.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.560
And they're setting
up little micro grids.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.550
$2,000 for a village,
you wire up the huts.

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.170
You put solar panels on.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:27.025
You lease the panel.

00:50:27.025 --> 00:50:29.010
When it's paid back, it's yours.

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:34.000
And a village, a small village
of several hundred? $2,000.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.070
So you can set up micro grids,
and it works like Wi-Fi.

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:40.294
You start connecting these
small players together,

00:50:40.294 --> 00:50:41.960
and all of a sudden,
you have a network.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.740
Just like a Wi-Fi network, you
have a near zero marginal cost

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.760
energy micro grid network,
and you create from the bottom

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.786
out, not from the top down.

00:50:50.786 --> 00:50:51.910
That's beginning to happen.

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:53.250
It's pretty encouraging.

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:57.380
As to the haves and
have nots, let me say,

00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.540
I taught the advanced
management program

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:04.150
at Wharton for 16 years, our
CEO program, nearly 16 years.

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:06.900
We all believed-- in the
First and Second Industrial

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:10.360
Revolution, we had to
vertically integrate

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:13.230
our business activity.

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:16.040
Every society needs
three things in order

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.740
to organize itself
as a society--

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.300
a form of communication,
a form of power,

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.350
and a form of mobility.

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:24.570
When communication comes
together with energy,

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:25.730
they create new systems.

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:28.160
For example, the 19th
century, the communication,

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.960
we went to steam-powered
printing-- cheap,

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.090
efficient, mass-produced
printing-- and the telegraph.

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:36.394
That allowed us to manage
a complex coal power

00:51:36.394 --> 00:51:37.310
industrial revolution.

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:38.680
That was the power source.

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.510
And then we introduced the
locomotive for the mobility

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:44.020
so we could bring dense urban
areas together and create

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.320
national markets.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.230
20th century, Second
Industrial Revolution,

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:49.480
the form of communication
was centralized electricity,

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.770
the telephone, then
radio and television,

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:57.600
to organize a power
source-- oil--

00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:02.210
and a new mobility factor called
the internal combustion engine.

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:04.570
The Third Industrial
Revolution, the communication

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:07.390
is the internet and
the internet of things.

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.170
The power source is
the energy internet

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:11.710
and renewables that are
distributed energies.

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:15.410
And the mobility is an
automated, driverless transport

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:18.760
and logistics system
in one platform.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.840
So I think the trend
lines are there.

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.950
But what it allows
us to do now is

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:25.670
eliminate vertically-integrated
global companies

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:29.000
where-- they were essentially in
the First and Second Industrial

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.111
Revolution, because they
reduced marginal cost.

00:52:31.111 --> 00:52:32.610
They eliminated a
lot of middle men.

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:34.270
You put everything
under one roof.

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:37.190
But now the internet of things
allows millions of people

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:40.880
to even bypass those types
of vertical organizations,

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.730
scale laterally, eliminate
all the middle men,

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.270
and you directly
engage each other.

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:46.810
That's what the
internet's about.

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:49.670
Millions of people go up there
in lateral economies of scale.

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:52.605
They are bypassing-- thanks to
Google and all these others--

00:52:52.605 --> 00:52:54.520
they're bypassing
all the middlemen

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.160
with information goods.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.660
Now they're going to be able,
with these lateral economies

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.680
of scale, to also
move to the world--

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:05.490
the physical world-- energy
and 3D printed products.

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:08.120
And so I should say, things
like CouchSurfing and Airbnb

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.050
are just the beginning
of this shift.

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:13.650
But what it does is it
democratizes the economy.

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.730
And hopefully, you'll
be in a world in 2050

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:18.620
that won't be the 1% or the 99%.

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:21.780
It'll be a shared economy,
a sustainable good quality

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.940
of life, where no
one's left behind.

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.050
Now, is it Utopia?

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:25.550
No.

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:27.990
Will we actually get
everything I'm laying out?

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.950
Doubtful.

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:31.870
But if we can at least see
this as a possible narrative,

00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:34.530
it's a pretty good journey
to be on even if we only

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.020
get half of it done.

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:39.230
And it's a lot better
journey than we're on now,

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:42.530
where we have a Second
Industrial Revolution that's

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:45.350
bringing us mass unemployment,
a greater disparity

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:47.750
between rich and poor, and
climate change threatening

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:48.910
our survival.

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:53.270
So I think this new journey
is a positive journey.

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:56.420
It's going to be fraught
with problems and challenges.

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.860
But it's worthy
of your generation

00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.651
to help reheal the
planet and create a more

00:53:59.651 --> 00:54:03.330
just world for all
of us, hopefully.

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.560
AUDIENCE: So I had
a question again

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.969
about zero marginal cost--

00:54:06.969 --> 00:54:08.010
JEREMY RIFKIN: Near zero.

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:09.620
AUDIENCE: Or new zero.

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:12.557
I work in manufacturing, and
we use 3D printing quite a bit.

00:54:12.557 --> 00:54:14.390
But the thing that we
like about 3D printing

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:16.750
is that it's a very low
fixed cost in exchange

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:20.260
for a much higher marginal cost.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:23.000
So marginal cost for
current manufacturing

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.010
is already very, very
low-- much, much lower

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:27.780
than 3D printing will ever get.

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.740
So I guess maybe
I'm misunderstanding

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:34.457
what you mean by the near zero
marginal cost on manufacturing?

00:54:34.457 --> 00:54:36.290
JEREMY RIFKIN: My
understanding-- of course,

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:37.450
the printers are pretty cheap.

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:38.600
But they're not
very sophisticated.

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.190
You can get a printer
now for $1,200.

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:42.010
The big, sophisticated
printers cost more.

00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:42.718
But you're right.

00:54:42.718 --> 00:54:45.260
It's an exponential curve.

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.552
The fixed costs are going to
really go down, especially

00:54:47.552 --> 00:54:49.051
because it's added
at manufacturing.

00:54:49.051 --> 00:54:50.852
AUDIENCE: They're
already much, much lower.

00:54:50.852 --> 00:54:52.122
JEREMY RIFKIN: Yeah.

00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:53.580
AUDIENCE: And this
is in a typical,

00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.670
like a traditional
manufacturing line.

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:57.670
JEREMY RIFKIN: What
brings the marginal cost

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.260
down is its additive
manufacturing.

00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:02.320
I always taught
subtractive manufacturing

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:06.120
would, in centralized first and
second Industrial Revolution

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:09.200
factories, you take a big hunk
of a material from nature,

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:12.496
cut it up, tear it down,
winnow it, and then put

00:55:12.496 --> 00:55:13.370
the product together.

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:14.740
And you throw a lot out.

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:15.700
All right?

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:19.140
As you know, with 3D printing,
the software is directing

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.110
the molten material
to, layer by layer,

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:24.080
build up a three dimensional
product with moving parts.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.430
It's additive manufacturing.

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:28.180
It uses, what, 1/10
of the material?

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:31.800
With additive manufacturing, you
are using a lot less materials.

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.820
But you're talking about
the materials themselves.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:36.430
What I'm saying
is that what I've

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.160
been seeing in the
industry-- in Europe,

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:41.160
at least-- is they're using
a lot of recycled plastic

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.140
now, which is very low cost.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.772
And they're now
using, as you know,

00:55:45.772 --> 00:55:47.330
in the Scandinavian
countries they're

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:51.210
using recycled paper,
which is low marginal cost.

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:54.050
And we now have some printers
that are using gravel, rocks,

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.220
and sand for various
things, which

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:57.816
is just locally available.

00:55:57.816 --> 00:55:59.190
I think it's going
to be a while.

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:02.170
This is so new-- and you're at
the cutting edge of it here--

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:07.210
it's going to be a while before
3D planning is on center stage.

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:09.570
But at least the kind
of work you're doing,

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:11.570
I'm sure you feel very
positive that it's

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:13.840
going to lead to a new kind
of manufacturing that's

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:17.026
going to reduce both fixed and
marginal cost down the line.

00:56:17.026 --> 00:56:18.150
It's going to take a while.

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:20.470
Otherwise, why do it?

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:23.140
I'm hopeful that
here at Google, help

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.714
lead us into this new world.

00:56:25.714 --> 00:56:27.380
We need to join
together, all the people

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.800
on the planet, with
this new technology,

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.730
and hopefully create some hope.

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:35.310
Because I see a lot of
despair, a lot of cynicism,

00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:37.120
a sense that nothing can happen.

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.240
But we're right now on the cusp
of a great economic revolution,

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.770
this shift to the collaborate
comments and an internet

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:46.050
of things platform that allow
us to begin to produce and share

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:49.090
goods and services with
low or zero marginal cost,

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:51.450
and in a sustainable
way for the planet.

00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:53.520
It's the journey we
all ought to be on.

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.420
Thank you.

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:58.789
[APPLAUSE]
