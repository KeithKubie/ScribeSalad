1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,040
The general good experience. Yeah,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,680
and the justice system is obviously
that's a really interesting thing to talk

3
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:11,070
about and constitutional law is a
fascinating thing for people studying this

4
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:13,080
idea that we argue about
the second amendment,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,300
like let's let constitutional lawyers
that think discuss a lot of those things

6
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:21,060
and we should all understand
that and be curious about it.

7
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:25,530
But I would think our constitution is
also silly. Like let's remake everything.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,330
Like let's have that conversation was
so much better that we can do have a

9
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,600
serious conversation about what kind
of guns and bullets people can have.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,520
Not that they can have them
or that they can't have.

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,450
Like that's the conversation. That's
where we should be. Right now.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,320
Everything gets regulated. Everything.
There are trade offs and healthcare,

13
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:46,170
there are trade offs and everything,
but Americans now are so divided.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,810
They want everything that they want.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,960
That compromise is something that we
don't do as Americans much less in in

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,810
government. That's, that's preposterous.

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,100
That the Democrats that demand purity
or, or anybody that is doing that,

18
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:03,360
you don't agree with me, you're wrong.

19
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,410
Hold on. That's not not you're related.

20
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:08,900
You don't have any relationships with
people in your real life like that.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,980
Like my wife and I don't agree on
a lot of stuff, but I love her.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,160
I adore her. Well, it's what
we've talked about before.

23
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:19,700
They're on teams and you want your
team to win, so you state why?

24
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:22,820
Why do you want your team to win? It's a
natural thing with human beings, right?

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,360
I agree that what I'm
saying about the gun thing,

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,110
the most fucked up part about
the messiness of the gun
thing is that even if you

27
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:34,250
made guns illegal, even if you
said you can't have any bullets,

28
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,110
you'll all go to jail. There's so many
guns. You're not getting them all.

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,560
It's not possible. There's
more guns in there are people,

30
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:47,561
which means there's more than 300 and
what 30 million guns there are country

31
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:52,400
alone. Absolutely. The most
important point in the discussion.

32
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,240
That's a nutty number, man. You really
stop and think about that number.

33
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,400
You're like, what is that real?

34
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,550
But you don't really stop the behavior
by necessarily creating certain laws

35
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:06,180
about why someone might behave
a certain way and shoot people.

36
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:07,620
That's not going to necessarily change.

37
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:12,600
What you do is you do limit the access
to a certain types of weapons and rounds

38
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,530
of ammunition. Right?

39
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,040
Yeah. Well the real question is
why would someone do that? Right?

40
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,780
That's the number one
question. [inaudible] let's
say the hardest part truck,

41
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,310
but it's a harder question to answer.

42
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,850
The easier question to answer is
make them less accessible. Yes.

43
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:30,970
If you've got people who have
problems we can figure out or solve,

44
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,800
if you could make them less accessible,

45
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,570
the president or blame, like,
I don't mean to get political,

46
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:40,010
but like there's no data on the video
game argument that there's no data on it.

47
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:40,330
The on

48
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:40,811
that. Well,

49
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:44,050
the video game argument is interesting
because I've had soldiers bring it up to

50
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:46,570
me, including Dakota Meyer.
Yeah, I heard that conversation.

51
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,100
I'm willing to have it. I mean I don't,

52
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,160
I don't think it necessarily makes sense
that people would act out in a certain

53
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,810
way that's horrific because of video game.

54
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,110
But if they were already
inclined to violence,

55
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,010
begin with maybe the already had a
fucking short circuit and then they get

56
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:07,120
desensitized to violence in movies
and violence and video games.

57
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:11,050
Does that have an impact on them? I'm
not the guy to answer that question.

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,180
[inaudible] has an impact
on, it's a variable.

59
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,940
It's a variable that I
think merits discussion.

60
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,290
I don't know if it's true or not.

61
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,410
I don't think it is because I
don't think it merits discussion.

62
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,090
Well, let me make this
point and then you decide.

63
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:24,710
If you think of merits discussion. Okay.

64
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,370
The V violent video games are played at
far higher rates in Japan and they don't

65
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:34,190
have the gun violence. We
have. It's a good point.

66
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:35,390
They have a very different culture though.

67
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:38,420
The way they don't have access
to guns. That's true. That's it.

68
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,410
They don't also have a lot of,
they've had a few mass stabbings.

69
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,930
It's the access. I, dude, I've
shot guns. I shoot guns, I get the,

70
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,000
I, I have nothing but respect for hunters.
I grew up in a hunting community. Uh,

71
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,610
but I mean, I, I don't know.

72
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:59,690
I don't think that there's much
past the conversation about access,

73
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,580
accessibility to guns that can fire that
many rounds that quickly killing that

74
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:07,820
many people. I don't think we have to
get rid of those somehow. But I agree.

75
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,870
How do you do it? Your, that's the most
important point. There's already 330.

76
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:14,630
There's more guns than there are people.
So what do you do? So by the way,

77
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,330
I think you buy as many
as you can back for sure.

78
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:20,420
You spend a whole bunch of taxpayer
money just help. By the way,

79
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,570
there's a ton of people in a bind
right now that have a rifle of like,

80
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,180
Oh my God, I'm not gonna be able to
afford my insulin. Let me get rid of this.

81
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,960
Uh, AK 47 to live another
month. You buy some guns back.

82
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:33,350
It's a good expenditure of money and
then melt them down and turn them into

83
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:35,240
furniture for a people.

84
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,110
So if you wanted to do that without
changing the second amendment,

85
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,180
like you just have a,

86
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:45,090
a buyback where you just offer people
the opportunity to make some money by

87
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,260
giving their guns up.

88
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,070
Well,

89
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:52,070
the second amendment is been interpreted
wrong by the Supreme court in my

90
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:52,441
opinion.

91
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:56,340
I mean it doesn't say that people should
have until 2008 it didn't say that.

92
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:59,070
Nobody thought that that people should
have a personal right to guns till the

93
00:04:59,071 --> 00:04:59,904
Heller case.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,210
But so I don't think you even need
to talk about the second amendment.

95
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:07,200
I think just people just need to agree
that these guns shouldn't be sold at the

96
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:09,660
ammunition to talk about the
second amendment. I mean it's,

97
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,900
it's a big conversation as people
can have guns, you can have guns.

98
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,020
The brick has a right to have guns.
You just can't have these guns anymore.

99
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,230
No more of those ones. You can have all
these guns, no restrictions anywhere.

100
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,320
Right. And they work city. You can't
have a handgun. Yeah, they work.

101
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,850
You can't even, I don't
think you can have a, a,

102
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:28,620
you can have a switch plate in New
York city. Yeah. Cyrus Vance, the da.

103
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:33,360
There is like terrified that they're
changing the federal government's changing

104
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,420
the law because he knows that those
gun laws in New York work really well.

105
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,710
And by the way, people always
make the argument, well,

106
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:42,570
they have those gun laws in Chicago
and there's a ton of violence.

107
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,910
That's because Chicago's on the
board of Indiana, doesn't have them.

108
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,470
Guns go across the border just
fine. That's the gun laws work.

109
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,610
They work well. Chicago is also in the
middle of of bitter drug war. Well, yeah.

110
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,560
I mean that's where the finals
is coming from, but we should,

111
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:58,160
people should have less
accessibility to those

112
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,880
types of guns, like every other
civil society in the world. Come on,

113
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,250
this is like, but it goes back to
what you were talking about before,

114
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:08,060
like the drugs, if they were legal, you
wouldn't have that sort of a drug war.

115
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:08,961
Right? For sure.

116
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:12,320
It's the root of most of the violence
in the inner cities and in obviously in

117
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:16,610
Mexico. Yeah, it's the, it's black
markets. It's the illicit drug. Yeah.

118
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,140
They're making tons of money on that.

119
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,380
What is the second amendment
exactly as it's written? Can you,

120
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,810
the right to bear arms
shall not be infringed.

121
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,000
So how do you think that the
Supreme court misinterpreted that?

122
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,160
That in the in the 2008 Alec
case, everybody should just a,

123
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:38,060
I would plug the work of Eric
Siegel who is well regulated,

124
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:42,380
militia being necessary to the security
of a free state comma right of the

125
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:46,670
people to keep and bear arms
shall not be infringed. Yeah.

126
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:48,350
Those commons get argued by,

127
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,180
I know constitutional scholars for a
date that the Supreme court didn't decide

128
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:58,181
until 2008 that Americans had a
right to have their own weapon.

129
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,270
That's such a crazy statement
like when you read it,

130
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:07,190
it's so interesting because you were going
back in time trying to figure out how

131
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:12,191
people in 1776 thought about guns and
whether or not that applies to us because

132
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:15,830
if it doesn't apply to us we
have to think about 1789 we,

133
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:20,120
if it doesn't apply to us, we have to
think, well then who gets to decide?

134
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,840
Like one of the reasons you get to decide
as a society on on any of one of the

135
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,520
reasons why it's so
interesting. I want to believe.

136
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,780
One of the reasons why it's so interesting
to read these things is like we have,

137
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,920
for whatever reason,

138
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:34,710
when things get written written
into stone or carved into a,

139
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,750
a stone or written onto a
document, like the first amendment,

140
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,860
like the freedom of expression,
we that is that we, we have it.

141
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,300
So we all agree on it. We don't want
to change it. Yeah. Freedom of speech,

142
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,890
freedom of expression, whatever we
want to, we want to hold on to that.

143
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:55,220
We want to keep sure I, this is
our humans, the second amendment,

144
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,670
the right to have a gun. That's our
law. We got it written down. Look, look,

145
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,910
look. It's written there. So they'll
study these ancient words like scrolls,

146
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,630
like to go over these scrolls and look
at the commas and look at the words shall

147
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,530
not be infringed upon. What did they
mean? That's fascinating. It is.

148
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,080
It is fascinating. But I think
that they didn't mean this.

149
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,130
I think that how could they, they did
not know what this is. They didn't,

150
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,820
and the the, the whole gun thing is a
racket to make money. That's what that is.

151
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:23,060
It's, it's a way you
sell fear. Like are you,

152
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,140
I mean home invasion is
any family's worst fear,

153
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,510
but it doesn't happen very much.

154
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,590
Nor does kidnapping nor do all lot of
these crimes at all. My helicopter,

155
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,910
our generation of parents is helicopter
parents terrified of everything.

156
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:42,290
Not that's true. That's true. Letting
their kids go outside. You're right.

157
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,500
Come on thinking that your kid's going
to get kidnapped. You don't know anybody.

158
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,660
Okay. Who had their
kid kidnapped. You are,

159
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,320
but you're generalizing because
home invasions do happen sometimes,

160
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,830
but that's not how we shouldn't make
the laws, but we don't have to exist.

161
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:56,250
Like everybody's going to kidnap

162
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,260
your kid or everyone's going
to break into your home.

163
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,000
But I'm saying those kinds of
balance is that sometimes it's real.

164
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,020
That's why people want to be able to
have guns because sometimes someone can

165
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:10,350
break in your house and
people have defended their
house and their property with

166
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,200
guns. Sure. But it's, it's, is it a way,

167
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,940
is it a realistic threat or
is it something that the,

168
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,950
that the gun industry creates these
amazing ads and scares the shit out of

169
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:25,620
people? Oh, come on man.
It's crime is real. You know,

170
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,010
whether the crime is
real crime. Real, real.

171
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,980
I think the clear point is,

172
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:35,490
the reason why we have so many guns in
America is because there's so much money

173
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,200
to be made off of them.

174
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,650
I think we could absolutely limit them
and regulate them and have a thoughtful

175
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:42,690
conversation. I think that's
where most most people are at.

176
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,240
Although I hate that generalization.
There's something to that,

177
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,640
but there's also something to, the reason
why we have so many cars. People like,

178
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,170
I'll have that conversation. We should
get rid of all the cars. Okay, well,

179
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:56,040
I mean we're not looking me wrong.
Why should we get rid of all the cars?

180
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,560
Do not like freedom or do you
want, you have a better solution?

181
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,320
Are you going to, I don't have a
better solution, but if they're there,

182
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:04,410
there should to be one or I think that
we are killing ourselves with all the

183
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:07,680
cars. The pollution is okay, but you can
make them electric then. That's fine.

184
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,360
I think that would be fine if they were,

185
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,510
I have a Chevy volt since
2012 I have solar panels.

186
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,400
I'm trying to be the change
I want to see in the world.

187
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,680
If I'm coming off as a act, I'm a
complete hypocrite and all of it.

188
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,900
I eat meat and I do all kinds of things.

189
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:26,100
I think have a thoughtful conversation
about guns and why they're each part of

190
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,810
our culture and not another culture.

191
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,170
The way that other cultures and
countries regulate their weapons,

192
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,120
that the problems that they
have. Our problem shore,

193
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:34,920
we should talk about mental health,

194
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,960
but the problem with that conversation
that people don't want to have is

195
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:42,780
everything costs money. That's
why you have to pay taxes.

196
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,060
Paying taxes is the price of civilization.

197
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,490
What does that have to
do with mental health?

198
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,490
You have to pay for people
to help people, right?

199
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:54,240
You can't advocate in government,
Republican or Democrat for the,

200
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,680
this is what unfortunately Trump
and Republicans have advocated,

201
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,070
let's get mental health
solutions to the violence.

202
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:06,690
Let's do that and everybody's behind that
except they cut the Obamacare programs

203
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,660
at funded mental health.
It's just you can't do,

204
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:13,170
you have to spend the money providing
mental health. It is a problem.

205
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,540
It should be addressed, but it's not.

206
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,170
The main issue is definitely the
guns and the bullets in them. Well,

207
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:22,830
the main issue is the person
that's capable of shooting
people with the guns and

208
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:25,890
the bullets know it's the guns and
the guns and the bullets are inanimate

209
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:28,860
objects. Without a person pulling the
trigger. We're talking nonsense here.

210
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,510
They're not going to
just shoot themselves.

211
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,900
The main problem is the main problem
is someone willing to grab the gun and

212
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:38,460
shoot people. Right. We agreed.

213
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,830
We both agree there's
problems with having no idea,

214
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,860
but don't you think the main problem
is the person who actually shoots me?

215
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,140
I think that in every
other country in the world,

216
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:47,940
they don't have this problem
because they don't have the gun.

217
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,000
That's my where I start and end on
the argument. Okay. Why? Why is that?

218
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,190
They might, they might.
That might be the case

219
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,810
that they don't have the guns,

220
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,290
but there are places that do have
guns and they don't have a lot of mass

221
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,900
shootings. Canada's one of them.
Right, because they don't know.

222
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,820
They don't have the type of guns we
have up there. Have a lot of guns.

223
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,650
They do, but they don't have AK
40 sevens with unlimited rounds.

224
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:12,210
They don't have that. That's
crazy. If you have more guns,

225
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:13,260
they're awesome. I get it.

226
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:13,920
Okay.

227
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,610
Do you think that more or less limitations
to what firearms are allowed to have?

228
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,480
I believe they Canada.

229
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,810
I believe that Canada, Canadian gun
laws are far stronger, more regulated,

230
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,850
tried. They don't have
something. Some, some really,

231
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:31,110
recently Trudeau announced something
that was going to severely limit,

232
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,340
this is very recent, severely limit
the type of firearms you could have,

233
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,610
including things that can have multiple
rounds and chambers and certain types of

234
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,320
guns that are used right
now as hunting rifles.

235
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:47,040
Since there was a big push back about
that. Let's just read. There's always,

236
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,330
there's always going to find that

237
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,900
the conversation about like,
like the the freedom, like the,

238
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,180
the second amendment to me is it's
just your interpretation. Fine.

239
00:12:57,181 --> 00:12:59,430
Whatever your interpretation is is
fine. That's what's interesting.

240
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,090
There's a human insight. It's a
healthcare issue and they and they the,

241
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,400
it's so extreme. It's really,

242
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,880
if you want to know the
answer to healthcare is you
should talk to public health

243
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:11,370
experts. They have those
answers. They have the research,

244
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:13,860
but we'll hold on what
research on what? Well,

245
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:14,910
they don't have enough research on.

246
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,890
They don't have enough research
on gun violence. Unfortunately.

247
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm talking about if you want to know
the solutions for what is impacting and

248
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:24,120
creating a death by any measure.
Accidental death. Right,

249
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,760
but we're talking about
gun violence, right?

250
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,290
Healthcare professionals have
the solutions to gun violence.

251
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,630
I think a lot of healthcare
solutions, I think,

252
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,690
I think certainly surgeons have argued
for why certain ammunition has destroying

253
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:39,630
the inside of the body and unsurvivable.

254
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,760
I think public health
officials have argued,

255
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,200
certainly pediatricians all argued this
idea that you can't ask a parent if they

256
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:50,730
have a gun in the house because the
gun lobby is against that cause they're

257
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:53,370
building this conspiracy that the
government is going to track your gun.

258
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,280
That's terrible. Your pediatrician
has to ask you, do you have a pool?

259
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,910
Where do you keep the poison? Where are
the guns? Cause God forbid you don't,

260
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:02,400
you're not responsible enough or educated
enough to know that that kid might

261
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:04,260
accidentally get that gun.
And it happens all the time.

262
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,120
There's a rule against that. Yeah.

263
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:10,440
Public health officials and doctors and
physicians are pretty much on the same

264
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:14,910
case with this issue, these guns and
mental health. I think experts too,

265
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:17,550
I don't know, maybe there's a
large disagreement and if there is,

266
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:20,370
I'm happy to be wrong about this
or any dumb shit. I've said,

267
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,321
well,

268
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:26,240
what you're saying is that these public
health officials would be able to make

269
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:30,290
these guns less lethal by banning
certain types of ammunition because it's

270
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:34,670
destroying people and checking
to see if the parents uh,

271
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,150
know if they have a gun or where
the gun is or how it's treated,

272
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:41,010
how it's locked up like that
they should, I mean, how,

273
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,770
how do you feel like public officials,

274
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,850
public health officials could
have any impact on that? Well,

275
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,010
public health experts are, you know,

276
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:51,560
their entire sponsor ability to keep
people safe from sickness and death.

277
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,820
Look, if you have any bullets
at all, they're lethal, right?

278
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,010
So do you want to have
bullets that are less lethal?

279
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,340
I think that could be a law for
sure. Why not us lethal? Yeah.

280
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:02,750
Take two human bodies. Yeah.

281
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,540
We shouldn't be killing each other
with bullets all the time. A bullet,

282
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,420
I'll stop anybody a
blunt or whatever it is.

283
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:12,020
I don't understand the arguments about
ammunition, but the point about Poe,

284
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,210
but you brought it up. That's
why I brought it up. Fine.

285
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Public health experts will look at
what is creating sickness and death car

286
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:21,524
accidents.

287
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,160
What I'm saying to you is that I think
it's disingenuous to say that public

288
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:28,310
health officials have an answer to why
we're having so much mass violence.

289
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,070
I don't think anybody has an
answer. I think we're terrified.

290
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,470
And I think we could say it's,
if they didn't have guns,

291
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,170
he wouldn't be able to do it. And
you're right. And I can say if we,

292
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:39,540
these people weren't mentally
handicapped or filled with,

293
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,770
I shouldn't say handicapped melted
me mentally compromised, uh,

294
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,740
filled with all kinds of
demons, all sense of demons,

295
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,940
the different medications that are
fucking with their judgment, uh, abuse,

296
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,690
all sorts of, of they spirits and
childhood. There's a lot of factors. Sure.

297
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,290
No one,

298
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,290
no one has any idea why someone who is
abused and who's fucked up is capable of

299
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:04,010
making that leap. We have some
thoughts on it. That's all.

300
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:07,910
We have some thoughts on it and we talk
about it endlessly. And you're right,

301
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:10,250
if no one had a gun, there
would be no issue with that.

302
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,840
You wouldn't be able to mass shoot people.

303
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,080
But would we still have fucked up people
that are lashing out trying to hurt

304
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:19,550
people. I think we always will, but we
have mental health. We have to fund.

305
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:22,070
No one's already searched. Yeah. A
lot of people are, well, I'm not.

306
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,800
I think you should. I think we
should, not only should we comp

307
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,380
[inaudible] mental health, we,
it should be a top priority.

308
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,280
I think we should think about having
four hour work days being mandatory.

309
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,010
I think we should help
people. I think you, you know,

310
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:40,040
they just did an experiment
Microsoft did in Japan in fact,

311
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,510
and they found that a four hour or
a four day work week rather increase

312
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:47,570
productivity by 40% yeah. I think
a lot of people, I don't know,

313
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,050
maybe this is their culture or maybe
it was, this is a specific instance,

314
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,050
the type of people that would get a
job at Microsoft, but you know what?

315
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:59,840
What you're dealing with for most people
is beaten down shells that are tired of

316
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:02,330
high. All that together. Go
back to the gun argument.

317
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,660
Argue for the four hour work week in any
other type of benefits that civilized

318
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:07,880
nations around the world,
especially in Scandinavia,

319
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:12,080
have study in that culture is really
interesting and what they do and,

320
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,320
and you realize that there's any number
of things that you can do to help people

321
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,200
and how do you,

322
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:25,400
you have to be able to fund those
solutions and people don't want to do it,

323
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,170
right? People don't
want to pay more taxes,

324
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,780
but they also have a distrust in the
way the government spends their money.

325
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:32,990
So it becomes a catch 22 even if
they wanted things to be better,

326
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,940
they don't trust the government
to spend their money.

327
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:37,580
Like if you work hard and you make X
amount of dollars and the government

328
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,060
argument, but there's not a bet
necessarily a better way, fine,

329
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,260
I give you that argument,

330
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,990
but there we have to come
together as society and gray.

331
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,120
This is how we're going to spend
money on a fire department,

332
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:49,580
on schools and so on.
Well, no one's arguing

333
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:57,660
[inaudible].
