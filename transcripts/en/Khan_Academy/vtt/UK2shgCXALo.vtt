00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.150
If you were paying close
attention in the last video,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.750
an interesting question might
have popped up in your brain.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.890
We have talked about
the intervals over which

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.609
the function is
concave downwards.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.150
And then we talked
about the interval

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.820
over which the function
is concave upwards.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.740
But we see here that there's
a point at which we transition

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.000
from being concave downwards
to concave upwards.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.290
Before that point, the
slope was decreasing,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.850
and then the slope
starts increasing.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.060
The slope was
decreasing and then

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.617
the slope started increasing.

00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:32.950
So that's one way to look at it.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.741
Right here in our
function we go from being

00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:36.824
concave downwards
to concave upwards.

00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:38.740
When you look at our
derivative at that point,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.370
our derivative went from
decreasing to increasing.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.920
And when you look at our second
derivative at that point,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.160
it went from being
negative to positive.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.060
So this must have some type of
a special name you're probably

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.560
thinking.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.230
And you'd be thinking correctly.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.580
This point at which we
transition from being concave

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.590
downwards to concave upwards,
or the point at which

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.460
our derivative has
a extrema point,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.090
or the point at which our
second derivative switches signs

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.965
like this, we call it
an inflection point.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.040
And the most typical
way that people

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.660
think about how could you
test for an inflection point,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.360
it's a point, well,
conceptually, it's

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.350
where you go from being
a downward opening

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.670
u to an upward opening u.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.870
Or when you go
from being concave

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.070
downwards to concave upwards.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.720
But the easiest
test is it's a point

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.700
at which your second
derivative switches signs.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.930
So in this case, we went
from negative to positive.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.680
But we could have also
switched from being

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.810
positive to negative.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.270
So inflection point, your second
derivative f prime prime of x

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.310
switches signs.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.340
Goes from being
positive to negative

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.720
or negative to positive.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.260
Switches signs.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.510
So this is a case where we
went from concave downwards

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.250
to concave upwards.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.050
If we went from concave
upwards to concave downwards,

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.009
like that, then this inflection
point up until that point,

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.630
the slope was increasing.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.530
So the second derivative
would to be positive.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.740
And then the slope
is decreasing,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.646
so your second derivative
would be negative.

00:02:20.646 --> 00:02:22.020
So here your second
derivative is

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.211
going from positive to negative.

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:25.710
Here your second
derivative is going

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.020
from negative to positive.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.230
In either case, you are talking
about an inflection point.
