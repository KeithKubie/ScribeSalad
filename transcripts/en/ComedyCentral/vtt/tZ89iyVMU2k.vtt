00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:01.300
Andrew, what is
going on with the ...

00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.167
What's going on?

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:03.002
You're doing this thing
with your ...

00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:04.270
Oh, am I? Oh.

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:07.173
He does this anxiety thing and I
can't, it's giving me anxiety.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:08.741
I didn't even ... oh, it is?
What is this?

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:09.942
Okay. I just ...
What are you doing?

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:11.244
He does the thing
where it's like ...

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.012
I'm counting the money I guess?
I don't know.

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:15.381
You know when Italians go
"Mamma mia?"

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.050
For our listeners,
that's what he's doing,

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.185
just quietly in his lap.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:20.787
Oh, that would drive me nuts.
Kind of just ...

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.656
I can see it out of the corner
of my eye and it bugs me.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.792
And I know it's your anxiety,
I don't know what you're feeling

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.393
anxiety about right now,
can we talk about it?

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:28.628
Yeah.
I'm good, I'm good.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.997
I was just very quiet
for like a half an hour

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.132
so I just have to do
something with that energy.

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:34.434
No you don't, you really don't.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.835
You know?
I don't need any of this.

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.770
I have all that energy,
I gotta get it out.

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:39.439
So I put it in my thumbs
and my index finger.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.673
Let me just say ...

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:42.875
It's like you have Jewish
Tourette's and this is your tic.

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:44.811
Yeah, look at me, like Shylock.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.079
Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle.

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.413
Give me a pound of your flesh.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:48.614
Yeah, yeah. Shekels ...

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:49.416
Ew!

00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:53.352
Andrew does ...

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.655
I gave him an anxiety
blanket the other day

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.024
'cause Pete Lee gave me
for my birthday last year ...

00:00:58.057 --> 00:00:59.459
Did you wrap it
around his throat?

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.760
Yeah, yeah.
Not yet.

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.595
It's an anxiety blanket,
it's a noose?

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.530
It's cool, real comfortable.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:05.765
We've all seen these
on Instagram,

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:06.966
the really heavy blankets?

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:08.234
Oh yeah, yep.
They're so ...

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.469
It's so heavy, Nik.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.170
This thing weighs 50 pounds.

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:13.005
Wow.
I mean, it's so heavy.

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:14.740
It's like getting an X-ray,
it's like a lead blanket.

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:16.008
Exactly.
That's what it feels like.

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.677
You should do some hip thrusts
while it's on top of you.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.878
Yeah.
Oh, to practice fucking? Yeah?

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:20.246
Herd some cows,
I mean, I don't know. Ew.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:21.481
That actually would be ...

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:22.748
The thought of you fucking
makes me wanna vomit.

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:24.016
Thank you.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.185
No, it feels like a light
dead man is on top of you.

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:29.088
A dead man with like cancer
is laying on top of me.

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.290
I can't stand when Andrew talks
about pussy or fuck,

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:32.525
like you're ...

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:33.893
'Cause he's a doughy bitch.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:37.563
You haven't eaten in nine years,
shut up.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:40.566
Let's make this easier, what
do you like about Andrew, Nikki?

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.268
Oh, I'll tell you,
I'll tell you so many things.

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.903
Because this list of things
you don't like is just ...

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.138
That's a really
nice question, Shuli.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.973
It's like the Torah, we're
unfurling this fucking thing.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.475
Yeah, usually she just
breaks down all my negatives.

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:50.676
Okay, then let me build ...

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.311
What's in the pros?
What's in the pro list?

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:55.181
Okay, obviously like I don't
have people in my life

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:58.284
who are just only irritate me.
So he ...

00:01:58.317 --> 00:01:59.619
You're special.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.387
He brings a lot to my life.

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:03.356
Coffee ...

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.125
So far, by the way, she's been
talking for 40 seconds,

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:07.293
hasn't mentioned
one thing yet.

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:08.694
Kerryn, I'm gonna fuck you up.
Go ahead.

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:09.896
I'm gonna fuck you up, Kerryn.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.297
Let's fight, bitch.
I'll fight you right now,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.565
I will fuckin' whoop
that ass on camera.

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:13.766
I'll smoke you.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.101
I will throw you through
the fucking camera.

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:17.103
My goal is to destroy
this show form the inside

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.804
and then leave
and never return.

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:21.374
Okay. Here are great qualities
about Andrew.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.576
I have him around
because he does feel,

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:24.977
at times when
he's not anxious,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.679
he feels like
a support animal to me.

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:30.816
Like will be very ...
he will soothe me.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.852
Andrew, that was a compliment,
by the way. Heads up.

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:35.722
It is, it's a total compliment.
He feels like ...

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:38.724
'cause when I spike
in my anxiety,

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.126
that's when
he gets super chill.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.360
Oh, that's good.

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:44.197
And he will counteract
whatever I'm feeling.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.098
But when I'm too chill,
sometimes he gets anxious

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.366
and I can't have that.

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.468
Who needs that?
Like it doesn't ...

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:52.271
and it would be fine
if you were paying me,

00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:54.473
but I'm paying you.
So ...

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:55.775
Right, right.
Can I ask a question?

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:56.976
Yes.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.445
Are you gonna get a chip
put in him in case he gets lost?

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:00.813
You should.

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:03.249
She does put a little red cape
on me when we get on the plane.

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:04.550
Yeah, that is good.
Yeah, it's great.

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:05.818
"He's my support Andrew!"

00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:07.053
A little vest.

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.287
Yeah, yeah, a little vest.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.689
"Mind your business!"

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.224
She's gonna give me
to her mom soon.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:12.425
Oh, and also ...

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:15.561
Oh my God, that was mean.

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:20.233
Oh, just ... I would love
to give you to my mom.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.034
You just every once
in a while check in on me.

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:23.603
You would love that,
you would love my mom.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.438
You would like me more
if I was in St. Louis,

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:27.240
you would actually
like think about me more.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.975
You'd be like, "Oh, wow,
I actually did like Andrew."

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.243
I don't think about you at all

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:31.578
when you're not on
the road with me.

00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:33.379
Like I don't.

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.047
Sometimes I'm like,
"Oh, I wonder how he is,"

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.682
but I think
I'd be okay if we ...

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:38.884
I don't know, I don't think
you'd get by.

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:40.953
Honestly, you do bring a ton
to my life.

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:42.288
You're one of my best friends,

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:45.658
you're my road companion,
you are so funny.

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:48.594
No one's funnier than
Andrew Collin like on the fly.

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:52.098
You point a camera at him ...
when I post on stories,

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.966
if you're listening
and you watch my stories,

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.035
Andrew doesn't need
second takes.

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:57.336
He is always funny.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.439
I never have to erase a video,
when I put it on him,

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:03.175
he is 100% funny
all of the time.

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:06.212
He makes me laugh all of
the time when he keeps it light.

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:08.381
The other day he was like
kind of in his phone and I go,

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.816
"Yo, you need to be like,
stop being antisocial

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.885
like you need to be funny
around me right now

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:14.353
'cause I need
your energy of funniness."

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:15.588
So you bring ...

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:17.089
Also known as,
"Dance, monkey, dance."

00:04:17.122 --> 00:04:18.324
Exactly.
That's right.

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:19.592
Exactly.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:22.395
Yeah. And I actually danced,
I did. I actually did a ...

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:23.696
He literally got up and danced.

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.197
He was like,
"Oh, you want some of this?"

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.399
And I go, "Yes!"
Of course!

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.167
That is the mood
that I would like backstage.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.169
But sometimes you're
on your phone so much

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:32.338
that I don't know
when you want my dancing.

00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:33.539
I'll tell, I'll yell at you.

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:35.508
She's on her phone
getting you gigs probably.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:36.742
I'll yell at you ...

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:38.878
Kerryn ...

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.346
And I'll tell you.

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.348
Don't you dare ruin this for me.

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:44.817
There's a new show on VH1,
Love and Set Times.

00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:47.653
This is all I have, Kerryn.
You know that.

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:49.155
What have you got there,
an empty water?

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:50.423
Enough.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:53.626
And Andrew brings
great stories to my life,

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.194
I'm not out there
hooking up a ton.

00:04:55.227 --> 00:04:56.829
Like I thrive on his
like fun hook up stories,

00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:58.164
I think that's really fun.

00:04:58.197 --> 00:04:59.365
Yeah.

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:01.500
He's also so nice,
like he'll always build me up.

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:03.102
He thinks of good ideas
for my career,

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:06.072
he was the one to suggest to me
that I go do Tom

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:08.007
Segura's podcast,
Bert Kreischer's podcast,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.275
Theo Von's podcast,

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:12.178
which led me to have hundreds
of thousands of new followers.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.714
All because Andrew was like,
"Hey, you should probably try

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:17.116
maybe doing a podcast
while you're in ..."

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:18.417
Do you get a tax write off

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.618
because he has
a speech impediment,

00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:20.853
he's like a handicapped kid?

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:22.054
Kerryn, Kerryn ...

00:05:22.087 --> 00:05:23.255
What?

00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:24.623
I like that Andrew's at home
going,

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:26.625
"Nikki, go do a bunch of shit,
it'll help you."

00:05:26.658 --> 00:05:28.894
Yeah, I know.
"Get us new followers!"

00:05:28.927 --> 00:05:30.563
I don't wanna fuckin'
do it myself,

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:31.831
like no, they won't
answer my email.

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:33.966
"Nikki, get off, get your ass,
fly somewhere, do some stuff,

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.167
and then come back."

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.602
Yeah, come back
and give me money.

00:05:36.635 --> 00:05:39.705
Sometimes I will ask him
when we come back from the road,

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:41.140
he could just go back
home to Brooklyn

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:42.441
but instead he comes
to my place

00:05:42.474 --> 00:05:44.510
and he'll help me carry my bags
up four flights of stairs.

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:45.745
That's nice.

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.480
And then he'll spend the night
on my couch

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:48.781
and I honestly
want him to

00:05:48.814 --> 00:05:51.183
because I get scared after
watching the Ted Bundy tapes.

00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:52.485
Yeah.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.120
I don't like being
a single girl alone

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:55.821
so it's nice
to have like someone

00:05:55.854 --> 00:05:57.056
for Ted Bundy to murder ...

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:58.391
First, yes.

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:00.292
First, on the couch,
under an anxiety blanket.

00:06:00.325 --> 00:06:01.794
Little does she know ...
little, yeah, yeah.

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:03.896
I'm gonna move that last one
off the pros list

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:05.097
and put it on the cons.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.799
Ted Bundy will try
to like kill me ...

00:06:06.832 --> 00:06:08.067
That's a good point, Shuli.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.435
But like the blanket
will save me.

00:06:09.468 --> 00:06:10.736
No, Nikki's like sleep
in this wig.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:12.004
Yes, yeah.

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:15.040
But Andrew does me the favor
of staying the night,

00:06:15.073 --> 00:06:17.209
a lot of times it's sleeping
on the couch uncomfortably.

00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:19.478
Yeah, some would say that maybe
I'm doing him a favor

00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:21.714
by letting him crash
in Manhattan for the night,

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:24.217
but actually I like
when you're there.

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:26.986
And you know that
I need that, obviously.

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:29.155
And you know I won't murder you
'cause I'm too lazy.

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:31.457
Yes, you won't murder me,
you won't molest me,

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.394
you won't do anything weird.
He's just a really good friend

00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:37.997
and also you put up
with a ton of abuse

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.432
and I appreciate
that in a friend.

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:40.666
I don't see any of that.

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:41.901
I have never had that
in a friend.

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:43.202
This is how she is in front
of people,

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:44.470
she's different
behind close doors.

00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:45.671
Am I?
She's meaner?

00:06:45.704 --> 00:06:46.939
She's way nicer, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:06:46.972 --> 00:06:48.174
She's meaner.

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:49.942
No, I snapped at you
so hard the other day

00:06:49.975 --> 00:06:51.310
because he walked
into my hotel ...

00:06:51.343 --> 00:06:52.912
You snap in the morning
before you get your coffee,

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.113
that's like your big time,

00:06:54.146 --> 00:06:57.082
that's like your time
to like really shine.

00:06:57.115 --> 00:06:59.318
And I'm just like
I don't wanna be anywhere ...

00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:01.053
He showed up at my hotel
the other day

00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:02.655
to pick up my phone
which was broken

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.089
'cause he was gonna take it
to get repaired

00:07:04.122 --> 00:07:06.125
while I was going to do
Nick Viall's podcast.

00:07:06.158 --> 00:07:08.561
Nick Viall, by the way,
has a podcast, I'm on it.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:11.564
It's called Viall Files,
it drops today, check it out.

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.966
But I was going to record that,
my phone wasn't working.

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:15.734
I said, "Andrew, can you come
over and take my phone?"

00:07:15.767 --> 00:07:17.770
Ten minutes.
I was there 20 minutes later,

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:19.205
I was 15 minutes away.

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.507
I didn't shower.
I ran out, I got there ...

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.842
Yeah. He acts as my assistant

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.109
because I pay you
to do such things.

00:07:24.142 --> 00:07:25.311
Yeah, yeah, no,
I'm not complaining.

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:26.579
Right.

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:27.947
It might sound like complaining,
but I'm not.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.648
So he gets there,
he gets to my hotel room

00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:31.817
and I'm trying to like
figure out everything,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.118
get dressed, get ready.

00:07:33.151 --> 00:07:35.387
I'm kind of like rushing,
I'm not in a great mood.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.757
He's there and it was really
nice of you to zip over there

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.526
so quickly,
like that was awesome.

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:42.328
You were like such a hero
in that moment.

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:43.696
But then I turn around

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.097
and he's eating
one of my protein bars ...

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.365
Oh, mother fucker!

00:07:46.398 --> 00:07:47.566
Just mid bar.

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:51.637
First of all, there's 45 bars,
there's 45 bars!

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.606
Doesn't matter,
she wanted that one!

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.474
This is the thing,
this is the thing.

00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:57.610
Just because I have 45 bars
doesn't mean

00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:00.179
I didn't pay for those 45 bars.

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:02.581
Each one I paid for,
they aren't free.

00:08:02.614 --> 00:08:03.916
I ran, I skipped breakfast!

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:05.384
Just because there's
an abundance

00:08:05.417 --> 00:08:06.952
doesn't mean they're free.

00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:08.587
I skipped breakfast
to get to you.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.756
So I turn around, he's mid bar,
and I go,

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:12.358
"Ask first, ask first."

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:13.626
Yeah.

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.828
I go, "Did you ask?"
and he goes, "No."

00:08:17.262 --> 00:08:18.497
"Sorry."

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.299
Why do you have to give me
that voice?

00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:21.734
You know, I sound like I'm ...

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:23.536
I go, "Just ask."

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:27.273
And that was all, but again,
I was projecting.

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:28.841
Because oftentimes
when I have friends

00:08:28.874 --> 00:08:30.309
that have
an abundance of things ...

00:08:30.342 --> 00:08:31.877
But you've given me open range

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.479
to the protein bars
in many other settings.

00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:34.747
Yes.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.849
So then this setting,
where I thought I came in,

00:08:36.882 --> 00:08:39.184
I'm the hero, I deserve maybe
a little protein bar.

00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:40.786
You weren't wrong,
you weren't wrong,

00:08:40.819 --> 00:08:44.456
but it irritated me so much
to see you just gnawing

00:08:44.489 --> 00:08:46.091
on one of my protein bars ...

00:08:46.124 --> 00:08:47.927
Gnawing, just sucking it
with my mushy mouth, yeah.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.161
Yeah.

00:08:49.194 --> 00:08:50.696
Yeah, your mushy
like toothless mouth.

00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:52.197
You only chew in like the front
of your mouth too.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.499
He doesn't have teeth
in the back.

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:55.134
Yeah. You know how many teeth
I have, Kerryn.

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:56.402
Right, right, right.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:58.904
You're still not on solid food,
how'd you eat that protein bar?

00:08:58.937 --> 00:09:00.205
Either way,
it's all smoothie based.

00:09:00.238 --> 00:09:01.740
It's really, it's very ...

00:09:01.773 --> 00:09:03.275
I bring my own blender.

00:09:03.308 --> 00:09:05.377
She's like "You put the protein
bar in the blender again?

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.712
It's so loud
and it's the morning!"

00:09:06.745 --> 00:09:07.913
Can you tell you why this is ...

00:09:07.946 --> 00:09:11.050
He was sucking on this bar
and it was just like the way

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.985
he was like eating it,
it was just ...

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:15.788
These are all of the good
things about me.

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:17.256
Yeah, we're still
on the compliments section.

00:09:17.289 --> 00:09:18.991
I screamed at him, I just go ...
I didn't even scream at you,

00:09:19.024 --> 00:09:21.026
I go, "Ask first,
just ask next time,"

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:23.829
and then that got us started
on a bad foot for that day

00:09:23.862 --> 00:09:26.632
and I take full credit.
Because I was only projecting

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:28.467
because I've been someone
who takes things

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.136
without asking from
my rich friends, Amy Schumer.

00:09:31.169 --> 00:09:32.972
Like I'll just go
into her kitchen

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:34.273
and grab whatever the fuck
I want

00:09:34.306 --> 00:09:35.975
because I'm like,
"She won't notice."

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:37.409
It's almost bothersome
to be like,

00:09:37.442 --> 00:09:38.644
"Hey, can I have these chips?"

00:09:38.677 --> 00:09:39.912
When she's like "Yeah,
you can have ..."

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:41.413
like I don't give a fuck, have
chips, you know what I mean?

00:09:41.446 --> 00:09:42.915
Yeah, 'cause you don't want
that reaction

00:09:42.948 --> 00:09:44.583
either of asking a person
and them be like,

00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:46.251
"Why are you asking?
You know I'll give it to you."

00:09:46.284 --> 00:09:47.485
Exactly. So I understand.

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:49.288
Except for this one time where
I'll make you feel horrible.

00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.489
No, just ask.

00:09:50.522 --> 00:09:52.191
And then all day I felt
so much anxiety.

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:53.425
But then yes, okay.

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:55.894
So then we came back from LA,
were we in LA?

00:09:55.927 --> 00:09:57.229
Where were we, who cares?

00:09:57.262 --> 00:09:58.430
Who knows, man.

00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:00.265
We came back from the road
on Monday

00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:00.799
and we get back,

00:10:00.832 --> 00:10:01.834
he spends the night.

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:03.769
Tuesday morning,
yesterday morning,

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:05.204
I woke up early,
I go to the gym.

00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:09.942
He's on the couch.
I come back and I walk in

00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:12.678
and you at one point
hear me like stirring.

00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:14.580
I'm trying to be quiet

00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:16.582
so that you can like sleep
through the morning.

00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:19.985
And you turned on the couch,
like you turned your back to me

00:10:20.018 --> 00:10:23.222
and there was a wrapper of a
protein bar stuck to your back.

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:26.058
I didn't take a picture of it
'cause I felt ...

00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:28.027
You eat it that way?
That's weird.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.962
You in the middle of night ...

00:10:29.995 --> 00:10:33.065
Through my kidney dialysis?
Dialysis? Princess Diana.

00:10:34.032 --> 00:10:36.735
It was just the grossest, it was
the same kind of protein bar

00:10:36.768 --> 00:10:37.936
that he had stolen
the day before ...

00:10:37.969 --> 00:10:39.170
Ew, ew.

00:10:39.204 --> 00:10:41.941
And it was stuck to his back
and just kind of falling off.

00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:46.512
Dude, I put it in my pocket
'cause I didn't want you to know

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:47.880
I ate it in the middle
of the night.

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:50.582
No, you were busted brother,
you were busted.

00:10:50.615 --> 00:10:52.785
You didn't ask, not to be,
like you couldn't have asked.

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.420
If you would have
knocked on my fucking door

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:55.654
in the middle of the night ...

00:10:55.687 --> 00:10:57.423
That's what I'm saying,
you're womanizing in there.

00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:58.791
To be like, "Can I have
a protein bar?"

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:01.794
I would've hated you even more,
but I hated seeing

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:04.663
that loose wrapper
stuck to your dirty ass back ...

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:05.898
So gross.

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:10.036
Under your anxiety blanket,
it enraged me.

00:11:10.602 --> 00:11:12.337
And I wish
I would've taken a picture

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.773
'cause it was just so sloppy
the way it was hanging off ...

00:11:14.806 --> 00:11:16.208
You guys realize you're
a married couple, right?

00:11:16.241 --> 00:11:17.443
Yeah.

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:19.044
The bickering, the little shit
that upsets you ...

00:11:19.077 --> 00:11:20.245
Yeah, yeah.

00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:21.246
Yeah.
We're not having sex.

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.481
And the fact that
nobody's fucking ...

00:11:22.514 --> 00:11:24.650
Yeah, no one's fucking.
All those factors, this is like

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:26.919
I'm listening to the shit
you're doing, I'm going ...

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:28.921
I got a wife
and two beautiful girls,

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.956
I barely want to do half
that shit for her

00:11:30.989 --> 00:11:32.424
and she lets me
bang her, you know?

00:11:32.457 --> 00:11:33.625
Yeah, yeah.
I know.

00:11:33.658 --> 00:11:34.860
She's kind enough that way.

00:11:34.893 --> 00:11:36.895
No, she's doing me a favor
by not letting me bang her.

00:11:36.928 --> 00:11:38.263
That's why I do
all these things.

00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:39.498
I think everybody's winning.

00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:41.300
Yeah, I think your wife is
messing up by banging you.

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:42.501
Yeah, well, believe me ...

00:11:42.534 --> 00:11:44.036
No, Andrew is like ...

00:11:44.636 --> 00:11:46.438
I do acknowledge
and I talk about it a lot

00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:48.707
with my other friends,
like I'm really mean to Andrew

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.743
and I need to pull it back
because I just ...

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:51.977
Nah, you're fine.
He can take it.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.479
I don't know ... you can
take it, that's the thing.

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:54.713
Are you okay?

00:11:54.746 --> 00:11:56.448
I think so, I don't know,
maybe I'm sad, without knows?

00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:57.683
I mean, until he snaps.
And then ...

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:59.818
He has confronted me
about it before and been like,

00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:01.820
"You're a bitch,"

00:12:01.853 --> 00:12:03.522
I don't think you've said,
but you're right,

00:12:03.555 --> 00:12:05.023
I'm a bitch to you sometimes.

00:12:05.056 --> 00:12:08.393
And it's because
I don't know why

00:12:08.426 --> 00:12:10.129
and I'm working on it,
I wanna tell you that.

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:11.396
And currently
I'm not working on it,

00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:12.731
like this has just been real ...

00:12:12.764 --> 00:12:13.932
Not in this segment, right.

00:12:13.965 --> 00:12:15.234
No, no, this has all been ...

00:12:15.267 --> 00:12:16.802
Not in this segment, I refuse
to do any work on air.

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:18.003
This is the crescendo.

00:12:18.036 --> 00:12:19.238
By the way,
a good friend of mine

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:20.539
used to treat his assistant
like this,

00:12:20.572 --> 00:12:22.741
David Spade,
and that ended just fine, okay?

00:12:22.774 --> 00:12:23.942
So don't worry about it.

00:12:23.975 --> 00:12:26.044
Oh, he killed himself?
Did he kill himself?

00:12:26.077 --> 00:12:27.379
No, he tried to murder him.

00:12:27.412 --> 00:12:28.714
No, he fuckin' tried
to kill David Spade

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:29.982
in the middle
of the night.

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.416
Yeah. I told you,
I told Nikki I would kill her

00:12:31.449 --> 00:12:32.785
but I'd just be too lazy
to get rid of the body.

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:33.986
I don't know
what I would do ...

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:35.287
You're not into cardio,
you wouldn't ...

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.555
it'd be too much.

00:12:36.588 --> 00:12:38.157
It's a four story work ... yeah,
I'd be too tired the next day.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.625
Dude, if Andrew
murdered someone ...

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:41.293
we were talking about like,
I go,

00:12:41.326 --> 00:12:42.694
"How would you dispose
of a body?"

00:12:42.727 --> 00:12:46.165
With his saliva, he would
just drown them with his spit.

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:47.466
You'll die eventually.

00:12:47.499 --> 00:12:48.667
What is this dynamic?

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.002
I need to put this together
because ...

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:51.537
Oh, we hate each other, yeah.
We hate each other.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.771
Wait, how do you know ...

00:12:52.804 --> 00:12:53.972
Get in line, Kerryn.

00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:55.207
Have you just known
each other from ...

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.441
Kerryn Feehan is here.

00:12:56.474 --> 00:12:57.643
I know, I know.
He's so fun to hate.

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.211
You hate me now, Shuli?
What the fuck's going on here?

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.213
Have we always hated each other

00:13:01.246 --> 00:13:02.514
or were we friends
for like a second?

00:13:02.547 --> 00:13:03.749
No, I've hated you
right from the start, yeah.

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:04.983
Okay, thank you.
Thank you so much.

00:13:05.016 --> 00:13:06.185
Yeah, I didn't,
there was something like

00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:07.452
an aura about you.
Have you guys ever hooked up?

00:13:07.485 --> 00:13:08.720
There's like
that kind of vibe here.

00:13:08.753 --> 00:13:09.854
No, no, no.

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:11.223
No, no, I would not, she'd burn
a condom with her pussy.

00:13:11.256 --> 00:13:14.026
It would be bad,
it'd be terrible.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:15.294
I wouldn't go near it.

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:17.462
You use condoms?
You fuckin' loser.

00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:18.631
With you, I'd use fuckin' nine.

00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:21.400
Thank you.

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:22.768
I would need girth
for that big ... no.

00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:24.036
'Cause you have tiny dick,
is that ...

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:25.304
Yeah, yeah,
'cause I have a tiny ass ...

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:26.538
Just announce your tiny ...

00:13:26.571 --> 00:13:28.373
You have a tiny pussy, you
bragged about it all the time.

00:13:28.406 --> 00:13:30.676
I was born with my pussy shut
and I am very proud of it.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:31.877
I would be so proud of that.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.078
She is, I know.
Are you serious?

00:13:33.111 --> 00:13:34.279
Thank you.
It's called vaginal fusion.

00:13:34.312 --> 00:13:35.547
Yep.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.349
Right? And so you
had to have it cut open?

00:13:37.382 --> 00:13:39.484
Well, my mom had to put
topical cream on me

00:13:39.517 --> 00:13:41.553
like every day
when I was born.

00:13:41.586 --> 00:13:43.389
And then you had
to fuck 45 comics.

00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:45.958
46, 46.

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.192
I had to open it up, Mom.

00:13:47.225 --> 00:13:48.393
Dude ...

00:13:48.426 --> 00:13:50.195
And now it's open forever.

00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:51.663
What's the condition
called again?

00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:52.965
Vaginal fusion.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.199
What a great band name.

00:13:54.232 --> 00:13:55.400
It sounds like a restaurant.

00:13:55.433 --> 00:13:57.169
A band name. Hello Cleveland!

00:13:57.869 --> 00:13:59.905
Sushi Fusion, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:59.938 --> 00:14:02.741
Okay, vaginal fusion,
when did you ...

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:05.577
was sex really painful
for you at first?

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.379
Yeah, yeah.
It took me like two ...

00:14:07.412 --> 00:14:08.614
my high school boyfriend,

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:10.482
like we tried to have sex
like three times, I could never.

00:14:10.515 --> 00:14:12.284
I didn't lose my virginity
til I was in college

00:14:12.317 --> 00:14:13.886
'cause we just couldn't
get it in there.

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:15.053
Wow. Oh my God.

00:14:15.086 --> 00:14:16.388
Did he ever take
a running start?

00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:18.824
Just fuckin' charge it?

00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:21.793
Just like one of those gymnasts.

00:14:21.826 --> 00:14:25.331
Guy rushes you like
he's at a NFL combine workout.

00:14:25.897 --> 00:14:27.098
"Stay there."

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:30.435
Alright, we're timing you on
this, let's see some movement.

00:14:30.468 --> 00:14:32.504
No, I didn't break my hymen
til I slept

00:14:32.537 --> 00:14:34.873
with my hip hop teacher
when I was in college.

00:14:34.906 --> 00:14:36.074
Ah, well, enough said.

00:14:36.107 --> 00:14:38.644
Do you know that you are
right now on the top

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:40.479
10 like trending searches
on Porn Hub?

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:41.780
Did you know that?

00:14:41.813 --> 00:14:44.116
I know, I know. Did you just
see that on your own?

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:45.684
No, no. Somebody told me
that Monday night,

00:14:45.717 --> 00:14:46.919
I was like oh my God.

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:48.120
It's so weird.

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:49.354
You don't love it?
I'd be stoked.

00:14:49.387 --> 00:14:50.956
I mean, I love it but I wish
I had some content on there.

00:14:50.989 --> 00:14:52.157
I don't have any yet.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.492
I was gonna say, what the fuck
you got on there?

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:54.760
Nothing's coming up,
I could be getting these hits.

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:55.994
Fire up the phone right now.

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:57.796
They're just looking and looking
and looking and nothing ...

00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:59.531
I don't know what they're
looking for, there are ...

00:14:59.564 --> 00:15:00.732
I'm so jealous.

00:15:00.765 --> 00:15:02.267
Oh, it's so super flattering.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.835
It was after your Conan,

00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:05.437
so I bet you it had
something to do with that.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.506
That dress was so fuckin'
killer, man.

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:11.143
Thanks, dude, thanks.
You do a show every month called

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:12.577
Stand Up And
Take Your Clothes Off.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.812
Yes.

00:15:13.845 --> 00:15:16.181
Do you get full on naked
for that?

00:15:16.214 --> 00:15:17.916
No, no, no.
No, I hire burlesque.

00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:19.184
I have stand up comics

00:15:19.217 --> 00:15:20.552
and then I have burlesque acts,
they get naked.

00:15:20.585 --> 00:15:21.820
I'll flash a tit
if I have my period, but ...

00:15:21.853 --> 00:15:23.055
Good for you.

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:24.523
Right, if you have your period,
because it's like a full?

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:25.724
Bigger.

00:15:25.757 --> 00:15:28.427
'Cause it's bigger, yeah.
"'Cause they're bigger."

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.362
Because your vagina's
fused together

00:15:30.395 --> 00:15:32.130
so you're bleeding
out of your tits?

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:36.201
"I guess I'm ... I guess
I must be on my period."

00:15:36.234 --> 00:15:37.937
I know, it must be menstrual.

00:15:38.803 --> 00:15:41.840
Wait, so I love you on Instagram

00:15:41.873 --> 00:15:45.077
because you've got it
and you flaunt it.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.447
And I'm 100 years old.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.950
And you do, I mean,
you are hot on Instagram

00:15:51.983 --> 00:15:53.285
and I respect that so much

00:15:53.318 --> 00:15:55.187
because I would like to be hot
on Instagram and be like ...

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.421
You are.
Me too.

00:15:56.454 --> 00:15:57.689
And be like, well, no.

00:15:57.722 --> 00:15:59.224
There's sometimes I get out of
the shower and I wanna like ...

00:15:59.257 --> 00:16:00.459
Yes.

00:16:00.492 --> 00:16:03.795
But you do like you will be
semi nude on Instagram.

00:16:03.828 --> 00:16:05.030
Yeah, sure.

00:16:05.063 --> 00:16:07.333
'Cause you, girl, you've got it.

00:16:07.932 --> 00:16:10.435
You have got it and I appreciate
what I see

00:16:10.468 --> 00:16:11.703
and I'm never judgmental of it.

00:16:11.736 --> 00:16:15.641
I'm like I wish I could do that.
How can you do that?

00:16:17.175 --> 00:16:19.644
Here's my dilemma when I post
something that is just like

00:16:19.677 --> 00:16:21.413
"I look hot right now,"
is that ...

00:16:22.213 --> 00:16:23.849
other comedians
are gonna screenshot it

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:25.650
and then text it to each other
and be like,

00:16:25.683 --> 00:16:26.885
"Glaser thinks she's hot."

00:16:26.918 --> 00:16:28.086
Yeah, thinks she's fuckin' hot,

00:16:28.119 --> 00:16:29.688
like what's funny
about this picture?

00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:32.991
Like what's funny about that,
all she wants is male attention,

00:16:33.024 --> 00:16:34.626
it's not about the jokes,
she's not funny.

00:16:34.659 --> 00:16:36.762
82% of my Instagram followers
are men. Sorry, I mean ...

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:38.130
And then they cum
all over their phone

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:39.331
and they stop talking about you.

00:16:39.364 --> 00:16:40.999
I know, it's like I guess
that's the ...

00:16:41.032 --> 00:16:42.267
I've played that out

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.568
and you're right, Shuli,
that's how it ends.

00:16:43.601 --> 00:16:44.770
Yeah, that's 100%.

00:16:44.803 --> 00:16:46.471
"Look at this fuckin' ...
who does she think she is?

00:16:46.504 --> 00:16:48.240
Uh. Alright, well, that's enough
about Nikki, let's move on."

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:49.508
Right, yeah.

00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:50.842
I guess it's female comics
I'm worried about.

00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:52.077
Female comics are the ones.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.779
Yeah, sure. And those follows
have dropped off

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:57.649
and that's fine.
Like I feel it ... I don't know.

00:16:57.682 --> 00:17:00.218
Oh, you see ... you know what,
my friend Kelsey Cook

00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:03.221
also posted a picture where she
was like pretty nude in it,

00:17:03.254 --> 00:17:05.023
but she was saying
like I'm owning it.

00:17:05.056 --> 00:17:06.558
Like she had this whole
statement about it

00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:08.193
and she said she lost
so many followers

00:17:08.226 --> 00:17:10.095
because she posted something
that was a little bit more ...

00:17:10.128 --> 00:17:11.296
you think you would gain!

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.564
Oh yeah, it happens
all the time.

00:17:12.597 --> 00:17:15.133
Sometimes I think it's like guys
that are married

00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:16.835
or in relationships
and their girlfriends see

00:17:16.868 --> 00:17:18.103
and they're like
"Unfollow her."

00:17:18.136 --> 00:17:19.805
Yeah, sorry about that.
Oh, yeah.

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:21.406
But she has jokes,
she has jokes.

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:22.908
She's got jokes, yeah.
I swear.

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:25.410
I guess I'm just like ...
I'm an alcoholic, right?

00:17:25.443 --> 00:17:26.912
So like my new addiction ...

00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:28.447
Bragger.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.881
Thank you.
Like I fuckin' work out.

00:17:29.914 --> 00:17:31.116
Are you an alcoholic who drinks?

00:17:31.149 --> 00:17:32.851
No, I haven't had a drink
in nine months.

00:17:32.884 --> 00:17:34.052
But I've relapsed
many times.

00:17:34.085 --> 00:17:35.253
Sure.
I've seen it.

00:17:35.286 --> 00:17:37.155
I have a tattoo that says
don't serve me.

00:17:37.188 --> 00:17:38.457
You've seen me drunk?

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.724
Yeah.
Oh, cool.

00:17:39.757 --> 00:17:41.827
Wait a second, talk to me ...

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.095
About the shitty tattoo?

00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:46.431
It's in dancers' script,
it's beautiful.

00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:49.201
Okay. I relate to so much
of what you're saying,

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.702
I wanna just back up
a little bit.

00:17:50.735 --> 00:17:52.704
When did you first get sober?

00:17:52.737 --> 00:17:54.873
Probably like five,
six years ago.

00:17:54.906 --> 00:17:56.074
Okay.

00:17:56.107 --> 00:17:57.409
I've gone like two
and a half years

00:17:57.442 --> 00:17:58.677
and then I relapsed
for six months.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.645
Got it.

00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:00.212
Two and a half years,
relapsed for a year.

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.580
Okay.

00:18:01.613 --> 00:18:02.814
And now I'm nine months
and a few days.

00:18:02.847 --> 00:18:04.182
How were those relapses
because I ...

00:18:04.215 --> 00:18:05.450
A fuckin' blast ...

00:18:05.483 --> 00:18:06.785
I love a relapse for a year.

00:18:06.818 --> 00:18:08.420
Like that's not a re ...
that's like a new life.

00:18:08.453 --> 00:18:09.688
What do you mean?

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.123
She's taking her time,
she's doing it right.

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:12.357
I respect it.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.726
"I relapsed for nine years
and then died of old age."

00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:17.062
Tell me, because I'm seven
and a half years in.

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:18.263
Right.

00:18:18.296 --> 00:18:19.198
And just drinking, I smoke weed.

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:21.166
I'll smoke weed too.

00:18:21.199 --> 00:18:22.400
Okay. So ...

00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:23.602
Right, then neither of you
are sober. Go ahead.

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:24.936
We didn't say that,
I said I was an alcoholic. Yeah.

00:18:24.969 --> 00:18:26.138
We didn't say sober,
I don't drink.

00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:27.372
No, no, that's fine.

00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:28.874
Yeah, I have to be very ...
like I do not drink

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:31.143
but I do not consider myself
sober by any means.

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:32.611
No. I just announce
I'm an alcoholic

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:34.312
who doesn't drink right now.

00:18:34.345 --> 00:18:35.814
But I believe
in marijuana management

00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:37.082
even though AA doesn't.

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:38.350
Yeah, that's my problem
with AA ...

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:39.584
Same.

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:41.186
... is that people don't feel
comfortable going back there

00:18:41.219 --> 00:18:42.420
when they're smoking weed

00:18:42.453 --> 00:18:43.722
when they really need
a support system.

00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:44.956
Totally.

00:18:44.989 --> 00:18:46.258
And they feel ostracized

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.526
because they're doing
this other thing ...

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:48.760
They say it in the beginning.

00:18:48.793 --> 00:18:49.994
That is not as dangerous!

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:51.830
Yeah, at all. They say it in the
beginning of every meeting,

00:18:51.863 --> 00:18:53.265
if you have taken
any mood elevators,

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:54.533
you're not allowed to share.

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:56.501
It's like well fuck you, I got
stoned to tell you my stories.

00:18:56.534 --> 00:18:58.403
Yeah, and actually
they're gonna be better.

00:18:58.436 --> 00:19:00.105
Yeah, but meanwhile ...
I don't know about that.

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:03.041
A fuckin' stoned share,
you're there for 35 minutes

00:19:03.074 --> 00:19:04.476
going,
can we wrap this fuckin' up?

00:19:04.509 --> 00:19:06.111
It's like she's just eating
munchkins at this point.

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:08.513
We're still at Taco Bell
in this story, what's going on?

00:19:08.546 --> 00:19:11.049
So what led you
to have these ...

00:19:11.082 --> 00:19:14.186
can you pinpoint
what led you to relapse?

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:15.954
Because there are times
where I go,

00:19:15.987 --> 00:19:17.589
"I could just have one drink."
Right, right, right.

00:19:17.622 --> 00:19:18.924
Is that it?
Yes.

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:20.292
Is that that feeling?
Is that the funk?

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:22.894
Yeah. I'm like a textbook alkie
in that sense

00:19:22.927 --> 00:19:24.563
where like my brain
does work that way.

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:26.498
It's like, "I'll just have like
a 15 dollar glass

00:19:26.531 --> 00:19:27.699
of sauvignon blanc,

00:19:27.732 --> 00:19:30.001
it's like expensive,
you'll just have one."

00:19:30.034 --> 00:19:31.336
And then cut to like
a month later,

00:19:31.369 --> 00:19:33.405
I'm doing shots of tequila
before I go to work,

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:34.606
like it's insane.

00:19:34.639 --> 00:19:36.308
Right, yeah. So you really ...

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:38.743
It's like textbook,
like I'm like a snowball type

00:19:38.776 --> 00:19:40.512
and then it gets worse
every relapse.

00:19:40.545 --> 00:19:42.514
But like I also ...
I've fallen on my head,

00:19:42.547 --> 00:19:45.450
I got eight stitches on my
forehead like a while ago.

00:19:45.483 --> 00:19:46.785
Here?

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:50.088
I will fucking karate chop you
in the neck.

00:19:50.121 --> 00:19:52.757
But yeah, so ...

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.493
Why did Andrew push you?

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:57.162
I know.
She was telling a weed story.

00:19:57.829 --> 00:20:00.131
They do, my relapses do seem
to happen

00:20:00.164 --> 00:20:01.166
after breakups

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:03.768
but it's not even like a,
"Oh, I'm so sad,

00:20:03.801 --> 00:20:06.605
like I miss that guy,"
it's a "This is a great excuse."

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:08.340
To meet someone new.
To go back.

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:09.641
And out.
Yeah, yeah.

00:20:09.674 --> 00:20:11.710
Well, first of all,
when you get out of a breakup,

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:15.080
you're single again.
Meeting guys and hooking up

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:17.082
and all of that
is so wrapped in drinking.

00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:18.416
Totally.

00:20:18.449 --> 00:20:20.318
And when you're dating and you
don't drink,

00:20:20.351 --> 00:20:22.087
it's weird,
people find it weird.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.421
Totally, right.

00:20:23.454 --> 00:20:25.857
And it is weird because
it's hard to become intimate

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.225
with someone
for the first time

00:20:27.258 --> 00:20:28.827
when you don't have
that lubrication of drinking.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.095
Exactly.

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:32.797
So that makes sense why you
would kind of ease back into it

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:33.999
when you're newly single.

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:35.267
Yeah, totally.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.837
So you had some bad bottoms
where like was

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.772
the stitches where you go,
"I need to quit?"

00:20:40.805 --> 00:20:42.274
That was a bottom, yeah.

00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:43.842
And then that was like
my first time

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:45.710
like not drinking for two
and a half years.

00:20:45.743 --> 00:20:47.245
And then I got banned
from The Stand.

00:20:47.278 --> 00:20:48.480
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.

00:20:48.513 --> 00:20:51.316
I called Patrick Milligan
a fat F-word to his face.

00:20:51.349 --> 00:20:52.584
Good for you.

00:20:52.617 --> 00:20:54.853
He just ... like I just started
getting paid spots again there.

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:56.087
I mean, not good for you.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.757
And he goes, "You're the first
person who's been banned,

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:03.561
has gone from banned to paid,
like ever," come back in ...

00:21:03.594 --> 00:21:05.463
Well that just shows the power

00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:08.400
of just you're
a good person and alcohol

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:09.734
makes you a bad person.

00:21:09.767 --> 00:21:11.002
Yes.

00:21:11.035 --> 00:21:12.437
And when you remove it,
then you're back to that.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:13.705
Exactly.

00:21:13.738 --> 00:21:15.507
And funny trumps
being a drunken asshole.

00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:18.043
That's it actually.

00:21:18.076 --> 00:21:21.146
When you're a comic. When
you're in the audience, never.

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:22.480
Yeah, never.

00:21:22.513 --> 00:21:24.316
Right, right.

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:28.853
Okay. So you were talking about,
there was something else ...

00:21:28.886 --> 00:21:31.790
so now when you're sober
you get addicted to other things

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:33.325
which I very much relate to.

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:34.593
Yep.

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:37.095
And you say that working out now
is kind of like an addiction.

00:21:37.128 --> 00:21:38.363
Yeah, yeah.
What's your ...

00:21:38.396 --> 00:21:39.631
I'm at Equinox every day.

00:21:39.664 --> 00:21:41.299
Same.
I'll take any of the classes.

00:21:41.332 --> 00:21:43.001
I'm not very disciplined,
like I see you,

00:21:43.034 --> 00:21:44.336
you're like disciplined
like you can like run

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:45.570
and like be on your own
and do stuff.

00:21:45.603 --> 00:21:46.804
Right.

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:49.107
I need to be in a group setting
like competing with others.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.443
Like I need a couple fat Asians
behind me to feel good

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:52.744
and like get my pump on.

00:21:52.777 --> 00:21:55.180
I'm addicted to working out
right now too,

00:21:55.213 --> 00:21:57.449
not because I'm trying
to like look good,

00:21:57.482 --> 00:21:59.017
it's just like
something to do

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.519
that isn't smoking weed
or having anxiety.

00:22:01.552 --> 00:22:03.521
Shopping, 'cause I'll do that,
I'll just blow all my money.

00:22:03.554 --> 00:22:04.723
Or sleeping all day.
Yep.

00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:06.725
Yeah, it just makes me,
it's something ...

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:08.159
shopping, absolutely.

00:22:08.192 --> 00:22:11.229
The locker room yesterday though
was on fire with hot girls.

00:22:11.262 --> 00:22:12.931
There's so many hot girls
in Williamsburg, ugh.

00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:14.132
I got back from the gym ...

00:22:14.165 --> 00:22:15.400
Alright, now we're talking.

00:22:15.433 --> 00:22:17.269
When I discovered
old wrapper back over here,

00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:19.404
I got back and I go ...

00:22:19.437 --> 00:22:20.672
This is what I got.

00:22:20.705 --> 00:22:22.807
I'm talking to you, he's got
his wrapper on his back ...

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.042
Protein sciatica.

00:22:24.075 --> 00:22:26.578
The funny thing is I don't know
which bar it is.

00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:29.447
Like I'm trying to figure out
which bar it could be.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.282
There's like so many back there.

00:22:31.315 --> 00:22:33.351
So I told Andrew, I was like,

00:22:33.384 --> 00:22:36.187
"Dude, there was a girl in the
locker room that was so ..."

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.022
do you ever get
in the locker room and you go,

00:22:38.055 --> 00:22:40.892
"I am so lucky right now,
men would kill to be ..."

00:22:40.925 --> 00:22:42.961
Kill to be surrounded
by these hips,

00:22:42.994 --> 00:22:44.963
by these perfect tits,
these asses everywhere.

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.264
And it's just like
you'd imagine.

00:22:46.297 --> 00:22:47.499
I feel like you guys
are punching me

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:48.767
in the face right now.
I don't like this.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.034
This girl yesterday was,

00:22:50.067 --> 00:22:51.470
I'm not joking you,
she was in ...

00:22:53.404 --> 00:22:55.039
I don't wanna say stockings,
not stockings.

00:22:55.072 --> 00:22:56.307
Please do.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.744
But like leggings that you get
in an egg, like 80s leggings.

00:22:59.777 --> 00:23:01.012
Oh, right. Okay, yeah.

00:23:01.045 --> 00:23:03.548
Sheer black leggings
and a really short skirt

00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:06.651
but the leggings were up to here
and a short skirt, topless,

00:23:06.684 --> 00:23:08.987
just no top,
just brushing her hair

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.089
and doing her makeup
for an hour.

00:23:11.122 --> 00:23:13.825
And this girl's tits
were insanely perfect.

00:23:13.858 --> 00:23:15.093
Insane, I know. I know.

00:23:15.126 --> 00:23:17.061
I was trying to look so hard

00:23:17.094 --> 00:23:18.296
because I was so turned
on by it.

00:23:18.329 --> 00:23:19.631
I stare, I can't help myself.

00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:20.865
I couldn't help but stare.

00:23:20.898 --> 00:23:22.233
Here's how I stare,
I have a trick.

00:23:22.266 --> 00:23:23.468
Okay.

00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:24.736
When you're blow
drying your hair,

00:23:24.769 --> 00:23:27.138
put your head through your legs
so you have a low line of sight,

00:23:27.171 --> 00:23:29.574
no one can see you looking.
You have the whole Serengeti ...

00:23:29.607 --> 00:23:31.543
I'll try it, but it's gonna look
weird,

00:23:31.576 --> 00:23:32.911
blow drying my hair,
but I'll try it.

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:35.013
Shuli blow drying his hair.

00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:36.948
Wait, are you naked
when you're blow drying?

00:23:37.949 --> 00:23:39.284
Because then you're giving ...

00:23:39.317 --> 00:23:42.387
No, I'm a girl who just
I at least wear a bra.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.456
I'm not one of these girls
that goes just top ...

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:46.591
like you don't need to blow dry
your hair without a shirt on.

00:23:46.624 --> 00:23:47.959
I do, I actually do
'cause I sweat.

00:23:47.992 --> 00:23:49.194
You're a flaunter.

00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:50.462
I'm a sweater.

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:53.731
Oh, I'm a huge sweater too.
But I put a towel or something.

00:23:53.764 --> 00:23:55.834
Yeah. My boobs, I'm not mad
about my boobs,

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:57.302
so they're fine. And
they don't bother anybody ...

00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:58.536
Me too.
They're small.

00:23:58.569 --> 00:24:00.104
Keep making that face Andrew,
I'm coming over there.

00:24:00.137 --> 00:24:01.372
What face, what are you ...
He just went ew, ugh.

00:24:01.405 --> 00:24:02.674
No I didn't, when did I do that?

00:24:02.707 --> 00:24:03.942
Yes, you did.
It's a tic.

00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:05.743
We're all ... you're checking
out girls in there too, right?

00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:06.945
Oh, all the time.
Are you gay?

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:08.146
No.
Are you bi or anything?

00:24:08.179 --> 00:24:09.981
I wish.
I'm not either.

00:24:10.014 --> 00:24:11.616
I would die to be.

00:24:11.649 --> 00:24:12.917
I would like to be as well.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.752
Can one of you guys crawl on the
table and just start fucking?

00:24:14.785 --> 00:24:15.987
I know, I feel like ...

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.489
Like the scene from Requiem
for a Dream?

00:24:17.522 --> 00:24:18.757
Ass to ass.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.593
I feel like we're about to start
filming the White Snake video.

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:23.695
You have your womanizers,
grab 'em.

00:24:23.728 --> 00:24:26.431
But I check out women
all the ding dong time in there

00:24:26.464 --> 00:24:27.632
and I'm loving it.

00:24:27.665 --> 00:24:29.133
Of course, of course.
And I wonder about, I'm like,

00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:30.935
"Where do they get
these hips sometimes?"

00:24:30.968 --> 00:24:33.004
Like I'm hipless,
I'm like their bodies are ...

00:24:33.037 --> 00:24:34.506
No you're not,
you have great hips.

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:37.242
I have a but but no hips.
I'm like how do they do it?

00:24:37.275 --> 00:24:39.010
That's just bones,
they're just born like that.

00:24:39.043 --> 00:24:40.245
Shuli, your dick is awesome.

00:24:40.278 --> 00:24:42.981
Andrew, your asshole
is tight as a drum, bro.

00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:44.983
Dude, your hard nipples
just make my dick

00:24:45.016 --> 00:24:46.284
just rock hard, Shuli.

00:24:46.317 --> 00:24:48.119
Dude, I'd give you
pink eye in a second.

00:24:48.152 --> 00:24:49.888
Oh, I'd fucking cum
on your bald head.

00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:52.790
This is what's happening
in 24 hour fitness locker rooms.

00:24:52.823 --> 00:24:54.659
Oh yeah, right, exactly.

00:24:54.692 --> 00:24:56.294
You check out that guy's hog
over there?

00:24:56.327 --> 00:24:57.695
This is crutch talk.

00:24:57.728 --> 00:24:58.963
He's blow dryin' his nuts.

00:24:58.996 --> 00:25:00.632
This guy just stood up
and his balls

00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:03.735
were just dangly
and skin and loose.

00:25:04.435 --> 00:25:07.705
I feel grateful for working out
at Equinox.

00:25:07.738 --> 00:25:09.874
The level of hotness
both in LA

00:25:09.907 --> 00:25:12.510
'cause I go to LA ones
and New York is insane.

00:25:12.543 --> 00:25:15.547
And I'm like, guys would kill to
see what I'm killing right now.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.516
And I try to like
capture it in my mind

00:25:18.082 --> 00:25:20.018
and maybe I'm trying to
get kicked out of Equinox

00:25:20.051 --> 00:25:21.586
by saying that I ...
that's the only way

00:25:21.619 --> 00:25:23.821
to get out of your contract
is to like break the rules

00:25:23.854 --> 00:25:25.189
so I'm trying
to put it out there.

00:25:25.222 --> 00:25:26.491
You know what else
I use Equinox for?

00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:27.692
What?
To shave my puss.

00:25:27.725 --> 00:25:28.893
Hell yeah.

00:25:28.926 --> 00:25:31.829
I fuckin' nicked my taint
the other in there, though.

00:25:31.862 --> 00:25:34.632
Oh my God, it stung when I peed,
I was not ready for that at all.

00:25:34.665 --> 00:25:35.833
Oh, that's the worst.

00:25:35.866 --> 00:25:37.969
When you just like
cut your labia like off.

00:25:38.002 --> 00:25:39.304
Ah, you poor things.

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:40.805
You're like, "Well, alright,
this is ..."

00:25:40.838 --> 00:25:42.674
"Can we biopsy this
while we got it?"

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:46.744
Poor darlings.
What you go through.

00:25:46.777 --> 00:25:48.880
Yeah, I really use ...

00:25:48.913 --> 00:25:51.215
I love amenities, I lube up
with that lotion.

00:25:51.248 --> 00:25:52.550
The keels, the keels.

00:25:52.583 --> 00:25:53.785
Oh yeah, I drink it.

00:25:53.818 --> 00:25:56.187
I let my hair grow out
pretty intensely

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.722
when I'm not hooking up
and then when I feel

00:25:57.755 --> 00:26:00.024
an impending hooking up,
that's when I shave it all off.

00:26:00.057 --> 00:26:02.093
And that's a lot of clean
up in your bath

00:26:02.126 --> 00:26:04.128
'cause once it drains like
there's a ring of hair around.

00:26:04.161 --> 00:26:05.430
Oh yeah, yep.
It looks like you ...

00:26:05.463 --> 00:26:08.333
it's a lot of clean up
and I thrust that on Equinox.

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:10.034
I go that's what I'm paying for
is to damage their ...

00:26:10.067 --> 00:26:11.603
Absolutely. That lady with
the suck vac walking around.

00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:12.904
Oh, the suck vac, yes.

00:26:12.937 --> 00:26:14.138
Do you ever do this
when you're done?

00:26:14.171 --> 00:26:15.406
I'm like put that on my clit.

00:26:15.439 --> 00:26:17.909
Clean my pubes, people!
Hello!

00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:21.079
I was doing Brazilians
for the longest ...

00:26:21.112 --> 00:26:22.447
No more.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.815
What about waxing?

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:26.951
That's it. He's so stupid.

00:26:26.984 --> 00:26:28.886
I know, I was thinking
that joke.

00:26:28.919 --> 00:26:30.188
I didn't even get it.

00:26:30.221 --> 00:26:31.656
Shuli G, February 27th.

00:26:31.689 --> 00:26:33.191
I was, I was thinking
about saying that joke.

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:34.892
That's a great joke.
Yeah, it was great.

00:26:34.925 --> 00:26:36.094
That was great, Shuli.

00:26:36.127 --> 00:26:37.328
So good, really good.

00:26:37.361 --> 00:26:39.130
Thanks guys, I'm outta here,
I gotta go jerk off.

00:26:39.163 --> 00:26:40.331
See you guys!

00:26:40.364 --> 00:26:41.766
See you at Equinox.

00:26:42.566 --> 00:26:46.337
You're watching the Outtakes
with Nikki and Andrew.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.673
Are you using that as floss?
That is not okay.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.377
You share that with people,
that is a bag that you go,

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.913
"Do you want any ..."
repulsive.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.083
I used to do it with dog bags.

00:26:59.283 --> 00:27:00.551
Ew, it's on his tooth.

00:27:00.584 --> 00:27:03.121
This isn't a time to brag
about other bags you use,

00:27:03.154 --> 00:27:04.355
it's a time to be like,

00:27:04.388 --> 00:27:05.623
"This never happens,
I needed it."

00:27:05.656 --> 00:27:08.526
Anything can be floss,
anything can be floss.

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:11.563
Yeah, when you have the gap
in your teeth like you've had.

00:27:12.263 --> 00:27:13.965
You're ... oh my God.

00:27:24.141 --> 00:27:26.744
We have to figure out what we're
using on our social media pages.

00:27:26.777 --> 00:27:29.580
Okay, yeah. We have to go
through these pictures,

00:27:29.613 --> 00:27:30.848
we did a photo shoot,

00:27:30.881 --> 00:27:33.217
these are the pictures
that Noa has chosen.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.653
She went through 'em all for me
because I did not wanna judge.

00:27:35.686 --> 00:27:36.988
Yeah, you don't like
doing those.

00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:38.990
No, I don't.

00:27:39.023 --> 00:27:41.192
So these are the ones
we've selected

00:27:41.225 --> 00:27:43.895
and we just have to pick
which ones go where.

00:27:43.928 --> 00:27:45.763
We need one for like reception,

00:27:45.796 --> 00:27:47.632
so what do you want people
to see when they walk in?

00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:48.866
Like when they walk in here.

00:27:48.899 --> 00:27:50.168
Okay.

00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:51.369
So let's look for that one.

00:27:51.402 --> 00:27:52.804
I'm dying for your input.

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:54.072
No you're not, you hate it.

00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:56.074
No, this is actually
interesting to me.

00:27:58.776 --> 00:28:00.678
That's too hot, that's like
if I was coming out

00:28:00.711 --> 00:28:02.013
with like a Shakira type single.

00:28:02.046 --> 00:28:03.247
Yeah, I don't think that's you.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.416
I get like you should
do something

00:28:05.449 --> 00:28:07.185
outside your comfort zone,

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:09.154
like what people don't expect,
I get that.

00:28:10.721 --> 00:28:11.923
So what are we looking for?

00:28:11.956 --> 00:28:13.191
What do you think
that is my vibe?

00:28:14.058 --> 00:28:15.259
I'll find it.

00:28:15.292 --> 00:28:17.929
You'll know it when you see it?
Well, we're running out.

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:19.664
How many did you do?

00:28:20.297 --> 00:28:21.699
Keep going.

00:28:21.732 --> 00:28:23.134
No.

00:28:23.167 --> 00:28:25.870
Why isn't that my vibe?
Why isn't that my vibe?

00:28:26.837 --> 00:28:28.539
I just think it's like too much
of a smile,

00:28:28.572 --> 00:28:30.074
it's too big of a smile.

00:28:30.107 --> 00:28:31.275
I'm a happy person.

00:28:31.308 --> 00:28:32.510
Are you?

00:28:32.543 --> 00:28:34.011
Yes.

00:28:34.044 --> 00:28:36.114
That is the vibe of the show,
we are having that much fun.

00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:37.315
Yes, that's fun, I like that.

00:28:37.348 --> 00:28:38.783
That is me laughing at you.

00:28:38.816 --> 00:28:40.418
I like that more
than the other ones.

00:28:40.451 --> 00:28:42.153
Okay.

00:28:42.853 --> 00:28:44.388
No. I like that.

00:28:44.421 --> 00:28:45.957
That's the one, I like that
one the best so far.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.191
Yeah. I see like

00:28:47.224 --> 00:28:48.392
You Up with Nikki
Glaser on the side.

00:28:48.425 --> 00:28:50.895
Because that's fun,
it's also sexy, it's like ...

00:28:51.862 --> 00:28:53.565
I don't know,
I like that one.

00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:56.200
The way you say sexy
couldn't be said sexy ...

00:28:56.233 --> 00:28:57.568
Sexier less?

00:28:57.601 --> 00:28:59.170
Sexy less.
Yeah.

00:28:59.203 --> 00:29:00.438
Say it again.

00:29:00.471 --> 00:29:03.608
You look so sexy there.

00:29:04.241 --> 00:29:07.212
Ew, I can see food.

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:11.249
I can see it on your tongue,
it's like a film.

00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:12.517
Yeah, I have ...

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.819
I learned to brush my tongue
though this year.

00:29:15.853 --> 00:29:17.121
That just got to you, that news?

00:29:17.154 --> 00:29:18.790
I had no idea.
Right.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:20.792
You brush your tongue?

00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:24.562
Yeah. I do it if I want
my breath to smell extra fresh.

00:29:24.595 --> 00:29:26.631
I like that one and that one,
these are my choices.

00:29:26.664 --> 00:29:27.999
What do you think?

00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:29.233
I like that one.

00:29:29.266 --> 00:29:31.169
So what do we need
to put them in?

00:29:31.202 --> 00:29:33.905
We need one for reception,
we need podcast art,

00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:36.107
and then we have to refresh
all our socials.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.375
Okay, okay.

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:40.344
So I guess like three different
pictures out of these.

00:29:40.377 --> 00:29:44.115
Okay, so reception
I think should be this

00:29:44.148 --> 00:29:45.349
'cause who cares?

00:29:45.382 --> 00:29:47.118
Why don't I just look happy
and pretty,

00:29:47.151 --> 00:29:48.986
all my bosses
are walking around here,

00:29:49.019 --> 00:29:50.755
that's who's gonna see it.
Howard Stern might see this ...

00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:52.023
Yeah.

00:29:52.056 --> 00:29:53.257
And be like she seems ...

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.492
I like it. You look fit.

00:29:54.525 --> 00:29:55.893
This could be good for ...

00:29:55.926 --> 00:29:57.495
I honestly am trying
to think now

00:29:57.528 --> 00:29:59.397
what would Howard
Stern want for me?

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.766
Yes, let's do it that way.

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:04.368
but it's not even like a,
"Oh, I'm so sad,

00:30:04.401 --> 00:30:07.205
like I miss that guy,"
it's a "This is a great excuse."

00:30:07.238 --> 00:30:08.940
To meet someone new.
To go back.

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:10.241
And out.
Yeah, yeah.

00:30:10.274 --> 00:30:12.310
Well, first of all,
when you get out of a breakup,

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:15.680
you're single again.
Meeting guys and hooking up

00:30:15.713 --> 00:30:17.682
and all of that
is so wrapped in drinking.

00:30:17.715 --> 00:30:19.016
Totally.

00:30:19.049 --> 00:30:20.918
And when you're dating and you
don't drink,

00:30:20.951 --> 00:30:22.687
it's weird,
people find it weird.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.021
Totally, right.

00:30:24.054 --> 00:30:26.457
And it is weird because
it's hard to become intimate

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:27.825
with someone
for the first time

00:30:27.858 --> 00:30:29.427
when you don't have
that lubrication of drinking.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.695
Exactly.

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:33.397
So that makes sense why you
would kind of ease back into it

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:34.599
when you're newly single.

00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:35.867
Yeah, totally.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.437
So you had some bad bottoms
where like was

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.372
the stitches where you go,
"I need to quit?"

00:30:41.405 --> 00:30:42.874
That was a bottom, yeah.

00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:44.442
And then that was like
my first time

00:30:44.475 --> 00:30:46.310
like not drinking for two
and a half years.

00:30:46.343 --> 00:30:47.845
And then I got banned
from The Stand.

00:30:47.878 --> 00:30:49.080
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.

00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:51.916
I called Patrick Milligan
a fat F-word to his face.

00:30:51.949 --> 00:30:53.184
Good for you.

00:30:53.217 --> 00:30:55.453
He just ... like I just started
getting paid spots again there.

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:56.687
I mean, not good for you.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.357
And he goes, "You're the first
person who's been banned,

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:04.161
has gone from banned to paid,
like ever," come back in ...

00:31:04.194 --> 00:31:06.063
Well that just shows the power

00:31:06.096 --> 00:31:09.000
of just you're
a good person and alcohol

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:10.334
makes you a bad person.

00:31:10.367 --> 00:31:11.602
Yes.

00:31:11.635 --> 00:31:13.037
And when you remove it,
then you're back to that.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.305
Exactly.

00:31:14.338 --> 00:31:16.107
And funny trumps
being a drunken asshole.

00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:18.643
That's it actually.

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:21.746
When you're a comic. When
you're in the audience, never.

00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:23.080
Yeah, never.

00:31:23.113 --> 00:31:24.916
Right, right.

00:31:24.949 --> 00:31:29.453
Okay. So you were talking about,
there was something else ...

00:31:29.486 --> 00:31:32.390
so now when you're sober
you get addicted to other things

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:33.925
which I very much relate to.

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:35.193
Yep.

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:37.695
And you say that working out now
is kind of like an addiction.

00:31:37.728 --> 00:31:38.963
Yeah, yeah.
What's your ...

00:31:38.996 --> 00:31:40.231
I'm at Equinox every day.

00:31:40.264 --> 00:31:41.899
Same.
I'll take any of the classes.

00:31:41.932 --> 00:31:43.601
I'm not very disciplined,
like I see you,

00:31:43.634 --> 00:31:44.936
you're like disciplined
like you can like run

00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:46.170
and like be on your own
and do stuff.

00:31:46.203 --> 00:31:47.404
Right.

00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:49.707
I need to be in a group setting
like competing with others.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.043
Like I need a couple fat Asians
behind me to feel good

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:53.344
and like get my pump on.

00:31:53.377 --> 00:31:55.780
I'm addicted to working out
right now too,

00:31:55.813 --> 00:31:58.049
not because I'm trying
to like look good,

00:31:58.082 --> 00:31:59.617
it's just like
something to do

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.119
that isn't smoking weed
or having anxiety.

00:32:02.152 --> 00:32:04.121
Shopping, 'cause I'll do that,
I'll just blow all my money.

00:32:04.154 --> 00:32:05.323
Or sleeping all day.
Yep.

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:07.325
Yeah, it just makes me,
it's something ...

00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:08.759
shopping, absolutely.

00:32:08.792 --> 00:32:11.829
The locker room yesterday though
was on fire with hot girls.

00:32:11.862 --> 00:32:13.531
There's so many hot girls
in Williamsburg, ugh.

00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:14.732
I got back from the gym ...

00:32:14.765 --> 00:32:16.000
Alright, now we're talking.

00:32:16.033 --> 00:32:17.869
When I discovered
old wrapper back over here,

00:32:18.469 --> 00:32:20.004
I got back and I go ...

00:32:20.037 --> 00:32:21.272
This is what I got.

00:32:21.305 --> 00:32:23.407
I'm talking to you, he's got
his wrapper on his back ...

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.642
Protein sciatica.

00:32:24.675 --> 00:32:27.178
The funny thing is I don't know
which bar it is.

00:32:27.211 --> 00:32:30.047
Like I'm trying to figure out
which bar it could be.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.882
There's like so many back there.

00:32:31.915 --> 00:32:33.951
So I told Andrew, I was like,

00:32:33.984 --> 00:32:36.787
"Dude, there was a girl in the
locker room that was so ..."

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.622
do you ever get
in the locker room and you go,

00:32:38.655 --> 00:32:41.492
"I am so lucky right now,
men would kill to be ..."

00:32:41.525 --> 00:32:43.561
Kill to be surrounded
by these hips,

00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:45.563
by these perfect tits,
these asses everywhere.

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:46.864
And it's just like
you'd imagine.

00:32:46.897 --> 00:32:48.099
I feel like you guys
are punching me

00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:49.367
in the face right now.
I don't like this.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.634
This girl yesterday was,

00:32:50.667 --> 00:32:52.070
I'm not joking you,
she was in ...

00:32:54.004 --> 00:32:55.639
I don't wanna say stockings,
not stockings.

00:32:55.672 --> 00:32:56.907
Please do.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.344
But like leggings that you get
in an egg, like 80s leggings.

00:33:00.377 --> 00:33:01.612
Oh, right. Okay, yeah.

00:33:01.645 --> 00:33:04.148
Sheer black leggings
and a really short skirt

00:33:04.181 --> 00:33:07.251
but the leggings were up to here
and a short skirt, topless,

00:33:07.284 --> 00:33:09.587
just no top,
just brushing her hair

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.689
and doing her makeup
for an hour.

00:33:11.722 --> 00:33:14.425
And this girl's tits
were insanely perfect.

00:33:14.458 --> 00:33:15.693
Insane, I know. I know.

00:33:15.726 --> 00:33:17.661
I was trying to look so hard

00:33:17.694 --> 00:33:18.896
because I was so turned
on by it.

00:33:18.929 --> 00:33:20.231
I stare, I can't help myself.

00:33:20.264 --> 00:33:21.465
I couldn't help but stare.

00:33:21.498 --> 00:33:22.833
Here's how I stare,
I have a trick.

00:33:22.866 --> 00:33:24.068
Okay.

00:33:24.101 --> 00:33:25.336
When you're blow
drying your hair,

00:33:25.369 --> 00:33:27.738
put your head through your legs
so you have a low line of sight,

00:33:27.771 --> 00:33:30.174
no one can see you looking.
You have the whole Serengeti ...

00:33:30.207 --> 00:33:32.143
I'll try it, but it's gonna look
weird,

00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:33.511
blow drying my hair,
but I'll try it.

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:35.613
Shuli blow drying his hair.

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:37.548
Wait, are you naked
when you're blow drying?

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:39.884
Because then you're giving ...

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:42.987
No, I'm a girl who just
I at least wear a bra.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.056
I'm not one of these girls
that goes just top ...

00:33:45.089 --> 00:33:47.191
like you don't need to blow dry
your hair without a shirt on.

00:33:47.224 --> 00:33:48.559
I do, I actually do
'cause I sweat.

00:33:48.592 --> 00:33:49.794
You're a flaunter.

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:51.062
I'm a sweater.

00:33:51.095 --> 00:33:54.331
Oh, I'm a huge sweater too.
But I put a towel or something.

00:33:54.364 --> 00:33:56.434
Yeah. My boobs, I'm not mad
about my boobs,

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:57.902
so they're fine. And
they don't bother anybody ...

00:33:57.935 --> 00:33:59.136
Me too.
They're small.

00:33:59.169 --> 00:34:00.704
Keep making that face Andrew,
I'm coming over there.

00:34:00.737 --> 00:34:01.972
What face, what are you ...
He just went ew, ugh.

00:34:02.005 --> 00:34:03.274
No I didn't, when did I do that?

00:34:03.307 --> 00:34:04.542
Yes, you did.
It's a tic.

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:06.343
We're all ... you're checking
out girls in there too, right?

00:34:06.376 --> 00:34:07.545
Oh, all the time.
Are you gay?

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:08.746
No.
Are you bi or anything?

00:34:08.779 --> 00:34:10.581
I wish.
I'm not either.

00:34:10.614 --> 00:34:12.216
I would die to be.

00:34:12.249 --> 00:34:13.517
I would like to be as well.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:15.352
Can one of you guys crawl on the
table and just start fucking?

00:34:15.385 --> 00:34:16.587
I know, I feel like ...

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.089
Like the scene from Requiem
for a Dream?

00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:19.357
Ass to ass.

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:22.193
I feel like we're about to start
filming the White Snake video.

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:24.295
You have your womanizers,
grab 'em.

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:27.031
But I check out women
all the ding dong time in there

00:34:27.064 --> 00:34:28.232
and I'm loving it.

00:34:28.265 --> 00:34:29.733
Of course, of course.
And I wonder about, I'm like,

00:34:29.766 --> 00:34:31.535
"Where do they get
these hips sometimes?"

00:34:31.568 --> 00:34:33.604
Like I'm hipless,
I'm like their bodies are ...

00:34:33.637 --> 00:34:35.106
No you're not,
you have great hips.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:37.842
I have a but but no hips.
I'm like how do they do it?

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:39.610
That's just bones,
they're just born like that.

00:34:39.643 --> 00:34:40.845
Shuli, your dick is awesome.

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:43.581
Andrew, your asshole
is tight as a drum, bro.

00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:45.583
Dude, your hard nipples
just make my dick

00:34:45.616 --> 00:34:46.884
just rock hard, Shuli.

00:34:46.917 --> 00:34:48.719
Dude, I'd give you
pink eye in a second.

00:34:48.752 --> 00:34:50.488
Oh, I'd fucking cum
on your bald head.

00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:53.390
This is what's happening
in 24 hour fitness locker rooms.

00:34:53.423 --> 00:34:55.259
Oh yeah, right, exactly.

00:34:55.292 --> 00:34:56.894
You check out that guy's hog
over there?

00:34:56.927 --> 00:34:58.295
This is crutch talk.

00:34:58.328 --> 00:34:59.563
He's blow dryin' his nuts.

00:34:59.596 --> 00:35:01.232
This guy just stood up
and his balls

00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:04.335
were just dangly
and skin and loose.

00:35:05.035 --> 00:35:08.305
I feel grateful for working out
at Equinox.

00:35:08.338 --> 00:35:10.474
The level of hotness
both in LA

00:35:10.507 --> 00:35:13.110
'cause I go to LA ones
and New York is insane.

00:35:13.143 --> 00:35:16.147
And I'm like, guys would kill to
see what I'm killing right now.

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.116
And I try to like
capture it in my mind

00:35:18.682 --> 00:35:20.618
and maybe I'm trying to
get kicked out of Equinox

00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:22.186
by saying that I ...
that's the only way

00:35:22.219 --> 00:35:24.421
to get out of your contract
is to like break the rules

00:35:24.454 --> 00:35:25.789
so I'm trying
to put it out there.

00:35:25.822 --> 00:35:27.091
You know what else
I use Equinox for?

00:35:27.124 --> 00:35:28.292
What?
To shave my puss.

00:35:28.325 --> 00:35:29.493
Hell yeah.

00:35:29.526 --> 00:35:32.429
I fuckin' nicked my taint
the other in there, though.

00:35:32.462 --> 00:35:35.232
Oh my God, it stung when I peed,
I was not ready for that at all.

00:35:35.265 --> 00:35:36.433
Oh, that's the worst.

00:35:36.466 --> 00:35:38.569
When you just like
cut your labia like off.

00:35:38.602 --> 00:35:39.904
Ah, you poor things.

00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:41.405
You're like, "Well, alright,
this is ..."

00:35:41.438 --> 00:35:43.274
"Can we biopsy this
while we got it?"

00:35:45.676 --> 00:35:47.344
Poor darlings.
What you go through.

00:35:47.377 --> 00:35:49.480
Yeah, I really use ...

00:35:49.513 --> 00:35:51.815
I love amenities, I lube up
with that lotion.

00:35:51.848 --> 00:35:53.150
The keels, the keels.

00:35:53.183 --> 00:35:54.385
Oh yeah, I drink it.

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:56.787
I let my hair grow out
pretty intensely

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.322
when I'm not hooking up
and then when I feel

00:35:58.355 --> 00:36:00.624
an impending hooking up,
that's when I shave it all off.

00:36:00.657 --> 00:36:02.693
And that's a lot of clean
up in your bath

00:36:02.726 --> 00:36:04.728
'cause once it drains like
there's a ring of hair around.

00:36:04.761 --> 00:36:06.030
Oh yeah, yep.
It looks like you ...

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:08.933
it's a lot of clean up
and I thrust that on Equinox.

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:10.634
I go that's what I'm paying for
is to damage their ...

00:36:10.667 --> 00:36:12.203
Absolutely. That lady with
the suck vac walking around.

00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:13.504
Oh, the suck vac, yes.

00:36:13.537 --> 00:36:14.738
Do you ever do this
when you're done?

00:36:14.771 --> 00:36:16.006
I'm like put that on my clit.

00:36:16.039 --> 00:36:18.509
Clean my pubes, people!
Hello!

00:36:19.509 --> 00:36:21.679
I was doing Brazilians
for the longest ...

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.047
No more.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.415
What about waxing?

00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:27.551
That's it. He's so stupid.

00:36:27.584 --> 00:36:29.486
I know, I was thinking
that joke.

00:36:29.519 --> 00:36:30.788
I didn't even get it.

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:32.256
Shuli G, February 27th.

00:36:32.289 --> 00:36:33.791
I was, I was thinking
about saying that joke.

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.492
That's a great joke.
Yeah, it was great.

00:36:35.525 --> 00:36:36.694
That was great, Shuli.

00:36:36.727 --> 00:36:37.928
So good, really good.

00:36:37.961 --> 00:36:39.730
Thanks guys, I'm outta here,
I gotta go jerk off.

00:36:39.763 --> 00:36:40.931
See you guys!

00:36:40.964 --> 00:36:42.366
See you at Equinox.

00:36:43.166 --> 00:36:46.937
You're watching the Outtakes
with Nikki and Andrew.

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:49.273
Are you using that as floss?
That is not okay.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.977
You share that with people,
that is a bag that you go,

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.513
"Do you want any ..."
repulsive.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.683
I used to do it with dog bags.

00:36:59.883 --> 00:37:01.151
Ew, it's on his tooth.

00:37:01.184 --> 00:37:03.721
This isn't a time to brag
about other bags you use,

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:04.955
it's a time to be like,

00:37:04.988 --> 00:37:06.223
"This never happens,
I needed it."

00:37:06.256 --> 00:37:09.126
Anything can be floss,
anything can be floss.

00:37:09.159 --> 00:37:12.163
Yeah, when you have the gap
in your teeth like you've had.

00:37:12.863 --> 00:37:14.565
You're ... oh my God.

00:37:24.741 --> 00:37:27.344
We have to figure out what we're
using on our social media pages.

00:37:27.377 --> 00:37:30.180
Okay, yeah. We have to go
through these pictures,

00:37:30.213 --> 00:37:31.448
we did a photo shoot,

00:37:31.481 --> 00:37:33.817
these are the pictures
that Noa has chosen.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:36.253
She went through 'em all for me
because I did not wanna judge.

00:37:36.286 --> 00:37:37.588
Yeah, you don't like
doing those.

00:37:37.621 --> 00:37:39.590
No, I don't.

00:37:39.623 --> 00:37:41.792
So these are the ones
we've selected

00:37:41.825 --> 00:37:44.495
and we just have to pick
which ones go where.

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:46.363
We need one for like reception,

00:37:46.396 --> 00:37:48.232
so what do you want people
to see when they walk in?

00:37:48.265 --> 00:37:49.466
Like when they walk in here.

00:37:49.499 --> 00:37:50.768
Okay.

00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:51.969
So let's look for that one.

00:37:52.002 --> 00:37:53.404
I'm dying for your input.

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:54.672
No you're not, you hate it.

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:56.674
No, this is actually
interesting to me.

00:37:59.376 --> 00:38:01.278
That's too hot, that's like
if I was coming out

00:38:01.311 --> 00:38:02.613
with like a Shakira type single.

00:38:02.646 --> 00:38:03.847
Yeah, I don't think that's you.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.016
I get like you should
do something

00:38:06.049 --> 00:38:07.785
outside your comfort zone,

00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:09.754
like what people don't expect,
I get that.

00:38:11.321 --> 00:38:12.523
So what are we looking for?

00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:13.791
What do you think
that is my vibe?

00:38:14.658 --> 00:38:15.859
I'll find it.

00:38:15.892 --> 00:38:18.529
You'll know it when you see it?
Well, we're running out.

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:20.264
How many did you do?

00:38:20.897 --> 00:38:22.299
Keep going.

00:38:22.332 --> 00:38:23.734
No.

00:38:23.767 --> 00:38:26.470
Why isn't that my vibe?
Why isn't that my vibe?

00:38:27.437 --> 00:38:29.139
I just think it's like too much
of a smile,

00:38:29.172 --> 00:38:30.674
it's too big of a smile.

00:38:30.707 --> 00:38:31.875
I'm a happy person.

00:38:31.908 --> 00:38:33.110
Are you?

00:38:33.143 --> 00:38:34.611
Yes.

00:38:34.644 --> 00:38:36.714
That is the vibe of the show,
we are having that much fun.

00:38:36.747 --> 00:38:37.915
Yes, that's fun, I like that.

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:39.383
That is me laughing at you.

00:38:39.416 --> 00:38:41.018
I like that more
than the other ones.

00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:42.753
Okay.

00:38:43.453 --> 00:38:44.988
No. I like that.

00:38:45.021 --> 00:38:46.557
That's the one, I like that
one the best so far.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.791
Yeah. I see like

00:38:47.824 --> 00:38:48.992
You Up with Nikki
Glaser on the side.

00:38:49.025 --> 00:38:51.495
Because that's fun,
it's also sexy, it's like ...

00:38:52.462 --> 00:38:54.165
I don't know,
I like that one.

00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:56.800
The way you say sexy
couldn't be said sexy ...

00:38:56.833 --> 00:38:58.168
Sexier less?

00:38:58.201 --> 00:38:59.770
Sexy less.
Yeah.

00:38:59.803 --> 00:39:01.038
Say it again.

00:39:01.071 --> 00:39:04.208
You look so sexy there.

00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:07.812
Ew, I can see food.

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:11.849
I can see it on your tongue,
it's like a film.

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:13.117
Yeah, I have ...

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:15.419
I learned to brush my tongue
though this year.

00:39:16.453 --> 00:39:17.721
That just got to you, that news?

00:39:17.754 --> 00:39:19.390
I had no idea.
Right.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.392
You brush your tongue?

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:25.162
Yeah. I do it if I want
my breath to smell extra fresh.

00:39:25.195 --> 00:39:27.231
I like that one and that one,
these are my choices.

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:28.599
What do you think?

00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:29.833
I like that one.

00:39:29.866 --> 00:39:31.769
So what do we need
to put them in?

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:34.505
We need one for reception,
we need podcast art,

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.707
and then we have to refresh
all our socials.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.975
Okay, okay.

00:39:38.008 --> 00:39:40.944
So I guess like three different
pictures out of these.

00:39:40.977 --> 00:39:44.715
Okay, so reception
I think should be this

00:39:44.748 --> 00:39:45.949
'cause who cares?

00:39:45.982 --> 00:39:47.718
Why don't I just look happy
and pretty,

00:39:47.751 --> 00:39:49.586
all my bosses
are walking around here,

00:39:49.619 --> 00:39:51.355
that's who's gonna see it.
Howard Stern might see this ...

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:52.623
Yeah.

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:53.857
And be like she seems ...

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.092
I like it. You look fit.

00:39:55.125 --> 00:39:56.493
This could be good for ...

00:39:56.526 --> 00:39:58.095
I honestly am trying
to think now

00:39:58.128 --> 00:39:59.997
what would Howard
Stern want for me?

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.999
Yes, let's do it that way.

00:40:02.032 --> 00:40:03.867
That one's strong.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.203
Wait, that one.
I think that one, that's it.

00:40:06.236 --> 00:40:07.604
That one's also good.
That's it.

00:40:07.637 --> 00:40:09.306
Yeah, I said that one.

00:40:09.339 --> 00:40:10.641
Okay, yes. That's the ...

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:12.409
I have a good eye,
believe it or not,

00:40:12.442 --> 00:40:14.344
I think I have a good eye.
That one's good.

00:40:14.377 --> 00:40:15.780
Yeah, this one. This one for ...

00:40:18.248 --> 00:40:19.449
Howard?

00:40:19.483 --> 00:40:25.890
For Howard, for our banner,
and then podcast is that one.

00:40:26.756 --> 00:40:28.459
And then what did we need
something else for?

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:29.726
Socials.

00:40:29.759 --> 00:40:34.098
Socials. I think that
for socials.

00:40:34.831 --> 00:40:36.033
Thank you.
Yay.

00:40:36.066 --> 00:40:37.634
Do you want it to be worse?

00:40:37.667 --> 00:40:40.304
Do you want me to like
really pick apart the picture?

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.508
Yeah, go hard, go hard on one.

00:40:44.541 --> 00:40:45.709
No way, I would never.

00:40:45.742 --> 00:40:46.944
Let's just do it.
Huh?

00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:48.545
Go hard on one.
Okay.

00:40:48.578 --> 00:40:50.047
Go hard on these.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.281
I can't.

00:40:51.314 --> 00:40:53.383
What's wrong with this?

00:40:53.416 --> 00:40:57.287
No, well first of all,
your thumb is in your belt loop.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.622
Yeah, that's cool,
that's a cool look.

00:40:58.655 --> 00:41:00.457
That means
I'm coming out with ...

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:01.758
How many people have you met

00:41:01.791 --> 00:41:03.928
ever that put their thumb
in their belt loop?

00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:05.829
So many models.

00:41:05.862 --> 00:41:07.030
That's a thing?

00:41:07.063 --> 00:41:09.066
That's a model pose,
I'll do it right now.

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:10.400
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:10.433 --> 00:41:11.635
It's a comfortable ...

00:41:11.668 --> 00:41:12.936
Oh, yeah?
You're gonna jump on this?

00:41:12.969 --> 00:41:14.204
This whole time
I've had it like this!

00:41:14.237 --> 00:41:15.472
No way.

00:41:15.505 --> 00:41:16.707
Yeah, she was that way
the whole time.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.075
Alright.
Okay.

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:20.844
Um, I don't know, I don't like
doing this. This is not ...

00:41:20.877 --> 00:41:22.412
Wait, what could you say
that's bad about this?

00:41:22.445 --> 00:41:23.647
There's nothing bad about it.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.549
I have every piece of confidence
in this piece of work.

00:41:25.582 --> 00:41:26.950
I think you look great.

00:41:26.983 --> 00:41:28.952
Okay. What's the issue with it?

00:41:28.985 --> 00:41:30.454
I don't wanna ... I don't know,
nothing.

00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:32.256
Just you say I don't want to,
it's not that you don't know.

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:33.490
What are you gonna say?

00:41:33.523 --> 00:41:35.158
No, no, no, no. I don't think
anything wrong with it.

00:41:35.191 --> 00:41:36.560
I'm asking you to be
the meanest you can be.

00:41:36.593 --> 00:41:37.828
No way, you don't want that.

00:41:37.861 --> 00:41:39.730
Well, don't be the meanest
but just be honest.

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:41.765
Okay ... I can't do it.

00:41:41.798 --> 00:41:43.000
Do it.

00:41:43.033 --> 00:41:46.403
Huh? I don't like ...

00:41:49.339 --> 00:41:51.408
I have like the tautest stomach,
there's no stomach issue

00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:52.676
that you could ever
find with me.

00:41:52.709 --> 00:41:53.911
There's no stomach issue,

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:55.779
the bellybutton's
kinda interesting.

00:41:55.812 --> 00:42:02.819
My bellybutton is awesome.
You can say whatever you want,

00:42:02.852 --> 00:42:05.556
you could have any opinion about
my bellybutton, it is awesome.

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:06.757
I think this is great.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:07.958
What's wrong
with my bellybutton?

00:42:07.991 --> 00:42:09.793
I don't know, nothing.
Let me see yours.

00:42:09.826 --> 00:42:12.229
I just feel like a bellybutton
coming just like

00:42:12.262 --> 00:42:13.897
showing the midriff
is just like ...

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:15.165
Too much.

00:42:15.198 --> 00:42:16.400
It's like a little much.

00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:17.668
Yeah, I agree with you
that it's too much.

00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:18.902
But my bellybutton is ...

00:42:18.935 --> 00:42:20.404
My belly would look
ridiculous if I was ...

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:21.638
right.

00:42:21.671 --> 00:42:23.807
It would just be hair
with skin coming over ...

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.309
Some people have
gross bellybuttons

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:26.610
and I'm not one of them.

00:42:26.643 --> 00:42:28.912
If I have anything,
I have gross so many things ...

00:42:28.945 --> 00:42:30.347
I think when it's just
a bellybutton.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.882
I think if it was like in a ...

00:42:31.915 --> 00:42:34.685
I'm not gonna zoom, this isn't
gonna be our Instagram square.

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:36.553
But this accentuates
the bellybutton ...

00:42:36.586 --> 00:42:39.289
because I see
so much bellybutton here

00:42:39.322 --> 00:42:40.724
because it's all ...

00:42:40.757 --> 00:42:41.959
It's that small,

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:43.860
wat am I supposed to do,
a half belly button?

00:42:43.893 --> 00:42:46.096
What're you supposed to do,
a crescent bellybutton?

00:42:46.129 --> 00:42:47.297
I'm gonna get a text later,

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.333
"What the fuck is wrong
with my bellybutton?"

00:42:49.366 --> 00:42:50.667
No, I'm not.
I know, I'm kidding.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.069
My bellybutton literally
is perfect.

00:42:52.102 --> 00:42:53.270
No, it's a nice bellybutton.

00:42:53.303 --> 00:42:55.205
I was just gonna say like
Andrew's probably not used

00:42:55.238 --> 00:42:57.407
to seeing your bellybutton
so he's like honed in on it

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.009
and that's what's making him
feel different.

00:42:59.042 --> 00:43:00.477
Yeah. And maybe
it's winter time.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.013
You look so good
in all of these.

00:43:03.046 --> 00:43:04.348
Thank you, Noa.

00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:06.016
I know that like you have
a different perspective

00:43:06.049 --> 00:43:07.217
but just ...

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.418
No, I appreciate you.

00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:10.554
But just like move over Taylor.

00:43:10.587 --> 00:43:13.490
Thank you.
Move over, Taylor Dane.

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:15.926
Taylor Ketchum?

00:43:16.459 --> 00:43:17.761
Is that who you were
talking about?

00:43:17.794 --> 00:43:22.099
No, I won't let it go.

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:24.067
Stare into it, stare into it.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.103
Oh, please don't, actually,
that really grosses me out.

00:43:26.136 --> 00:43:27.437
Maybe if I just zoom in on it,
zoom in on it.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:28.705
No, no, no, no.

00:43:28.738 --> 00:43:29.640
Maybe if it was
only bellybutton.

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:34.511
Good, I'm glad he doesn't know
how to do it.

00:43:34.544 --> 00:43:36.246
Andrew's learning computers.

00:43:38.148 --> 00:43:39.816
Remember this thing
in the middle here?

00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:41.518
Yeah, like the keyboard clit?

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:45.055
Oh, there we go. Now this ...

00:43:45.088 --> 00:43:46.790
Oh, dear God.

00:43:47.457 --> 00:43:49.159
See?

00:43:50.493 --> 00:43:52.663
I'm gonna send, go,
zoo in again.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:56.667
Just having a staring contest
with it.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.468
Ask people what it is.

00:43:58.501 --> 00:43:59.736
That's a good question.

00:43:59.769 --> 00:44:02.939
Like it's one of those things
if you zoom in close enough,

00:44:02.972 --> 00:44:07.244
it looks like a cave drawing.
Wait, hold on.

00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:10.447
People are gonna go,
you've gotta stitch that up.

00:44:11.614 --> 00:44:12.783
That needs stitches.

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:14.818
That looks like
your cavernous asshole.

00:44:14.851 --> 00:44:17.588
Yeah, that looks like your
asshole after a clean shave.

00:44:18.788 --> 00:44:20.357
That could be a poll
that we put up.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:21.558
Like they can't see the button.

00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:22.793
What is this?

00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:24.361
What is this? Yeah, what ...

00:44:24.394 --> 00:44:27.564
It looks like a dying kokopelli.
You know those kokopellis?

00:44:27.597 --> 00:44:29.299
It looks like an empty eyeball.

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:32.436
Yeah, it does.
It looks like a twig ...

00:44:34.003 --> 00:44:36.339
That looks like what my penis
looked like the other day

00:44:36.372 --> 00:44:38.075
when the doctor threw up.

00:44:44.247 --> 00:44:45.882
What? God.

00:44:45.915 --> 00:44:47.451
That's what your penis
looked like?

00:44:47.484 --> 00:44:51.021
Just a side of it.
Like on the balls area.

00:44:51.621 --> 00:44:55.692
Oh, God. I still have
the utmost confidence in it.

00:44:55.725 --> 00:44:57.828
But if you zoom in on anything
closely, it's gonna be bad.

00:44:59.362 --> 00:45:00.564
Yeah, I agree with that.

00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:01.798
Yeah.

00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:03.200
I'm with you on that.

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:06.303
Like even just a slight zoom in
on you makes it so much worse.

00:45:06.336 --> 00:45:08.238
Oh, if you saw
all my blackheads.

00:45:08.271 --> 00:45:09.773
Oh no, I just mean like
just a full face.

00:45:09.806 --> 00:45:11.007
Yeah, take a picture.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.310
Take a picture of my nose
right now, let's zoom in on it.

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:16.814
You'll probably see hair,
a black head, let's see.

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:20.317
Oh God.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.986
Hold on. Whoa. Whoa.

00:45:24.587 --> 00:45:25.856
Oh no.

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:29.526
There's a strawberry fields
forever.

00:45:30.426 --> 00:45:34.297
Dude, sorry, sorry.
Dude, that is so terrible.

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:36.867
I mean, all of our faces
would look like this.

00:45:37.567 --> 00:45:39.903
What would you rather?

00:45:39.936 --> 00:45:41.138
Dude, what is that?

00:45:41.171 --> 00:45:42.405
That's you, dude.

00:45:42.438 --> 00:45:44.141
Oh my God.

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:46.643
That is you.

00:45:46.676 --> 00:45:47.911
No, just zooming.

00:45:47.944 --> 00:45:49.112
That ... humiliating.

00:45:49.145 --> 00:46:01.825
You asked for that,
why would you ask for that?

00:46:01.858 --> 00:46:03.426
That's the best.

00:46:03.459 --> 00:46:05.362
The fact that you let us do that
to you was really nice of you.

00:46:05.395 --> 00:46:06.596
Thank you.

00:46:06.629 --> 00:46:09.566
Yeah, it was quite a sacrifice.
And it was well worth,

00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:12.836
I mean, I'm going to use
that zoom in of your face

00:46:12.869 --> 00:46:14.571
for so many different
purposes.
