00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.200
The moon has a lot of looks.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.609
And each one happens for a reason.

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.710
It takes the moon about 29 and a half days
to orbit around the Earth.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.790
And during this time, the sun illuminates
the moon from varying angles which creates

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.610
a shadow effect that we see here on Earth.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.910
At the start of each lunar cycle, the moon
is between the earth and the sun.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.400
This is called a “New Moon”.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.970
The side of the moon visible from Earth is
not illuminated and therefore we can’t see

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.970
it.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.570
As the angle between the Moon and the Sun
increases, so does the amount of moon we’re

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.140
able to see.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.090
After the new moon, it enters the waxing crescent
phase where we can see 1 to 49% of the moon.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.609
When it reaches 50% illumination, it becomes
a first quarter moon, which is kinda confusing

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.480
but we’ll roll with it.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.250
Next is the waxing Gibbous phase, which means
we can see about half to almost all of the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.250
moon.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.579
And finally… we get to see the big cheese.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:05.900
We get one glorious night of full moon and
then the illumination starts to fade.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.970
After a full moon, we see the waning phase
which is the opposite of waxing.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.610
The moon follows the same illumination pattern
just flipped with the final phase being the

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.180
waning crescent.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.480
Then it starts all over again with the new
moon!

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.159
The way you see the moon depends on where
you are on the globe.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.950
If you’re in the Northern Hemisphere, a
waxing moon will be illuminated on the right

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.430
side while a waning moon will be illuminated
on the left.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.810
It’s the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.409
So now you know, the next time you see a waxing
moon, a full moon is right around corner.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.770
You can catch new episodes of Space Crafts
every Wednesday!

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.100
In this episode, we'll explain what happens
when the Sun explodes and the potential fallout

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.149
for Earth.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.040
