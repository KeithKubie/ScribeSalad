In the Greek nomenclature or naming system, tri means 3. Tetra means 4. Hexa

00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:12.714
means 6. And of course, octo means 8. So an organism with 8 copies of every

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:16.586
chromosome, like strawberries, has more DNA than

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:20.736
if it were triploid, tetraploid, or hexaploid. This

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:23.116
means that strawberries have 4 times as

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:26.068
many copies of their chromosomes than humans do.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:29.816
That's a lot of copies. It makes strawberries

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:33.890
polyploid and a great selection for our DNA extraction.
