00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:01.802
Male voice: What I want
to do in this video

00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:03.868
is explore what the actual basket of goods

00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:06.138
looks like for the consumer price index.

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.735
We had a ridiculously simple
example in the last video.

00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:10.867
Right over here, this is a
table I got, this is from

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:13.537
a press release issued by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.

00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:17.474
If you do a search for a CPI or a CPI-U

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:19.984
in Bureau of Labor
Statistics, you should find

00:00:19.984 --> 00:00:22.447
the press release where
they issue the CPI.

00:00:22.447 --> 00:00:25.028
This is the first table
in that press release.

00:00:25.028 --> 00:00:27.140
They say the Consumer
Price Index for all urban

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.130
consumers, and just
like we talked about in

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.136
the last video, when people
talk about the CPI Index,

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:33.938
they're really talking about, or they tend

00:00:33.938 --> 00:00:37.169
to be talking about, the
CPI-U. The CPI for urban

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:40.202
consumers because most consumers
fall under this category.

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:42.538
U.S. city average by expenditure category

00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:44.069
and commodity and service group.

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:45.806
Then they define their base year.

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:48.400
The base year, actually they have a range,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.281
maybe I guess they take an
average between 1982 and 1984.

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:55.283
They say that is 100
unless otherwise noted.

00:00:55.283 --> 00:00:56.697
What they do in this first column,

00:00:56.697 --> 00:00:58.611
so these are the different
buckets that people

00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:01.136
spend, that the urban consumer might spend

00:01:01.136 --> 00:01:03.285
some of their money on. This is saying

00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:05.402
the basket of goods
we're giving a weighting.

00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:08.734
About a little under 15% is spent on food

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.557
and beverages. Then they
break down that 15%,

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:14.470
so 13% is on food and then
they even break it out

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.473
between 7% or a little
under 8% is food at home.

00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:19.805
Then they break it out
between cereals, meats,

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:21.742
dairy and related products,
fruits and vegetables.

00:01:21.742 --> 00:01:24.121
The average, based on
the way the basket looks,

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:25.954
it looks like they're
spending about the same amount

00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:28.203
on fruits and vegetables
as they're spending

00:01:28.203 --> 00:01:32.336
on alcohol. They're spending
significantly less on ...

00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:34.808
Well, I don't know if
that's a good trend right

00:01:34.808 --> 00:01:37.624
over there, but that's why
this is interesting to look at,

00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:39.946
because this is viewed as a typical basket

00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:43.100
of goods for your average urban consumer.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.035
You can see they're
spending a little bit more

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:46.838
on meats, poultry and fish.
You can see the breakdown.

00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:48.369
Then you could keep breaking it down.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.210
They're spending 41%, the basket of goods,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.069
on housing, and they even
break that up in terms

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.871
of some of it is your
primary, some of it is your

00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:00.074
general shelter, then there's stuff like

00:02:00.074 --> 00:02:03.619
fuels and utilities.
That's encapsulated in

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.544
your housing, you're going
to have to heat your home

00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:08.866
and whatever else. Then
your furniture, 4% or 4.4%

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:11.009
is spent on furniture.
We could keep going down.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.334
This is pretty interesting to look at.

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:15.074
The basket of goods, so this
is viewed as the typical

00:02:15.074 --> 00:02:19.030
urban consumer spending 3.6% on apparel,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.412
17% on transportation,
6.6% on medical care,

00:02:24.412 --> 00:02:26.545
and almost a similar amount on recreation.

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:28.801
A similar amount on
education. They keep breaking

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:32.473
it down into all of the
different categories.

00:02:32.473 --> 00:02:35.297
A little under 1% on tobacco
and smoking products.

00:02:35.297 --> 00:02:37.537
You might say,"Wait,
most people these days

00:02:37.537 --> 00:02:39.409
"in the U.S. don't smoke,
but the ones who do

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.483
"spend way more than
this." This is an average

00:02:41.483 --> 00:02:45.666
of all of the people in the United States.

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:48.882
For example, if one
out of ten people spent

00:02:48.882 --> 00:02:51.402
10% of their income on
tobacco and the other

00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:52.997
people don't smoke at
all, then you might get

00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:57.070
on average, the average
basket of goods, is about 1%.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.135
They keep breaking it
down into other things.

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:02.893
All of these weightings
combined, they will

00:03:02.893 --> 00:03:08.721
add to 100. That is the
entire basket of goods.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.952
Now what they do, this is their weighting.

00:03:11.952 --> 00:03:13.662
This column right over
here essentially gives

00:03:13.662 --> 00:03:16.217
us the weighting as of December 2010.

00:03:16.217 --> 00:03:19.215
That's going to change as
people's habits change,

00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:21.332
or as new goods and services
emerge on the market,

00:03:21.332 --> 00:03:23.983
or frankly even as prices
change, that will change.

00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:25.794
But you have to some weighting in which

00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:28.456
to take a weight of the price changes,

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:31.928
or to weight the average percent changes.

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:35.987
They told us that unless otherwise noted,

00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:37.937
our base year is going to be 100.

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:40.653
Relative to that base
year, they then give us

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.930
the prices, the price indices for each

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.871
of these buckets in
November 2011, and then

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:48.521
December 2011. Then
they're going to actually

00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:51.270
figure out the unadjusted percent change

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.052
to December 2011 from.
This is year over year,

00:03:55.052 --> 00:03:57.192
from December of the
previous year, and this

00:03:57.192 --> 00:03:59.723
is from the previous month. You can see

00:03:59.723 --> 00:04:01.388
the change from the previous year is much

00:04:01.388 --> 00:04:04.119
larger than the change
from the previous month.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.457
One way to look at this, this is saying

00:04:06.457 --> 00:04:13.720
in November 2011, food
and beverages, on average,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.339
were about 2.3 times more
expensive than they were

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:23.097
between 1982 and 1984.
December 2012, sorry,

00:04:23.097 --> 00:04:27.787
December 2011, they were about 2.31 times

00:04:27.787 --> 00:04:32.020
more expensive than
they were in 1982-1984.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.910
Just as an extra kind of data point, they

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.719
actually give us this
one little line here.

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:40.468
If we set 1967 as the
base year, then all items,

00:04:40.468 --> 00:04:45.385
if we use the default
base year of 1982-1984,

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:49.186
in November 2011 all items
were about 2.26 times

00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:52.316
as expensive as they were in 1982-1984.

00:04:52.316 --> 00:04:54.455
But if we use 1967 as our base year,

00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:59.123
now it's 6.77 times as expensive.

00:04:59.123 --> 00:05:01.126
Remember, the base year is equal to 100.

00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:04.455
This is 6.77 times as
expensive as they were

00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:09.605
in 1967. You could go
down all of the categories

00:05:09.605 --> 00:05:11.616
to essentially see these are all relative

00:05:11.616 --> 00:05:14.651
to 1982-1984, so you
can see how much things

00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:16.352
have gotten more expensive.
It's interesting.

00:05:16.352 --> 00:05:20.016
Things like furniture
have not gotten that much

00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:22.515
more expensive relative to the early '80s.

00:05:22.515 --> 00:05:24.266
In fact, there are some
categories that have even

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:28.123
gotten cheaper. For example,
new and used motor vehicles.

00:05:28.123 --> 00:05:31.253
It hasn't changed much at
all since, based on at least

00:05:31.253 --> 00:05:33.732
this weighting, and they
do all these adjustments

00:05:33.732 --> 00:05:35.509
based on the quality of
the car. You might say,

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:37.853
"Wait, I'm spending more on
my car than I did in 1982,"

00:05:37.853 --> 00:05:39.733
but they're making
adjustments based on your car

00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:41.263
being that much better and all of that.

00:05:41.263 --> 00:05:44.433
It's not exactly an apples
to apples comparison.

00:05:44.433 --> 00:05:47.268
But you could see that
based on those adjustments,

00:05:47.268 --> 00:05:48.682
it doesn't look like it's changed much.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.188
Things like medical care have gotten a lot

00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:53.583
more expensive since the
early '80s; four times

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:56.052
as expensive, you see right over there.

00:05:56.052 --> 00:05:58.399
Video and audio has gotten cheaper.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.058
Recreation in general
has not gotten that much

00:06:01.058 --> 00:06:03.350
more expensive.
Information and information

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.517
processing has gotten cheaper. Telephone

00:06:06.517 --> 00:06:08.625
service has not gotten
that much more expensive.

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:10.186
Communication has gotten cheaper.

00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:12.321
I don't know if you were
around in the early '80s,

00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:14.718
but actually the cost to
call someone long distance

00:06:14.718 --> 00:06:17.682
has gone down dramatically.
Even, see, personal

00:06:17.682 --> 00:06:19.982
computers, they have gotten cheaper.

00:06:19.982 --> 00:06:22.991
Once again, like the cars,
there's an adjustment

00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:25.915
for essentially ... They
don't do it directly

00:06:25.915 --> 00:06:27.604
because obviously computers have gotten

00:06:27.604 --> 00:06:28.920
orders of magnitude more powerful,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.607
but they have gotten on cheaper average,

00:06:32.607 --> 00:06:36.123
and they have gotten
much, much more powerful.

00:06:36.123 --> 00:06:38.061
This is fun to look at.
You can see, looking

00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:40.590
right over here. Tobacco
and smoking products

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.857
have become dramatically more expensive.

00:06:42.857 --> 00:06:44.786
You have more and more
jurisdictions that are,

00:06:44.786 --> 00:06:47.452
for the most part, taxing it or whatever.

00:06:47.452 --> 00:06:49.119
They're making it harder
and harder to buy.

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:50.794
You see things like ...
It's just fun to look at.

00:06:50.794 --> 00:06:53.187
Dig around here. Medical, oh, we already

00:06:53.187 --> 00:06:54.769
looked at this. This is
the overview services,

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:57.826
durables. A lot of
these things are in this

00:06:57.826 --> 00:07:00.057
one to two to three price range.

00:07:00.057 --> 00:07:03.403
The stuff like medicine,
tobacco, much more expensive.

00:07:03.403 --> 00:07:05.689
Things like computers,
communications, much cheaper.

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:08.599
Then as we mentioned before, this measures

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:12.672
the percent change to December
2011 from the previous year.

00:07:12.672 --> 00:07:14.387
That's why it gives you
a year over year number.

00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:17.101
This is from the previous month.

00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:19.267
These are seasonally adjusted changes.

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:21.017
If we have time in another
video, I'll talk about

00:07:21.017 --> 00:07:23.385
how you can calculate, or I'll do a simple

00:07:23.385 --> 00:07:26.867
example, of seasonally adjusting things.
