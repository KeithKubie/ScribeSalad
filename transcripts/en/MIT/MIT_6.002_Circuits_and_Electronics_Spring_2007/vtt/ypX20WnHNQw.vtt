00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.552
All right.
Good morning,

00:00:03.552 --> 00:00:08.341
all.
So we take another big step

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:16.837
forward today and get onto a new
plane of understanding,

00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:23.016
if you will.
In the last week and a half,

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:31.512
our focus was on the storage
element or storage elements

00:00:31.512 --> 00:00:40.933
called inductors and capacitors.
And capacitors stored change

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:46.380
and inductors essentially stored
energy in the field,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.304
the magnetic flux.
And the state variable for an

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:57.380
inductor was the current while
that for a capacitor was the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.166
capacitor voltage.
We also looked at circuits

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:06.416
containing a single storage
element, we looked at RC

00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:11.250
circuits and we also looked at
circuits containing a single

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.500
inductor.
And this was a single inductor

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.416
with a resistor and a current
source or a voltage source and

00:01:19.416 --> 00:01:22.333
so on.
What we are going to do today

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:27.000
is do what are called
"second-order systems".

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.622
So they are on the next plane
now.

00:01:38.622 --> 00:01:43.390
And with this second-order of
systems, they are characterized

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.761
by circuits containing two
independent storage elements.

00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:52.450
They could be an inductor and a
capacitor or two independent

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.549
capacitors.
And you will see towards the

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.000
end what I mean by two
independent capacitors.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.033
If I have two capacitors in
parallel, they can be

00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:06.257
represented as a single
equivalent capacitor so that

00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:08.911
doesn't count.
It has to be two independent

00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.451
energy storage elements and
resistors and voltage sources

00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.916
and so on.
And what we end up getting is

00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:17.318
what is called "second-order
dynamics".

00:02:17.318 --> 00:02:20.731
And much as first order
circuits were represented using

00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:24.207
first order differential
equations, this kind you end up

00:02:24.207 --> 00:02:28.000
getting second-order
differential equations.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.410
Before we go into this,
I would like to start

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.372
motivating this and give you one
example of why this is important

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:38.232
to study.
There are many,

00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:41.100
many examples but I will give
you one.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.829
What I would like to do is draw
your attention to our good old

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.465
inverter driving a second
inverter.

00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:52.496
The same circuit that we used
to motivate RC studies,

00:02:52.496 --> 00:02:58.000
one inverter driving another.
So let me draw the circuit.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.600
Here is one inverter.
This is, let's say,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.546
5 volts and this is,
let's say, 2 kilo ohms.

00:03:15.546 --> 00:03:21.527
And I connect the output of
this inverter to a second

00:03:21.527 --> 00:03:26.127
inverter.
And what we saw in the last few

00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:32.223
lectures was that in this
specific example there was a

00:03:32.223 --> 00:03:38.319
parasitic capacitor or a
capacitor associated with the

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.545
gate of this MOSFET.
And that could be modeled by

00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:49.818
sticking a capacitor CGS between
the gate of the MOSFET and

00:03:49.818 --> 00:03:53.090
ground.
And we saw that the waveforms

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.000
here, if I had some kind of step
here.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.171
Let's say, for example,
a step that went from high to

00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:03.737
low.
Then out here I would have a

00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:08.390
transition that instead of going
up rapidly like this would

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.197
transition a little bit more
slowly.

00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:15.208
And this transition was
characterized by an RC time

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:18.417
constant.
And this is what gave rise to a

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:22.508
delay in the eventual output.
So that is what we saw

00:04:22.508 --> 00:04:27.000
previously, single energy
storage element.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.573
Today what we are going to do
is we are going to look at the

00:04:31.573 --> 00:04:34.364
same circuit,
the exact same circuit,

00:04:34.364 --> 00:04:38.472
and have some fun with it.
What we are going to say is

00:04:38.472 --> 00:04:43.201
look, this thing is pretty slow,
so what I would like to do is

00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:47.000
-- why don't we go ahead and put
that up.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
What we are going to see is
that the yellow waveform is the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.293
waveform at the input here.
And the green waveform here is

00:05:06.293 --> 00:05:09.198
the waveform at this
intermediate node.

00:05:09.198 --> 00:05:13.556
And notice that this waveform
here is characterized by the

00:05:13.556 --> 00:05:17.685
slowly rising characteristics
that are typical of an RC

00:05:17.685 --> 00:05:19.825
circuit.
There are some other

00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:24.183
weirdnesses and so on going on
here like a little bump and

00:05:24.183 --> 00:05:27.700
stuff like that.
You can ignore all of that for

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.208
now.
It happens because of certain

00:05:31.208 --> 00:05:35.015
other very subtle circuit
effects that you won't be

00:05:35.015 --> 00:05:38.365
dealing with,
called Miller effects and so on

00:05:38.365 --> 00:05:41.335
that you won't be dealing with
in 6.002.

00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:43.695
So focus then on this part
here.

00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:46.893
It is pretty slow.
And because of that slow

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:51.157
rising, I get a very slow
transition and I get some delay

00:05:51.157 --> 00:05:53.593
in my inverter.
So you say ah-ha,

00:05:53.593 --> 00:05:59.000
we learned about this in 6.002,
I can make it go faster.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.359
How can you make the circuit go
faster?

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:06.338
What could you do?
This is rising very slowly.

00:06:06.338 --> 00:06:09.698
How can you make it go faster?
Anybody?

00:06:09.698 --> 00:06:12.792
You have multiple choices,
actually.

00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:15.798
What are your choices here?
Pardon.

00:06:15.798 --> 00:06:20.838
Decrease the time constant.
And how would you decrease the

00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:24.817
time constant?
The capacitance is connected to

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:30.123
this MOSFET gate here.
I didn't want it in the first

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:32.979
place but it is there,
I cannot help it,

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.322
so I can decrease the
resistance.

00:06:35.322 --> 00:06:37.739
Good.
Let me go ahead and do that.

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:42.279
What I will do is I am going to
knock this sucker out and stick

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:46.233
in a new resistance that is say
50 ohms, a much smaller

00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:49.089
resistance.
That should speed things up,

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:51.798
right?
That should make things go much

00:06:51.798 --> 00:06:56.045
faster because this is a smaller
time constant because R is

00:06:56.045 --> 00:07:00.000
smaller, correct?
OK, let's go do it.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.149
And let's see if we get what we
expect.

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:07.292
I have a little switch here.
And using that switch,

00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:11.104
I am going to switch in this
little resistance.

00:07:11.104 --> 00:07:14.585
Whoa, what on earth is
happening out there?

00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:18.646
This is so much fun.
What I did is I switched in a

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:22.707
small resister here to decrease
the time constant,

00:07:22.707 --> 00:07:27.845
but it looks like I got a whole
bunch of crapola that I did not

00:07:27.845 --> 00:07:32.153
bargain for.
This is certainly very fast,

00:07:32.153 --> 00:07:36.153
it goes up really fast,
but I am not sure where it is

00:07:36.153 --> 00:07:39.384
going, though.
Let's stare at that a little

00:07:39.384 --> 00:07:42.538
while longer.
Let me expand the time scale

00:07:42.538 --> 00:07:44.153
for you.
Look at this.

00:07:44.153 --> 00:07:47.692
Instead of a nice little smooth
thing going up.

00:07:47.692 --> 00:07:50.461
I get something that looks like
this.

00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:53.076
It looks something like a
sinusoid.

00:07:53.076 --> 00:07:56.923
It looks sinusoidal,
but then it is a sinusoid that

00:07:56.923 --> 00:08:01.153
kind of gives up and kind of
gets tired and kind of goes

00:08:01.153 --> 00:08:03.561
away.
Right?

00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:07.677
It kind of dies out.
So nothing that you have

00:08:07.677 --> 00:08:11.419
learned so far has prepared you
for this.

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:15.441
And, trust me,
when I first did some circuit

00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:20.212
designs myself a long,
long time ago I got nailed by

00:08:20.212 --> 00:08:22.832
that.
I looked at my circuit,

00:08:22.832 --> 00:08:28.725
and what ended up happening was
I was noticing these sharp lines

00:08:28.725 --> 00:08:33.603
at all my transitions.
When I looked at my scope,

00:08:33.603 --> 00:08:37.118
I expected to see nice little
square waves but I saw these

00:08:37.118 --> 00:08:39.400
little nasty spikes sitting out
there.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.052
And then when I stared at it
more carefully,

00:08:42.052 --> 00:08:45.506
those spikes were really
sinusoids that seemed to kind of

00:08:45.506 --> 00:08:48.528
get tired and kind of go away.
So those are nasty,

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.180
those are real and they happen
all the time.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.387
And what we will do today is
try to get into that and

00:08:54.387 --> 00:08:57.903
understand why that is the case.
We will understand how to

00:08:57.903 --> 00:09:02.327
design that away.
And that is a real problem,

00:09:02.327 --> 00:09:05.775
by the way.
And the reason that is a real

00:09:05.775 --> 00:09:09.051
problem is the following.
Look at this.

00:09:09.051 --> 00:09:12.500
Look down here.
Because this intermediate

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.896
voltage is meandering all over
the countryside here,

00:09:16.896 --> 00:09:21.982
at this particular point the
intermediate voltage dips quite

00:09:21.982 --> 00:09:24.827
low.
And because it dips quite low

00:09:24.827 --> 00:09:30.000
look at the output.
The output has a bump here.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.885
And it is quite possible for
this output bump to now go into

00:09:33.885 --> 00:09:35.860
the forbidden region.
Or worse.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.746
If this swing here was higher,
this could have actually gone

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:43.500
onto a one, so I would have
gotten a false one pulse here.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.595
Instead of having a nice one to
zero transition,

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:49.887
I would have gotten a one to
zero, oh, back to one,

00:09:49.887 --> 00:09:52.719
oh, back to zero and then back
down to zero.

00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:57.000
So this is nasty stuff,
really, really nasty stuff.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.350
What we will do is understand
why that is the case today and

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.409
see if we can explain it.
What is going on here?

00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:14.652
What is really going on here is
take a look at this circuit

00:10:14.652 --> 00:10:18.527
here.
I will take a look at this path

00:10:18.527 --> 00:10:21.864
here.
So this is your VS voltage

00:10:21.864 --> 00:10:25.954
source.
Path kind of goes like this and

00:10:25.954 --> 00:10:30.408
around.
It turns out that this circuit

00:10:30.408 --> 00:10:34.100
is a loop here.
And when there is current flow,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.837
going down to basic physics you
remember that I also enclose

00:10:38.837 --> 00:10:42.128
some amount.
So there is a current flowing

00:10:42.128 --> 00:10:45.419
in a loop.
And because of that there is an

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:48.550
effective inductance here.
And, in fact,

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.965
any current flowing through a
wire above a ground plane,

00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:56.417
for that matter,
can be characterized by the

00:10:56.417 --> 00:10:59.788
inductance.
So I can model that by sticking

00:10:59.788 --> 00:11:04.573
a little inductor here.
So my real circuit is not

00:11:04.573 --> 00:11:07.972
exactly a resistor and a
capacitor, but my real circuit

00:11:07.972 --> 00:11:11.622
is an inductor as well that
comes into play because of this

00:11:11.622 --> 00:11:13.636
wire.
Every wire, when there is a

00:11:13.636 --> 00:11:16.216
current flow,
has an inductance associated

00:11:16.216 --> 00:11:18.482
with it.
And because of that the real

00:11:18.482 --> 00:11:21.188
circuit is resistor,
inductor and capacitor.

00:11:21.188 --> 00:11:23.769
So I end up with two storage
elements now,

00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:27.482
and the dynamics of that are
very different from that with a

00:11:27.482 --> 00:11:32.074
single storage element.
That is just a bit of

00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:37.407
motivation for why our study of
inductors is important.

00:11:37.407 --> 00:11:40.864
And I can draw a quick circuit
here.

00:11:40.864 --> 00:11:45.308
If you look at the circuit,
start from ground,

00:11:45.308 --> 00:11:49.555
the voltage VS and there is a
resistor here.

00:11:49.555 --> 00:11:54.987
And then I have an inductor and
then I have a capacitor.

00:11:54.987 --> 00:11:59.728
So it is a voltage source,
resistor, inductor and

00:11:59.728 --> 00:12:04.080
capacitor.
For this whole week we will be

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.172
looking at circuits like this.
Today what I would like to do

00:12:08.172 --> 00:12:11.223
is start very simple,
start with the simplest

00:12:11.223 --> 00:12:15.315
possible form of this so that
you can begin building up your

00:12:15.315 --> 00:12:18.574
insight and then go into more
complicated cases.

00:12:18.574 --> 00:12:22.805
Today what I will do is simply
begin with a case where I don't

00:12:22.805 --> 00:12:26.550
have a resistor here and simply
study a voltage source,

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.572
an inductor and a capacitor and
understand what the voltage

00:12:30.572 --> 00:12:35.649
looks like out here.
So we look at the dynamics of a

00:12:35.649 --> 00:12:39.068
little system like this.
Before we go on,

00:12:39.068 --> 00:12:42.230
I want to caution you about
something.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.760
It is just happenstance that I
have introduced for you

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.290
capacitors based on the
parasitic capacitance here and

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.709
inductance based on parasitic
inductance.

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:59.752
I would hate to leave you with
the impression that inductors

00:12:59.752 --> 00:13:04.261
and capacitors are "bad".
Because when you think of a

00:13:04.261 --> 00:13:05.662
parasitic, you know,
parasites.

00:13:05.662 --> 00:13:07.951
These are parasitic.
You didn't expect them there,

00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:10.427
didn't expect this here and we
got the weird behavior.

00:13:10.427 --> 00:13:12.482
So parasitics have a bad
connotation to them.

00:13:12.482 --> 00:13:15.378
I do not want to leave you with
a bad taste in your mouth about

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.948
capacitors and inductors that
these are just bad things.

00:13:17.948 --> 00:13:20.564
We just have to deal with them
and deal with second-order

00:13:20.564 --> 00:13:23.413
differential equations and all
that stuff because they're just

00:13:23.413 --> 00:13:25.468
bad stuff and we just have to
deal with them.

00:13:25.468 --> 00:13:27.851
I don't want you to end up
going through life hating

00:13:27.851 --> 00:13:31.795
capacitors and inductors.
Just because of my choice of

00:13:31.795 --> 00:13:35.835
examples, it just happened to be
introducing them as capacitors.

00:13:35.835 --> 00:13:39.747
I want to point out that these
are fundamental lumped elements

00:13:39.747 --> 00:13:41.863
in their own right.
They are very,

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:45.519
incredibly important and useful
circuits where we designed

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:49.494
capacitors and inductors because
we want to have them in there.

00:13:49.494 --> 00:13:53.278
There are many circuits that we
will look at where we really

00:13:53.278 --> 00:13:56.869
want the inductor in there.
We will design an inductor by

00:13:56.869 --> 00:14:00.717
wrapping wire around in a coil
and get bigger inductances and

00:14:00.717 --> 00:14:04.434
so.
Just remember that this can be

00:14:04.434 --> 00:14:08.655
parasitic in some cases,
but in many cases it's good,

00:14:08.655 --> 00:14:12.063
inductors are good,
so just stick with that

00:14:12.063 --> 00:14:15.147
thought.
These are mostly good so don't

00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:17.744
go around hating them.
All right.

00:14:17.744 --> 00:14:21.721
Let's go on and analyze a basic
circuit like this.

00:14:21.721 --> 00:14:26.104
And what I would like to cover
in the next hour are the

00:14:26.104 --> 00:14:30.000
foundations of something like
that.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.555
I will take you through the
foundations so you understand

00:14:33.555 --> 00:14:35.333
how it works.
And, as always,

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:39.015
what I am going to end up with
is build up the foundations,

00:14:39.015 --> 00:14:42.888
help you understand why we got
where we were and then help you

00:14:42.888 --> 00:14:45.619
build intuition.
And then show you a really,

00:14:45.619 --> 00:14:49.301
really simple intuitive way of
doing things in terms of how

00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:52.031
experts do it.
And the real cool thing about

00:14:52.031 --> 00:14:55.650
EECS is that the way experts do
things, things are really,

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:59.396
really very simple in the end.
But you need to build up some

00:14:59.396 --> 00:15:04.481
intuition to get there.
So our circuit looks like this

00:15:04.481 --> 00:15:07.375
in terms of my two storage
elements.

00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:11.428
I have a voltage vI,
inductor L, capacitor C and I

00:15:11.428 --> 00:15:16.225
am going to look at the voltage
across the capacitor and my

00:15:16.225 --> 00:15:21.105
current through the capacitor.
So v(t) is the voltage across

00:15:21.105 --> 00:15:26.067
the capacitor and my current is
the current through this loop

00:15:26.067 --> 00:15:31.195
here, which is the same as the
current through the capacitor or

00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:35.000
the current through the
inductor.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.337
And we are going to proceed in
exactly the same manner as we

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:41.843
did for first order differential
equations, write the equations

00:15:41.843 --> 00:15:43.880
down and just boom,
boom, boom, boom,

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.047
go down the same sets of steps
but just get to some place

00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:48.970
different.
We are going to start by

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.346
writing a node equation for this
node here.

00:15:51.346 --> 00:15:54.513
That's the only node for which
I have an unknown voltage.

00:15:54.513 --> 00:15:56.945
The node here is vI,
so I need to find this,

00:15:56.945 --> 00:16:00.000
there's just one unknown node
voltage.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.411
And I am going to need some
element laws.

00:16:04.411 --> 00:16:11.139
For the capacitor I know the iV
relation is given by the i for

00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:17.095
the capacitor is Cdv/dt.
And just to show the capacitor

00:16:17.095 --> 00:16:23.161
I am just calling it dvc/dt.
Similarly, for an inductor,

00:16:23.161 --> 00:16:30.000
L, the voltage across the
inductor is given by Ldi/dt.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.385
So this is the vI relation for
the capacitor,

00:16:34.385 --> 00:16:37.475
the vI relation for an
inductor.

00:16:37.475 --> 00:16:42.458
It also suits us to write this
in an integral form.

00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:48.737
So if I integrate both sides of
this equation and I bring L down

00:16:48.737 --> 00:16:53.122
to this side,
I end up getting something like

00:16:53.122 --> 00:17:00.000
this, 1/L minus infinity to t,
VLdt, and that is simply iL.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.608
I am just simply replacing this
with an integral form.

00:17:04.608 --> 00:17:09.826
So this is a VI relationship
for the inductor and this is for

00:17:09.826 --> 00:17:13.304
the capacitor.
So let me now go ahead and

00:17:13.304 --> 00:17:16.869
apply the node method for my
circuit here.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:21.652
Here, for the node method,
I have to equate the currents

00:17:21.652 --> 00:17:26.869
coming into the node or sum the
currents coming into the node

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:32.405
and equate that to zero.
And while I do that I simply

00:17:32.405 --> 00:17:37.474
replace the currents by the
corresponding voltages using the

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:40.052
element laws.
So what do I get?

00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:45.379
I get the current going in here
to the inductor is equal to the

00:17:45.379 --> 00:17:48.386
current going through the
capacitor.

00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:51.737
What is the current going the
capacitor?

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:55.431
In terms of its v relationship
it is Cdv/dt.

00:17:55.431 --> 00:17:59.985
And the current going to the
inductor is given by this

00:17:59.985 --> 00:18:03.336
relation here,
which is simply 1/L minus

00:18:03.336 --> 00:18:08.267
infinity to t.
The voltage across the

00:18:08.267 --> 00:18:14.141
capacitor is simply (vI-v)dt.
I have just written down the

00:18:14.141 --> 00:18:17.541
node quotation for this node
here.

00:18:17.541 --> 00:18:23.931
Now I will just apply a bit of
math and simplify it and get the

00:18:23.931 --> 00:18:28.259
resulting equation.
What I can do is simply

00:18:28.259 --> 00:18:33.000
differentiate with respect to t
here.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:41.099
And get this to be Cd^2v/dt^2,
the second derivative of v.

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:47.210
And here what I end up getting
is 1/L(vI-v).

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:54.742
So I just differentiated the
whole thing by d/dt here.

00:18:54.742 --> 00:19:02.773
And then I just move L up here.
I bring d^2v/dt^2 out here.

00:19:02.773 --> 00:19:08.527
And then I get a minus v here,
and that will be equal to,

00:19:08.527 --> 00:19:12.328
oh, I'm sorry.
Let me leave this here.

00:19:12.328 --> 00:19:18.493
Bring the minus v to this side
so it becomes a plus and leave

00:19:18.493 --> 00:19:22.089
vI on this side.
So I end up getting

00:19:22.089 --> 00:19:25.171
LCd^2v/dt^2.
I bring L up here.

00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:30.000
And then I take v to the other
side.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.111
Plus v and leave vI here so I
get vI.

00:19:33.111 --> 00:19:37.086
That is second order
differential equation that

00:19:37.086 --> 00:19:40.975
governs the characteristics of
the voltage, v.

00:19:40.975 --> 00:19:45.641
So much as the voltage across
the capacitor was a state

00:19:45.641 --> 00:19:51.000
variable in our RC circuits or
the current through the inductor

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.925
was a state variable in our RL
circuits, out here both the

00:19:55.925 --> 00:20:01.456
current through the inductor and
the voltage across the capacitor

00:20:01.456 --> 00:20:06.432
are my two state variables.
And so here I have a

00:20:06.432 --> 00:20:09.154
second-order equation in my
voltage, v.

00:20:09.154 --> 00:20:12.091
Again, going through the
foundations here,

00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:15.243
I am now going to go through a
bunch of math.

00:20:15.243 --> 00:20:18.968
Up to here it was circuit
analysis, and now I am just

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:22.048
going to do math.
For the next three or four

00:20:22.048 --> 00:20:25.845
blackboards just math.
You can solve this second-order

00:20:25.845 --> 00:20:30.000
differential equation any which
way you want.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.189
But just to keep things as
simple as possible,

00:20:33.189 --> 00:20:36.521
in 6.002 I solve all the
differential equations,

00:20:36.521 --> 00:20:40.136
it turns out we are fortunate
enough we can do that,

00:20:40.136 --> 00:20:43.893
using the exact same method
again and again and again,

00:20:43.893 --> 00:20:48.075
the same thing can be applied.
And the method that we use to

00:20:48.075 --> 00:20:51.620
solve it is the method of
homogenous and particular

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.455
solutions.
So the first step we are going

00:20:54.455 --> 00:20:58.000
to find the particular solution,
vP.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.212
Second step we find the
homogenous solution,

00:21:03.212 --> 00:21:07.333
vH.
And the third step we are going

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:14.121
to find the total solution as
the sum of, v is simply the

00:21:14.121 --> 00:21:21.030
particular plus the homogenous
solution and then solve for

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:27.818
constants based on the initial
conditions and the applied

00:21:27.818 --> 00:21:32.228
voltage.
So let's write down initial

00:21:32.228 --> 00:21:34.209
conditions.
Let's assume,

00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:37.924
for simplicity,
that my initial conditions are

00:21:37.924 --> 00:21:42.794
simply the voltage across the
capacitor is zero to begin and

00:21:42.794 --> 00:21:47.747
the current through my inductor
is also zero as I begin life.

00:21:47.747 --> 00:21:51.049
Now, this is what is called
"zero state".

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:54.929
v and i are both zero,
and so the response of my

00:21:54.929 --> 00:21:58.891
circuit for some input is going
to be called ZSR.

00:21:58.891 --> 00:22:05.000
You've probably heard this term
in one of your recitations.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.274
So zero state response simply
says I start with my circuit at

00:22:10.274 --> 00:22:14.934
rest and looks at how it behaves
for some given input.

00:22:14.934 --> 00:22:18.626
That is a little term you may
end up using.

00:22:18.626 --> 00:22:22.582
My input next.
I am going to use the following

00:22:22.582 --> 00:22:25.747
input.
vI of t is going to be a step,

00:22:25.747 --> 00:22:31.137
is going to look like this.
My input is at t=0 v is going

00:22:31.137 --> 00:22:35.412
from zero to some voltage VI and
then stay at that voltage.

00:22:35.412 --> 00:22:37.771
It is going to be a step.
Kaboom.

00:22:37.771 --> 00:22:41.972
And you can see why I am going
with this set of variables,

00:22:41.972 --> 00:22:45.953
because I want make this
situation as close as possible

00:22:45.953 --> 00:22:48.828
to the funny behavior we
observed there.

00:22:48.828 --> 00:22:52.734
Remember we had a step,
and because of the step we had

00:22:52.734 --> 00:22:56.862
some behavior at that node?
So I will try to bring you as

00:22:56.862 --> 00:23:00.546
close to that.
In tomorrow's lecture,

00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:04.623
I am going to close the loop
around that and derive for you

00:23:04.623 --> 00:23:07.435
exactly the behavior we saw on
the scope.

00:23:07.435 --> 00:23:11.231
And to get there I am going to
be try to be as close as

00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:15.308
possible to the constants and
other parameters in the demo.

00:23:15.308 --> 00:23:19.315
So VI is a step and zero state.
Just in terms of notation,

00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:22.829
this kind of a step input
occurs pretty frequently.

00:23:22.829 --> 00:23:25.782
And we just have a special
notation for it.

00:23:25.782 --> 00:23:30.000
We simply call it VI is the
final value here.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.888
And we call it u(t).
So VIu(t), u(t) simply

00:23:33.888 --> 00:23:39.259
represents a step at time t=0,
steps from zero volts to VI.

00:23:39.259 --> 00:23:44.629
That is just a little more
notation that will come in handy

00:23:44.629 --> 00:23:47.222
at some point.
More math now.

00:23:47.222 --> 00:23:50.185
Three steps,
particular solution,

00:23:50.185 --> 00:23:54.351
homogenous solution,
total solution/constants.

00:23:54.351 --> 00:24:00.000
This is almost like a mantra
here, like a chorus.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.563
Homogenous solution we compute
using a four-step method.

00:24:03.563 --> 00:24:06.479
And four-step method for
homogenous solutions,

00:24:06.479 --> 00:24:09.978
it turns out that it happens to
be that way for all the

00:24:09.978 --> 00:24:12.246
equations we will see in our
course.

00:24:12.246 --> 00:24:16.069
The first step would be assume
a solution of the form Ae^st.

00:24:16.069 --> 00:24:19.244
Exactly as with RCs.
If you close your eyes and do

00:24:19.244 --> 00:24:23.196
exactly what you did for RCs you
will get to where you want to

00:24:23.196 --> 00:24:25.205
be.
You assume a solution of the

00:24:25.205 --> 00:24:27.537
form Ae^st.
Substitute that into your

00:24:27.537 --> 00:24:31.987
homogenous equation.
Obtain the characteristic

00:24:31.987 --> 00:24:34.292
equation.
Solve for the roots.

00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:37.789
And then write down your
homogenous solution.

00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:42.320
Same sort of steps again and
again and again until you get

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.102
bored to tears.
Particular solution.

00:24:45.102 --> 00:24:49.156
For the particular solution,
I simply need to find a

00:24:49.156 --> 00:24:53.448
solution, any solution,
if not the most general one but

00:24:53.448 --> 00:24:57.900
any solution that satisfies the
particular equation which

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:03.154
satisfies that equation.
LCd^2vP/dt^2+vP=VI.

00:25:03.154 --> 00:25:09.618
My input is a step and I am
going to look for the solution

00:25:09.618 --> 00:25:15.969
for time t greater than zero.
Notice that for time t less

00:25:15.969 --> 00:25:20.958
than or equal to zero,
v is going to be zero.

00:25:20.958 --> 00:25:26.288
So I am looking for a solution
greater than t=0.

00:25:26.288 --> 00:25:34.000
Here, if I substitute vP=VI,
that is a particular solution.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.352
Because if I substitute VI here
this goes to zero and then I get

00:25:39.352 --> 00:25:43.601
VI=VI, so this works.
I promised you this was going

00:25:43.601 --> 00:25:47.339
to be simple.
You cannot get any simpler than

00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:49.973
that.
I have done my first step.

00:25:49.973 --> 00:25:52.607
I found the particular
solution.

00:25:52.607 --> 00:25:57.026
And VI is a good enough
particular solution so I will

00:25:57.026 --> 00:26:03.287
use it, I will take it.
As my second step I am going to

00:26:03.287 --> 00:26:08.590
find vH or the solution to the
homogenous equation.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:15.060
And the homogenous equation is
simply that equation with drive

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.242
set to zero.
What I get here is

00:26:18.242 --> 00:26:23.439
LCd^2vH/dt^2+vH=0.
That is my homogenous equation.

00:26:23.439 --> 00:26:28.000
I simply set the drive to be
zero.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.036
And to find the solution here,
I go through my four-step

00:26:32.036 --> 00:26:34.678
method.
Again, in 6.002 following the

00:26:34.678 --> 00:26:38.715
kind of Occam's principle,
we just show you the absolute

00:26:38.715 --> 00:26:41.798
minimum necessary to get to
where you want.

00:26:41.798 --> 00:26:45.981
The absolute minimum necessary
is it turns out that we can

00:26:45.981 --> 00:26:50.018
solve all our differential
equations that we use here by

00:26:50.018 --> 00:26:54.128
using the methods of homogenous
and particular solutions.

00:26:54.128 --> 00:26:58.311
And every homogenous solution
can be solved by a four-step

00:26:58.311 --> 00:27:04.085
method.
That is about as minimal as it

00:27:04.085 --> 00:27:09.124
can get.
So no extraneous stuff there.

00:27:09.124 --> 00:27:13.482
The four-step method,
four steps.

00:27:13.482 --> 00:27:21.108
The first step is assume a
solution of the form vH=Ae^st.

00:27:21.108 --> 00:27:28.190
What I have noticed is that
students starting out are

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:35.000
usually scared of differential
equations.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.890
I know I was when I was a
student.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.326
And the trick with differential
equations is that it is all a

00:27:40.326 --> 00:27:42.675
matter of psych.
Just because you see some

00:27:42.675 --> 00:27:46.226
squigglies and squagglies and a
bunch of math and so on you say

00:27:46.226 --> 00:27:49.205
oh, that must be hard.
But differential equations are

00:27:49.205 --> 00:27:52.298
actually the simplest thing
there is because in a large

00:27:52.298 --> 00:27:55.563
majority of cases the way you
solve them is you assume you

00:27:55.563 --> 00:27:59.000
know the answer,
someone tells you the answer.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.390
And then all you are left to do
is shove the answer into the

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.379
equation and find out the
constants that makes it the

00:28:05.379 --> 00:28:07.103
answer.
Just a matter of psych.

00:28:07.103 --> 00:28:09.402
Psych yourselves that this
stuff is easy,

00:28:09.402 --> 00:28:11.988
because I am telling you what
the solution is.

00:28:11.988 --> 00:28:14.459
All you have to do is
substitute and verify.

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:17.908
If you think about differential
equations that way or a large

00:28:17.908 --> 00:28:20.666
majority of them,
it really is very simple if you

00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:22.793
can just get past the squigglies
here.

00:28:22.793 --> 00:28:26.068
Just get past the squigglies
and then just simply stick in

00:28:26.068 --> 00:28:31.377
some simple stuff and it works.
I mean it just cannot get any

00:28:31.377 --> 00:28:34.165
easier.
I cannot think of any other

00:28:34.165 --> 00:28:39.167
field where the way you find a
solution is assume you know the

00:28:39.167 --> 00:28:43.678
solution and stick it in.
It has never made any sense to

00:28:43.678 --> 00:28:48.023
me but that is how it is.
So we assume the solution to

00:28:48.023 --> 00:28:51.057
the form Ae^st,
you stick it in there,

00:28:51.057 --> 00:28:55.321
and you have to find out the A
and s that make it so.

00:28:55.321 --> 00:28:58.192
It cannot get any simpler than
that.

00:28:58.192 --> 00:29:02.619
Let's stick the sucker in here
and see what we can get.

00:29:02.619 --> 00:29:07.048
Substitute Ae^st here I get
LCA, and second derivative,

00:29:07.048 --> 00:29:12.762
so it's s^2 e^st.
And Ae^st on this one here.

00:29:12.762 --> 00:29:17.981
And that equals zero.
And then let me just solve for

00:29:17.981 --> 00:29:22.586
whatever I can find.
Assuming I don't take the

00:29:22.586 --> 00:29:26.781
trivial case A=0,
I cancel these guys out.

00:29:26.781 --> 00:29:32.000
And what I am left with is
simply LCs^2+1=0.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.156
In other words,
what I end up getting is B,

00:29:36.156 --> 00:29:38.928
s^2=-1/LC.
My first step was,

00:29:38.928 --> 00:29:43.481
I am giving you solutions,
stick them in there,

00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:48.726
assume a solution of this form.
Second step is get the

00:29:48.726 --> 00:29:53.378
characteristic equation.
And the way you get the

00:29:53.378 --> 00:29:59.218
characteristic equation is that
you simply stick this guy in

00:29:59.218 --> 00:30:04.210
there.
And what you end up getting is

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:09.453
some equation in s^2.
Do you remember what you got

00:30:09.453 --> 00:30:13.306
for first order circuits?
What s was?

00:30:13.306 --> 00:30:17.051
What is s?
For first order circuits,

00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:21.867
what did you get as a
characteristic equation?

00:30:21.867 --> 00:30:24.435
s+1/RC=0.
The same thing.

00:30:24.435 --> 00:30:30.000
Just remember to blindly apply
the steps.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.391
It will lead you to the answer.
This is called the

00:30:33.391 --> 00:30:37.198
"characteristic equation".
This is incredibly important.

00:30:37.198 --> 00:30:41.212
You will see in about a couple
weeks from now that once you

00:30:41.212 --> 00:30:44.811
write the characteristic
equation down for a circuit,

00:30:44.811 --> 00:30:48.341
it tells you all there is to
know about the circuit.

00:30:48.341 --> 00:30:51.594
And often times you can stop
solving right here.

00:30:51.594 --> 00:30:54.708
To experienced circuit
designers this tells me

00:30:54.708 --> 00:30:59.000
everything there is to know.
This is really key.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.106
That's why it's called a
characteristic equation.

00:31:02.106 --> 00:31:05.860
I believe in problem number
three of the homework that will

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.225
be coming out this week,
that is exactly what you are

00:31:09.225 --> 00:31:11.555
going to do.
I am going to give you a

00:31:11.555 --> 00:31:15.503
circuit, ask you to get to the
characteristic equation quickly

00:31:15.503 --> 00:31:18.027
and then from there intuit the
solution.

00:31:18.027 --> 00:31:21.457
Write the characteristic
equation and then just intuit

00:31:21.457 --> 00:31:25.081
solution, it's that simple.
So, step A, assume a solution

00:31:25.081 --> 00:31:27.929
of the form, step B,
write the characteristic

00:31:27.929 --> 00:31:33.354
equation down.
And let me just simplify that a

00:31:33.354 --> 00:31:37.682
little bit.
I go ahead and find my roots.

00:31:37.682 --> 00:31:42.768
And my roots here,
remember that j is the square

00:31:42.768 --> 00:31:47.746
root of minus one.
And so what I end up getting

00:31:47.746 --> 00:31:53.805
is, my two roots here are,
plus j square root of 1/LC and

00:31:53.805 --> 00:31:59.000
minus j square root of 1/LC.
Two roots.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.599
And just as a shorthand
notation, much like I had a

00:32:03.599 --> 00:32:08.750
shorthand notation for RC,
what was my shorthand notation

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.762
for RC?
Tau.

00:32:09.762 --> 00:32:15.097
Just as tau was big in first
order, we have a corresponding

00:32:15.097 --> 00:32:20.433
thing that is big in second
order and that is omega nought.

00:32:20.433 --> 00:32:24.020
Omega nought is simply square
root 1/LC.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:28.252
Just as tau was RC,
omega nought is a shorthand

00:32:28.252 --> 00:32:33.652
here.
And so s is simply plus or

00:32:33.652 --> 00:32:40.537
minus j omega nought.
Notice that in this equation

00:32:40.537 --> 00:32:48.826
here, if you take the square
root of LC there that has units

00:32:48.826 --> 00:32:56.413
of time, so one divided by that
has units of frequency.

00:32:56.413 --> 00:33:04.000
Notice that this guy is a
frequency in radians.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.098
I end up getting my roots of
the homogenous equation,

00:33:09.098 --> 00:33:13.803
and that is my third step.
And as my fourth step,

00:33:13.803 --> 00:33:18.215
I simply write down the
homogenous solution as

00:33:18.215 --> 00:33:23.803
substituting s with its roots
and writing the most general

00:33:23.803 --> 00:33:29.686
possible form of the solution,
and that would be A1e^(j omega

00:33:29.686 --> 00:33:34.000
nought t)+A2e^(-j omega nought
t).

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.065
Done.
Some constant times this

00:33:36.065 --> 00:33:38.843
solution plus some other
constant times,

00:33:38.843 --> 00:33:41.835
the other solution.
Plus zero omega nought.

00:33:41.835 --> 00:33:44.257
Remember it comes from here,
Ae^st.

00:33:44.257 --> 00:33:48.317
I assume the solution of this
form, so my solution in this

00:33:48.317 --> 00:33:52.235
most general case would be s
being j omega nought in one

00:33:52.235 --> 00:33:55.369
case, minus j omega nought in
the other case,

00:33:55.369 --> 00:34:00.000
and I sum the two to get the
most general solution.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.357
So blasting ahead.
I now have my homogenous

00:34:10.357 --> 00:34:14.438
solution.
And as my third step of

00:34:14.438 --> 00:34:21.581
solution to differential
equations I write down the total

00:34:21.581 --> 00:34:27.704
solution, v=vP+vH,
particular plus the homogenous

00:34:27.704 --> 00:34:32.509
solutions.
And v=VI, was my particular

00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:38.272
solution, +A1e^(j omega nought
t)+A2e^(-j omega nought t) is my

00:34:38.272 --> 00:34:41.339
complete solution.
The final step,

00:34:41.339 --> 00:34:46.916
write down the total solution
and find the constants from the

00:34:46.916 --> 00:34:51.471
initial conditions.
To find the constants from the

00:34:51.471 --> 00:34:54.817
initial conditions,
let's start with,

00:34:54.817 --> 00:34:59.000
the voltage is zero to begin
with.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.826
This equation governs the
characteristics of v,

00:35:03.826 --> 00:35:08.022
so I need to find the initial
conditions.

00:35:08.022 --> 00:35:12.429
First of all,
I know that know that v(0)=0.

00:35:12.429 --> 00:35:17.885
From there I substitute t=0.
And so this goes to one,

00:35:17.885 --> 00:35:21.767
this goes to one,
and I end up getting

00:35:21.767 --> 00:35:25.859
0=VI+A1+A2.
That is my first expression.

00:35:25.859 --> 00:35:31.000
And then I am also given that
i(0)=0.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.069
And so I can get that as well.
How do I get i?

00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:41.251
This is v.
I know that i=Cdv/dt,

00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:47.186
so I can get i by simply
multiplying by C and

00:35:47.186 --> 00:35:52.311
differentiating this with
respect to t.

00:35:52.311 --> 00:36:00.000
I get C, this guy vanishes so I
get d/dt of this.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.791
So it is CA1(j omega nought)
e^(j omega nought t)+CA2(-j

00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:12.608
omega nought)e^(-j omega nought
t).

00:36:12.608 --> 00:36:21.108
From here I am given that that
is zero, and so therefore this

00:36:21.108 --> 00:36:26.916
guy becomes a one,
this guy becomes a one,

00:36:26.916 --> 00:36:34.000
j omega nought,
j omega nought cancel out.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:43.692
What I end up getting is A1=A2.
From the second initial

00:36:43.692 --> 00:36:50.333
condition I get A1=A2.
From these two,

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:58.769
if I substitute here for A2,
I get VI + 2A1 = 0,

00:36:58.769 --> 00:37:05.341
or A1=-VI/2.
That is also equal to A2.

00:37:05.341 --> 00:37:13.094
Therefore, my total solution
now can be written in terms of

00:37:13.094 --> 00:37:19.777
the actual values of the
constants I have obtained.

00:37:19.777 --> 00:37:24.722
I get VI-VI/2.
So A1 and A2 are equal.

00:37:24.722 --> 00:37:33.428
I just pull them outside.
I pull VI-2 outside and I stick

00:37:33.428 --> 00:37:38.000
these two guys in parenthesis
in.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:46.571
Again, I promised you no more
circuits from here on until the

00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:52.000
very last board or something
like that.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.857
It is all math,
so not much else happening

00:37:57.857 --> 00:38:01.182
there.
More math.

00:38:01.182 --> 00:38:06.976
If you would like,
I could skip all the way to the

00:38:06.976 --> 00:38:13.125
end and show you the answer.
But I just love to write

00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:19.391
equations on the board so let me
just go through that.

00:38:19.391 --> 00:38:25.185
I am going to simplify this a
little further here.

00:38:25.185 --> 00:38:31.570
And we should remember this
form by the Euler relation,

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:38.666
ejx=cos x+j sin x.
And by the same token,

00:38:38.666 --> 00:38:47.333
(e^jx + e^-jx)/2=cos x.
You all should know this from

00:38:47.333 --> 00:38:54.833
the Euler relation.
So were are using this guy

00:38:54.833 --> 00:39:04.117
here, ej^x + e^-jx=2cos x.
And so this one is 2 cosine of

00:39:04.117 --> 00:39:08.784
omega nought t,
2 and 2 cancel out,

00:39:08.784 --> 00:39:16.745
and what I am left with is
v(t)=VI-VI cos( omega nought t).

00:39:16.745 --> 00:39:24.431
And the current is Cdv/dt,
which is simply CVI sin( omega

00:39:24.431 --> 00:39:30.058
nought t).
Just remember that omega nought

00:39:30.058 --> 00:39:36.608
is the square root of 1/LC.
We are done.

00:39:36.608 --> 00:39:44.381
In fact, I did not give that
answer the importance that was

00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:48.000
due so let me just draw.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
There.
That is better.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.394
Enough math.
In a nutshell,

00:40:02.394 --> 00:40:06.078
what did we do.
We wrote the node method,

00:40:06.078 --> 00:40:10.960
it's a very simple circuit,
to write down the equation

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.750
governing that circuit.
And then we grunged through a

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:18.973
bunch of math.
Not a whole lot here.

00:40:18.973 --> 00:40:23.394
It is pretty simple.
And ended up with a relation

00:40:23.394 --> 00:40:28.828
that says the voltage across the
capacitor for a step input,

00:40:28.828 --> 00:40:33.342
assuming zero state,
is a constant VI-VI cos omega

00:40:33.342 --> 00:40:36.842
t.
Notice that even though I have

00:40:36.842 --> 00:40:39.422
a step input,
the circuit dynamics are such

00:40:39.422 --> 00:40:42.800
that I get a cosine in there.
You can begin to see where

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.828
these cosines are coming from
now.

00:40:44.828 --> 00:40:47.837
They come in here.
And if you recall the example I

00:40:47.837 --> 00:40:50.417
showed you earlier of the
inverter circuit,

00:40:50.417 --> 00:40:52.874
remember there was a cosine
that decayed,

00:40:52.874 --> 00:40:56.068
that was sort of losing energy
and kind of dying out?

00:40:56.068 --> 00:41:00.000
So you can see where the
cosines are coming from.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:11.765
And just to draw you a little
sketch here.

00:41:11.765 --> 00:41:26.400
Let me draw v and i for you and
let me plot omega t,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:35.285
pi/2, pi and so on.
Let me plot VI.

00:41:35.285 --> 00:41:41.685
When time t=0,
VI=0, cosine omega t is one,

00:41:41.685 --> 00:41:48.238
and so VI-VI=0.
That is simply a cosine that

00:41:48.238 --> 00:41:56.466
starts out at zero here,
and at pi I get cosine omega t

00:41:56.466 --> 00:42:02.866
is minus one,
so I get plus VI on the other

00:42:02.866 --> 00:42:08.163
side.
So I end up at +2VI.

00:42:08.163 --> 00:42:13.384
At this point the voltage is
here.

00:42:13.384 --> 00:42:19.711
And notice that this guy looks
like this.

00:42:19.711 --> 00:42:27.937
It is a cosine that is
translated up so that its mean

00:42:27.937 --> 00:42:37.111
value is not zero but VI.
It is just a translation up of

00:42:37.111 --> 00:42:42.593
a cosine.
Similarly, in this case for the

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:48.213
current it is a sinusoidal
characteristic.

00:42:48.213 --> 00:42:56.162
And it looks something like
this where the peak is given by

00:42:56.162 --> 00:43:00.000
CVI, oh, I messed up.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.125
When I differentiated this is
missed the omega nought out

00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:15.000
there.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.082
What I would like to do now --
This is the form of the output

00:43:30.082 --> 00:43:33.414
for a step input.
What I would like to do next is

00:43:33.414 --> 00:43:36.537
show you a demo.
But before I show you a demo,

00:43:36.537 --> 00:43:40.702
I always found it strange that
I have a step input and then I

00:43:40.702 --> 00:43:44.590
have two little elements,
how can I get a sine coming out

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:47.227
of the output?
I would like to get some

00:43:47.227 --> 00:43:50.698
intuition as to why things
behave the way they are.

00:43:50.698 --> 00:43:54.585
I could go and pray to find
out, but let me just give you

00:43:54.585 --> 00:43:58.472
some very basic insight as to
why this behaves the way it

00:43:58.472 --> 00:44:02.634
does.
Let me draw the circuit for you

00:44:02.634 --> 00:44:05.524
here.
And this is my inductor L and

00:44:05.524 --> 00:44:08.328
capacitance C.
Remember this is v.

00:44:08.328 --> 00:44:13.342
Let me just walk you through
what is happening there and get

00:44:13.342 --> 00:44:17.847
you to understand this.
Now, you have seen sines occur

00:44:17.847 --> 00:44:20.821
before.
If you go and write down the

00:44:20.821 --> 00:44:24.390
equation of motion of a
pendulum, you know,

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:28.130
you have a pendulum,
you move it to one side,

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:31.556
let go.
It is also governed by

00:44:31.556 --> 00:44:35.304
sinusoidal characteristics.
And you will find that the

00:44:35.304 --> 00:44:39.478
equation governing its motion is
very much of the same form,

00:44:39.478 --> 00:44:43.863
and you get the sinusoid where
you have energy that is sloshing

00:44:43.863 --> 00:44:47.895
back and forth between maximum
potential energy to maximum

00:44:47.895 --> 00:44:51.785
kinetic energy and zero
potential energy back to maximum

00:44:51.785 --> 00:44:53.907
potential energy,
zero kinetic.

00:44:53.907 --> 00:44:56.665
So it is energy sloshing back
and forth.

00:44:56.665 --> 00:45:01.211
The same way here.
Capacitors and inductors store

00:45:01.211 --> 00:45:04.012
energy.
Let's walk through and see what

00:45:04.012 --> 00:45:06.739
happens.
I start off with both of them

00:45:06.739 --> 00:45:09.319
having the stage zero,
zero current,

00:45:09.319 --> 00:45:11.751
zero voltage.
I apply a step here.

00:45:11.751 --> 00:45:14.700
Boom, the step comes
instanteously to VI.

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.975
I notice that the capacitor
voltage cannot change instantly

00:45:18.975 --> 00:45:22.144
unless there is an infinite
pulse of a sort,

00:45:22.144 --> 00:45:24.724
so this guy cannot change
instantly.

00:45:24.724 --> 00:45:29.000
And so its voltage starts off
being zero.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.048
So the entire voltage here,
KVL must be true no matter

00:45:32.048 --> 00:45:34.118
what.
They are absolutely fundamental

00:45:34.118 --> 00:45:36.131
principles from Maxwell's
equations.

00:45:36.131 --> 00:45:38.489
KVL must hold,
which means that the entire

00:45:38.489 --> 00:45:40.905
voltage VI must appear across
the inductor.

00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:44.413
I put a big voltage across the
inductor and its current begins

00:45:44.413 --> 00:45:45.851
to build up.
There you go.

00:45:45.851 --> 00:45:49.359
A voltage across the inductor,
its current begins to build up.

00:45:49.359 --> 00:45:52.523
As its current begins to build
up that current must flow

00:45:52.523 --> 00:45:54.018
through the capacitor,
too.

00:45:54.018 --> 00:45:57.239
And as current flows through a
capacitor it is depositing

00:45:57.239 --> 00:46:02.900
charge into the capacitor.
As the capacitor begins to get

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:07.733
charge deposited on it,
its voltage begins to rise.

00:46:07.733 --> 00:46:12.856
Let's see what happens here.
Its voltage keeps rising.

00:46:12.856 --> 00:46:16.336
At some point,
the voltage across the

00:46:16.336 --> 00:46:21.266
capacitor is equal to VI.
But then VI equals this VI

00:46:21.266 --> 00:46:24.263
here.
So when the two become VI,

00:46:24.263 --> 00:46:29.000
the inductor has zero volts
across it.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.683
So there is no longer a
potential difference that is

00:46:32.683 --> 00:46:35.573
increasing the current in that
direction.

00:46:35.573 --> 00:46:37.957
At that point,
at pi divided by 2,

00:46:37.957 --> 00:46:42.074
I have some current going into
the inductor so there is no

00:46:42.074 --> 00:46:46.191
longer a pressure that is
forcing more current through the

00:46:46.191 --> 00:46:49.081
inductor because this voltage
reaches VI.

00:46:49.081 --> 00:46:53.343
But remember capacitors like to
sit around holding voltages.

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:57.171
Just remember that demo.
That rinky-dink capacitor sat

00:46:57.171 --> 00:47:01.000
there stubbornly holding its
voltage.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.564
And it had a huge spark towards
the end.

00:47:03.564 --> 00:47:05.997
It just sat there holding its
voltage.

00:47:05.997 --> 00:47:09.088
In the same manner,
inductors love to sit around

00:47:09.088 --> 00:47:12.244
holding a current.
They will do whatever they can

00:47:12.244 --> 00:47:14.743
to keep the current going
through them.

00:47:14.743 --> 00:47:17.111
It has got the current going
through.

00:47:17.111 --> 00:47:19.675
And few forces on earth can
change that.

00:47:19.675 --> 00:47:22.437
And so therefore,
even though the capacitor

00:47:22.437 --> 00:47:26.120
voltage is VI and the voltage
drop across the inductor is

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:30.000
zero, it still keeps supplying a
current.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.365
It has got the current.
It's got inertia.

00:47:32.365 --> 00:47:34.850
It keeps going.
It is like a runaway train.

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:37.571
You may not be pushing the
train from the back,

00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:41.120
but once it is running it has
got kinetic energy and is going

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.959
to run no matter what for a
least some more time,

00:47:43.959 --> 00:47:46.561
even if you take away the force
on the train.

00:47:46.561 --> 00:47:49.992
So I have taken away the force
on the punching more current

00:47:49.992 --> 00:47:52.003
through, but it has kinetic
energy.

00:47:52.003 --> 00:47:55.552
It has current flowing through
it so it continues to supply a

00:47:55.552 --> 00:47:57.800
current.
Because it continues to supply

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:02.000
the current the capacitor
voltage keeps increasing.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.932
This is a subtle insight which
is absolutely spectacular that

00:48:05.932 --> 00:48:09.405
with zero volts across it,
it still keeps pumping that

00:48:09.405 --> 00:48:11.895
current.
Capacitor voltage has gone up.

00:48:11.895 --> 00:48:14.648
And guess what?
The voltage on this side is

00:48:14.648 --> 00:48:17.924
higher now but this guy is still
pumping a current.

00:48:17.924 --> 00:48:20.677
Man, I have been born to do
this, you know,

00:48:20.677 --> 00:48:24.019
I shall pump a current.
However, because the voltage

00:48:24.019 --> 00:48:29.000
has now gone up here gradually
the current begins to diminish.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.625
So the capacitor is concerned.
You pump a current into me,

00:48:33.625 --> 00:48:36.303
my voltage goes up.
At some point,

00:48:36.303 --> 00:48:39.549
like a runaway train,
it comes to a halt.

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:44.013
The current through the
capacitor drains and now goes to

00:48:44.013 --> 00:48:47.421
zero and the capacitor voltage
reaches 2VI.

00:48:47.421 --> 00:48:50.586
So this is at 2VI now and this
is at VI.

00:48:50.586 --> 00:48:53.751
Now the situation is not in
equilibrium.

00:48:53.751 --> 00:48:57.484
At this point there is zero
current through it,

00:48:57.484 --> 00:49:01.970
but guess what?
I have a VI pumping in this

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:05.182
direction now.
I have the same VI punching in

00:49:05.182 --> 00:49:07.299
this direction.
So guess what?

00:49:07.299 --> 00:49:11.240
Its current must now build up
in this direction and its

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.452
current begins to build up in
that direction.

00:49:14.452 --> 00:49:18.832
That begins to discharge the
capacitor and the capacitor then

00:49:18.832 --> 00:49:22.554
goes on to a negative,
or the current goes down to a

00:49:22.554 --> 00:49:26.350
maximum negative current,
and this process continues.

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:30.000
What you are seeing here is
energy.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.260
It is sloshing back and forth
between the two,

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:37.174
and that is kind of a key.
I will just quickly put up a

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:40.507
demo that you can watch as you
are walking out.

00:49:40.507 --> 00:49:44.058
With a step input,
notice the green is the voltage

00:49:44.058 --> 00:49:48.188
across the capacitor and the
orange is the current through

00:49:48.188 --> 00:49:49.188
the capacitor.
