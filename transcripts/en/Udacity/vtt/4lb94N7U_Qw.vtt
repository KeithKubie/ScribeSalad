00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.870
Time for a question. In exokernal we have this mechanism of downloading code

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.430
into the kernel. Spin has a similar functionality, which is to extend

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.890
logical protection domains. The question to you is, which one of these two

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.170
mechanisms compromises protection more. Does spin

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.580
compromise protection more? Or exokernal compromise protection

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.460
more by this idea of either downloading code in into the kernel as is done

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.160
in exokernal or extending spin using the logic and protection domain idea?
