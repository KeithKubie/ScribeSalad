00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.870
For this video, I’m going to show you how
to make an easy and reusable fruit-fly trap,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.850
that’s surprisingly effective. And leaves
your kitchen, smelling lemony fresh, as well.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.150
All you need for this kitchen creation, is
a small container with a lid, and a lemon.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.399
Use a sharp knife to cut the end off the lemon,
then slice it in half, so you have a piece

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:20.919
that’s flat on the top, and flat on the
bottom.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.500
Go ahead and squeeze a bit of the juice into
the container, to get the lemon scents flowing,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.259
then simply plop the rest of the slice, inside.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.050
Now finishing up is almost as simple, as adding
the lid.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.140
It just needs to have a tiny hole punched
in it first.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.410
So poke, or burn a hole just barely big enough
to let fruit flies in, but small enough, that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.140
they’ll have a hard time, finding their
way back out.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.920
With that done, simply snap the lid back onto
the container, and your reusable fruit-fly

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.190
trap is ready to get to work.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.790
Make as many as you want, for as cheap as
you want, and put them, wherever you want.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.400
For some reason, fruit flies really like lemons,
and most of them will find their way inside

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.510
the container, but won’t be in any hurry
to get back out.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.760
When you’ve had enough of them, simply drip
a bit of water through the hole, and place

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.899
the container in the microwave on high heat,
for 15-30 seconds.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.139
As the container cooks, the flies drop dead,
and a “lemony fresh” scent, fills the air instead.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.670
The best part is, if you’ve got more flies
to catch, simply refresh your traps, and do

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.120
it again as many times as you want.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.720
Well now you know how to make a simple kitchen
gadget, that filters out fruit fly challenges,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.340
and freshens your air at the same time.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.400
That’s it for now. If you liked this project,
perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
