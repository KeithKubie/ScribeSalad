My opponent tonight
co-wrote the book Lean In,

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.904
was a writer for shows
like The Simpsons

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:06.606
and Late Night
 with David Letterman,

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.241
and has written jokes
for Barack Obama

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:09.642
and Hillary Clinton.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.544
Wow, not many writers
can transition

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:14.414
from comedy to horror
that successfully.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.682
-Nell Scovell. Nell, welcome.
-(cheering and applause)

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:18.451
Thank you for having me.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:20.219
Of course. Now, I want to talk.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:22.221
In this book here,
you talk a lot

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:25.525
about being the only
female writer in a writers' room

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.393
and helping break
the glass ceiling.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.128 line:0%
Can I just ask you
to do me a favor

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:30.596 line:0%
before we continue?

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:33.433 line:0%
-Y-Yeah.
-So, President Trump comes out,

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.468 line:0%
he attacks Jim Comey
for his book,

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:37.703 line:0%
-and the book
becomes a best seller. -Yeah.

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.839
-Right.
-So, I write this book.

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:42.141
I honestly thought
people would attack me,

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:43.576
and they've been so nice.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.111
-They say it's funny.
-Sure.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:46.579
-They-they love it.
-Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:50.249
Um, and it would really help
to create some controversy,

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:52.652
so if you wouldn't mind,

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:56.122
could you just call me
a no-talent whore?

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:58.925
Just... could you?

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.960
(cheering and applause)

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:04.397
Please?

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.366
(laughter)

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.502
This feels like a trap.

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:11.370
(laughter)

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:13.306
-I'm your guest.
-I know, exactly. This...

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.541
-I know. -Are you
Time's Upping me right now?

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:16.976
-Is that what's going on?
-No, no.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.112
The problem is
throughout history

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.948
when women spoke up,
men tried to silence them.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:23.916
-Uh-huh.
-And I come out with this book,

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:26.819
and at the one moment
when men are thinking twice

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:29.722
about, you know,
telling women we're terrible

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:32.692
and should make them sandwiches.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.427
-See, on the one hand,
-Yeah.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.663
like, I want to satisfy
your demand.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:39.565
But I'm not always great
at satisfying women,

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.902
if I'm being quite honest
with you.

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.004
-But...
-You can do it, Jordan.

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:47.640
-Just...
-Nell...

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:50.042
I'm afraid I've looked
at your book, and you're a...

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:51.644
Say it.

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:54.447
...a-a talentless whore.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.817
-Thank you, thank you, thank
you. -(cheering and applause)

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.286
-Was that... -I'm gonna...
Can I put that on the back?

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.221
I don't... Yes? No!

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:03.856
It's a great quote.

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.625
-Uh... Y-Yeah. Uh...
-All right.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.827
-I really appreciate that.
-#YesAllMen.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.829
(laughing)

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:12.265
If that can help sell
some books, please,

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.834
I know it takes a man
to sell books, so, uh,

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.703
use me however you can.

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:19.739
But-but in all seriousness,

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:22.175
uh, you are fairly talentless.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.643
-Uh...
-Yeah.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.511
(laughter)

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:26.979
-And-and unattractive

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:29.248
-in any way, means or form.
-Well, yeah, like...

00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:31.117
-Yeah. -So you wrote this
all by your woman self--

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.885
is that what you're telling me?

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:35.488
-I, um... Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.156
Yeah? So why is it hard

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.959
to get these women
into these writers' rooms?

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:42.695
In fact, let me say this, you...
right now, you are trying...

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:44.764
one of your jobs
is to try to help get women

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.766
-into writers' rooms,
is that correct? -Yes.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.668
-It's a mission, not a job.
But yes. -It's a mission.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.570
Okay. Okay,
your mission is to do that.

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.673
Why-why isn't there a man doing
that thing for people like me?

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:56.409
Aw. Um, well,
there-there have been.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:59.445
Their names are, uh,
David Letterman,

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:01.714
Jay Leno, Johnny Carson.

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:03.849
You just were born
at the wrong time, Jordan.

00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:05.484
I-I keep saying that.

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.720
I should have been born
20 years earlier, right?

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:09.288
You've also written
for, uh, Hillary Clinton

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:10.623
and Barack Obama.

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:12.058
Uh, what was it like
writing for...

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.360
humor for people like that,
with no sense of humor?

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:16.896
(groaning, laughter)

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.232 line:0%
Well, I actually disagree,

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.200 line:0%
and I think President Obama,
especially,

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:23.302 line:0%
had an incredible sense
of humor.

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:24.737 line:0%
He had great delivery.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.205
This... Well, I-I have...

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:28.808
This-this is a joke you wrote
that he did not read.

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:30.676
-Is that correct? -Right,
and this would be a good example

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.945
of how untalented I am.

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:34.247
-Great.
-Yeah.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.416
Well, let-let... let me
read some of this then.

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.785
"I turned 50 while in office
which meant

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:41.854
"I had to have
my first colonoscopy,

00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:43.456
"and guess what they found.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.924
Mitch McConnell."

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:47.093
(laughter, groaning)

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:49.328
"That guy can obstruct
anything."

00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:50.830
(laughing):
Yeah.

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:52.465
(laughter)

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:53.833
-I see what you're doing there.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.735
You're-you're implying

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.170
that Mitch McConnell
was up the president's ass.

00:03:58.203 --> 00:04:00.806
Yeah, maybe that's why
he didn't do the joke.

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:02.308
-Yes.
-You think?

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:04.543
I'm gonna say that...
that I do like.

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:06.312
Nell, tell me something
I already know.

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:08.247
-Can I tell you two things?
-Please.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.616
Okay, the first is
that your forehead takes up

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.452
as much space
as the rest of your face.

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:15.454
(laughter)

00:04:15.487 --> 00:04:17.456
(applause and cheering)

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.991
And...

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.661
But you knew that.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.429
And you have more.

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:25.598
And-and the second is that

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.634
half of your writing staff
is female,

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.803
so... high five.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:33.239
-Oh, that's-that
Viacom-mandated. -What? no.

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:35.374
-Uh, yeah. No, no, no, no.
-No? No?

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:37.276
-No, no, no, no. -Oh,
I was so proud of you, Jordan.

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:38.611
No, no. Oh, no.

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:40.313
(applause and cheering)

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:42.114
No. No. No, no, no, no.

00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:44.183
Her book is called
 Just the Funny Parts.

00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:44.684 line:92%
Nell Scovell.
