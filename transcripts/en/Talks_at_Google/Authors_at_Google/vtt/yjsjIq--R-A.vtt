00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.880
MALE SPEAKER: So wow.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.140
How great is this?

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.295
It is my enormous pleasure
today to introduce

00:00:13.295 --> 00:00:18.300
Bob Ryan, author of
"Scribe, My Life in Sports."

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.130
He's a Jersey kid who
made Boston his home

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.090
and went on to cover
sports here, nationally

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.420
and around the world, playoffs
and championships in virtually

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.485
every college and pro
sport plus the Olympics.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.830
He's been writing about
sports, based on his book,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.870
pretty much since he could
pick up a pen and pencil

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.470
and had some paper
in front of him--

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.090
professionally, since
1968, until his retirement

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.310
a couple of years ago.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.060
Bob spent almost his entire
career working for the "Globe"

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.980
with a couple of years out
working on air for Channel 5.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.050
But even if you never
heard his voice on the air,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.140
you certainly heard it through
his writing-- sometimes blunt,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.185
sometimes flowery, always
opinionated and to the point.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.200
I'm a lifelong sports fan
myself, and reading Bob's work

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.190
has been one of the high
points of every one of my days

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.990
since I moved to
Boston in the '70s.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.050
Please join me in welcoming
the one and only Bob Ryan.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:32.530
BOB RYAN: Well thank you.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.405
Thank you for coming.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:36.170
And on behalf of me,
I want to thank me

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.764
for allowing you to play hooky.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:42.695
BOB RYAN: We're obviously
going to get to questions,

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:45.950
but I'll throw out
some opening remarks.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.320
One of the questions-- the
book has been out for a week.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.880
A week ago today was
the publication date.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.040
I felt like it had a very
long gestation period

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.450
because the book was
actually-- the send button

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.990
on the original draft was
hit on August 27, 2013.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.560
And at that point, I assumed
it would be a spring release.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.570
And that would have been good,
but any author will tell you he

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.170
or she is very
happy to have a fall

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.009
release with the
holidays coming up.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.550
So in that sense,
I was very grateful

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.400
that there was some
sort of procrastination.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.460
But by the time
the book came out,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.375
I felt like I had had
the book by c-section.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.670
It was a long wait, and
I was anxious to have it.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.180
And so that's the genesis there.

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:24.980
One of the things I've
been asked this week--

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.190
and I've done a lot of radio
interviews, which is very, very

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.750
nice-- is why did you
decide to write the book?

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.314
The actual truth is-- and
I'm not being disingenuous

00:02:34.314 --> 00:02:34.980
when I say this.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.909
So of course, all along
the way in my career

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.200
I thought about writing a book.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.380
I think any author
or writer with an ego

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.221
and a little hint
of pomposity thinks

00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:44.720
that maybe the world
would just love

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.390
to know all his or her thoughts
about the career they've led.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.670
But I talked myself out of it.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.910
I really did, because I
just came to the conclusion,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.334
you're flattering yourself.

00:02:55.334 --> 00:02:57.500
Better people than you have
either not written books

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.400
or have written
books that didn't

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.525
seem to have much traction.

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:03.100
So that's a nice thought,
but put it aside.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.420
Then about four
years ago, an agent

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.500
named Andrew Blowner, who was
a Brown University graduate who

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.120
had read during the Bird
era, and had read me then

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.125
and is a big basketball
fan, a New Yorker,

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:19.470
born and raised in
Manhattan, came to me

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.980
and identified himself-- he's a
very prominent agent for people

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.595
far beyond sports--
and came to me

00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:26.600
and identified himself
as a fan of my work

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.360
and said that he really
thought I should do a book.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.780
And I explained to him that
I'd already talked myself

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.591
out of doing a book,
but he persuaded me

00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:32.840
that there was some viability.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.870
I said, OK.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.930
I said, that's great,
I appreciate that.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.370
But I'm not going to do
anything until I am free

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.600
and I'm officially retired.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.310
I want to be able to
concentrate on this,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.726
and I'm planning on getting
out after the London Olympics.

00:03:43.726 --> 00:03:46.470
So if you can sit around
and wait for me to get done,

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.150
then we'll talk.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.290
And he was very patient.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.630
And we had a couple of meetings.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.129
Lunches.

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.050
Meetings-- we had lunches
and a few beers in New York

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.820
and in Boston over the years.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.190
And when I did get freed up
after the London Olympics

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.860
and officially retired from the
"Globe" on a day-to-day basis,

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.660
we got together.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.640
I got up a little proposal,
he shopped it around,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.270
and in January of
2013, an editor

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.630
in New York City named
George Gibson from Bloomsbury

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.630
took the book.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.603
It was really fortuitous
because George Gibson

00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:18.019
and I had worked together 25
years ago on a previous book,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.269
a Celtics book that some of
you might even be aware of

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:20.947
or have seen.

00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:23.030
I can't even remember the
long, pretentious title,

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.610
but it was about the
images-- iconic--

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.070
but it was all about pictures.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.550
Great photos from a tremendous
photographer, the late Dick

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.605
Raphael, and I could
supply the text.

00:04:35.605 --> 00:04:39.570
It was much more of a picture
book first and a print book

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.090
second.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.710
There is plenty of
print, but the pictures

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.668
were the selling point.

00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:44.390
But George had edited that book.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.750
He worked up at Addison-Wesley
in Reading at that time,

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.080
and we had no contact
in the ensuing years.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.240
None.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.850
Now, he has taken the book.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.380
So I'm in the hands of two
people that believe in me,

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.754
and believe me, as much or
more than I do in myself

00:04:57.754 --> 00:04:58.920
with regard to this project.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.750
I wrote the book over the months
of April to August of 2013

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.960
after about a six week period
of actually researching myself.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.140
I had to go back and check out
things and corroborate memories

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.570
and check facts and
remind myself of things.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.000
And it was very interesting.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.110
It was kind of fun.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.919
And then I got started writing
and for the first time--

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.710
I'd written 11 previous
books and all them,

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.500
of course, as I was a full-time
employee of the "Globe."

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.470
And the other books
all have to be

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.610
crammed in on nights and
weekends and vacations.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.710
And it's like a giant term
paper hanging over your head.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.280
That's exactly what it's like.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.720
And they're not fun.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.200
And only a couple of them
really involved a process

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.950
that was even
remotely pleasurable.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.510
Any author will tell you that
the most time-- the great line

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.440
that was uttered-- I
don't know who said it.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.720
Someone, one of you
here, you might know.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.640
Someone is credited with
saying, "I don't like writing.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.340
I like having written."

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.500
And most authors of any
kind will relate to that.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.690
This book was not
hard to write in

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.530
that this was one of the
few times it didn't feel

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.990
as if were a giant term paper.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.490
One reason being
I was going to be

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.150
able to devote my
full energies to it.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.490
I actually wrote on a schedule.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.000
I read about, what
does John Updike do?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.080
What does Philip Roth do?

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.780
What does Grisham and King do?

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.560
What do they do?

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.637
They actually sit down
and write on a schedule.

00:06:17.637 --> 00:06:18.470
That's what they do.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.260
They get up in the morning,
they have breakfast, they write.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.650
They have lunch, they
go back, they write.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.260
Then they go on about
their merry way.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.630
Never did that before.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.860
So I arranged a
schedule for myself.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.990
Four days a week writing, and
one day a week that I called

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.430
Make Money Monday.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.970
Now, that was through my
"ESPN, Around the Horn,"

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.459
if you're familiar with
that, and maybe my Comcast,

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:38.000
which is the studio
up in Burlington.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.620
That's where I do
the Comcast at night.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.560
I tried to consolidate
them as often as possible

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.740
to have one day where I
could-- and which I do often,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.281
by the way, because
of the logistics.

00:06:45.281 --> 00:06:48.060
I live 40 miles one
way from Burlington.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.140
It's a shlep, believe me.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.890
I get sick of 128.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.420
I hate it.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.753
I'm so sick of looking at it,
and I can't get rid of it.

00:06:54.753 --> 00:06:57.740
So I had Make Money Monday.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.990
And then I wrote Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.290
and the occasional Saturday
when my wife was out of town.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.380
And I actually stuck to it.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.160
It was the first time
I had ever exhibited

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.890
any kind of discipline.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.890
And not only that, I
actually beat the deadline.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.400
Now, nobody does that, and I
certainly had never done that.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.070
But the actual deadline--
deadlines, they

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.560
give you a deadline and
it's like a speed limit.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.510
If the speed limit's 65, we
know you can go 70 safely.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.249
And you get a deadline
in print at a publisher--

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:23.790
they'll give you a
deadline, and they

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.100
know it's going to be
at least a month later.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.650
They know that.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.358
They build it in.

00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:27.380
It's like flight times.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.730
I actually made it because I had
a self-imposed deadline, which

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.780
was September 1, due to the
fact that my wife and I have

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.850
an annual little
trek up to Maine.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.380
And I wanted to go up there
with a clear mind and feeling

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.230
good about myself
and no pressure.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.070
So I did it.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.070
I got it done.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.010
I was amazed.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:47.980
I surprised myself.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.470
Now, of course, the editing
process takes place from that.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.800
And George Gibson is
a phenomenal editor.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.730
Brilliant guy.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.620
And he was able to help
me shape-- take this

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.930
from that original chapter
and put it in that chapter.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.300
And without rearranging
or writing any new words,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.000
I was able to
re-craft the book--

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.690
he was able to help me shape
the book into a coherent book.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.090
It is, as you'll see, it is
not a chronological book.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.390
It wasn't intended to be.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.390
I never wanted it to be.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.765
It wasn't going to be a book--
I was born on February 21,

00:08:16.765 --> 00:08:19.020
1946 and then right up to today.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.830
No, it's a thematic book.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.650
I thought I would break it
up into different experiences

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.780
in sports that I've covered,
and so it's a thematic book.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.420
And it also has several
personality profiles

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.570
of prominent Celtics such
as-- or Celtic-oriented people

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.390
such as Red Auerbach, Dave
Cowens, Larry Bird, and John

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.820
Havlicek; a chapter
on Chuck Daly, who

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.909
I had a very interesting and fun
relationship with from the time

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.140
he was at BC 45 years
ago; and Bob Knight.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.320
I mean, you can't go wrong
writing about Bob Knight.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.986
Everybody's fascinated
about Bob Knight.

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:52.210
And so I had my own particular
interesting up and down,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.630
up the graph, down the graph
experience with Knight.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.790
And I was able to
write about him.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.130
But George was able to craft
this so that the first half is

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.800
essentially, basically,
kind of chronological.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.810
It takes me from birth to--
and the column-- it takes me

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.364
from birth to the end of the
'87, '88 Celtics season when

00:09:14.364 --> 00:09:15.780
I-- it was the
last time I covered

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.520
the team on a daily basis.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.245
In '89, I became a
full time columnist

00:09:19.245 --> 00:09:22.820
and spent the last 25 years
of my career writing columns,

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.850
and then several features
too, which I think

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.120
are important to do.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.760
So the second half of the book
is more thematic-- chapter

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.450
on football,
chapter on colleges,

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.310
chapter on my life with
television, both local

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.350
and ESPN, chapter
on golf, et cetera,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.760
et cetera, international
basketball, the Olympics.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.230
And then tying it all together
with a little personal

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.356
look back about everything.

00:09:43.356 --> 00:09:45.313
And talking about my
father, which is something

00:09:45.313 --> 00:09:46.960
I'd never done
before, and it was

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.100
very-- he died when I was 11.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.120
And this was really
almost-- I won't go so far

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.490
as to say cathartic, but
it was more emotional

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.230
than I expected it
was going to be.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.210
So that's the logistics, if
you have the remotest interest

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.680
in how this thing
was put together.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.581
The career, I'm proud
of in the sense of I

00:10:06.581 --> 00:10:08.080
really did have two
distinct halves.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.380
The first half was with a strong
identity covering the Celtics.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.770
And I was very proud of that.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.240
And I loved it.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.480
I say in the book that if
I could turn the clock back

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.950
to January 1, 1980 and
to January, 31, 1989,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.610
professionally I'd
change nothing.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.660
The good, the bad,
the in between,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.790
I'd do it all over again.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.939
And I might even backdate
it to January 1, 1970.

00:10:28.939 --> 00:10:30.480
That's how much I
enjoyed that aspect

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.104
of covering the NBA--
being a beat man,

00:10:32.104 --> 00:10:34.660
traveling with the
NBA essentially.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.580
Also there was a year
of covering the Red Sox.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.240
A full year, '77.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.960
And that's a story
you'll find out.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.400
I was in between Peter
Gammons's stints at the "Globe."

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.410
So the second half is more
thematic and that's the deal.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.230
The highlight of the second
half, which I [INAUDIBLE],

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.820
is getting involved
in the Olympics.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.710
Now, that's something
that-- though growing up I

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.210
had an interest in
reading about the Olympics

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.385
as far back as the '56
Olympics, reading about them

00:11:00.385 --> 00:11:02.659
in "Sports Illustrated,"
I never associated myself

00:11:02.659 --> 00:11:04.450
with covering them or
thought that I would.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.420
I never gave it a
whole lot of thought.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.750
And when I stumbled
into them in '92,

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.380
when I went to
cover the Dream Team

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.430
and did a couple of
other pieces in addition

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.517
to the basketball pieces,
and fell in love with them--

00:11:16.517 --> 00:11:17.350
I love the Olympics.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.720
When they're somewhere
else-- we'll get to that.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.620
I know you're
going to ask what I

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.119
think about Boston
and the Olympics.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.510
I mean, at least,
I think you would.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.580
So I love the Olympics.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.000
I went to eleven
of them in a row.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.720
And six were
summer, five winter.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.790
And they provided me with a
whole different perspective,

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.460
so valuable.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.390
I used to look forward
to getting away

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.850
from our meat and potatoes
stuff in the middle of winter

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.890
for three weeks, going
somewhere, hopefully

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.580
going somewhere other
than-- Salt Lake was good,

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.770
but you want to go
somewhere with the Olympics.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.000
You want to get
out of the country

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.600
and go somewhere
and immerse yourself

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.440
in the entire experience,
come home kind of refreshed

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.805
and jump back into
your regular routine.

00:11:54.805 --> 00:11:55.930
And the same in the summer.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.090
And it was a great way to break
up the winter and the summer

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.160
in those Olympics.

00:12:01.007 --> 00:12:02.840
I really did fall in
love with the Olympics,

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.320
and there's quite a bit
about the Olympics in there.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.870
So with that said,
I'm hoping now

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.420
you might have some questions,
whether it's about the book,

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.045
whether it's about
sports, whether it's

00:12:14.045 --> 00:12:16.410
about the newspapers, whatever.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.610
I'm at your disposal.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.330
To anybody.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.670
AUDIENCE: We live in an instant
gratification society, right?

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.530
And even on your "Around
the Horn" experience,

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.040
you have 30 seconds to make
your point or less, right?

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.360
How do you think that that
has changed and will continue

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.980
to change the profession
of journalism and writing?

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.790
And what are writers
going to have

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:44.640
to do in order to keep
future generations engaged

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.810
to the point that they want
to read a 200 page book?

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.585
BOB RYAN: Oh boy.

00:12:49.585 --> 00:12:50.085
Thanks.

00:12:51.822 --> 00:12:54.030
I'll start with the first
one before I can figure out

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.988
how I can babble my way
through the second one.

00:12:58.497 --> 00:13:01.850
One of the things
that's happened-- and we

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.260
have certain culprits,
starting with talk radio--

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.300
is the lack of
perspective and the demand

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.200
for instance adjudication,
instant judgment,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.340
instant assessment
on everything.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.930
And it's certainly
not a good thing.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:22.340
Consider that in 1979, when
the first all 24-hour talk

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.750
radio devoted to sports
was WFAN, and that now,

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.260
35 years later, that is
the number one radio format

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:29.797
in America.

00:13:29.797 --> 00:13:32.130
It has surpassed country,
which was the previous holder.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.950
There are more stations devoted
to sports talk radio in America

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.120
than any other format,
which is stunning.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.700
In any big market there
are multiple stations.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.050
We have a great example here.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.010
We finally had a competitor
that challenged WEEI.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.780
Sports Hub 98.5 has done
that, and now they're

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.560
fighting back and forth
over supremacy now.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.830
And they probably
will for a long time.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.700
One of the things that sports
radio has proven, sadly--

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.260
and hosts have to
acknowledge it--

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.090
is that good is boring
and bad has sizzle.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:10.270
Negativity trumps positivity
by about a 10 to 1 margin.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.330
When a team is going
well, the calls

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:18.760
are repetitive and frequent, but
when things aren't going well,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.510
stand back.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.460
We had exhibit A here
after the Kansas City

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.550
game with the Patriots.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.400
And Brady's fate,
and the team's fate,

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.200
and I mean there's
nothing illegal about it.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.800
We had reasons to
doubt them, and I did.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.200
I wanted to see them
assemble an offensive line.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.400
We'll look into that later.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.750
Point being, it's back
to the point here.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:39.870
Perspective has been lost.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.080
One sport that has
really suffered from it

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.230
is baseball, because
baseball, with 162 games,

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.201
you can have long lulls.

00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:49.450
You can have 10-game losing
streaks and win a pennant.

00:14:50.439 --> 00:14:52.980
The best hitter is going to go
0 for 4 with three strikeouts.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.980
The best pitcher--
Clayton Kershaw anybody?

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.760
The best pitcher can get
lit up on certain occasions.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.250
That's the nature of the game.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.836
Baseball is not meant to be
micromanaged on a daily basis.

00:15:04.836 --> 00:15:06.960
It's meant to be looked at
with a little step back,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.749
whether it's a series
or a week or month,

00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:10.540
and then we can make
some proper judgments,

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.010
because there's so
many things that

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:17.590
go into the ebb and
flow of baseball season.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.740
Football, OK, once a week.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.250
There are only 16 games.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.250
It's totally understandable
that a football game

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.650
is completely micromanaged
when there are only 16 of them.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:31.040
And therefore, if everyone has
a disproportionate importance

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.010
compared to 1 out of 162.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.070
That's kind of obvious.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.903
And the same goes for
basketball and hockey.

00:15:35.903 --> 00:15:37.780
You need a little
bit of perspective.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:39.640
That's been lost.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.040
And it's not encouraged anymore.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.760
And writers get
swept up into it too.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.090
And so that's kind of
answering your question.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.390
That's one of the
negative by-products

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:59.080
of where we are-- the focus
on the day-to-day heat

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.180
intensity of sports interest.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.590
Now, technology-- and we
might as well get right to it.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.880
I mean, here I am at Google.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.080
Technology has been
a two edged sword.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.920
Technology made my life a
lot easier in so many ways

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.030
than writing a story,
sending a story.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.444
Writing this book, for
the first time, because it

00:16:16.444 --> 00:16:18.860
was the first book-- I hadn't
written a book in ten years.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.870
So it was the first
post-iPad era for me.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:26.210
The first post-iPhone era
for me with writing a book.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.760
And in contrast to
all those other books,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.080
going back to 1972 when
I wrote my first one,

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.160
the process was enhanced by
that little baby right there.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.680
Whenever I needed a fact
or a spelling or whatever,

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.660
a stat-- bingada, bingada,
bingada-- right there.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.409
I loved that.

00:16:44.409 --> 00:16:46.200
It was fantastic, and
it made my life easy.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.160
It's hard to imagine going
back 40 years on a typewriter

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.114
with carbon copy
and hoping, if you

00:16:54.114 --> 00:16:56.280
needed to find out something
and it wasn't instantly

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.519
available in an encyclopedia,
making a phone call

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.560
and maybe two days later
you get the information.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.280
That's where we were, writing
stories in those days.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:09.359
Now you have the instant
gratification of that.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.290
You used the word gratification.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.460
Yeah, instant
gratification is demanded.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.300
And it's very dangerous.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.980
I do think what we
went through here

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.300
could be a mini course
in a journalism school,

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.010
to look at how Boston reacted to
the first four games of the New

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.710
England Patriots season.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.800
And I was guilty.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.110
I was asked on the
air, on Comcast.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.480
Somebody might have even see it.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:35.286
After the Cincinnati
game-- how do

00:17:35.286 --> 00:17:36.020
you think they're going to do?

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.436
I said, they'll
be seven and nine.

00:17:37.436 --> 00:17:40.809
And that's because I had
no-- my mind couldn't wrap

00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:42.600
around the idea that
they could reconstruct

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.400
that offensive line,
it was such a mess.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.310
And they did it in
five nights, five days.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.230
I don't know how they did it.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.180
I still don't know
how they did it.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.440
And suddenly with a line,
Brady's Brady again.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.390
Isn't that nice?

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.810
So there's a lot more
of this aspects of this

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.330
that we could talk
about, but I just

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.590
think that the ability to step
back and accept that there

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:04.330
is an ebb and flow-- but I said
that the biggest sport casually

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.250
in this is baseball.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.190
It's absolutely baseball,
because baseball

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.960
with 162 games, it just
should not be micromanaged.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.251
Years ago, I suggested,
knowing it would never be done,

00:18:16.251 --> 00:18:18.000
but I really thought
it was the way to go.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.920
I really suggested
to my sports editor

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.060
that rather than cover
every game with a game story

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.870
that we should
cover it by series.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.540
You should wait and you
should provide information

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.030
about what happened in
the bare bones-- let's

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.260
say you have a three-game
series Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.179
Friday and Saturday and
Sunday, you go to the game,

00:18:38.179 --> 00:18:39.470
you assess all the information.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.440
Monday you have
an overview piece

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.775
about the weekend-- a series.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.690
But nobody's going to do that.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.910
Now, we have changed the
nature of game stories.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.690
And they're being phased out.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.789
But not to the full
extent that anybody

00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:55.330
would dare do what
I suggest and wait

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.840
until the series is
over in baseball.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.470
And then weigh in on the import
and the reality of the weekend,

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.310
but I think it would
be a great idea.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.810
Baseball.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.310
Yeah.

00:19:07.197 --> 00:19:09.280
AUDIENCE: So you've seen
a lot of incredible games

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.630
over your career
and over your life.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.520
If you could go back
and relive one game,

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.530
what's the greatest
game or series

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.694
that you've ever
personally witnessed?

00:19:18.694 --> 00:19:20.110
BOB RYAN: I'd have
to go by sport.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.010
I really do.

00:19:22.352 --> 00:19:23.670
I can't pick one.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.787
I have to go by sport.

00:19:25.787 --> 00:19:27.870
I am associated with
basketball more than anything

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:28.870
and then maybe baseball.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.620
But it's just so hard.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.017
And then within
basketball, there's the NBA

00:19:34.017 --> 00:19:34.850
and there's college.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:39.140
And I went to 29 Final Fours
and lots of tournament games.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:39.910
I loved March.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.420
I used to try to cover-- get
out there and be somewhere

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.220
for the entire month when I
was covering the tournament.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:51.780
But I have a fairly reasonable
answer for sport by sport.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.360
For football, the easiest one
by far, it's the snow game.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.100
It's the last game
in the stadium,

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.390
it's the Tuck Rule Game.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.140
And I immediately
decried the Tuck Rule

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.950
was an abomination
under the Lord.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.860
And it's finally
been adjudicated,

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.870
but it benefited us.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.090
And I didn't mind
it as much, though,

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.131
even though it was an
abomination under the Lord,

00:20:09.131 --> 00:20:12.220
that it was divine retribution
for Sugar Bear Hamilton and Ben

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.682
Dreith in 1976.

00:20:13.682 --> 00:20:17.300
And I was there for that
in the Oakland Coliseum,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.750
as it was known then, OK?

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.444
So you know the one
I'm talking about.

00:20:20.444 --> 00:20:22.110
And they were the
best team in football,

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.030
as I realized that day.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.405
And they got
screwed by the refs,

00:20:24.405 --> 00:20:25.590
and they didn't win in '76.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.410
So 25 years later, we finally
got divine retribution.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.140
Now we're even with Oakland, OK?

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.940
But it's a bad rule,
and they got rid of.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.746
A fumble-- fact.

00:20:32.746 --> 00:20:34.370
I'm going to just
digress very briefly.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.840
Because one of the things
in sports that absolutely

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.690
I am most mystified by,
and I pose this question

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.790
and never get an answer.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.480
At what point in
football history

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.340
did down by contact
come into play?

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.300
Because I guarantee you,
in the '50s and '60s,

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.340
we knew a fumble when
we saw it, and you

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.301
could fumble when that
ball hit the ground.

00:20:56.301 --> 00:20:58.800
Well, I don't know when they
put it in, but that's the rule.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.360
It takes weight off the
referees, of course,

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.340
makes it easy.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.540
Now with replay they can get
it right every single time,

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.340
because they can-- but
a fumble's a fumble.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.710
To me, a fumble should
be a ball is loose.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.860
When the ball was
loose, the whistle

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.730
doesn't blow until
somebody gets it.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.885
Now, if in the course
of trying to get it,

00:21:17.885 --> 00:21:21.480
you observe someone is
guilty of a little bit

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.720
too extra enthusiasm, like
a knee in somebody's [GRUNT]

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.435
or an elbow in their
nose, OK, you call it.

00:21:28.435 --> 00:21:30.910
You drop the flag, give them
15, even if they get it.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.880
But why don't
they-- I hate that.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.590
OK.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.160
Now, so the tuck-- Vinatieri's
field goal in the snow.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.260
If not the greatest field goal
ever, it's one of the two,

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.070
because Pat Summerall kicked a
very similar one for the Giants

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.220
in '58 that everybody in my
area-- I grew up in Jersey--

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:47.950
will remember.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:49.406
OK, that game.

00:21:49.406 --> 00:21:50.780
The import of it
was [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.946
That was my football moment.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:53.700
Basketball.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.840
The triple overtime game with
Phoenix in '76 still for me

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.850
resonates.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.220
There's so much
drama in that game.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.970
The Celtics played
the best they had

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.239
played in the entire playoffs
in the first 14 minutes

00:22:09.239 --> 00:22:09.780
of that game.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.070
They got up by 22.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.221
Phoenix would not go away.

00:22:12.221 --> 00:22:14.720
No matter what they did, they
could not get them to go away.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.469
And they finally come
back and tied it up,

00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:20.290
and we had this historic
three overtimes, including

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.477
John Havlicek's miracle shot,
followed by Gar Heard's miracle

00:22:24.477 --> 00:22:26.310
shot, followed by Ritchie
Powers, a referee,

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.750
getting attacked at
mid court by a fan

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.810
after the end of
overtime, the time out

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:35.285
that Silas called that
Ritchie Powers wouldn't call.

00:22:36.497 --> 00:22:39.080
And then finally Glenn McDonnell
coming deep, deep, deep, deep

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.663
off the bench to win
the game for them

00:22:40.663 --> 00:22:41.870
in this third overtime.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:46.115
That was my-- and then with
Bird, there's a ten way tie.

00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:47.400
You know, Bird era.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.050
Come on.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:48.650
But

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:49.690
the Heat game.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.150
You know, the game with the
97 degree Fahrenheit on Friday

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:52.650
night.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.080
May 8, 1954.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.420
May 6.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:55.920
Or not May.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.340
June 6, 1984.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.730
Game five.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.930
That was a mind over
matter such as I've never

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.180
seen because--
we'll get to that.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.800
But that game, and game
six in '86 against Houston,

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.470
which was Bird's own choice,
you'll read in the book,

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.622
as his favorite game because
he was "never more prepared."

00:23:14.622 --> 00:23:15.580
Isn't that interesting?

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.610
Why would he say that? "Never
more prepared" for a game.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.490
If you remember, game five
was the Sichting-Ralph Sampson

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:22.190
fight.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.314
And it was a lot of emotion
attached to that series

00:23:24.314 --> 00:23:25.460
as we came home.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.200
And Larry assured the
fans via the media,

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.030
as he did so well in those days,
everything's going to be OK.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:35.240
It was his version of
Aaron Rodgers's R-E-L-A-X.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.200
It was OK back in '86.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.700
Then he went out
and played the best

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.590
all around game I
ever saw him play.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.460
He was in every
aspect of the game,

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.375
including defense--
he was phenomenal.

00:23:45.375 --> 00:23:46.620
He was everywhere.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.470
OK.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:48.425
Baseball.

00:23:48.425 --> 00:23:49.970
It isn't one game.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.076
It's the totality of games
four and five and eight in '04.

00:23:53.076 --> 00:23:55.184
They've lost game three 19 to 8.

00:23:55.184 --> 00:23:56.100
We've all buried them.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:56.930
I wrote-- I killed them.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:57.620
And we had to.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.690
I said, you wanted the Yankees?

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.648
You've got the Red Sox.

00:23:59.648 --> 00:24:00.350
You happy now?

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.426
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:24:01.426 --> 00:24:03.300
So we know how that one
went in ninth inning.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.450
And the walk, the
steal, the single.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.889
Then we get around.

00:24:06.889 --> 00:24:08.180
Papi hits a game-winning homer.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.420
The next night--
oh, and excuse me.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.319
Later that day-- see, the
games ended on the same day,

00:24:13.319 --> 00:24:15.110
because the first went
into after midnight,

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.830
and the next one
started at 5:00 PM.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.820
So game five starts at 5:00
PM here, goes extra innings,

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:24.340
and the moment when
Wakefield comes in--

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.650
remember the history of
Wakefield the year before.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.310
And Wakefield comes
in and guy gets on it.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.512
And Varitek's catching.

00:24:30.512 --> 00:24:31.970
And of course, he
didn't catch him.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.190
It was the other
guy who caught him.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:38.850
And he wild pitches him
around to third base.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:40.225
And we're ready
for the next one.

00:24:40.225 --> 00:24:42.641
And he finally strikes out
Ruben Sierra [INAUDIBLE] inning

00:24:42.641 --> 00:24:44.490
and then Papi on a
ten pitch at bat.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.860
Bloops one to center off
Loaiza to win the game.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.980
The totality of the
emotional experience

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.140
of those two and the whole thing
was my favorite baseball moment

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.040
as a writer.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.330
As a fan, October
1, '67 still stands

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.650
as a culmination of a fan
experience for so many of us

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.930
that year that it still
is kind of over there.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.880
And finally hockey,
though not my sport,

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.790
I got on that moving
train in '11, 2011,

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.470
after the second series.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.700
Covered the Tampa Bay series
and covered the finals,

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.770
and that seventh game
against the Lightning, 1-0.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.000
No penalties.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.920
And the coach,
their coach, Boucher

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.500
saying that it was like
60 minutes of overtime.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.070
And it was.

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.700
It was tension-filled
beyond belief.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.250
And then going out to Vancouver,
getting down 0-2, finally

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.690
winning and being there.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.330
So the game was
that overtime game,

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.150
but the Phoenix-- not
[INAUDIBLE], that 1-0 game.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.590
But the whole
experience was-- you

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.090
know, that enabled me to be
able to say I'd covered all four

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.830
major championships, which is
something not everybody gets

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:42.330
to do.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.663
And I actually had covered
all four major championships,

00:25:44.663 --> 00:25:45.810
in a seven year period too.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.790
College basketball--
I'll go one more.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.902
Villanova-Georgetown
in kind of tie

00:25:52.902 --> 00:25:54.485
for first between
Villanova-Georgetown

00:25:54.485 --> 00:25:56.730
in '85 and Duke-Kentucky.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.300
The 104-103 game.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.300
The Laettner shot.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.980
Because that is
generally acclaimed

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.750
to be the best college
game ever played,

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.010
and I would certainly concur.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.848
Certainly the best
one I ever saw.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.500
Yes?

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.390
AUDIENCE: So, Bob, I often
listen to Bill Belichick answer

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:13.160
questions.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.320
And it's extremely painful.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.990
BOB RYAN: I want to [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.250
AUDIENCE: I'm curious.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:26.020
If he's not the most frustrating
athlete/coach to cover,

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.070
who might be?

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.770
BOB RYAN: No, he is
for the beat people.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.040
And there's a big distinction
between how the beat

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.240
people react to him and how
the columnists react to him.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.740
The beat people are
so totally frustrated.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.200
They need information.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.460
They need to know that
it was-- could you

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.122
be more specific than
a lower body injury?

00:26:45.122 --> 00:26:47.080
Could you be more specific
than that, you know?

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.330
They need to know things and
they need a lot of things

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.180
that they can't get from him.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.010
However, there is
a misconception

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:55.380
that he is always that way.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.500
He is not always that way.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.880
He is often that way.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.260
He's horrible on
Sunday after the game.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.164
I really mean he
shouldn't even bother.

00:27:02.164 --> 00:27:04.330
Don't even bring him out
there, because win or lose,

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.394
he's monotone and it's useless.

00:27:07.394 --> 00:27:08.810
He's a little bit
better on Monday

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.770
after he's seen
the film, the tape.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:14.560
As it goes on, by Friday, when
work's in and he's more relaxed

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.260
and they've got all the job
done, he's almost a raconteur.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.896
And if you push the right button
on football theory or history,

00:27:20.896 --> 00:27:22.770
or-- you know, he doesn't
mind hypotheticals.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.140
He doesn't mind talking history.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.130
He loves it.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.510
He has the largest private--
allegedly-- who knows?

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.600
Who could disprove this?

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.850
He's alleged to have the largest
private collection of football

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.110
books of anybody in the world.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.651
That if he sees a
football book or he

00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:36.380
hears about one or a
friend-- somebody, his kids,

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.124
or his wife, they know to get
it, add it to the collection.

00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:41.290
And he knows more about the
Browns, like Paul Brown,

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.902
than his son does, Mike, I
mean, he really is a historian.

00:27:43.902 --> 00:27:45.610
He's not that bad at
the end of the week,

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:48.710
but he's terrible for the beat--
but even in his worst days,

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.510
as a columnist, you
can write the scene.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.650
So if Belichick's at it again,
being monotone and being

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.750
not forthcoming, you can write
that and have some fun with it,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.250
you know.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.840
I mean, as a columnist,
I never went away empty.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.850
Now, Parcells would come out
almost the polar opposite

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.310
because he was a raconteur every
day, every day, for four years.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:14.970
I always said, I always wished
that I had somebody or somebody

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:19.110
had gotten annotated every--
transcribed every press

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.109
conference he had, from the day
he signed to the day he left,

00:28:22.109 --> 00:28:24.650
it would be a good football--
it would be a bestselling book.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.112
It would be a fabulous book.

00:28:26.112 --> 00:28:27.570
All the stuff that
he talked about.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:28.645
He talked about Broadway.

00:28:28.645 --> 00:28:29.960
He talked about horse racing.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.260
He talked about baseball,
talked about Bob Knight,

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.810
talked about football.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:34.810
He was fabulous.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.470
But just the total
opposite of Belichick.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.944
But for a columnist, I
didn't mind Belichick.

00:28:40.944 --> 00:28:42.110
But you're absolutely right.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.140
He is the ultimate
nightmare for a beat man.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.250
I've never encountered anybody
close to that in all my years.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:47.750
No.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.606
AUDIENCE: What is
the biggest rule

00:28:53.606 --> 00:28:54.980
change that you
would like to see

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.688
in either professional
sports or college?

00:28:57.109 --> 00:28:59.150
BOB RYAN: The biggest rule
change I'd like to see

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:02.010
is, you should only
need one foot in

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.270
to catch a pass in the
National Football League.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.980
I just can't believe you
should be making people

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.396
into Nureyev just
to catch a pass.

00:29:07.396 --> 00:29:08.580
That's one foot in college.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.621
It would make life a lot
easier for the referees.

00:29:11.407 --> 00:29:12.990
And I just don't
think it's necessary.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.122
I don't see the point.

00:29:14.122 --> 00:29:15.820
One foot's in OK in basketball.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.200
One foot's in OK in baseball.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.415
You know, it doesn't
matter in baseball.

00:29:18.415 --> 00:29:19.748
You catch the ball or you don't.

00:29:20.866 --> 00:29:22.240
But in football,
why do they have

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.680
to have two feet as
opposed to college?

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.680
I don't understand that.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.124
Baseball, it's not a rule.

00:29:28.124 --> 00:29:29.040
Well, it's a DH thing.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.610
Make up your mind, baseball.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:34.320
When we're playing inter-league
virtually every day now because

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.945
of the schedule,
it's preposterous.

00:29:35.945 --> 00:29:38.700
I mean, the way it
breaks-- and the way

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.740
it's going to go--
they'll keep it.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.730
The Players Association will--
they'll lay under that bus.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:47.300
They'll never give up the
DH, so give up and do it.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.381
I don't really have enough
knowledge about hockey

00:29:52.381 --> 00:29:52.880
to do it.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.685
And basketball.

00:29:54.725 --> 00:29:55.225
Rule change?

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.000
No, it's not.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.250
It's just interpretation.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:02.380
I mean, all this emphasis
on flopping and the fines?

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.330
Just referee better.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.020
I don't think it's that hard.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.440
I really don't.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.810
I've been watching this
league close up for 45 years.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.810
I don't think it's-- I
think competent referees,

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.240
knowing who the players are,
what their proclivities are--

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.960
you knew [INAUDIBLE]
was going to flop.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.950
So let him lay there.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:16.647
You know?

00:30:16.647 --> 00:30:18.730
Every once in a great
while, he might get run over

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:19.450
legitimately.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:19.970
Too bad.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:21.553
That doesn't make
up for the 500 times

00:30:21.553 --> 00:30:22.810
he get away with it, right?

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.140
I mean, I don't see
the problem that it's

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.650
that big a deal that
it should be a fine

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.420
or that referees can't
tell the difference.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.470
I just don't get it.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.050
I don't have a change-- but
I mean, one foot in is--

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.694
that really-- and of course--

00:30:38.694 --> 00:30:40.360
But I already mentioned
the other thing.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.400
A fumble's a fumble, damn it.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.670
And so I mean, you just
saw one the other day.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.467
Catch the ball, it
falls down, ball

00:30:46.467 --> 00:30:48.050
pops out because
you're at the ground.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.250
Why isn't that a fumble?

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.040
Hold the damn ball.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.410
That drives me crazy too.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:54.432
So it's kind of a
tie in football.

00:30:54.432 --> 00:30:55.890
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned Parcells

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.306
as a great example
of somebody who

00:30:57.306 --> 00:30:59.610
gave really good
press conferences.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:03.060
And the Jets have another
one, but their fortunes

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.050
seem to be going in
opposite directions.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:09.610
So the question really is, is
it just that the Jets had better

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.500
players and have
worse players now?

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.410
Or has society changed?

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.100
Has the glare of the
spotlight on coaches

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.130
changed such that it is, in
fact, not possible for a coach

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.720
to survive for
five years and yet

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.650
be as open and
loquacious as Parcells?

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.690
BOB RYAN: Well, the
cycles have diminished.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.015
No question.

00:31:28.015 --> 00:31:30.390
I'm trying think-- who is the
longest tenured-- Belichick

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.060
has got to be, right?

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.560
The longest tenured--
who is second?

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.295
Anybody know?

00:31:33.295 --> 00:31:33.920
I have no idea.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.810
AUDIENCE: Marvin Lewis.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:35.150
BOB RYAN: Who is?

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:35.810
AUDIENCE: Marvin Lewis.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:36.380
One year.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.730
BOB RYAN: Marvin Lewis is
second what, eight or nine?

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:38.830
AUDIENCE: No, one year less.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:39.490
BOB RYAN: One year less?

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.195
He's been there that long?

00:31:40.195 --> 00:31:41.270
Wow, I didn't realize that.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:42.160
AUDIENCE: He was hired
out of Baltimore--

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:42.993
BOB RYAN: All right.

00:31:42.993 --> 00:31:45.300
Red Auerbach identified
this, believe it or not,

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.450
30 years ago, that
cycles were shortening.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:49.550
Even then, he saw this coming.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.660
This "you need the new
voice," whatever it is.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:55.870
Coaches get burned out.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.710
The players tune
you out, et cetera.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.750
But now that's not the reason.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.800
It's the instant
gratification of the owners.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.170
As soon as an
owner-- some owners.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:07.820
There are these
impetuous owners.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.290
They've spent-- they're a new
breed compared to the old guys.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:15.470
You know, the Ralph Wilsons
as opposed to the Snyders.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.120
You know, Snyder
comes in, and he's

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.703
spent all this money
for the Redskins.

00:32:18.703 --> 00:32:19.700
And he wants now.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.220
Ralph Wilson came
into the NFL when

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.750
you paid $25,000 as
an entry fee in 1960.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.330
That's what it was.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.850
And dies at 94 several
months ago as the owner

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.150
of a-- sitting on a goldmine.

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.670
But it look 54 years for that
goldmine to accumulate for him.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.335
But other guys come in, and
they want instant gratification.

00:32:39.335 --> 00:32:41.460
And especially if someone
has an immediate success,

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.820
they say, why can't we have it?

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:43.730
How come he has it?

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.520
And that's true in football,
baseball, basketball.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.450
It's so true in all of them.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:47.160
There's no question.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.110
That's the big change.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.635
It's not so much
that the players

00:32:49.635 --> 00:32:50.780
are tuning out the coaches.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:53.980
So coaches are casualties.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.950
They don't get it--
they become casualties

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:58.450
with some of these
impetuous owners.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:03.310
And if there's a majority of
those kind of new breed owners,

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:07.170
if you will-- nouveau riche--
whether it's from technology

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:10.750
or whatever it's from, then you
get these coaching casualties.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.420
Say this town.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.780
I mean, you really should
applaud the Celtics ownership,

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:23.340
because Doc Rivers lost 18
games in a row in 2006--

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.560
or that team did.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.184
Team lost 18 in a row
in the 2006-2007 season.

00:33:28.184 --> 00:33:29.850
Now, there were
mitigating circumstances

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:32.370
that I think we--
the press knew.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:34.000
Pierce was hurt.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.370
Missed most of them.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:39.420
They would have won a few with
him, but they lost 18 in a row.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.110
Doc didn't go anywhere.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.570
He was around the next year
to win a championship, thanks

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.210
to Danny's manipulations
on that draft day.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.840
These people have shown
remarkable patience I think,

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.210
in the long way, and
they believe in Danny.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.360
So I applaud them.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.672
But that's it to me.

00:33:56.672 --> 00:33:57.380
It's very simple.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.500
They're just impetuous,
impetuous owners.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.560
I mean, they have
huge investments.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.730
And some of them have
[? debt ?] service.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.355
And they really have
strong concerns.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:09.460
And the coaches-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.120
It's easier to fire one
coach than fill in a blank.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.929
Twelve players in
basketball, 18 in hockey.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:16.820
Or 23, whatever the roster is.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.400
53 in football and baseball 25.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.217
So that's what they do.

00:34:22.217 --> 00:34:23.800
AUDIENCE: On the
topic of the Celtics,

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.929
you covered them day-to-day
during a pretty great time

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.840
to be doing that
I would imagine.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.020
Could you talk a
little bit about how

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.860
the Celtics' relationship
with this city

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.690
has transformed over
the last 20 years

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.639
or so as it's been
more up and down

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:41.046
and they haven't been that
consistently great team

00:34:41.046 --> 00:34:41.670
that they were?

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.139
And one quick follow up.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:46.000
Where do you think that my
favorite player, Paul Pierce,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.850
ranks in the history
of Celtics' greats?

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.980
BOB RYAN: I think I've been
here long enough to size

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.900
up the ongoing dynamics, OK?

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:02.120
It was, up until a very, very
recent time, the last decade

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.640
but even more recently, the
Red Sox were number one.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.060
And then we could start--
and everybody else

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.100
was fighting for the two,
three, and four spots.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:15.144
And in the winter, it
was always a Bruins town.

00:35:15.144 --> 00:35:17.560
And the only time the Celtics
reigned supreme, ultimately,

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.910
was during the Bird era.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.411
Even during the
Havlicek-Cowens era,

00:35:20.411 --> 00:35:22.451
that was the big bad Bruins
they were up against.

00:35:22.451 --> 00:35:24.390
And they weren't winning
that battle at all,

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.015
even though they won
two championships.

00:35:26.015 --> 00:35:28.300
The Bruins did as
well in that era.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.937
And so now, the
Patriots are number one,

00:35:31.937 --> 00:35:34.520
and whether the Red Sox are one
or two is a subject of debate.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.170
But who can argue that
the consuming passion now,

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.250
number one overall
is the Patriots?

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.920
And that's an amazing
transformation

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.394
because in 1993, when Parcells
came, they were fourth

00:35:45.394 --> 00:35:47.560
and so distant a fourth,
it wasn't even an argument.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.990
But in the winter,
let's be honest,

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.090
it's a hockey town at the core.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:51.770
It's still the greatest
hockey town in America.

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:53.970
Strong high school hockey,
the college situation,

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:55.220
the ability to have a Beanpot.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.616
No other city could have one.

00:35:56.616 --> 00:35:58.740
To have those four schools
within three mile radius

00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.614
play that tournament.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.580
There's no other city
that comes close to that.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.200
But we are a hockey culture
in the winter still.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.170
We've never been a pure
basketball culture.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.124
Never.

00:36:08.124 --> 00:36:10.540
In the Russell era, they were
lucky to draw 7,000 to 8,000

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.790
a night in the regular season.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.930
And then they would fill
the house in the playoffs.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:16.670
And then in the
Cowens-Havlicek era,

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:20.300
they maybe got it up
to 12,000, 13,000,

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.650
but never consistently sold out.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.340
Bird era, yes, they reigned
supreme thanks to Larry.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.810
And now they've fallen back.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.580
I saw a survey the other day.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.680
What's your favorite team?

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.660
And Patriots were one, Red Sox
were two, Bruins were three,

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.220
and the Celtics had 6%.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.341
That make sense to me.

00:36:42.341 --> 00:36:44.090
I'm a basketball guy,
though it pained me.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:45.381
I write about this in the book.

00:36:45.381 --> 00:36:47.580
I was an impetuous little
brat in the early '70s.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.690
I was always whining about
the Bruins, believe me,

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.820
and now people couldn't
officiate the Celtics.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.290
I mention that.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:55.284
Paul Pierce.

00:36:55.284 --> 00:36:56.450
Well, let's start with this.

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:57.825
I've said this--
the first time I

00:36:57.825 --> 00:37:00.590
said it was in 2002 after
that game in Indiana

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.100
when he got 40 points
with 20 free throws.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.394
And I said, kids,
don't try this at home.

00:37:06.394 --> 00:37:07.810
You know, this is
only one guy can

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.050
do-- he is the greatest
individual scoring

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.570
machine in Celtics history.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:13.180
Not the best player.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.740
He's not Bird,
he's not Havlicek.

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.720
But definitely the best
guy with the most ability--

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.790
varied ability to get
the ball in the basket.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:21.790
Nobody more than Pierce.

00:37:23.026 --> 00:37:24.150
He's a three point shooter.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.070
He's a great driver.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:26.850
He's a great finisher
on the break.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.370
He has all these
up fakes and tricks

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.290
that go right back
to the '50s and '60s.

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:33.150
He and Manu Ginobili are
the two most throwback guys

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.400
in the league to
the '50s and '60s

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.370
with the modern ability
to shoot threes.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:38.130
Don't foul them.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.505
He goes to the
line and he fouls.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.270
He was an excellent
rebounder for a guard.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:45.620
Excellent rebounder.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.300
And he was a terrific player.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.830
We got a Mount
Rushmore of Celtics,

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:52.400
which you can't argue, OK?

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.990
Which is Russell, Cousy,
Bird, and Havlicek.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.140
But if you want to
go to a five man,

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.000
now the fun starts
because you've

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.940
got three candidates
for the fifth,

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.760
and he's one of them along
with McHale and Cowens.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.590
And Sam Jones right on
the rail, believe me.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.760
But I'm a big booster
of his in this regard,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:16.720
and to me I think that's
pretty high praise.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.450
I can't put them on the Rushmore
when Rushmore means four.

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:23.670
You can't get there, but he
might be the next one up.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.150
And I always say
this-- people forget--

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:29.800
Paul Pierce came literally
that close to dying.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.080
If the knife goes
into that chest

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.710
that far apart the
other way, he's dead.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.250
And I thought that he came
back so fast from that.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.410
I thought it was--
I was in awe that he

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:45.160
was able to function after
that as well as he did.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.750
And we watched him grow, and I
think he became a real leader.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.440
Now, he had that one horrible
moment in Indianapolis

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.750
with the gauze on
the face that looked

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.392
like the troops at
Valley Forge that night.

00:38:56.392 --> 00:38:58.600
That was-- I don't know what
got over him that night.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.650
I have no idea what
he was thinking about.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:03.340
That was his one
aberrational moment.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.607
Other than that, I think
he was a great Celtic.

00:39:05.607 --> 00:39:07.190
AUDIENCE: So what's
one thing that you

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.490
knew was going to happen?

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:11.560
That you called right from
the beginning and then

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.470
it didn't happen.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.470
The worst thing that
you've swung and missed on.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.900
BOB RYAN: Well, I
thought when Jim Rice hit

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:24.325
the ball in October 1,
1978, a ball was going out

00:39:24.325 --> 00:39:26.240
of the ballpark,
but that was wrong.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.760
So we won't go there.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:29.360
I don't know.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.000
I really don't.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.652
I mean, they had a player
named Garfield Smith in 1969

00:39:33.652 --> 00:39:35.110
that I really
thought my first year

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.865
that-- second year, second
year-- that I really thought

00:39:37.865 --> 00:39:39.740
was going to be a really,
really good player.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.379
He was a good rebounder.

00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:42.670
Turned out to be an utter bust.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:43.860
And he's immortalized.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.215
He did something that
won't be exceeded.

00:39:47.215 --> 00:39:49.370
It can only be matched.

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:52.260
And this is the gospel
truth that he did this.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:57.420
He had the famous free throw
air ball hat trick in Phoenix.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.080
He missed the rim on all three.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.370
All three.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:02.680
He was 6 for 31 lifetime
free throw shooting.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.630
You can look it up.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:04.840
I kind of blew it on him.

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:10.175
But other than that, I'm
just trying to think.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.907
You know, I mean, ball players--
Red Sox players come and you

00:40:14.907 --> 00:40:16.990
think some of them are
going to be good and great,

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:18.656
and they don't turn
out to be very good.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.900
Honestly, I'm not trying to--
I don't have an answer to that.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.550
Garfield Smith jumps out at
me, but I was young then.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.235
I developed more perspective.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:30.590
AUDIENCE: One more
quick question.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.800
So Boston and New
England in general

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.520
have so many iconic sports
figures, from Tom Brady

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.620
all the way down to
Russell and everybody else.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.910
If you had to pick one person
to represent Boston sports,

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:45.530
who is it?

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.250
And why do you
choose Larry Bird?

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.100
BOB RYAN: I'm just
trying to think about--

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.770
that question is a different
one in the slant to it?

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:59.630
Representing the city, I
might go Havlicek over-- I

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.610
might go Havlicek
as a representative.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:04.040
You know, scrub him up,
bring him home to mother.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:04.680
No problems.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.471
That kind of thing.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.430
Larry had some rough
edges, though I love Larry.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.070
And Larry grew to love Boston.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.940
But when you stand up there in
front of thousands of people

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:18.661
at City Hall and you utter
the S word in regard to Moses,

00:41:18.661 --> 00:41:21.160
you know, that's a little bit
the lack of polish, as we say.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.230
Everybody loved it, of course.

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:25.420
Bobby Orr is still the
most revered figure

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.240
in my time in Boston.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:32.060
As of 50 years I've been
here-- post-date Ted Williams.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:35.970
That whole other worship of
Ted of the elder generation

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:37.170
is something else, you know?

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.280
So in my time, the 50 years
I've been here since I set foot

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:46.010
in BC in 1964, the most
revered athlete I think

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:47.560
is still Bobby Orr.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.610
And rightly so because
he's the greatest hockey

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.210
player that ever lived.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:51.710
Period.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:57.070
And so there-- and it's just the
fact that he ended at age 30.

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:59.265
Today, if he came along,
that first knee scope

00:41:59.265 --> 00:42:01.140
would've been done and
he would've been fine.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.710
But that's true of a
lot of guys in history.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:03.330
We know that.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.690
But it's very, very true of Orr.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:06.860
I'd have to settle him.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.310
He never made a
misstep in public.

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:11.340
He represented-- to
this day, he just

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.987
exudes class and positivity
and everything else.

00:42:14.987 --> 00:42:16.320
AUDIENCE: So him over Tom Brady?

00:42:18.912 --> 00:42:19.870
BOB RYAN: Brady's fine.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.328
Brady-- there's nothing-- Brady
hasn't done anything wrong.

00:42:22.328 --> 00:42:29.110
I would say that people--
this isn't going outside.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:32.679
I mean, I don't want
this misinterpreted.

00:42:32.679 --> 00:42:33.178
OK?

00:42:33.178 --> 00:42:35.080
I mean, I'm going to
have to be very careful.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.930
Somebody's-- I got the good guy
over here and the bad guy over

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.180
here telling me don't do this.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.763
But please understand
what I'm saying.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.180
If he hadn't married the
most successful model

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.010
in the world-- if
he had married,

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:48.200
if not necessarily
the girl next door,

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.570
but a regular person-- he
always dated celebrities.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:53.810
That was always the case.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:55.098
That's the only thing.

00:42:55.098 --> 00:42:57.306
To some people, that might
put them off a little bit,

00:42:57.306 --> 00:42:57.805
you know?

00:42:57.805 --> 00:42:59.976
But I mean, other guys
think it's fantastic

00:42:59.976 --> 00:43:01.850
that he never dated
anything but celebrities.

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:09.630
His money literally is tip
money in their family account.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:13.160
It's the discretionary
fund money.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:15.760
It's all it is.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.740
They can go anywhere
they want in the world.

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.212
He can pay for it
out of his-- it

00:43:19.212 --> 00:43:20.920
makes him feel good
that he can help out.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:24.495
You know I'm right.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.154
That must be funny.

00:43:27.154 --> 00:43:29.070
And the other thing is,
the houses they build.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.300
It's like Jeter.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.104
What does Jeter need
with that monstrosity

00:43:35.104 --> 00:43:36.520
down there, that
they have already

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:40.659
nicknamed St. Jetersburg
in West Coast of Florida.

00:43:40.659 --> 00:43:41.200
I don't know.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.439
Anyway, Brady would be
a fine representative.

00:43:44.439 --> 00:43:45.730
He always says the right thing.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:46.940
He's a bright guy.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.968
But I'm going to stick with Orr.

00:43:49.882 --> 00:43:51.090
AUDIENCE: A couple of things.

00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:53.380
Quarterbacks.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:56.920
Are they management
or are they labor,

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.260
and how much should they be
standing up for the rest?

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.720
And this is not a
new topic, right?

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.570
I mean, even in the '90s
they had this whole QB club

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.910
thing where they tried to
split off from the players

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.618
union in terms of
making their own money.

00:44:07.618 --> 00:44:10.602
BOB RYAN: So who are you saying
about-- is who management?

00:44:10.602 --> 00:44:11.560
AUDIENCE: Quarterbacks.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.790
How much should they
stand with the players,

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:16.700
and how much should
they stand with the team

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.050
when it comes to, for
example, negotiations?

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:22.390
BOB RYAN: Well, I used
to kid, and it's probably

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:23.440
a good rule of thumb.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.148
Never trust an owner
any farther than you

00:44:25.148 --> 00:44:27.100
can throw the building
or the stadium.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.280
I mean, for the most part.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.750
None of them are
purely altruistic.

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:33.530
They're all in it-- they want
to make some money anymore.

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:34.510
There's no doubt about it.

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:36.884
But some are more willing to
lose more money than others.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.430
You have to sympathize.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:46.630
Once again, in sports--
in a sport like football,

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:50.890
with the short career
life, the danger of injury,

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:53.125
the idea of, yeah,
your career could

00:44:53.125 --> 00:44:54.750
end at any-- look
what happened Sunday.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:58.670
Ridley and Mayo out for
the year on one play.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:00.090
Not cumulative.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.630
You have to have some
sympathy for the players.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.900
The pendulum-- this is so
analogous to real life labor

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:09.710
management going back to Samuel
Gompers and John L. Lewis

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.520
and the whole labor
movement in America

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.907
going back to the late
19th century and Sinclair

00:45:15.907 --> 00:45:16.990
Lewis and the whole thing.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:21.160
I mean, you had the
management, and you

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.110
had the oppressed workers.

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:25.100
I had to laugh when
Marvin Miller did

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.710
say, as he did say
when he took over,

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:28.610
that the baseball writers were
the most oppressed workers he

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:29.690
had ever represented.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:33.510
And he was an economist
who represented

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:34.880
all kinds of union people.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.490
But remember this.

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:38.320
Marvin Miller took over in 1966.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.010
You know what the--
show of hands.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.570
Anybody know?

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:44.500
What do you think the minimum
salary in baseball was in 1966?

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.900
Minimum salary by the virtue
of their collective bargaining

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:48.620
agreement.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.516
1966.

00:45:49.516 --> 00:45:50.890
We had indoor
plumbing, remember.

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:51.460
Color TV.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.285
The whole bit.

00:45:53.422 --> 00:45:54.005
AUDIENCE: $50?

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.594
BOB RYAN: $6,000.

00:45:57.594 --> 00:45:59.260
And they had, of
course, no free agency.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:45:59.880
No rights.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.190
The reserve clause
bound them forever.

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.970
The whole thing.

00:46:06.144 --> 00:46:07.060
Things had to improve.

00:46:08.659 --> 00:46:09.950
It was arbitration that did it.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:11.325
It was Peter Seitz
the arbitrator

00:46:11.325 --> 00:46:13.030
that overturned the
Messersmith case.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:16.060
That's the big seminal moment
that changed everything.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.670
As much as Marvin Miller was a
strident defender of the union

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.624
rights, that arbitrator Peter
Seitz is the one who actually

00:46:21.624 --> 00:46:23.790
is the person that they
should all be thanking today

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:25.630
for the way the world is now.

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:28.990
So owners didn't
do it willingly.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:31.244
They fought every change
every step of the way.

00:46:31.244 --> 00:46:32.910
There were two guys--
believe it or not,

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:35.326
they were very interesting
because they're very distinctly

00:46:35.326 --> 00:46:37.700
different out there,
outsides people.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:41.030
The two owners who were so
far away from their mainstream

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.130
of all other owners
during their time,

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:45.640
and they did
overlap to a degree.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:50.940
Bill Veeck and Charlie Finley,
both of whom at different times

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:55.220
advocated total free
agency, thinking

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:59.270
that it would all settle itself.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:02.770
OK, and that was,
oh my god, aghast.

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:05.700
They were always ahead of their
time and always iconoclastic.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.410
So by and large, you've
got to go players.

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:09.580
Yeah.

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:13.525
Because there's an awful lot
owners that still-- I mean,

00:47:13.525 --> 00:47:15.070
it's just the
nature of the beast.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:15.925
That's all.

00:47:15.925 --> 00:47:17.800
AUDIENCE: Why didn't
you list Wellington Mara

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.910
in that list of
owners as the guy who

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:22.535
said, "We're going to share
all revenue nationally

00:47:22.535 --> 00:47:24.675
in our sport as opposed
to other sports?"

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.216
BOB RYAN: What about
Wellington Mara?

00:47:26.216 --> 00:47:26.830
I'm sorry?

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:28.760
AUDIENCE: As an owner who is
so different from the rest.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.176
BOB RYAN: Well,
the Mara family is

00:47:30.176 --> 00:47:32.570
invested in football
for eight decades.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:33.630
OK?

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:37.190
Tim Mara got the team
back in the '30s.

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:38.150
It's like the Rooneys.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:39.700
The Rooneys are the dynasty.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.490
Whether or not Art
Rooney actually

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:44.355
won the team in a poker game is
part of the apocryphal story.

00:47:44.355 --> 00:47:46.800
It wasn't quite that, but it
was something close to that.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.820
And now the Rooneys
are still there.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.710
His grandsons are
still running the team.

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:53.320
There's some wonderful owners--
the Griffiths in baseball

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:58.100
were the last people I remember
who-- well, I don't know.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:59.340
It's true of Rooney and Mara.

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.840
They make their
living from the team

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.786
as opposed to-- the Griffiths
were the last ones in baseball.

00:48:03.786 --> 00:48:05.410
And of course, they
were always accused

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.182
of being penny
pinching, you know.

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:11.050
But I think the
Maras are considered

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:12.685
to be excellent
owners as owners go.

00:48:12.685 --> 00:48:14.560
AUDIENCE: I guess the
point was that, I think

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.720
he was the one who
said that we're

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.600
going to share national revenue,
which was against, for example,

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.080
what baseball did and perhaps
as the single decision that

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.100
causes the success of football.

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.560
The flat salary cap and
shared national revenue on TV.

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.170
BOB RYAN: I mean, I
think the Maras are

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:32.420
high on the list of good--
I think Kraft-- hey,

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:36.500
you know-- I think Kraft
has by and large been

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.770
a great owner for the fans.

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:39.360
I'm well aware of
his business issues.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.250
I know his litigation forever.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:43.490
I'm well aware of all that.

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:45.110
And I know he has
a tremendous ego.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.010
And I know he wants to
walk down the street

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:48.440
and have people say,
hi, Mr. Kraft, thank you

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.090
so much for everything you've
done for us and all that.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:50.860
He does.

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.020
I know he does.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.850
But he's been a pretty
damn good owner.

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:55.920
And he got that stadium built.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:01.530
And yeah, it wasn't completely
without the help of the public,

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:04.310
but it wasn't as much
public aid as other stadiums

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:06.530
and other arenas
in other cities.

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:08.350
By and large,
we're pretty lucky.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:11.220
But in general terms, look,
this is a capitalist society.

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.480
We have a system in which the
ownership owns and the labor

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:20.610
works, but still
owners will get away

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:23.630
with everything they
can get away with.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:27.220
And if they weren't forced
into it kicking and screaming

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:27.790
at times.

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:31.560
Now, watch out for the
next-- in two years

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:36.270
when the NBA association
can opt out of the agreement

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:38.620
now that they've got this
whopping new TV contract.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.990
And if the owners
didn't realize that was

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:45.200
going to be a byproduct of this,
then they are rather foolish.

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.750
But I'm sure they do.

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:50.754
So be prepared for a delay
in the start of the 2016-17

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:51.420
season, I think.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:54.640
I'm telling you right now,
[INAUDIBLE] we know that.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.250
Anybody else?

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.750
Yes?

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:59.560
AUDIENCE: I do want to get your
opinion on the Boston Olympics.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.990
BOB RYAN: OK, good.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.960
I love the Olympics.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.784
I think Boston would
be a tremendous site.

00:50:04.784 --> 00:50:06.200
I can just imagine--
what you need

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.690
for a successful Olympics,
over and above the venues,

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:11.290
is gathering places
and places for people

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:12.610
to go in the off hours.

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.830
Picture the Commonwealth
Mall from Kenmore Square

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:19.730
up to the Garden as people from
all over the world strolling.

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:22.190
Maybe there'd be
kiosks, whatever.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:24.220
Temporary kiosks,
it would have to be.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:25.530
Picture City Hall Plaza.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.320
Picture the waterfront as
it is getting more and more

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:34.400
transformed into something
really nice by 2024.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.570
There's lots-- I think
it'd be fantastic.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.140
Then take a trip to
Beijing or Athens

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.360
and look at the stadium
sitting there doing nothing.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.900
And ask Athens how
they feel about it now.

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:49.560
Ask Beijing.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.800
I mean, if Bill Gates
or Warren Buffett

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.380
wants to write a check for
us for the billions that

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.260
would take, OK.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.660
But the logistics are daunting.

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.090
I can't believe what
I'm hearing from people.

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.330
They have to build a stadium.

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:04.280
They're not going
to use Foxborough.

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.280
They have to build--
where would they put--

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.620
and what happens afterward?

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.000
The Patriots aren't
moving there.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:09.720
Who's going to play there?

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:10.380
The Revolution?

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.080
No.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:11.670
The Red Sox?

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:12.170
No.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:15.160
Eastie versus Southie
on Thanksgiving Day?

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:15.850
Is that it?

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:16.350
What?

00:51:18.339 --> 00:51:19.880
Here's the things
that always happen.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.060
The Velodrome sits
there and nobody

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.340
knows what to do
with the Velodrome.

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.390
The swimming pool is oversized
and gigantic, sits there,

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:26.010
and nobody knows what to
do with the swimming pool.

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:28.343
The Chinese don't even know
what to do with the stadium.

00:51:28.343 --> 00:51:29.357
The birds nest stadium.

00:51:29.357 --> 00:51:30.690
They don't having to do with it.

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:36.540
The reality-- look at what's
happening with the Winter

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:37.040
Olympics.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:41.050
We have two autocratic
countries left.

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:42.330
Oslo opted out.

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:45.310
We've got Kazakhstan,
and we've got Beijing.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:46.810
Winter Olympics in Beijing.

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:48.540
They're talking about
hundreds of miles

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:51.400
away for skiing
events and everything.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.374
But they seem to be
the only countries now

00:51:53.374 --> 00:51:55.040
that are willing to
absorb all the costs

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.270
and do what they have to do.

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:58.410
I mean, they displaced
how many hundreds

00:51:58.410 --> 00:51:59.850
of thousands of
people in Beijing?

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:00.558
We'll never know.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.680
I love being there,
but I always--

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.970
but I think it's preposterous.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.330
I don't know what they
are smoking or drinking

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:13.240
or-- I have no idea
if they've ever

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.540
really thought this out fully.

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.470
This guy John [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:17.040
And also, do you like the
idea that the guy that's

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.415
the [? protagonist ?] just
happens to be in construction?

00:52:19.915 --> 00:52:20.930
I mean, seriously.

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:24.390
I mean, this isn't even--
he's not hiding anything.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:25.549
He's this construction guy.

00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:27.090
He would profit
enormously from this.

00:52:29.201 --> 00:52:29.700
No.

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:30.408
The answer is no.

00:52:30.408 --> 00:52:30.920
OK?

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.340
No.

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.340
And I'm worried about the
future of the Olympics

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.800
because the 2022 thing is scary.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.610
That that's all we've got left,
and nobody-- I was hoping Oslo

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:43.130
would say yes, but they're
smart people and they said no.

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.950
And it may have to
just run its course,

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:49.800
the Olympics as we know it.

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.160
But I do love them.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:57.460
I would recommend if you can get
to Rio, it's an amazing take.

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:00.500
I love the take, as we say.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:01.000
Yes.

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:04.900
AUDIENCE: This will be the
last one from me, I promise.

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.910
So I wrote an op
piece about-- we

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:10.320
were putting up a
statue for Bill Russell.

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:15.600
And it talked a lot about the
history of racism in Boston

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.610
and how that has
affected the NBA.

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:22.040
And you were a huge
advocate for the NBA

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.150
back in the day when they
couldn't fill the house up

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:29.550
because of the Bruins who were
in large part a white team.

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:32.040
Do you think that
racism has played

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.380
that kind of pivotal role?

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:35.080
What's your opinion
on that and how

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:40.050
it's affected the history and
the future of the NBA here

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:40.580
in Boston?

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.320
BOB RYAN: There was no question
that when Dave Cowens came,

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.870
suddenly sprung up a fan base
that had not patronized them.

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:53.030
Spent money to see them.

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:55.857
He certainly became a
very popular player,

00:53:55.857 --> 00:53:57.440
and I don't think
there's any accident

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:02.780
that the Celtics started to
acquire a sounder, stronger,

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.950
wider fanbase because the
new exciting player happened

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:06.460
to be white.

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:07.330
Ridiculous.

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:10.070
I don't think it's any
accident that-- and I remember,

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:14.290
I actually wrote this once about
the-- in the Bird-McHale era,

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:18.170
that the greatest
cheers in the building

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:21.830
are when McHale blocks the
shot of a big black star,

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:27.605
specifically Dr. J. It's
foolish to deny that impulse.

00:54:28.497 --> 00:54:30.330
I think we've evolved
and we're much better.

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:32.190
The Red Sox thing, the
history is shameful.

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:34.645
The Yawkey history is shameful.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.230
And right into the
'70s, the players

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:42.080
who will tell you how much they
did not like Boston-- Reggie

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.449
Smith was the most
outspoken one of all.

00:54:44.449 --> 00:54:45.490
It got better and better.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:48.700
And Mo Vaughan would tell
you totally the opposite

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:53.640
now, because he came up in the
'80s-- in the '90s, excuse me.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.912
We've evolved to a degree.

00:54:54.912 --> 00:54:55.870
The whole busing thing.

00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:57.910
Boston's national
image was horrible.

00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:59.610
There were players,
and there may still

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.540
be some left for all I
know, who had things written

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.710
in their contract in baseball
they couldn't be traded here.

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:04.880
This was one of the cities
they didn't want to come to,

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:05.463
black players.

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:12.230
But the NBA being-- the
composition of the NBA being

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:16.580
whatever percentage it is black
is a whole different matter

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:17.080
now.

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.880
Everybody's is used to
the idea that the odds are

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.795
that 8 or 9 or 10 of the players
on the court at any given time

00:55:23.795 --> 00:55:24.860
are going to be black.

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:26.860
And people are used to
that who love basketball.

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:30.757
But we had a bad history
here, no question about it.

00:55:30.757 --> 00:55:31.840
The Red Sox were shameful.

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:32.840
We all know the history.

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.397
The last black player and all
the other stuff I just cited.

00:55:35.397 --> 00:55:36.730
But I'm sure it affected people.

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:40.570
But I think this fortunately
younger generation did not

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:44.990
bring-- did not carry over
the prejudices of their elders

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.740
here.

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.556
I think that was-- I
remember going back

00:55:47.556 --> 00:55:48.830
to the book, "The
Greening of America."

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:49.954
That book was very popular.

00:55:49.954 --> 00:55:53.530
It talked about how the younger
generation would evolve.

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:55.300
And I think, in that
case, in this city,

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.060
racial relations have evolved
better because the younger

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:00.565
generation shed the
prejudices of their parents.

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.710
Just an observation.

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:05.520
AUDIENCE: On the
racism thing, recently

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.660
with the Clippers
and actually more

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:11.380
interestingly the Hawks,
what's going on here?

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:13.270
Especially for the
Hawks, for what

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:16.940
seemed like a somewhat racist
but somewhat innocuous thing,

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.370
he just quietly disappeared.

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:21.800
I mean, has the pendulum swung
all the way to the other side

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.760
where now--

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.110
BOB RYAN: Well, in general
terms, a lot of pendulum

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:26.070
has swung a long way.

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:30.000
Things that could be said
and written 25 years ago,

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.060
you can't do it now.

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:31.830
You cannot do it.

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:33.280
I'll give you an example--
Oh, the Hawks thing.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.970
We're talking about
the owner saying

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:38.990
that they-- the
black fans-- they

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:42.470
wanted a season ticket
holding white population

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:44.880
because the black fans
don't buy season tickets.

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.782
And they scared
away the white fans.

00:56:46.782 --> 00:56:48.490
And the music scared
away the white fans.

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:49.804
I mean, oh my God, you know.

00:56:49.804 --> 00:56:50.720
That was hard to read.

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:51.670
It really was.

00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:54.360
Accompanied by the
scouting report.

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.260
Talking about Luol
Deng that there's

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.072
too much African in this game.

00:56:58.072 --> 00:56:59.549
Oh boy.

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:01.340
Just when you think
you're beyond all this,

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:02.423
this thing rears its head.

00:57:02.423 --> 00:57:04.080
My opinion on
Atlanta, by the way,

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:04.780
is that isn't the real issue.

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.900
The issue is that it's
just a lousy sports town.

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.660
And they've been there 46
years, and they've never

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:09.535
gotten to the finals.

00:57:09.535 --> 00:57:17.430
And people are just never come
and adopted that team the way

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:18.870
they could or should.

00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:21.560
I was going to say
something about-- oh, hell,

00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:22.600
I forgot about it.

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.690
I'm sorry.

00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:25.015
I was going to play off that.

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.940
Oh, yeah, 25 years ago or more.

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:29.710
30, I don't know.

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:30.860
Maybe more.

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:33.470
I was writing a piece that was
common to-- these things were

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:34.310
very common.

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:37.020
And I wrote one for
Inside Sport magazine.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.360
And it was about the
all-black black team,

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.655
the all-white white team,
the all-black white team,

00:57:41.655 --> 00:57:43.030
and the all-white black team.

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.800
Guys who played-- the guys
who have the funkiest games,

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:46.952
the all-black black team.

00:57:46.952 --> 00:57:49.410
The all white team, guys who
had the whitest game, and then

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:50.750
the crossover players.

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:52.460
You couldn't print that now.

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:54.030
You could not get
that in print now.

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:55.440
Nobody-- you could not do it.

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:57.900
The players all got it.

00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:58.900
They always got it.

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:02.150
It's still truth in the NBA
that the white man's disease

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:06.842
is the best ongoing
joke in the NBA.

00:58:06.842 --> 00:58:09.300
Woe be to the black player who
has the white man's disease.

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:12.300
He's going to get razzed by
his team forever, et cetera.

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:16.330
But the public-- but you can't
even do that anymore and not

00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:18.875
have some special interest
group jumping all over you.

00:58:18.875 --> 00:58:21.250
You can't even do that anymore,
even though the league is

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:23.660
perfectly tuned to the
idea that the NBA is

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:27.180
the only element--
maybe not the only,

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:29.500
but one of the most prominent
areas of our society

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.280
where the fact of the matter
is that the white man is judged

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.600
to be inferior by definition
and has to prove himself.

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:39.600
And everybody in the league
knows it at every level,

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.980
but you can't say that
in public anymore.

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:43.940
So yeah.

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.690
We've gone-- we're in such
a PC frightening world,

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:52.690
and humorless world, and
special interest world.

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:56.144
And I speak as a left of
center person, trust me,

00:58:56.144 --> 00:58:57.560
but I get a little
bit frustrated.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.005
I mean, with some
of this nonsense.

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.820
I couldn't write that
story today, it's too bad.

00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:03.960
It was a pretty good story.

00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:08.180
Well, we've gone
through our hour.

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:09.610
I am not going anywhere.

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:10.364
You may have to.

00:59:10.364 --> 00:59:11.780
So I mean, I've
got plenty of time

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:13.790
if anybody wants to linger.

00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:15.460
But thank you for coming.

00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:16.720
I really appreciate it.

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.510
Let me just say one
thing about the book.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:19.926
Nobody asked me a
question, so I'm

00:59:19.926 --> 00:59:23.190
going to give you my little--
what I hope you take away

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:27.120
from the book is that I
am somebody who was almost

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:31.020
programmed to do what I did
by virtue of my background.

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:34.180
And that I enjoyed it
and I still like it.

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.820
And though you hear
about how many writers

00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:43.044
get jaded and cynical and
they don't care about who

00:59:43.044 --> 00:59:44.460
wins and loses and
they only write

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:47.450
about people and all that
stuff, I'm not that guy.

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.665
And I still love the
sports, the games.

00:59:49.665 --> 00:59:51.290
People talk about
writing about people.

00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:52.850
Well, we wouldn't care
about these people

00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:54.060
if it weren't for the game.

00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:56.230
The core of it is that all
these people are involved

00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:59.730
in playing a game, no
matter what the game is.

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:02.839
And so I just would try
to reflect that I'm really

01:00:02.839 --> 01:00:04.880
grateful and happy and
lucky that I got to do it.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.800
And I hope I can share
that enthusiasm with you

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.550
throughout by reading the book.

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:11.940
So thank you very much for
your attention and coming

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.470
and thank you for having me.

01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:15.920
[APPLAUSE]
