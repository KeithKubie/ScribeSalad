00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.840
Hi.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.470
I'm Mano Marks with the Maps
Developer Relations team here

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.110
at Google in Mountain View.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.320
I am going to talk to you today
about the Google Maps

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.530
SDK for iOS and specifically
about some new marker

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.400
management features that
we added to the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.340
SDK in version 1.2.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.980
So in version 1.1, when you had
a map, when you wanted to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.040
add a marker you added the
marker from the map object.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.640
Let's take a look at what that
code actually looks like.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.805
You can see here in older
versions, 1.1 and before, you

00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:55.850
would create a GMSMarkerOptions
object and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.540
create a CLLocationCoordinate
object.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.290
And then with MapView,
you would call

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.780
addMarkerWithOptions and give
it the options object.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.050
We don't do that anymore.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.510
The reason that we don't do
that anymore is because we

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.260
wanted to give you a lot more
control over marker objects.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.040
Let's take a look at what
code looks like today.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.250
So you can see here, I've got
two arrays, two immutable

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.780
arrays, and what I'm doing is
I'm just adding random markers

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.160
into those arrays.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.510
And you'll see what I'm doing
is I'm creating the marker

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.850
object, GMSMarker object,
separate from the map.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.430
What this allows you to do is
then assign the marker to any

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.060
map object that you want to
use in your application.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.280
It also allows you to do
interesting things, like

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.780
create your own marker
management tools and

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.240
techniques, you can create
your own quadtrees or

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.780
clustering algorithms, or
anything that you want, which

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.210
wasn't previously easy to do
with the Google Maps SDK.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.860
So you see here, each
marker that--

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.480
I'm adding 10 markers--

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.890
and every other marker I'm
adding making it green.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.010
And you'll see here, we also
added to this add marker.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.950
You could add colors to your
marker using the marker image

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.010
with color.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.180
And so what that looks like here
is you see I have red and

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.850
green markers being
added to the map.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.300
And this allows me to do things
like walk through one

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.130
or the other of the arrays and
just turn on or off each

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.830
marker by simply assigning
the map to nil.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.600
So when you want to assign a
marker to a map, you just say

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.180
marker.map equals this
particular map view.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.030
Or you assign it to nil.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.450
The marker objects still exists,
it's still something

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.620
that's around for you to use,
and you can assign it back to

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.200
the map when you want to.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.740
So you'll see here,
that allows us to

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.760
do things like this.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.710
I've got this simple one here.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.570
Here, I can turn off all the
markers by simply assigning

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.640
them map.nil.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.260
I can turn on all the red or I
could turn on all the green,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.330
because they're in
separate arrays.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.220
So pretty simple but powerful
change that gives you a lot

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.800
more control over how you manage
markers in the iOS SDK.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.900
So that's it.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.510
That's your shortcut
for today.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.450
Thanks for tuning in, and
we'll see you next week.
