the robots of the cartoons and movies

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040
the robots of the cartoons and movies
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.310
the robots of the cartoons and movies
from the 1970s are going to be the

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
from the 1970s are going to be the
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.799
from the 1970s are going to be the
reality of the 2020s and there are two

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
reality of the 2020s and there are two
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.020
reality of the 2020s and there are two
real drivers behind this first is

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030
real drivers behind this first is
 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.500
real drivers behind this first is
mapping belief space historically it's

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510
mapping belief space historically it's
 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.960
mapping belief space historically it's
been really difficult to be able to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
been really difficult to be able to
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.000
been really difficult to be able to
instruct robots to do things like

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
instruct robots to do things like
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.849
instruct robots to do things like
grasping grasping might seem like a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
grasping grasping might seem like a
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.550
grasping grasping might seem like a
pretty straightforward thing to do but

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
pretty straightforward thing to do but
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960
pretty straightforward thing to do but
it's actually very complex

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
it's actually very complex
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.080
it's actually very complex
mathematically and algorithmically to be

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
mathematically and algorithmically to be
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.299
mathematically and algorithmically to be
able to instruct robots how to do that

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309
able to instruct robots how to do that
 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.610
able to instruct robots how to do that
and so what this mathematical

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
and so what this mathematical
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.250
and so what this mathematical
breakthrough in mapping belief space has

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
breakthrough in mapping belief space has
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.220
breakthrough in mapping belief space has
done is it has taken water historically

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
done is it has taken water historically
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.729
done is it has taken water historically

if he stumbled into this interview is he

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979
if he stumbled into this interview is he
 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.850
if he stumbled into this interview is he
is he would ping the cloud and he would

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
is he would ping the cloud and he would
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.550
is he would ping the cloud and he would
get instructions from the hive mind that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
get instructions from the hive mind that
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.039
get instructions from the hive mind that
is there algorithmically and he would

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
is there algorithmically and he would

is there algorithmically and he would
then know to excuse himself to do so in

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
then know to excuse himself to do so in
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.109
then know to excuse himself to do so in
English and to though then go clunk away

so what does this mean what this means

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610
so what does this mean what this means
 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.190
so what does this mean what this means
is that the robots of our youths and of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
is that the robots of our youths and of
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.350
is that the robots of our youths and of
our imaginations don't have to have

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
our imaginations don't have to have
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.300
our imaginations don't have to have
millions of dollars of incredibly

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
millions of dollars of incredibly
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.120
millions of dollars of incredibly
sophisticated hardware and software in

dumb devices so long as they are

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
dumb devices so long as they are
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.740
dumb devices so long as they are
connected to the power of the cloud so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
connected to the power of the cloud so
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.450
connected to the power of the cloud so
what's the significance okay so they're

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
what's the significance okay so they're
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.969
what's the significance okay so they're
cheaper so what the big significance

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
cheaper so what the big significance
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.389
cheaper so what the big significance
here really goes to labor so let's think

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399
here really goes to labor so let's think
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.889
here really goes to labor so let's think
about the difference between humans and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
about the difference between humans and
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.219
about the difference between humans and
robots and their costs humans don't have

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
robots and their costs humans don't have
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.260
robots and their costs humans don't have
a lot of capex but they have a lot of

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
a lot of capex but they have a lot of
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.619
a lot of capex but they have a lot of
effects so the upfront costs costs you

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629
effects so the upfront costs costs you
 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.830
effects so the upfront costs costs you
know maybe your employer by

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
know maybe your employer by
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.449
know maybe your employer by
see some business cards maybe he gets

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459
see some business cards maybe he gets
 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.040
see some business cards maybe he gets
you a computer for work or something

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050
you a computer for work or something
 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.589
you a computer for work or something
like that not a lot of capex not a lot

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599
like that not a lot of capex not a lot
 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.290
like that not a lot of capex not a lot
of upfront costs but a lot of op ex

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300
of upfront costs but a lot of op ex
 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.780
of upfront costs but a lot of op ex
every two weeks you want to get paid

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790
every two weeks you want to get paid
 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.140
every two weeks you want to get paid
right

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150
right
 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.949
right
a lot of salary a lot of op ex robots

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959
a lot of salary a lot of op ex robots
 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.539
a lot of salary a lot of op ex robots
come with and diametrically opposed

you've got to buy the robot 10 n but

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709
you've got to buy the robot 10 n but
 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.339

then relatively little op X you can work

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349
then relatively little op X you can work
 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.740
then relatively little op X you can work

join a union or get sick they don't

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060
join a union or get sick they don't
 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.390
join a union or get sick they don't
expect a salary and so what's happening

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400
expect a salary and so what's happening
 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.610
expect a salary and so what's happening
right now is we're seeing new
