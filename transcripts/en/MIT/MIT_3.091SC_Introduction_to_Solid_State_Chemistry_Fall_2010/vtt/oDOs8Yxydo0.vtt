00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.300
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.260
OK, settle down.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.710
Settle down.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.860
Let's get started.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.740
So last day we started talking
about diffusion.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.540
Diffusion is a solid-state
mass transport by random

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.420
atomic motion.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.150
I made the first point last day
and today I'll make the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.820
second point.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.350
We'll see why it's random
atomic motion.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.530
We reasoned that we
could describe

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.920
the ingress of material.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.655
Here I'm showing a concentration
profile.

00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:56.310
A profile is nothing more than
a plot of something as a

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.880
function of position.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.870
So, this is looking
at, for example,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.330
the doping of a wafer.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.740
This is the free surface
at x equals 0.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.780
As we go to the right,
it represents depth.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.080
And we fix the concentration
at the surface and the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.470
material tails off to zero
deep inside the specimen.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.010
Fick in 1855 annunciated the law
of diffusion, shown here,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.590
that says that the rate of
ingress expressed by the flux

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.740
is proportional to the instant
gradient in concentration.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.730
And the constant proportionality
is the

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.680
diffusion coefficient.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.400
This is where all the material
science lies.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.120
It's inside the D.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.450
That's what we're going to
talk about more today.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.480
And so we see things tail off
and what we want to do is

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.905
figure out what the mathematics
are that'll allow

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:51.355
us to render this thing into a
functional representation.

00:01:51.355 --> 00:01:54.410
Because all we know right now
is that we've got something

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.480
tailing off.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.140
Ok?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.580
And so this is the gradient
multiplied by the diffusion

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.230
coefficient and you can
see that the red line

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.850
represents the flux.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.170
The gradient is maximum at the
surface, so the flux is

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.770
maximum at the surface.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.300
And as we move farther and
farther into the piece, the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.680
gradient in concentration
becomes less steep, which

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.140
means the absolute magnitude
of the flux becomes less

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.780
steep, and we go deep inside
where there is no doping yet.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.920
The variation of concentration
is constantly 0, so the slope

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.840
is zero, which means
the flux is zero.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.380
So the two sort of track,
one and the other.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.930
And we recognize these are
negative slopes since the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.150
minus sign is here.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.630
Even though we have a
negative slope, we

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.560
have a positive ingress.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.930
And then the other thing that
we realized was that the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.500
diffusion coefficient has a
temperature dependence.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.130
And the temperature dependence
looks like this.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.280
It's an exponential of some
kind of a characteristic

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.320
energy divided by the product
of -- this is the gas

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.050
constant, this is not the
Rydberg constant.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.980
The gas constant is simply the
Boltzmann constant per mole.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.130
So if you take the Boltzmann
constant, multiply it by the

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.160
Avogadro number, you get this.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.210
But if you see something times
T, you know it's got to be

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.880
either gas constant or
Boltzmann constant.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.360
This two-letter character string
has to have something

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.970
akin to a Boltzmann constant,
otherwise you don't end up

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.250
with an energy term.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.510
And this in the top is
a barrier energy.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.160
It's a barrier energy to
diffusion and out here we have

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.310
the pre-exponential.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.515
Unfortunately we didn't give
it the letter F in honor of

00:03:32.515 --> 00:03:33.860
Fick, it's just D naught.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.330
And so there it is.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.200
So if we take this equation and
we plot it, natural log of

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.580
d versus 1 over T, that'll
linearize the equation, and we

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.130
end up with something that
gives us a straight line.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.320
And the slope is minus Q over
R, where this Q is some kind

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.980
of a barrier energy.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.810
And the R is the gas constant
or the Boltzmann constant.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.320
So this is the gas constant.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.960
It's on your table
of constants.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.360
It's got a value in SI units
of 8.314 joules per mole

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.360
Kelvin, OK?

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.740
Just the Boltzmann times
Avogadro number.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.730
So now I want to invite you
to join me in some pattern

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.860
recognition.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.510
If I give you the temperature
dependence of a quantity that

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.850
looks like this , in other
words, the logarithm of that

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.300
physical parameter versus
1 over T, gives

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.700
you a straight line.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.640
You know from the work that we
did on chemical kinetics, this

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.370
is the representation
of something that is

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.860
an activated process.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.650
Remember the box that would fall
on its side, and it had

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.020
to go up on its corner?

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.250
So we had some physical sense
of what activation is.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.620
Now this has a log, something
versus 1 over T dependence.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.550
This represents some kind
of an activation energy.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.790
An activation energy.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.810
But what's the activated process
that's going on here?

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.800
So that's where I want to take
you into the atomistics.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.890
So here's a cartoon taken from
one of the readings.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.700
And it shows a set of atoms here
and the atom next to the

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.350
vacancy wants to move
into the vacancy.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.130
And you can see the artist's
rendition is showing that in

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.190
order to get from the current
position into the vacant

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.300
position, it's got to squeeze
through this narrow channel.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.650
And it takes energy to move
through that channel.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.010
And there's an activation
barrier

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.330
associated with that motion.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.040
Can you see when the atom
is sitting right

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.550
at the saddle point?

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.250
The system is highly activated
because it's pushing out

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.170
against those atoms. And then
finally it falls into the new

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.090
slot and the energy drops.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.560
So the activation energy is
associated with moving through

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.760
this saddle point.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.440
So what really happens here,
I'll tell you right now.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.950
First of all, we have to
recognize that the system is

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.030
depicted there, because it's a
freeze frame, but we know that

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.150
above 0 Kelvin, everything
is in motion.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.230
So the only way we can
rationalize what's going on is

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.310
to, first of all, recognize
that we

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.960
have a pulsating lattice.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.590
We have a pulsating lattice.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.410
Everything's vibrating.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.750
And what's the heartbeat?

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.900
What's the idle speed?

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.220
I've told you this before.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.070
Everything that's going on in
this room has an idle speed, a

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.190
heartbeat, of 10 trillion
times a second.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.360
That's the Debye
frequency, OK?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.630
The idle speed or
the heartbeat.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.140
The heartbeat is called
the Debye frequency.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.470
Here's frequency, lowercase nu,
in honor of Peter Debye.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.310
And it's on the order
of about 10 to the

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.270
thirteenth per second.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.720
10 to the thirteenth Hertz.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.670
That's 10 trillion.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.300
So 10 trillion times a second
atoms are going like this.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.430
Pulsating.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.380
All right?

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.500
So what has to happen for
that operation to occur?

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.950
Well, I've got an atom here,
vacancy next door, but because

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.960
it's close packed the atoms
on either side close in.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.230
There's no way this can
squeeze through.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.360
But, imagine, 10 trillion
times a second.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.610
If I'm lucky enough to see the
moment when the atom above

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.240
pulsates up, the atom below
pulsates down, a channel can

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.950
open up and then this thing
can squirt through.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.930
Now, that doesn't happen
every time.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.620
If it did, history
would have ended.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.260
At 10 trillion times a second,
it's all over for everybody.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.790
Right?

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.390
So what happens?

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.080
What's the frequency at which
we will get this unique

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.290
combination?

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.050
It turns out that frequency,
noted gamma, is called the

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.230
jump frequency.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.550
That's the jump frequency.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.260
And the jump frequency is on the
order of about 10 to the

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.980
eighth Hertz.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.530
10 to the eighth Hertz, which
is about 100 million.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.690
So if you take the ratio of
the Debye frequency to the

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.300
jump frequency, you see you get
a value of about one try

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.940
in about 10 to the fifth
is successful.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.980
One try in about 10 to the
fifth is successful.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.320
And that explains what's
going on here.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.430
So, what now does that
mean in terms of Q?

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.900
What's the breakdown of Q?

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.940
Well, clearly, Q, the activation
energy for

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.220
diffusion, must involve
both the energy to

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.170
form the vacancy --

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.720
I'm going to call it delta Hv,
and that's the energy for

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.940
vacancy formation --

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.300
if you don't have vacancies,
you cannot have motion --

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.750
plus the delta H sub
m which is the

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.450
energy for atom migration.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.425
So you have to form the
vacancies and then you've got

00:08:51.425 --> 00:08:53.910
to squeeze through those
saddle points.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.330
So that's how we get
a sense of it.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.250
And I think I've got
another slide.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.340
OK, so they're I've simply put
the markings on for you so you

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.670
can see the atoms above
and below jumping

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.540
in the right direction.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.370
That allows the atom on the left
to squirt to the right.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:16.090
Now, this is also related
to energetics.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.300
It's related to energetics
because the energy to form a

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.920
vacancy and the energy to
squeeze through those saddle

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.450
points must be related to
the binding energy.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.880
And what else is related
to binding energy?

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.770
Melting point.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.790
So, this is an elegant plot
that simply shows that the

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.540
energy -- these are all FCC
metals: lead, aluminum,

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.760
silver, gold, copper,
and iron.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.380
They're all FCC on
this chart here.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.620
Iron has both BCC and
FCC, but this is

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.600
comparing apples to apples.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.060
And you can see that there's
lead melts at 327, aluminum at

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.360
660, silver 980,
all the way up.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.560
Iron 1535.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.780
And you can see that the
activation energy for --

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.300
that's this Q-value --

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.610
the activation energy
for diffusion scales

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.590
with melting point.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.330
Again, an indication that this
analysis makes sense.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.060
And then, here's the other
one, the interstitial.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.670
If you have interstitial
diffusion you've got plenty of

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:16.260
interstitials, so you don't
have to pay the penalty to

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.340
create the interstitial, but
it's much, much more difficult

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.390
to squeeze through
the saddle point.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.810
So, it turns out that activation
energy for

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.100
diffusion by interstitial
means is still

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.980
fairly highly activated.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.160
So this is in the case
of substitutional

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.860
systems, all right?

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.090
This is for substitutional.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:40.220
Substitutional atoms. What
do I mean by that?

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.980
An atom that sits on
a lattice site.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.290
If an atom sits on a lattice
site, it has to jump to

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.510
another lattice site, which
means there needs to be a

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.960
vacant lattice site.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.660
On the other hand, if we're
talking about interstitial

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.380
special atoms --

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.720
not substitutional atoms,
interstitial atoms --

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.130
the assumption is that there's
plenty of interstitial sites.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.890
There are very few systems that
I can think of where the

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.980
interstitial sites are so
heavily occupied that this

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.380
assumption is invalid.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.860
So in that case, you
don't have to

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.920
pay for vacancy formation.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.400
It's simply equal to the
enthalpy, which we know is

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.310
analogous to the energy
for a condensed

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.420
system of atom migration.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.440
Atom migration gives you the
whole story and it goes back

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.480
to the same picture,
and so on.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.480
Now, I said it's random walks,
so let's look at another one.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.400
So, this is an interesting
example.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.890
This is self-diffusion
in cobalt.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.120
Cobalt has a number
of isotopes.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.780
One of them is 59 and
one of them is 60.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.380
60 is a radioisotope.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.400
Cobalt 60 is a radioisotope and
it's used in a variety of

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.670
technical endeavors.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.600
And so what we've got here is
a sandwich of cobalt 59 --

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.310
cobalt 60 and cobalt 59.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.320
So even though cobalt 60 has
radioactivity and it's got a

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.670
different number of neutrons in
the nucleus, chemically it

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.750
is identical to cobalt 59,
just as carbon 14 is

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.850
chemically identical
to carbon 12.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.800
So there's no concentration
gradient.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.830
Fick's Law says it's
supposed to go by

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.860
concentration gradient.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.400
The concentration gradient is
zero across that piece.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.540
And yet if you wait for
long enough, you will

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.570
start to see --

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.970
the dark atoms here are meant to
represent cobalt 60 in the

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:26.850
sandwich --

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.560
after some period of time, the
cobalt 60's will move outward.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.980
And if you wait long enough,
the cobalt 60 concentration

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.530
will be uniform throughout
the specimen.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:39.930
So what's going on?

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.390
There's no chemical
concentration gradient, and

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.730
yet over time, the cobalt
60 spreads out.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.530
And the answer is this is
happening by random walk.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.030
We've got the pulsating
lattice.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.710
Pulsating lattice.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.220
10 trillion times a second those
atoms are vibrating and

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.440
there's going to be
some vacancy.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.050
All of a sudden an atom
falls into a vacancy.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.610
And the mathematics of this --
look at this, this is no

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.570
accident -- this curve here
represents something that

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.760
looks like a Gaussian
distribution.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.230
At any given time, the amount
of cobalt 60 that's veered

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:14.210
from the center band can be
portrayed by the Gaussian

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.020
distribution, the bell curve.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.450
And what's the physical model
for the bell curve?

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.110
It's the drunken sailor.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.530
Or I guess I have to be PC.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.370
I'm not going to just
pick on sailors.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.650
Maybe it's the drunken cougar,
the soccer mom

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.460
that went out drinking.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.110
OK, so what happens with the
drunken cougar, she comes to

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.950
the door, and she starts
to walk, all right?

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.200
And then she walks one way or
the other way, until she

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.200
finally falls.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.510
And if you go through the number
of steps that it'll

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.310
take before the drunken sailor
falls, you get this

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.120
distribution.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.980
It's an old physics problem.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.540
The drunken sailor problem.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.880
And it's a normal
distribution.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.930
And that normal distribution
tells you that everything's

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.730
going about by random jumping.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:02.740
Random jumping, according
to this, all right?

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.450
So that's why we say
that diffusion is

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.150
a random walk problem.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.110
Before I turn this off, I want
you to take a look carefully.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.345
What's wrong with this
textbook cartoon?

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.480
Any ideas?

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.260
It's a substitutional
system, right?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.250
It's cobalt and cobalt.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.860
This is absolutely impossible.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.840
What's wrong with it?

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.450
There are no vacancies.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.580
There are no vacancies.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.020
It's impossible.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.460
There's no vacancies
to jump into.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.980
This thing is jam-packed, so
it's physically unrealistic

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.390
from a thermodynamic
standpoint.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.460
There has to be some finite
population of vacancies.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.320
Given this system, there's no
way that the black atom could

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.860
jump into the neighboring site,
because you'd have to

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.700
have the entire system open up,
and the chances of that

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.170
happening are vanishingly
small.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.340
So it just shows you, just
because something costs 150

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.120
bucks and is pressed between two
hard covers doesn't mean

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.160
it's full of truth, OK?

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.430
Be careful here when
you look at this.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.280
So, again, the artist
needed to be guided.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.610
We need to put a few of these
things out, just to give

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.920
symbolic recognition to
the fact that we need

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.220
to have some vacancies.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:12.665
OK.

00:15:12.665 --> 00:15:15.150
All right, let's keep going.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.670
Let's keep going.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:16.670
Here is some data.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.670
Here is some data.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:18.410
Various data.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.490
This is diffusion.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.280
This is the logarithm of the
diffusion coefficient

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.050
versus 1 over T.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.050
So let's look at the top.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.430
This is hydrogen in iron.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.940
So temperature increases
from right to left.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.320
So, go up, up, up, up, up.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:36.200
And roughly 900 degrees
Centigrade, iron changes from

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.040
BCC to FCC.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.790
And you know from our previous
unit, the number of nearest

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.110
neighbors in FCC is greater,
so there's less

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.110
void fraction, right?

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.840
So that means that it's much
more difficult to move.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.160
And you can see, first of all,
the order of magnitude drop in

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.860
the diffusion coefficient, and
also, it's subtle, but the

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.660
slope is steeper, because the
activation energy for

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.600
diffusion is steeper in a
closer-packed system.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.570
This is carbon in iron.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.880
Same thing.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.560
Relatively gentle slope at the
same temperature, there's a

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.190
phase change to FCC and it takes
much, much more energy

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.870
per unit increase in temperature
to get the

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.265
comparable increase in the
value of diffusion

00:16:19.265 --> 00:16:19.680
coefficient.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.950
This is iron, self-diffusion
in iron.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.680
So this would be radio
tracer iron in iron.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.620
Very much lower.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.640
You see these values are up
around 10 to the minus 5, 10

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.310
to the minus 6.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.340
This is down to 10 to the minus
11, 10 to the minus 12

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.950
centimeters squared
per second.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:38.180
Iron diffusion changes at the
transition temperature.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.480
Now iron going through
FCC iron.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.330
Here's the last one.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:41.680
Look at this one.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.790
This is carbon in graphite.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.620
So how does carbon --
suppose I had some

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.410
carbon 14 in graphite.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.670
What's the bonding
in graphite?

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.180
Silence.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.310
It's covalent.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.740
It's sp2 hybridized.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.860
It's really strong bonds.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.440
The activation energy --

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.900
you know, forget just jumping
through that saddle point --

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.550
you've got to break those
covalent bonds.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.140
It's very, very high energy
to get carbon to

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:09.950
move through graphite.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.780
And so you see very, very low
values and very, very steep

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.030
temperature dependence.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.320
Now, there's another way
to think about this.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.980
Again, this is now looking
at the atomistics.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.125
So this is the same material
trying to indicate that if you

00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:29.310
use Fick's Law, moving in from
the surface into the bulk, we

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.410
have a certain front.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.480
So this is some isoconcentration
line.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:39.300
So we could take this value off
of the graph arbitrarily.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.820
So they're saying c
greater than c i.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.620
Because it trails off
to zero, right?

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.590
It's asymptotic.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.450
There's no sharp cut-off here.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.560
It trails off.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.550
So what they're doing in that
graph is arbitrarily saying,

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.200
let's call this ci.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.330
And where's the front at
concentration ci, given a

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.050
constant value of cs
at the surface?

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.900
And you can see that there's a
near-constant rate of advance

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.960
through the bulk.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.590
But along the grain boundary you
go much, much farther in

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.830
the same amount of time.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:09.730
Why?

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.770
Because the atoms in the grain
boundary are not bounded the

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.500
same way as the atoms
in the bulk.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.080
There's this gap, this
misalignment.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.585
And so, it's easier to make that
jump, and you can see you

00:18:20.585 --> 00:18:22.410
get much, much more advancement

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:23.790
along the grain boundary.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.110
And this is a crack.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.690
And this material covers
the surface.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.030
You get surface diffusion.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:34.140
Surface diffusion is very
important in many processes,

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.120
and it's very fast, because on a
surface, you've got no atoms

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.640
on the top.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.770
It's almost liquid-like,
isn't it?

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.300
You've got atoms to the bottom,
but you've got no

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.110
atoms to the top, so you
can move unconstrained.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.360
Go back to this one.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.710
Imagine here.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.820
Imagine if you didn't have any
atoms on the top, how easy it

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.695
would be to make that jump.

00:18:57.695 --> 00:19:00.660
All right, let's go and
see what the data are.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.930
Nothing like data.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.380
And I got data for you.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.780
Let's look.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.030
Click, click, click.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.280
All right.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.280
Here's the data.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.220
This is all for the diffusion
of silver.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:19.110
So I'm going to use this value,
this schematic, and I'm

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.370
going to give you the value for
silver diffusion in the

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:25.240
bulk, silver diffusion in the
grain boundary, and silver

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.890
diffusion along the surface.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.090
So these are the data.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.220
So this is log diffusion
coefficient versus 1 over T.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.140
Only, I hate this
graph, because

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.340
somebody got really wimpy.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.210
You know, it bothers them.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.000
You see, when you plot something
like this, you end

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.030
up with, if 1 over T increases
from left to right, this

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.960
really means that
high temperature

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.250
is over here, right?

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.430
1 over T increases this way,
which means temperature is

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.890
increasing this way.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.090
So somebody, some weenie, got
all nervous here and put the

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.070
numbers backwards, you see?

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.280
That way, the high temperature
is over here, but it looks

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.150
stupid, because when I see an
activation plot, I want a

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:03.930
negative slope.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.450
It's non-physical to have
a positive slope.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.090
So I condemned this and
I turned it around.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.900
So now let's look at
it the right way.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.360
So this is log d versus 1 over
T, and this is the bulk,

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.640
lattice or bulk.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.010
This is grain boundary and this
is surface diffusion, all

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.100
in solid silver.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.620
OK, look at this.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.700
First of all --

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.090
I'm going to jump from here
-- one, two, three, four.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.970
Four orders of magnitude faster
diffusion along a grain

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.700
boundary, which makes sense,
because it's less constrained.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.100
And now let's go from grain
boundary at constant

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.930
temperature up to surface.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.960
One, two, three.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.140
Three orders of magnitude
along the surface.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.920
So you can see the effects.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.750
And there's the melting point
of silver, right here.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.070
So at the melting point of
silver, the diffusion

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.650
coefficient is about 10 to the
minus 8 centimeters squared

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.220
per second, which is the
diffusion coefficient of

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.600
virtually every metal at
its melting point.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.930
So I happen to know
that number.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.640
10 to the minus 8 centimeters
squared per second.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.840
Not that I know it as a function
of temperature, but I

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.450
know it can't be any
faster than that.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:17.610
So I said, this is near
liquid-like behavior, what's

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.000
the next thing to look for?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.910
Let's get some data from real
liquids and see if this hunch

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:22.580
is correct.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.850
What's the number here?

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.660
10 to the minus 5 to 10 to the
minus 4 centimeters squared

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.480
per second.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.980
This is diffusion in molten
ferrous alloys.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.430
This is manganese
in molten iron.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.800
10 to the minus 5, 10
to the minus 4.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.100
Bingo.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.410
It really does behave like a
liquid, in terms of diffusion.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.520
Surface diffusion is very fast,
very fast. And it's all

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.980
explained by this simple
model of atom jumping.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.760
And I continued it.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.210
Here's data from glasses.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.550
We studied glasses.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.440
So here's a suite of
different glasses.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.610
Log k.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.080
This is permeability, which
is related to diffusion

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:57.780
coefficient.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.850
There's a gas constant in there,
but forget about it.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.920
So this is essentially log of
the diffusion coefficient

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.370
versus 1 over T.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.970
We've got a family of lines.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.530
And what's the difference
here?

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.630
This is pure fused
silica up here.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.960
SiO2.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.970
There's borosilicate, there's
soda lime, and

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.070
there's lead borate.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.900
So what's happening?

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.820
We're adding more and
more modifier as we

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.810
go from top to bottom.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:24.230
And as we add modifier, we
break the length of the

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.990
silicate network, which means it
packs tighter and tighter,

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.650
and as you get tighter and
tighter packing, the diffusion

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.170
coefficient gets lower
and lower.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.050
So train your eye.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.920
Let's pick 200 degrees
Centigrade, right here.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.230
So at constant temperature, the
more modifier you put in,

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.050
the lower the diffusion
coefficient because things are

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.330
more tightly packed.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.090
It's like walking down the
infinite corridor in the

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.370
middle of the hour, versus
walking down on the hour.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.340
On the hour, there's
too many people.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.610
It's tighter packing.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.590
And if you're the least bit
civilized, you're going to

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.380
have to move a little bit
slower, whereas, if you walk

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.270
down the infinite at around
now, no problem.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.000
It's liquid-like behavior.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.670
And now this is the isotherm
at 300 hundred degrees C.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.090
This is from some old
Corning literature.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.060
Corning used to make
glass, at one time.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.200
And this is the logarithm
of diffusivity.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:21.030
And this is now the set of
silica B203 and P205, and

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.270
these are all network
formers, right?

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:25.280
They all form covalent bonds.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:30.300
So the more silicate, borate,
phosphate you put in, the more

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.360
stretched out becomes
the network.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.570
And sure enough, look up here.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.890
See they didn't have names for
their glasses like the Malibu

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.390
or the Corvette or something.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.950
They called their glasses
by four-digit numbers.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.560
So someone would say, oh, this
customer needs, oh, I'd sell

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.385
them a 7040.

00:23:46.385 --> 00:23:46.990
All right?

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.030
Because it has a certain
mix of properties.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.780
So forget about what those
numbers are, just know that

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.540
this axis indicates that as you
move up, up, up, up, up,

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.200
the higher diffusivity is
associated with a much more

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.740
open structure.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.270
So, again, a link between
atomistic behavior and

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.690
atomistic structure.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.560
It's all there.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.870
OK.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.780
So let's leave that up
there while we go

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.640
a little bit forward.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.340
OK, so now, so we've been down
buried at the atomistic level.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.050
Now let's jump up to the
continuum level.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.610
We'll go back to Fick's
first law.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.670
And I want to do something a
little more quantitative.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:30.200
So I want to look at diffusion
across a permeable membrane.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:35.250
So this is gas through
a membrane.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.600
Gas through a membrane.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.230
And the membrane
is shown here.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.190
This is the walls
of the membrane.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.980
Membrane has thickness L.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.770
Membrane of thickness L.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.630
In fact, we'll give it a name.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.565
Let's call it membrane.

00:24:48.565 --> 00:24:52.280
All right, so here's the
membrane of thickness L, and

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.720
I'm going to put gas on the
left at P1, and it's a

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.850
constant P1.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:57.960
So we keep --

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.300
we've got a ballast here, so
even though something starts

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.340
diffusing, the amount that we
lose doesn't affect the

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.020
constant pressure over here.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:09.440
And on the right side, I'm
going to put a second

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.890
pressure, P2.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:15.120
And just for argument's sake,
I'm going to say that P2 is

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.210
less than P1.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.470
So that means we're going to
end up with mass transport

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.050
from left to right.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:25.690
And so, I want to ask, what's
this going to look like if we

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.010
use Fick's Law?

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:31.700
And so beneath I'll make a plot,
a concentration profile,

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.230
from x equals 0 to x equals L.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.670
And I can morph this
into concentration.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.860
We know the gas law
is PV equals nRT.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.320
This is the gas law.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.750
P is pressure.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.460
P is pressure.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.570
V you know is volume.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.200
But I'm going to write all these
out, because some of

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.730
these letters are used so many
times that we don't know, is

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:56.990
this the Rydberg constant?

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:00.000
No, it's the gas constant
that you've seen

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.920
on the first board.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.690
It's the Boltzmann constant
times the Avogadro number.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.380
T is absolute temperature,
temperature in Kelvins.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:13.060
And n is not the quantum number,
it's mole number.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.520
Mole number.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.500
PV equals nRT.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:22.710
And we know that concentration
of i is mole

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.270
number of i over V.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.040
Both of those appear in here.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.680
So if you take what's underneath
there, and I'll

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.210
expose it in a second, you'll
convince yourself that Ci

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.920
equals Pi divided by RT.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.820
And that's how you get that
permeability thing to turn

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.290
around as well.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:46.320
OK, so, I started with gas
pressure, but I'm now going to

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.070
write this in terms
of concentration.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:55.030
So I'm going to morph P1 into C1
and over here, P2 into C2.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.120
And I want to plot
the profile.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.930
So what's the profile
look like?

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.120
I'm going to plot the profile
at steady state.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.020
At steady state.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.650
At steady state, after I've
waited a while, I have a

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:10.320
straight-line profile across
here, at steady state.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.370
It's pinned at the two ends.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.240
It's pinned at the two
ends and varies

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.100
continuously across here.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:22.440
And you can see from Fick's
Law, that if you have a

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:29.270
situation in which the gradient
is invariant across

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.250
the piece, the gradient is --

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:37.190
dc by dx is the same here, as it
is here, as it is here, as

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:44.180
it is here. dc by dx is
invariant, right?

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.020
It doesn't change.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.330
This is a straight line.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.220
Well, if dc by dx is invariant,
and d is a

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.240
constant, then J is invariant,
which just means

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.740
no sources are sinks.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.590
All of the material that
goes in, must come out.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:01.450
This means that J is not
a function of time.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.700
J is invariant.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.220
J is not a function of time.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.960
I come back here ten
minutes later, I

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.100
have the same profile.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.360
That's what steady
state means.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.450
That's what study state means.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.920
OK, and then, of course, if I
wanted to be a little bit

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.890
pedantic, I could say, in
certain systems, the diffusion

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.720
coefficient is a function
of concentration.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.630
So, when the diffusion
coefficient is a function of

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.670
concentration, then even at
steady state, you might have

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.900
some bowing of the profile,
but that's a

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.710
little bit more advanced.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:35.620
OK.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.900
So, I can describe everything
that's going on here.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:44.130
If I wanted to know how much
material leaves from inside

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:48.290
over a certain period of time,
then I can simply say that

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:55.120
total material lost is given by
Fick's first law when you

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.490
have steady state.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.040
It's simply going to equal the
product of the flux, which is

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.240
mass per unit area per
unit time times the

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.450
area times the time.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:10.940
And that's sort of analogous
to Faraday's Law, right?

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:17.530
If I wanted to look at how much
electrical charge I get

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:21.120
for a certain period of time
with current passing, I could

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.000
say that the total charge is
the product of the current

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.860
times the time.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.350
You know this relationship.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:30.970
Well, can you see that J times A
is analogous to the current?

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:32.960
It's the mass current.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.150
It's mass flow rate.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.730
Mass flow rate per unit area
times area gives me something

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.750
that's analogous to the current,
and the time is the

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.090
time, this is the total material
lost, this is the

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.590
total electrical charge.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.830
These two are the comparable
equations.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:47.670
OK.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.260
Now, I want to go to the more
sophisticated question, and

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.240
that is, what happens
before steady state?

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.110
Before steady state
is achieved?

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:59.110
Suppose at time zero, the
membrane has no gas in it.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.070
And at time zero, I inflate
the left side.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.900
And just to keep things
simple, I'm going to

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.430
set c2 equals 0.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.440
It's a linear equation.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.330
You can always add it, but I
just want to keep it simpler

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.240
for the analysis.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:24.620
So, suppose at t equals 0, we
inflate to c1 on the left side

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.420
of the empty membrane.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.670
There's nothing in
the membrane.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:33.950
So, let's see what happens.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.770
First, I'm going to solve
the problem graphically.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.170
Because we know what's
going to happen.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.960
I'm going to have to
do the mathematics.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.440
So, here's what we expect.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.100
This is going from 0 to L.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.490
And we've got nothing in the
membrane on both sides, so

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:49.430
that's good.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:54.320
And then, at time zero,
I inflate to c1.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.500
There's nothing in here.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.990
So, what do I have?

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.420
Well, I know if I wait long
enough, it's eventually going

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.730
to look like this.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.570
Because that's the steady
state solution.

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.510
I've put here c2 equals
0, for simplicity, but

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:08.300
we can change it.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.430
It's a linear equation.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:10.850
We can just add.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:14.580
So, what happens
at time 0 plus?

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.740
I start getting diffusion in
from left to right, following

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.310
Fick's Law.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.730
So it's going to look
like this, isn't it?

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:24.560
This is the approach
to steady state.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.320
Some books will call it
nonsteady state or unsteady.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.500
Unsteady to me means unsteady,
so I refuse to use those

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.870
terms. I call this
the transient.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.060
That's the literary term.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.980
The transient.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.350
We're talking about the approach
to steady state.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.520
And in some systems, you never
get to steady state.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.780
But that's OK.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.080
So here's what it's going to
look like at some very, very

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.055
short time afterwards.

00:31:51.055 --> 00:31:55.170
It's going to look like that,
only somewhat modified for

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:55.980
this geometry.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.020
So it's going to look
like this, isn't it?

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.640
It's pinned at c1, and it's
pinned at 0, and it varies

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.860
continuously.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.050
So this is at time t 1.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.780
What happens at time t 2?

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.405
At time t 2, it advances
a little bit farther.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.990
But in all instances, the slope
and the shape is given

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.210
by this, Fick's first law.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:26.360
So this is at time t 2.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.600
And let's do one more.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.150
Three's a charm.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.790
So, let's take a green one.

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:35.170
All right, so here's at t 3,
still pinned at c 1 and still

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.960
pinned at 0.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.400
So this is at t3.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.280
And then finally, this
is steady state.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.890
So if we park at any place --

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.140
let's park at x1.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.650
Watch here.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.700
Can you see that the slope
at t1 is gentle?

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.060
The slope at t2 is
steeper than t1.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.130
The slope at t3 is steeper
than t2, and this is the

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:07.990
highest. So, we go from nothing,
to gradual, gradual,

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:09.710
gradual, until we finally
reach steady

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.070
state, and we stop.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.590
And then at that point, we just
continue to have to mass

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:14.100
flowing through.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.600
And look, the concentration is
zero, but the flux is not

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.740
zero, because the flux isn't
related to the concentration.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.820
It's related to the
concentration gradient.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.960
Zero concentration,
but non-zero

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.000
concentration gradient.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.800
In fact, just for grins and
chuckles, I could plot the

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.440
ascent of this.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.060
I could plot time
at x equals x1.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.710
I could plot J.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.610
And what's J?

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.420
At time zero, it's zero.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.430
Then it's small, then it's
larger, larger, larger

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:44.360
asymptotically.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.730
And this is J of steady state.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:52.160
And this is t1, t2, t3.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.350
That's the approach
to steady state.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:58.750
And you might say, well,
this is kind of

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.200
a professor's pedantry.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.330
It's not!

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.660
This is doping of
semiconductors.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.160
You don't run processes
at equilibrium.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.520
You run them far from
equilibrium.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.990
So in the transient mode,
doping, outgassing, drying,

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.850
what have you.

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:15.370
So, now I want to give
you the shape of the

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:16.770
concentration profile.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.170
So how do I do that?

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:27.890
OK, so the shape of the
transient profile is not given

00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:28.720
by Fick's Law.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.720
The Fick's Law just gives
me the gradient.

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.660
In other words, here's
what I want.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:38.500
I want C as a function of
x at any given time.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.860
That's what I want.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.360
I want to be able to
plot the profile.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.890
So, profile is C of x, but
C of x varies with time.

00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:47.440
So, I need C of x at
different times.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.470
What gives me that?

00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:52.310
What gives me that is
Fick's second law.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:55.980
Go to FSL, Fick's second law.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.320
Now, Fick's second law, I'm just
going to put it up here.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.920
I'm going to show you
the solution.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.730
I don't expect you
to solve it.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.530
I would, you were all required
to have differential equations

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:06.990
as a pre-req, but you don't.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.690
So, I'm just going to put it
up here so that you see it.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.160
It's a partial differential
equation, and

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.490
it looks like this.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:15.740
And it's really beautiful.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.290
It's got a beautiful symmetry
and the fonts look great, so

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:20.480
that's why we put it up here.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.500
So, this is the partial in
time goes as the double

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.390
derivative in space, because
we need a two-variable

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:28.080
function, right?

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.540
We want x and t.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:34.070
And this assumes that the
diffusion coefficient is not a

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:35.380
function of concentration.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.510
If it is, the equation
is messier.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.860
This assumes a constant
diffusion coefficient.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.590
So, this, as you can see, is a
partial differential equation,

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.610
which is a bummer, because it's
hard to solve, all right?

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.350
But, it's linear.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:50.080
It's a linear partial
differential equation, which

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.560
means the solutions
are additive.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.300
We know this already
from LCAOMO.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.300
So, I can handle, because I can
solve it once and then I

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:02.580
can give you ways to patch
it, to make it useful.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:06.200
So, the solution.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.300
First of all, how do I
specify this fully?

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.550
Every time you differentiate
--

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.240
I'm going to give you some
math here, real math

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.260
that you can use.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.880
When you differentiate, you
throw away information, right?

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.960
The derivative of a
constant is zero.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.380
So, what was the value
of the constant?

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.330
It's gone.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.160
You lost it.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.490
So you have to bring it back.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.780
So when I double derivative
this, I need two pieces of

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.345
spacial information.

00:36:27.345 --> 00:36:30.040
And when I take a derivative
with respect to time, I need

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.560
one piece of temporal
information.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.670
That's math.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.110
All the other lemmas and
postulates, forget them.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.590
This is how you use
it, all right?

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.860
So, I need two pieces of spatial
information and one

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.620
piece of temporal information.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:45.150
So these specify our boundary
conditions, right?

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.450
So, what are our boundary
conditions.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:49.920
So, I will need the
concentration of

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.710
all x at time 0.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.140
That's this.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.400
The answer to this question.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.180
And what we're going to do is
say that it's a constant.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.350
I don't know what the constant
is, it could be zero, it could

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.800
be any arbitrary number, but
I'm going to give you the

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.340
solution for the situation
in which the initial

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.650
concentration is a constant.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:10.700
So, you could look at this and
say, well, what happens if

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.790
it's a non-zero constant?

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:13.010
You ready for linearity?

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.870
Watch this.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.530
This is how cool linearity is.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.230
You see this set of solutions?

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:20.400
This is the set of solutions
for C equals 0.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.030
What if C equals some
non-zero value?

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:26.210
I just shift the origin down to
here to the non-zero value

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.440
and everything sits there.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.390
That's what superposition
gives you.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:32.570
That whole set of solutions
just gets jacked up by the

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:34.580
value of C naught.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:38.680
If C naught is 0, this slams
down onto the x-axis.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.660
That's real math.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.360
You're the master.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:47.620
The math is the slave. Never
let math enslave you.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.510
I won't.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:49.470
I refuse.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:52.840
So that's how you make C
equals C naught work.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:57.190
And then you have to peg the
concentration at the surface.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.830
I can give you examples where
that's not the situation,

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:02.340
where you have a variable
concentration at the surface.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.550
The solution I'm going to give
you won't work for those.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.370
So, x equals 0 is the surface.

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:10.680
So, at x equals 0 at all time, I
have some fixed value, which

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.550
I'm going to just
call C surface.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:14.600
And I need a third boundary
condition.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.100
And the third boundary
condition is a

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.390
mathematical trick.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:20.540
We're going to say that this
only works at short times.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.310
It's called the short time.

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.560
And at short times, I'm
going to say that --

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.850
from the perspective of the
diffusion experiment --

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:33.390
at very, very short times,
this sample appears to be

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.120
infinitely long.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.220
Because the amount of material
that goes in doesn't hit the

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.290
other side.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:42.160
So, at very, very short times,
we can pretend that it's

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.090
semi-infinite.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.000
And so then we can write that
the concentration --

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.130
this is the short time, which
means infinite size, and

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:53.740
you'll see that the
two are related --

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.520
that the concentration at
infinity, then, doesn't change

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.620
from the initial value.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.200
The concentration at infinity
for all time must equal the

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.770
initial value C naught.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.250
And so if you put these three
boundary conditions into that

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:09.600
equation, you end
up with this.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.340
This is the thing.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:16.140
You get C minus Cs over
C naught minus Cs.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.880
This is surface concentration.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.320
This is initial concentration.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.560
This is C.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.780
It varies by this amount.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:28.520
Error function of x over 2 times
the square root of Dt.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.960
So, you tell me the time and I
can tell you the relationship

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.500
between concentration
and position.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:38.320
Now I've got to tell you what
the error function is.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.940
Here's the error function.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.900
This is this problem before.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.490
This is the solution I'm
going to show you.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.550
Here's Cs.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.905
Here's C naught.

00:39:47.905 --> 00:39:49.410
The most general case.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.470
C naught could be zero.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:55.370
And this curve here is given
by this equation, OK?

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:57.740
And this is an example
of doping, isn't it?

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.680
This is how doping would work.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.110
And this is the case where C
s is greater than C naught.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:06.630
If we turn it around and we make
the surface concentration

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.270
less than the initial
concentration, we'll get the

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:12.306
complementary situation.

00:40:12.306 --> 00:40:14.800
The complementary situation
looks like this.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.360
So in this case, C naught is up
here, Cs is down here, and

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.610
we end up with this.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.660
So now matter is going
out, because Cs

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.760
is less than C naught.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.140
So this is --

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.760
what do you want to call it --
this is effusion, this is some

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.920
kind of a drying process,
outgassing.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.340
And this is doping.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.685
And what's the shape
of this curve?

00:40:39.685 --> 00:40:40.830
The shape of this curve.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:42.130
ERF.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:43.300
That's what math is.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.700
You find a mathematical
function that

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.660
templates for the curve.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.800
And ERF, I'm going to show you,
is related to random walk

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.410
statistics.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:54.970
So, it's physically validated.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.205
It's the best fit.

00:40:56.205 --> 00:40:59.080
I mean, heck, if you find
anything that is pinned at two

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.260
ends and has curvature, you'll
get a reasonable fit, but

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.880
what's the right fit?

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.980
The right fit is this.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.220
The error function
looks like this.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.370
Here's the error function.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:09.800
Error function.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.600
I'm going to plot ERF of
z as a function of z.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.570
And it goes from 0 to 1.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.300
It looks like this.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.640
All right?

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.260
And here's an error
function table.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.730
Those are exact values.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.700
And it turns out that ERF
is pretty much linear up

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.830
to about point 6.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.100
Up to about point 6.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:39.950
ERF of point 6 not to less
than about 1% is point 6.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:42.180
And then as you go farther and
farther out, and eventually,

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.240
ERF of infinity equals 1.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:49.200
But you don't even need tables
for 0 up to point 6.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.150
And you can push it, go to
point 6, 5, if you want.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.790
Yeah, let's do it.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:53.980
Let's push harder.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.110
6, 5.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:55.750
It's linear.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.360
You don't need tables.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:57.880
Right?

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.460
And so ERF of 0 equals 0.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.350
Oh, let me give you
the function.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:06.450
You know how you can
define sine?

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:09.940
Sine is that integral of
something over 1 minus blah,

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:10.820
blah, blah?

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.090
We've got a definition
for this one, too.

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:14.320
It's cool.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:14.960
It's cool.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.170
Here's what the error
function looks like.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:24.810
ERF of z equals the integral
from 0 to z of e to the minus

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.840
u squared du.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.770
You might say, why is he
showing us all of this?

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.860
Because he wants to torment
you, that's why.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.590
No, it's because I'm trying
to teach you something.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.090
What's e to the minus
u squared?

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.140
Actually, I think I can squeeze
it in right there.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.290
What's e to the minus
u squared du?

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.640
This function here, that's the
bell curve, isn't it? e to the

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.550
minus u squared.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:46.470
That's this thing.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:47.430
It's symmetric, right?

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.850
It's a minus u squared, so
it doesn't matter if u is

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:51.080
positive or negative.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:55.040
And e to the 0 was 1, and
then back and forth.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.700
And so what this is doing, is
it's integrating from zero out

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.600
to some value.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.180
That's all.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.330
That's the random walk.

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.460
This is the drunken sailor.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.700
How far does the drunken
sailor go?

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.830
That's the shape of this
curve, the integral.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:11.310
And we'd like it to be so that
if you integrate from zero to

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:14.040
infinity, the area
will be one.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.830
It turns out that this area
here is root pi over 2.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:22.120
So, therefore, to normalize,
we put 2 over root pi.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.915
That's how you get the
error function.

00:43:23.915 --> 00:43:24.650
All right?

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:27.300
So, the integral from zero to
zero is zero, and the integral

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.280
from 0 to 1 is going to be,
whatever it is, point 8, 4, et

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.200
cetera, et cetera.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.550
So, that's it.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:34.010
That's it.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:38.350
Now we have the functional
relationship to describe any

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.610
of these curves.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:43.180
And you'll get some practice
in doing that.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.730
And it's a lot of fun.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.380
Because now you can talk about
how long it's going to take to

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.050
dope something, and so on.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:49.960
Outgassing.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.240
And now I'm going to show you
something really cool, and I'm

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.010
not kidding you.

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:54.010
This has served me well.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.490
I've been here 30 some odd
years, and I've been in

00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:00.070
consulting situations where I
can, in my head, figure out

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.830
order of magnitude of what it's
going to take to run a

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:03.950
diffusion problem.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:10.080
Because you've got, up here, C
minus Cs over C naught minus

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:17.930
Cs equals ERF error function
of x over 2 roots of Dt.

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:21.100
So, this runs from 0 to 1.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.160
The right side.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.940
When I went to school, the left
side of the equation had

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:27.320
to do the same thing as the
right side of the equation.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.040
So if the right side of the
equation runs from 0 to 1, the

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.040
left side of the equation
runs from 0 to 1.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.250
So, let's pick a -- are
you ready -- average

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:35.940
value from 0 to 1.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.270
What would you pick?

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:39.990
I'd pick point 5.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.440
Now, I don't have to go to the
error function tables because

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.420
point 5 is less than point 6.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:49.540
So ERF of x over 2 root Dt is
essentially equal to x over 2

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.010
roots of Dt.

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:56.550
So, now I've got one half equals
one half x over root

00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:00.645
Dt, from which I can say that
x is approximately equal to

00:45:00.645 --> 00:45:02.120
the square root of Dt.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.390
And I can be sitting in a
meeting and someone says, gee,

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:05.490
I don't know how long
it's going to take.

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:08.440
This thing's going to go
down about 100 microns.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.040
And how long is it
going to take?

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.100
So, I pick a number, like, OK,
if this is 100 microns, and

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.930
this thing here is 10 to the
minus 8, now you just take the

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:18.110
square root of that, and tell
them, oh, it's going to take

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:19.790
so many minutes, and
they go, huh?

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:20.780
How did you get that?

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.130
It's right there.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.220
And I'm not trying to tell
them a number for three

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.410
significant figures.

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.580
They just want to know is it
going to take a minute, an

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.580
hour, a day, or are we
out of business?

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.840
And you can make that
calculation with this.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.210
This is so powerful.

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:39.100
And everything I told you about
diffusion applies to

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.540
conductive heat transport.

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.480
You can do the same thing for
heat transfer, figure out how

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.050
long it's going to take
for a wave to go in.

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:47.220
This is really powerful stuff.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.390
Anyway.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:50.920
Let's move on.

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.650
Well, there's our pal.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.030
OK, so I was going to give you
the last element today.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.830
The last element.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:59.050
Remember, we talked
about clean air.

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.720
So, I'm showing you the
catalytic converter.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.410
That's this thing here,
coated with platinum,

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:08.300
rhodium, and so on.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.510
And I'm showing you the
electronic control module.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:13.330
That's the CPU.

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:16.400
It's a little bit toned down
from a Pentium, but it

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.130
certainly started from
one of these units.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:22.200
So, we've studied all of this.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.840
Right?

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.810
OK.

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:28.240
And, so now, I want to talk
about this piece here, the

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.240
oxygen sensor. why do we
need an oxygen sensor?

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.750
Remember, the last day I told
you that to get rid of NO, the

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:38.180
NOx, you have to reduce, And to
get rid of CO and unburned

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.970
hydrocarbons, you
have to oxidize.

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:42.850
Well, you have to pick.

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:45.180
You can't have two different
atmospheres in the same place

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.250
at the same time.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.320
Turns out there's a
lucky sweet spot.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.210
Can you see that the conversion
efficiency is high

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:55.200
for both reduction and oxidation
reactions if you peg

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.490
the air-to-fuel ratio at 14.6.

00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:00.520
So you can't just set the
carburetor or the fuel

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.570
injectors at some arbitrary
ratio, because as you change

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:05.320
humidity, as you change
temperature -- what happens

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.790
when the temperature
goes down?

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.480
How much oxygen is
there in the air?

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.070
It's still 20%, but
PV equals nRT.

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.580
You ever try barbecuing
when it's --

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.090
I mean, I don't know, maybe
you're not from the Northeast.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:19.250
But if you want to barbecue
when it's 0 Fahrenheit?

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:22.230
Do you think you get a hotter
fire or a colder fire?

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.640
How much oxygen is there
per unit volume in cold

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.570
air versus warm air?

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:27.730
Think about it.

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:28.930
It'll be on the next exam.

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:29.620
I'm just kidding.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:29.880
OK.

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.490
So, anyway, here's the sweet
spot that gives you both

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:36.190
oxidation and reduction.

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:38.290
And so we need a
feedback loop.

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:40.940
That feedback loop is provided
by the oxygen sensor.

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.800
Dave, would you mind cutting
to the document camera?

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.020
So this is an oxygen sensor
that's used on automobiles.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.000
Here's the plug.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.750
This goes into the pin set.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.410
And the oxygen sensor is
inside this housing.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.660
This housing, you can see --

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.020
OK, what I'm going to
show you is what's

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.100
going on inside here.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.210
This has got all kinds of
protective stuff on it so that

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:07.890
it doesn't get dented during
installation and so on.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:12.230
But it sits inside the
exhaust train.

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:13.600
It sits inside the
exhaust train.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:18.030
Now, may we go back to
the slides, please?

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:21.260
Every car that's running a
catalytic converter has to

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.980
have one of those in order to
control, right here, to make

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.650
sure the air-to-fuel
ratio is optimum.

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:29.370
Otherwise, the catalytic
converter is either not doing

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:32.510
a good job on NOx, or it's
not doing a good job on

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:37.770
hydrocarbons and whatever
the other thing is.

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:39.100
Anyway, so here's what
it looks like.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.310
So, this is what's inside.

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:43.240
It's a closed, one-end tube
made of zirconia.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.690
Zirconium oxide.

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:47.840
And zirconium oxide conducts
oxide ions.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.590
And there are platinum
electrodes on the

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:50.280
front and the back.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.380
And what I showed you
was from this side.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.930
And this is the exhaust gas
going along here, and this is

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:57.580
the edge of your
exhaust train.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:01.200
And two wires coming off of
that sensor go to the CPU.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.380
The CPU measures voltage and
then from there, it regulates

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:08.040
the air-to-fuel mix to the
engine, to the exhaust gas,

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.900
and around and around and around
we go, so that when

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.480
exhaust gas gets to the
catalytic convert, it is

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.890
optimally being converted.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.130
So, we want to get
fast response.

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:21.650
We don't want slow response.

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:24.670
And it's a solid-state sensor
and solid-state diffusion is

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.700
slow, but that's we
have to rely upon.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.510
So we add a dopant.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:33.020
We add a dopant to zirconia
to stabilize its crystal

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.350
structure and create more oxygen
vacancies to get faster

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:38.590
diffusion and a shorter
response time.

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:41.320
So what we add is calcia, one
of the candidates, and it

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:45.660
creates oxygen vacancies, and
these oxygen vacancies allow

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.500
us to get more rapid
response time.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:52.020
So, these oxygen vacancies
compensate for the charge

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.090
imbalance, thanks to the
addition of calcia.

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:55.720
So, it's an engineered
material.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.040
Without this it doesn't
work, all right?

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.120
And so, now what I've shown you
is that on the basis of

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.980
this oxygen sensor, we can
monitor the exhaust gas flow

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.380
so as to optimize the conversion
here in the

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:12.870
catalytic converter and do so by
sending information to the

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:14.390
CPU on the car.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:18.130
And the number one consumer
of CPU's is the automobile

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.440
industry, because every car
has at least one, if not

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.950
multiple, CPU's.

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:26.460
So this is a good example of how
understanding the lessons

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:29.920
of solid state chemistry can
allow us to build fuel

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:35.020
efficient automobiles that have
minimum toxic emissions

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.840
to the environment.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.480
All right, we'll see
you on Monday.
