00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.769
Okay, I wanted to test the white, to see how
that shows up on that.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.380
I'll go back and then see how it looks.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.660
Oh, I think it's great.

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:19.669
I think it's great.

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:20.620
Let me see if you like it.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.980
Good?

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.380
Yeah.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.140
It's interesting, because different times
of the day it's gonna be different colors,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.150
so...

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.920
And even the different seasons.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.920
That's right.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.500
Right now we're at 2:00, it's pretty bright
in here, actually.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.240
Yeah.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.060
But it's summer, so I guess it'll be darker.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.200
And then, we'll have the lights on the works
themselves.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.239
It was smart to choose the dark color in here.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.699
I think so, rather than the gallery.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.240
Yeah.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.800
Yeah.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.300
Yeah.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.500
So we get that, sort of, envelope feeling.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.100
Seems dramatic to me, I hope it will be suitable
for the spider.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.600
Sure, yeah.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.560
Yeah.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.760
So who do you get to decide that it's not
gonna fall down?

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.770
I mean...

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.149
Well, there would be a meeting with the rigging
company.

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.920
With Moore?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.840
With Moore.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.520
So they'd know what to look for behind?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.780
Oh, before the day you installed?

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.920
Way before.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.800
Like, if we decide soon, we should get them
in as soon as possible.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.020
We were gonna put it down there, remember,
because I thought, when people come in, you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.210
know, I mean, you're really down here.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.799
It's still pretty big.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.270
Wanna put it down there for a second, just
to see?

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.780
Sure, or we can put the other one if you want.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.760
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.960
So, there, even closer...yeah, higher though.

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:01.969
Yeah.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.030
Yeah, you know, it almost seems too huge,
doesn't it, to me now.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.030
Yeah.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.460
It kind of dwarfs the prints.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.840
Can we try this smaller one there?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840
Sure.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.830
I feel like this one doesn't seem as much
like a real spider.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.860
This one's always seemed, like, more like
the design of the spider, the flatness of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.750
it, whereas this one really looks like it's
more crawling.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.780
Yeah.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.860
Does anyone think that's true?

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.800
I like the thinner one, that's always been
my preference.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.300
Yeah.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.380
The thing is, when it's that far away, as
Sewon was saying it would be better to have

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.390
the big one...

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.960
Have the big one?

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.980
What do you think?

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.720
I mean, like, when we're way down here...

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.220
I think the opposite is true.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.770
I think the fourth leg on the right, the bottom
right, it curls up and out and it turns into

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.730
a hook, and that one's kind of, just, flat
all the way down.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.600
Like, that's a little bit more...

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.100
More dimensional?

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.600
Yeah.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.180
Oh, I see, more alive.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.840
Yeah.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.180
Does it look too tiny?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.000
Oh my God, because we have to make a decision.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.780
So Jerry was just asking...We can control
these lights.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.810
Did you wanna ask him your question?

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.460
I just wanna make sure that the spider is
not in the way.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.870
We don't...You're not going up there to adjust
the lights, right?

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.640
Well, we can.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.080
We use that lift, and we adjust those outer
corner ones.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.640
We can adjust them a little bit...

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.680
Okay.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.870
And change the temperature.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.120
Were you gonna ask me because you wanted them
to adjust it?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.880
I wanted the room to be a little dark, because
I didn't know how it felt, like, on a dimmer

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.880
switch.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.880
It is, it is.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.950
I can control all these with my computer...

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.950
Oh great...

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.950
With the laptop...

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.950
That's fantastic.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.950
And so, I can change the color temperature
or the dimming.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.840
It's a brand new system that we installed
last week, so...

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.680
When should we do that?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.880
It's the first time we've used it.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.640
Yeah.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.440
Would you wanna be around when we do that,
Jerry?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.540
Yeah.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.040
Yeah?

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.000
I mean, I think we should wait until...

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.020
Everything is on...

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.940
All the tuning work is done.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.440
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.100
Okay.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.440
So our goal is for the show to open at 4:00.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.340
However, for that to happen, as you can see,
there's a lot to do.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.960
It's noon now.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.960
It's 20 after noon.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.240
It's 20 after 12:00, and we would like to
open by 4:00.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.180
I don't think this has been shown.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.930
No, I can't remember.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.930
So this is called...

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.160
Do you want to guess the title?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.600
Minuscule.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.850
Well, it's from a series that's called Microbe,
or Microbe, so that was a good guess.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:45.850
Yeah.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.300
But the full title is "Adam and Eve Expelled
From the Garden of Eden".

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.300
Oh wow.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.710
Can you see any Adam and Eve in there?

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.680
I mean, I don't see...I see the shining light...

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.680
Yes.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.870
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:07.000
And the landscape of, like, decay or something.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Right.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
No, you do.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.360
There's a shining light, it's a landscape,
but there's no...We looked at it...

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.950
Just don't see any figures.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.950
No.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.870
We looked at it under the microscope with
Laura in Conservation, and there's no figures

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:22.870
in there.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.870
So we think he just gave it that title...

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.320
So people would get up and look close.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.400
Are we ready? Is it time?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.000
Have your I.D. out, please.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.620
Hi everyone.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:56.800
I'm Sewon, I'm a curatorial assistant in Drawings
and Prints, and I assisted Debbie Wye, Chief

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:01.390
Curator Emerita of the Prints and Illustrated
Books department, on this exhibition.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:08.889
Louise Bourgeois moved to New York in the
'40s after she met an American, a historian

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:09.949
named Robert Goldwater.

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:14.960
They actually knew each other for two weeks
before they got married.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.560
So when she moved here, she was alone.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.639
She left all her friends and family, and turned
to print making.

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:27.990
Well, she was already a print maker, but print
making was especially helpful for her in these

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.370
early years because of the collaborative nature
of the print shop.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.110
You can't really make prints alone.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.829
You need special equipment, you need a helping
hand to set up the press, and get your paper

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:41.120
down, and ink your plate, and all that stuff.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.180
What's really wonderful about prints is that
you can see how the imagination of the artist

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.260
unfolded.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.509
With a sculpture or a painting, let's say,
you only see the final product, because all

00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:56.959
of the works in progress are hidden underneath.

00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:59.920
But with print making, you actually can save
the works in progress.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:07.360
You see, she etched a drawing of a figure
in a doorway on the plate, printed a proof,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.540
wanted to change the plate, changed the plate,
printed another proof, and then kept going.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.869
So that's a really good teaching moment, if
you want to point out what, sort of, the mechanics

00:09:16.869 --> 00:09:18.259
of print making are.

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:21.769
You can show people step one, step two, step
three.
