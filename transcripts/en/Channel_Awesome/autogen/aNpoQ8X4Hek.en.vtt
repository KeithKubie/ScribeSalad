the teacher uh acknowledged their faults

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840
the teacher uh acknowledged their faults
 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.949
the teacher uh acknowledged their faults
cuz again I think a lot of shows would

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959
cuz again I think a lot of shows would
 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.610
cuz again I think a lot of shows would
really drag this out and would just have

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620
really drag this out and would just have
 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.189
really drag this out and would just have
it where he doesn't like her for a bitch

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199
it where he doesn't like her for a bitch
 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.869
it where he doesn't like her for a bitch
she doesn't like him they'll they'll

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879
she doesn't like him they'll they'll

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889
carry over for about two three episodes
 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.229
carry over for about two three episodes
or something like that least and then

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239
or something like that least and then
 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.909
or something like that least and then
they come to this understanding oh maybe

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919
they come to this understanding oh maybe
 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.740
they come to this understanding oh maybe
I've been kind of a jerk and they come

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750
I've been kind of a jerk and they come
 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.080
I've been kind of a jerk and they come
to it at the very end and I I like that

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090
to it at the very end and I I like that
 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.720
to it at the very end and I I like that
they both acknowledge that they've

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730
they both acknowledge that they've
 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.159
they both acknowledge that they've
screwed up and I like the fact they

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169
screwed up and I like the fact they
 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.409
screwed up and I like the fact they
acknowledge the teacher his sort of been

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419
acknowledge the teacher his sort of been
 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.119
acknowledge the teacher his sort of been
screwing up - he has not been keeping

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129
screwing up - he has not been keeping
 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.550
screwing up - he has not been keeping
his patience as well and that matches

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560
his patience as well and that matches
 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.250
his patience as well and that matches
the character that seems to be a guy who

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260
the character that seems to be a guy who
 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.349
the character that seems to be a guy who
means well but it sort of takes what he

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359
means well but it sort of takes what he
 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.619
means well but it sort of takes what he
does very seriously and is not used to

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629
does very seriously and is not used to
 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.990
does very seriously and is not used to
having people really talk back to him I

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000
having people really talk back to him I
 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.879
having people really talk back to him I
mean it's just it's obviously holds us

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889
mean it's just it's obviously holds us
 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.620

to a great art and doesn't have a
 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.719
to a great art and doesn't have a
phenomenal sense of humor about it but

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729
phenomenal sense of humor about it but
 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.870
phenomenal sense of humor about it but
it's not harsh or mean either so it's a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880
it's not harsh or mean either so it's a
 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.760
it's not harsh or mean either so it's a
makes sense that she would sort of walk

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770
makes sense that she would sort of walk
 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.590
makes sense that she would sort of walk
all over him and he would just you know

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600
all over him and he would just you know
 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.960
all over him and he would just you know
a problem or you know that sort do that

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970
a problem or you know that sort do that
 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.560
a problem or you know that sort do that
thing so uh so I really like that I felt

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570
thing so uh so I really like that I felt
 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.480
thing so uh so I really like that I felt
those are the two elements that pulled

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490
those are the two elements that pulled
 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.820
those are the two elements that pulled
this through okay and made a decent

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830
this through okay and made a decent
 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.130
this through okay and made a decent
episode um the you know I've heard

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.990
episode um the you know I've heard
people talk this is like the one thing

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000

um but a lot of people are saying that

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930
um but a lot of people are saying that
 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.990
um but a lot of people are saying that
this Korra character is a little too

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000
this Korra character is a little too
 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.380
this Korra character is a little too
much of a hothead she's a little too

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390
much of a hothead she's a little too
 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.320

closed off and brutish and and so forth

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330
closed off and brutish and and so forth
 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.850
closed off and brutish and and so forth
um the reason I think so far I think it

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860
um the reason I think so far I think it
 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.630
um the reason I think so far I think it
works is because a when she makes a

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640
works is because a when she makes a
 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.040
works is because a when she makes a
mistake she comes around to it very

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050
mistake she comes around to it very
 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.000
mistake she comes around to it very
quickly and that's good so because there

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010
quickly and that's good so because there
 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.770
quickly and that's good so because there
were points here I'm just like oh come

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780
were points here I'm just like oh come
 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.020
were points here I'm just like oh come
on girl come how will you open your eyes

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030
on girl come how will you open your eyes
 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.870
on girl come how will you open your eyes
and say and she does and she doesn't no

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880
and say and she does and she doesn't no
 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.520

way that sort of makes sense like I said

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530
way that sort of makes sense like I said
 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.730
way that sort of makes sense like I said
using the moves and seeing that it works

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740
using the moves and seeing that it works
 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.170
using the moves and seeing that it works
that was very effective that that does a

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180
that was very effective that that does a
 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.470
that was very effective that that does a
very smart way of doing it um but here's

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480
very smart way of doing it um but here's
 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.390
very smart way of doing it um but here's
the other thing I'm so realizing

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400
the other thing I'm so realizing
 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.130
the other thing I'm so realizing
especially in this one where she's

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140
especially in this one where she's
 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.950
especially in this one where she's
having a real hard time getting

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960
having a real hard time getting
 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.870
having a real hard time getting
airbending and I like that airbending

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880
airbending and I like that airbending
 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.850
airbending and I like that airbending
and not firebending because that would

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860
and not firebending because that would
 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.320
and not firebending because that would
be the easy route to go again they would

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330
be the easy route to go again they would
 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.360
be the easy route to go again they would
have had the opposites because that was

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370
have had the opposites because that was
 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.800
have had the opposites because that was
the hardest with Aang was like Earth

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810
the hardest with Aang was like Earth
 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.720
the hardest with Aang was like Earth
well that's the opposite of air well now

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730
well that's the opposite of air well now
 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.400
well that's the opposite of air well now
you have water opposite of that would be

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410
you have water opposite of that would be
 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.190
you have water opposite of that would be
fire and they do air I like that because

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200
fire and they do air I like that because
 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.700
fire and they do air I like that because
it's not necessarily the power it's the

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710
it's not necessarily the power it's the
 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.720
it's not necessarily the power it's the
attitude this time uh and the attitude

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730
attitude this time uh and the attitude
 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.610
attitude this time uh and the attitude
of the Water Tribe is not usually like

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620
of the Water Tribe is not usually like
 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.410
of the Water Tribe is not usually like
her she's a little different because you

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420
her she's a little different because you
 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.240
her she's a little different because you
have a blowhard and she the fall of

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250
have a blowhard and she the fall of
 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.910
have a blowhard and she the fall of
herself and such so I like that the

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920
herself and such so I like that the
 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.060
herself and such so I like that the
philosophies are what is not gelling

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070
philosophies are what is not gelling
 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.560
philosophies are what is not gelling
here and why it's so difficult for her

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570
here and why it's so difficult for her
 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.540
here and why it's so difficult for her
so I I think that's cool I like they

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550
so I I think that's cool I like they
 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.800
so I I think that's cool I like they
didn't go the obvious route with

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810
didn't go the obvious route with
 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.400
didn't go the obvious route with
firebending

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410
firebending
 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.470
firebending
um but why would I realize I enjoy about

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480
um but why would I realize I enjoy about
 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.060
um but why would I realize I enjoy about
this character and why I think this is a

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070
this character and why I think this is a
 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.090
this character and why I think this is a
good route to take with the character is

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100
good route to take with the character is
 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.740
good route to take with the character is
because when you see her during the

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:05.820
couple of generations you might be
 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.420
couple of generations you might be
familiar but it's us it's us and it's

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430
familiar but it's us it's us and it's
 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.310
familiar but it's us it's us and it's
the generation right after as the

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320
the generation right after as the
 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.050
the generation right after as the
Millennials or whatever they're called

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060
Millennials or whatever they're called
 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.250
Millennials or whatever they're called
um because and yeah you could always say

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.260
um because and yeah you could always say
 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.650
um because and yeah you could always say
like oh that's any generation and

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660
like oh that's any generation and
 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.140
like oh that's any generation and
probably kids yeah but I think there is

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150
probably kids yeah but I think there is
 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.410
probably kids yeah but I think there is
something to the fact that the more

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:23.420
something to the fact that the more
 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.960
something to the fact that the more
technologically advanced we get the more

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970
technologically advanced we get the more
 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.270
technologically advanced we get the more
stuff is made easier for us and because

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280
stuff is made easier for us and because
 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.850
stuff is made easier for us and because
of that sort of the more sheltered we

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860
of that sort of the more sheltered we
 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.840
of that sort of the more sheltered we
become and more spoiled and selfish and

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:34.850
become and more spoiled and selfish and
 

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.250
become and more spoiled and selfish and

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.600

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.450
things that come from that do don't get

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460
me wrong but at the same time there is
 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.240

discover things about yourself you can
share things with yourself but there's

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:02.610
share things with yourself but there's
 

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.660
share things with yourself but there's
never that sense of being alone and

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:05.670
never that sense of being alone and
 

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.410
never that sense of being alone and
quiet and as much as we try to distract

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420
quiet and as much as we try to distract
 

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.900

ourselves and shove entertainment and

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:11.910

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.760
pictures and whatever in front of us
you're gonna have those moments where

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:15.770
you're gonna have those moments where
 

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.010
you're gonna have those moments where
all you're gonna have is yourself and

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:19.020
all you're gonna have is yourself and
 

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.190
all you're gonna have is yourself and
you can't you can't trick anyone but

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200
you can't you can't trick anyone but
 

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.780
you can't you can't trick anyone but
your sight yeah oh no a person you had

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:23.790
your sight yeah oh no a person you had
 

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.070
your sight yeah oh no a person you had
to drink is yourself and why would you

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080
to drink is yourself and why would you
 

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.740
to drink is yourself and why would you
want to trick yourself so if there's

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:27.750
want to trick yourself so if there's
 

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.940
want to trick yourself so if there's
that sense of just being comfortable

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:28.950
that sense of just being comfortable
 

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.260
that sense of just being comfortable
with yourself but I think it's very

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.270
with yourself but I think it's very
 

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.120
with yourself but I think it's very
obvious that core is not entirely

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.130
obvious that core is not entirely
 

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.290
obvious that core is not entirely
comfortable with herself she is

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:35.300
comfortable with herself she is
 

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.670
comfortable with herself she is
impatient and she is anxious and even

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680
impatient and she is anxious and even
 

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.500
impatient and she is anxious and even
though she served talks and acts like a

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:39.510
though she served talks and acts like a
 

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.540
though she served talks and acts like a
blowhard she knows she hasn't hit that

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:43.550
blowhard she knows she hasn't hit that
 

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.160
blowhard she knows she hasn't hit that
area of failure yet that she really

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.170
area of failure yet that she really
 

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.930
area of failure yet that she really
needs to confront I'm sure she's gonna

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940
needs to confront I'm sure she's gonna
 

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.050
needs to confront I'm sure she's gonna
have to confront so I like this

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060
have to confront so I like this
 

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.850
have to confront so I like this
character because of that I think it's

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:52.860
character because of that I think it's
 

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.550
character because of that I think it's
actually a really good representation

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560
actually a really good representation
 

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.400
actually a really good representation
