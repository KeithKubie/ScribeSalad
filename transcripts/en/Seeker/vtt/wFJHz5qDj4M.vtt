00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.290
The end is finally near for NASA’s Kepler
spacecraft, with the fuel tanks expected to

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.600
run dry in August of 2018.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.950
But before the undisputed champ of exoplanet
hide-and-seek retires and drifts off quietly

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.740
into space, we thought we’d look back on
the highlights of the nine year mission.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.570
Kepler was launched in March of 2009 with
one mission: to search for planets outside

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.570
our solar system.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.300
Rather than orbiting the Earth like the Hubble
Space telescope, Kepler was placed in what’s

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.550
called an earth-trailing orbit around the
sun, a little wider and a little slower than

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.719
ours, So, over time it would slowly drift
away from Earth until it was millions of miles

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:36.719
out.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.019
That means we can’t send astronauts to repair
Kepler like we’ve done with Hubble, but

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.050
so long as nothing goes wrong this orbit has
a lot of advantages.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.260
It keeps the Earth from photobombing the shot,
and since it’s out of Earth’s atmosphere,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.019
the stars won’t twinkle.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.469
The orbit also eliminates external torques
caused by atmospheric friction or Earth’s

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.550
magnetic field, meaning the craft can stably
point at one spot in the sky for a long time.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.500
The largest external torque on Kepler comes
from solar pressure, but four small wheels

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.979
that act as gyroscopes stabilize the craft
and counteract that.

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.799
Aside from a disposable cover, these are the
only moving parts on the spacecraft, reducing

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.750
the chances that something will break.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.229
Once in orbit, Kepler continuously stared
at the same patch of sky in the Cygnus-Lyra

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.250
region, watching 150,000 main sequence stars
for the tiniest drop in light levels that

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.860
indicate a transiting planet.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.229
The only time it broke its gaze was once a
month when it turned to transmit data back

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.250
to Earth.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.710
It was basically the most formidable staring
contest opponent humanity could create, and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.710
it caught stars blinking.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.259
Kepler identified over 2,300 confirmed extrasolar
planets, 30 of which are less than twice earth’s

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.850
size and in the habitable zone, making them
candidates to support extraterrestrial life.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.430
Kepler chugged along just fine for a while,
even though one of it’s reaction wheels

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.580
broke in July of 2012.Then in 2013, four years
after launch, disaster struck.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.930
Remember all that foreshadowing I did, about
the wheels being the only moving parts and

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.329
the craft being too far away to repair?

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:13.300
Well a second wheel broke, and two functional
wheels was not enough to keep the camera steady.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.610
Without the ability to stabilize itself Kepler
couldn’t continue the original mission,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.420
and it looked like the end.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.400
Until, someone had a brainwave: why not use
the solar pressure to act like a third stabilizing

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400
wheel?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.430
Kepler wouldn’t be able to look where it
had before, but it could point at one spot

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.740
for about 80 days at a time, until sunlight
would start leaking in.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.280
At which point it could rotate and stare at
a different spot for another 80-ish day “campaign”.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.770
The crazy plan worked, and the new mission,
dubbed K2, was underway.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.690
The K2 mission has discovered another 323
confirmed exoplanets, and there’s still

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.480
lots of data to dig through so more could
be confirmed years from now.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.430
K2 has even had some unexpected benefits.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.939
By looking at a variety of stars, many of
them in early stages of their lives, Kepler’s

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:08.900
observations have lead to discoveries and
insights into how stars and young planets

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.920
form.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.420
After 5 years of the K2 mission, Kepler is
running out of fuel, meaning soon it will

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.549
not be able to point itself back towards Earth
to transmit scientific data.

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.730
While NASA originally estimated it would only
have enough fuel for 10 campaigns, the little

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.220
spacecraft that could completed 18!

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.180
It makes me want to light a menorah or something.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.630
Its successor, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite, or TESS, was launched in April

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.980
of 2018, and will search almost the entire
night sky for exoplanets.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.830
But if exciting news ever comes out about
a planet with Kepler in its name, you’ll

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.900
know the story of the amazing spacecraft that
discovered it.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.159

Kepler isn’t the only space telescope whose
time is running out, soon the legendary Hubble

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.360
space telescope will be put out of commission
too.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.810
For a fond farewell to this stargazer, check
out Athena’s video here.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.329
One cool thing thing about the Kepler mission
is it was operated by undergrad students as

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.360
young as 20.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.900
It’s the next best thing to being a self-made
billionaire.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.769
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next
time on Seeker.
