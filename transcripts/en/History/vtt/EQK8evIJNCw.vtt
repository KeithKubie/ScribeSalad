00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.470
MIKE: We're here with
Mickey and Isaac in Indiana.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.800
It has been a tough day so far.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.200
We're really having
to dig to find stuff

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.600
they're willing to let go.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.130
Champion spark plugs.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.370
MICKEY: I guess I was a little
surprised about how much he

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.070
wanted that sign off the wall.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.370
ISAAC: He worked
at it real hard.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.470
MICKEY: There you go.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.470
Well, hey.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.700
So after all that
work, I finally

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.130
get something that I think
has absolutely no attachment.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.430
Would you guys
consider selling this?

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.900
It's not in the
best condition, but

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.700
still it's automotive related.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.730
MICKEY: Probably not.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.930
MIKE: And I was wrong.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.230
And I was wrong over
and over and over again.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.030
It's just advertisement
for the shop.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.970
- Yeah.
- It told what we done here.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.130
Yeah, there's tons
of history you guys

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.770
have in here for the wagons.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.800
Right.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.870
But not really too
much for the cars.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.200
Yeah.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.830
Not too much for the cars and
what we done to them here.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.200
Imagine that.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.230
You know, right there.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.400
MICKEY: We sold
automotive accessories.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.800
And it was a sign
that they could've

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.100
put out front, at one
time, and said hey,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.300
we got your spark plugs here.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.070
Going in the
blacksmith's shop,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.930
I remember a lot of things that
went on here when I was a kid.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.200
My grandpa was a blacksmith.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.970
My great grandpa
was a blacksmith.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.370
MIKE: Oh.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.170
This place is incredible.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.770
Wow.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.300
The smell, the sounds.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.170
MICKEY: You just don't see a
lot of old blacksmith shops

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.200
anymore.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.930
This is still original.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.070
There's no way you can
prepare yourself for it.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.900
I mean, walking
back into this room.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.370
MICKEY: It's like
walking back in time.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.130
MIKE: I mean, it
truly is. truly is.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.470
ISAAC: It is walking
back in time.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.530
MIKE: All old buildings
have personality.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.700
They're all different
in some way or another.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.870
They're like people.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.100
It's so cool.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.800
So this was
basically his office?

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.870
I mean, this I can see
was mounted right to here.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.730
This was his writing desk.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.130
You know, he had all his
paperwork inside of there.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.830
And then he had all
of this cabinetry

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.200
for every single thing
that he would need.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.500
You got large doors here.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.570
You got large doors
back there and here.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.270
It's like air coming through
as much as it possibly can.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.630
This had to be the
busiest place in town.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.430
[music playing]

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.330
FRANK: What's up, John Lennon?

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.100
ISAAC: Yeah, there you go.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.700
What about that?

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.730
This is a sign bracket.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.630
MICKEY: Yeah, it is a sign.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.100
And they probably made it here.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.000
MIKE: Nah, I doubt it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.370
I've seen a lot of these.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.370
I've seen a lot of these.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.830
This would be for a round sign.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.100
Something that was double sided.
$75.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.170
- $90 Let's do the dance.
- I'll do it.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.670
I got a round sign.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.030
To me, I want something to
look like it has history.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.500
It has miles on it.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.900
That's exactly what
this piece has.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.700
It's an awesome piece.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.270
So Speedwagon.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.700
REO?
MIKE: No.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.870
Well, yeah, REO Speedwagon.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.570
That was actually a vehicle.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.170
Way before REO Speedwagon
topped the charts with "Keep

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.800
on Loving You," REO Speedwagon
was a light duty truck

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.430
that was manufactured by
the REO Motor Car Company

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.900
in Lansing, Michigan.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.900
I think they started
in the early 1900s.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.400
That would be cool like,
I've got an old roadster.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.330
Yeah.
FRANK: On the front grill.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.030
I'd love to stick
that on there, man.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.600
Speedwagon.
MIKE: Even on the dash.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.930
$75.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:27.970
I don't know.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.570
Here.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.470
MICKEY: Yeah.
We probably sell it.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.930
So probably, how about $90?
- $90?

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.930
Yeah.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.470
How about $80?

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.470
MICKEY: Yes.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.300
MIKE: All right, man.
- There you go.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.500
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.530
I know, this was made for
an REO Speedwagon truck.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.970
But I think this would be
cool on a hot rod or rat rod.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.600
I could put this on a
1935 Ford panel truck.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.270
To me, that's my speed wagon.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.030
Guys got it?

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.330
Yeah.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.430
All right, great.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.230
MIKE: This property,
to anybody passing by,

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.700
is just an old building.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.230
But to the Pile family,
it's their history.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.730
They didn't want
to sell anything.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.270
They're just not ready.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.930
It's their forefathers
calling down

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.600
upon them saying, don't sell.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.400
I could hear it as
soon as I walked in.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.670
You got the flyer now.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.030
So as you get
through the layers,

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.900
you find anything that's
not connected to the place,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.200
give us a call.
- Give us a call.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.470
We're not that far away.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.700
We've been working
on this building

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.030
for the last five or six
years trying to clean it up.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.430
It's something that
we want to keep alive.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.630
That's something that we
want to instill in our kids.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.800
They can say, hey, yeah, my
great, great, great, great,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.430
great, grandpa started this.
- See you, Mickey.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.030
See you, Isaac.
- Bye.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.030
See you, fellows.
