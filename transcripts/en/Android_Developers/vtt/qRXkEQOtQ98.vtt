00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:06.729
Big Fish started 15 years
ago as a casual game studio.

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.948
Over the years, we became
a powerhouse in developing

00:00:08.948 --> 00:00:12.350
mobile games for multiple platforms.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.360
We've been making games for
Android since its inception.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.246
It's been great to see how
their focus on developer tools,

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:21.125
and also their global reach,

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:25.002
has helped us make games better
for a much wider audience.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.210
One of the great things
now is we're able to use

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.215
tools like Open Beta to
really get early access

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:32.546
in information to allow
us to actually do more

00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:35.943
of a user centered design
focused development.

00:00:35.943 --> 00:00:37.918
- Historically we've put
games into pre-launch

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:40.274
that we were already
very comfortable with,

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:43.058
and we just waited to validate that we had

00:00:43.058 --> 00:00:43.891
what we thought we had.

00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:45.266
Now that we're using Open Beta

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.492
we're really willing to put
a game out there to the world

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:50.457
much earlier in its process.

00:00:50.457 --> 00:00:52.183
Cooking Craze is a time management game,

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:54.833
in which you play from
the perspective of a chef.

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:56.133
Big Fish published Cooking Craze

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:59.015
working with a partner named
ElaFun who developed it.

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:01.198
This is our first free to
play time management game

00:01:01.198 --> 00:01:04.253
and it's super fun, they really
knocked it our of the park.

00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:06.693
- When comparing our previous game launch

00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:08.337
to our more recent one Cooking Craze,

00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:09.568
where we used Open Beta,

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:12.006
we saw a dramatic reduction in crash rate,

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:13.907
about 21% decrease.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.894
We also got a much higher volume

00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:17.955
of feedback as well, about 10X.

00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:18.842
The other thing that we noticed,

00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:21.929
based on the larger sample
size, was with Cooking Craze,

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.142
we had no surprise one
and two star reviews.

00:01:25.142 --> 00:01:26.376
Whereas our past game release,

00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:29.174
we had a few that were characterized.

00:01:29.174 --> 00:01:30.822
One of the benefits of being in Open Beta

00:01:30.822 --> 00:01:33.192
is you can still be released globally.

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:36.799
This allows our marketing teams
to optimize their processes,

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.510
their paid acquisition
partners and campaigns

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.410
that they weren't able to
do in a GeoLock soft launch.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.661
- Before using Open Beta, we
would pre-release our games

00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:49.605
into a small number of
soft launch countries,

00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:51.936
and we would use them
to see all the metrics

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:52.954
that we're looking for.

00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:55.849
With Open Beta, we're going
worldwide right off the bat,

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.970
and we're able to gather
data from a much wider range

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.969
of players that is much
more representative

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.551
of what we'll see when we
go to our official launch.

00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:08.985
With Open Beta, we have
said no restrictions.

00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:11.350
Go out, go live, see what happens,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.720
and we're able to react
if there's a problem

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.125
instead of assuming that
there would be a problem.

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:18.452
- We're looking at the core game capiod,

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:20.894
as we're looking at the team
that's delivering the game

00:02:20.894 --> 00:02:21.961
and their ability scale.

00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:23.641
We're looking at a lot of the metrics

00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:25.101
that are in Android vitals.

00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:26.144
- When we're in pre-launch,

00:02:26.144 --> 00:02:29.014
we start by looking at retention numbers.

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:30.982
Are people coming back on the second day,

00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:32.270
or are the coming back on the third day?

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.741
We're typically looking
at D1, D7, D30 retention.

00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:38.641
Then we start looking at
the monetization metrics.

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:40.304
Once we're comfortable with those metrics,

00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:42.953
then we know that it's
time to start moving toward

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:44.695
our official launch.

00:02:44.695 --> 00:02:47.229
We are able increase our retention numbers

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.128
fairly significantly.

00:02:48.128 --> 00:02:51.611
We went about nine percentage
points up on D1 retention,

00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:54.243
about eight percentage points up on D7,

00:02:54.243 --> 00:02:57.057
and about 5 percentage points up on D30.

00:02:57.057 --> 00:02:58.357
One of the great things about Open Beta

00:02:58.357 --> 00:03:00.025
is that we're able to gather feedback

00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:02.365
from the beta players without having

00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:05.115
public facing reviews and ratings.

00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:08.537
We're able to fail harder
without having negative reviews

00:03:08.537 --> 00:03:10.072
that stick on our permanent record,

00:03:10.072 --> 00:03:12.452
for the life cycle of the game.

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:14.356
- My recommendation for
all developers out there

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:17.971
is to take a close look at the
tools and the play console.

00:03:17.971 --> 00:03:21.099
We use a lot of them and we
benefit from them tremendously.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.135
Just in the last year,
we've changed the way

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:26.202
we've developed and released
our games substantially,

00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:28.285
based on Open Beta alone.
