1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,250
The Joe Rogan experience. So you, you
guys are dealing with Brexit, right?

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,710
Yeah. We've got a how's that changed
the climate of England? Well, it's made,

3
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:14,400
it's made a very toxic, very, I'm like,
come on, like what's happening over here?

4
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:18,180
You know, it's all gone polarized. Um,

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,320
like with the build the wall stuff.
Yeah. Yeah. And it's one side of the,

6
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:26,260
other than this, no one in
the middle in a way, if,

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,130
if you look at succession and a,
um,

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,060
American civil war that was
bound to happen at some time.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,870
If you go back to the
constitution, um, 17,

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,060
seven and 87 that was, was
happening, happened. I think
once you, European Union,

11
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:46,950
no one's ever tried from
countries that have hundreds
of years of, of, uh, history,

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,740
choose to try and lend to live together,
work together some shape or form.

13
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,060
This tricky thing we're trying to do.

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,820
It's the hottest thing politically that's
ever been done in the history of the

15
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:55,200
world.
Um,

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,890
and I th cause I'm saying the American
muddle with native American lands and

17
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:02,070
rolling over manifest
destiny is a different model.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,190
It's a different way of things happen.
It's a different time as well. Yeah.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,810
Different time. And native Americans
didn't have this idea of, oh,

20
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:12,420
we mark this off in when
we've registered this land.

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,770
So the idea that people are
learning to work together is, um,

22
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,580
it's tricky. At some point someone
was going to say, I think we,

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,250
we'd like to change this
or we'd like to move out.

24
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:26,460
So this fight was bound to
happen. And, uh, so it's,

25
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,970
it's very toxic.
It's,

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm, I'm not getting too in right at
the center of it cause you could just,

27
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,670
you know, probably like
you have a New York, um,

28
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,890
news broadcasts,

29
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,700
you can listen to people talking hours
and hours and hours or what do you think

30
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,950
about, what do you think about,
and it doesn't seem to get anyway,

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,050
so I worked out when my worldview is
this view that everyone's got to have a

32
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:55,470
fair chance in life. I know the
automation is happening right now.

33
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,050
So there's going to be a whole load of,
uh,

34
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,220
people who won't be able to get jobs
because of the unskilled labor force that

35
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,110
job's going to get automated.
That's going to get tricky.

36
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,370
So the universal wage is probably going
to have to come in the idea of universal

37
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:11,130
basic income, universal basic income,
which everyone's gonna have to get,

38
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,830
and it's not going to be a negative
thing. It's gotta be something. Okay,

39
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:17,640
then you can go off and you can retrain
or you can live your life. And uh,

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,330
and then there's artificial intelligence
parity by 2050 next 30 years.

41
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:26,220
And that's what is that mean? We can't
even work out what that means. Right. Um,

42
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,640
I think it's going to get harder before
it gets easier. And so I'm going to just,

43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,650
I always play the long game. I always
do the long game. So, you know,

44
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,790
I came out and it back in
85 and I just thought we'll,

45
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,560
hopefully it'll get better over time.

46
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:42,300
And now this world up in 2019 and it's
definitely better than that was where he

47
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:46,080
can go backwards, phones back. But I just,
I ain't going to try and shoot for that.

48
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,490
And the,
the,

49
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,900
everyone has a fair chance
in life and as to Brexit,

50
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:54,450
where that goes when they, you
know, positive, negative, you know,

51
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,260
I'm against it so I was
just going to find it.

52
00:02:56,261 --> 00:03:00,580
I don't need to think about whether I'm
against it. I just know that I want,

53
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,670
the younger people are coming online to
vote now they're old enough to vote and

54
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,950
they,
78% of them want to be part of Europe.

55
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,190
And the older people who are passing away,

56
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,800
probably 70 80% of them
wanting to be out of Europe.

57
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,590
And it's a fear thing like immigration,

58
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:18,040
fear of well is the thing you've gotta
we have to be brave and curious rather

59
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:22,090
than fearful and suspicious. And these
are the two ways I think people can go.

60
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,540
If we're brave enough, we can be
curious and say, hi, how are you?

61
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,820
Where are you from and what do you do?
Can we learn for you?

62
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:30,700
Can you learn from us? I think that
is the way for humanity to go forward.

63
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,270
Or You could be fearful and suspicious,
what? Hang on, they'll back off outside.

64
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,280
Don't, I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to know about you.

65
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,990
And that's the fearful and suspicious way.
And um,

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,960
I think we have to be brave and curious,
otherwise we're not going to make it.

67
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,670
So for us in America,

68
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:50,290
what you're essentially dealing with a
bunch of different countries that speak a

69
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,580
bunch of different languages,

70
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,670
whereas we're dealing with a bunch of
different states that speak the same

71
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,950
language, but it's kind of
doesn't make any difference. Yeah.

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,990
It's interesting because I thought
if everyone could get the hang,

73
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,350
because English has become a
Lingua Franca for the world,

74
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,650
hasn't made much difference.
And as America shows,

75
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:07,180
you can be completely at loggerheads,

76
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,500
whether you're saying
the same words or not.

77
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,990
I think if you're not saying the same
words, it's easier for people to say,

78
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,710
who are these people? We hate them because
they can't understand a single word.

79
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:16,530
They're saying that's easier.
But yeah,

80
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:19,750
it's an easier way to be
xenophobic slash racist on it.

81
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,470
And I've always said the xenophobia is
just a racist, where the xylophone check,

82
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,850
which I got to somewhere to
political situation. Um, but

83
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,310
[inaudible].
