00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.680
Importance of recovery within your training program.

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.360
And this is by the way, this is from a sore necks.

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.750
You the guys that make weight racks. Yeah. Well, you know, for Rick,

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.730
for recovery to be important, you have to have done the hard work to need it.

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.660
So I think a lot of people focus on recovery all the time. Um,

6
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.710
when they seriously, uh, I can't do that today,

7
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.713
I'm on recovery.

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.330
I gotta get a cryotherapy or ice bath or get a massage or acupuncture, you know,

9
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:36.290
like bitch, go train hard, you know,

10
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:40.370
like these callouses, I cut off, you know, like weekly.

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.920
It's from hard work, you know, and,

12
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.700
and I think recovery is as important as training,

13
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.060
but first the training has to be there and it has to be hard enough for it to

14
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:57.020
warrant needing recovery. Yeah. Now I would say when, when, um,

15
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.730
when I was training fighters, I don't do it a lot anymore,

16
00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:00.110
but when I was training UFC fighters,

17
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.000
it was so obvious when they were overtrained. Like they'd go from the, you know,

18
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.730
they be given me a hard time on the mat or whatever.

19
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:11.870
And all of a sudden I'm just annihilated and I go, yeah, hey, day off mango,

20
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.910
eat two steaks tomorrow and just relax and easy. But you know some guys,

21
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.070
oh I needed a couple of days off. You know,

22
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.150
I think it has more to do with lifestyle than recovery. You know,

23
00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:25.950
like when people are like, man, I'm just not being able to put that,

24
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.450
get the output, the volume that I need to do for work.

25
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.080
Let's talk about your life. You know, like we out chasing pussy last night.

26
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.430
Oh you were? You were, you were at a strip club. Is that glitter suck. Get Out.

27
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.300
Get, what have you eaten this week? Tell me, show me your diet.

28
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:43.960
Did you even have a log? No, you don't have a log. Get Out. You know,

29
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.250
how much did you sleep last night? Oh, you don't know cause what you drank,

30
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.510
get out. You know, like when was the last time you had a drink? Oh, last night.

31
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.690
Get Out, you know, stop talking to me about recovery.

32
00:01:55.691 --> 00:01:58.030
If you don't have a lifestyle that's conducive to training, you know,

33
00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:02.920
like you wanna talk about healthy lifestyle, get it out of sleep. Well,

34
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.970
yeah, I know. Yeah. Hey, Jocko doesn't sleep a lot. That's all right.

35
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.280
That's all right. Eat real food. Stop putting crap in your body. Stop Drinking,

36
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.920
Yo, you won't drop your testosterone. You won't talking about,

37
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:16.800
these guys are having like huge problems with stuff.

38
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.460
One stop using steroids to stop drinking. You know, for me,

39
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.010
sex day every day, get eight hours of sleep, work my ass off.

40
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.030
I think that a man for a real athlete, man or woman,

41
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.950
they have to go to bed tired.

42
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.790
I love that feeling where like you are exhausted.

43
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.500
You see that bed and you're like, fuck here kid. I mean to me, can I make it,

44
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.110
you know, can I make it from the shower to bed?

45
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.600
That's what you're supposed to feel like we've talked about that on here.

46
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.910
That's,

47
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.240
that's one of my favorite feelings in the world of I get to the end of the night

48
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:55.080
and I'm barely hanging on through dinner. I'm,

49
00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.190
by the time I get done with Dero Barton. God can't wait to wife starts talking.

50
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:04.400
You're like, baby Wa wa, Wa, Wa, Wa, Wa, Wa. You hear the words,

51
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.250
but I don't know what you're saying. Yeah. You know?

52
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.190
So I, yeah, that's, that's great input. Sleep,

53
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.850
eat right. It's, you can work, man. Humans can do a lot of this.

54
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.580
The body is so adaptive.

55
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.720
You've got people that can run ultra marathons and he got people that can

56
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:27.630
deadlift thousands of pounds and we're the same species. Right.

57
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.270
You know,

58
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.980
we have people that can like paint the Mona Lisa and there's people that can go

59
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:35.710
and murder villages,

60
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.740
same species. You know,

61
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:43.060
like it is an adaptive thing as long as you train it properly.
