00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.630
hello I'm Lillian here's my question I'm
wondering what can I do with science

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640
wondering what can I do with science
 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.639
wondering what can I do with science
outside of science class science is such

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649

watch the moon
 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.509
watch the moon
it's amazing it's amazing people don't

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519
it's amazing it's amazing people don't
 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.240
it's amazing it's amazing people don't
realize why the moon changes shape as

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250
realize why the moon changes shape as
 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.039
realize why the moon changes shape as
seen from the earth and and most people

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049
seen from the earth and and most people
 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.110
seen from the earth and and most people
do not know the phase of the moon they

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120
do not know the phase of the moon they
 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.610
do not know the phase of the moon they
don't know the shape of the moon right

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620
don't know the shape of the moon right
 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.030
don't know the shape of the moon right
now but maybe you will and of course

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040
now but maybe you will and of course
 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.890

there was a time when everybody knew the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900
there was a time when everybody knew the
 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.089
there was a time when everybody knew the
shape of the moon because we didn't have

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099
shape of the moon because we didn't have
 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.250
shape of the moon because we didn't have
streetlights we didn't have lights at

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260
streetlights we didn't have lights at
 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.020
streetlights we didn't have lights at
night and so everybody was aware of how

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030
night and so everybody was aware of how
 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.330
night and so everybody was aware of how
much light there be my grandparents

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340
much light there be my grandparents
 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.160
much light there be my grandparents
would tell you exactly when the moon was

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170
would tell you exactly when the moon was
 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.039
would tell you exactly when the moon was
going to be what shape my parents maybe

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049
going to be what shape my parents maybe
 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.009
going to be what shape my parents maybe
not so much people I went to school with

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019
not so much people I went to school with
 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.589

talked about physical science with
 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.849
talked about physical science with
flying a balloon then chemistry should

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859
flying a balloon then chemistry should
 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.050
flying a balloon then chemistry should
do some chemistry

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060
do some chemistry
