00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.310
Hi I'm Sal.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.980
Today we're going to solve
problem number 6 of

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.320
exam 1 of fall 2009.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.040
Now before you attempt a
problem, there are a lot of

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.680
things that you should know,
that is background material

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.740
that's going to help you
solve the problem.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.060
Especially during an exam,
given that this was the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.560
hardest on this exam.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.540
So you should be able to
finish this within

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.740
15 minutes or so.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.520
So before you start the problem
you should know what

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.800
the energy is of a charged
particle in an electric field,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830
which is given by
this equation.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.640
The conversion from an electron
volt to a joule,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.810
which is just a conversion of
energy and this should be

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.350
given to you on your
table of constants.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.970
Also the energy associated with
an emission spectrum,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.610
which is given by this equation
where k is actually

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.740
the ionization energy of
hydrogen, which is 13.6

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.140
electron volts and the z squared
is the atomic number

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.320
of your atom of interest. And
then the n f and the n sub i

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.340
are your transition states.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.360
The DeBroglie wavelength, which
is given by lambda, is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.370
equal to a Planck's Constant
divided by the momentum.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.430
And always remember that you
need to conserve energy.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.950
This is what's going
to get you the full

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.400
points on the problem.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.940
So the problem, it's best to
solve if you draw a little

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.690
image as you read the problem.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.170
So the problem reads, atoms of
ionized helium gas, He plus,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.350
are struck by electrons in a gas
discharge tube operating

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.040
with the potential difference
between the

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.060
electrodes set at 8.8 volts.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.580
So I'm going to go ahead and
start drawing an image.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:13.070
So let's say I have two plates
where the voltage between

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:21.930
these two is set
at 8.88 volts.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.690
And what's happening here is
that you're accelerating

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.750
electrons through here.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.660
So you can imagine that--

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.992
say this is positively
charges and this

00:02:30.992 --> 00:02:32.570
is negatively charged--

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.910
that an electron starts from
your negative plate and then

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.750
it accelerates toward your
positive plate and you can

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.940
imagine your plate having hole
or something small where your

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.550
electron can then exit and then
be in free space under

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.890
the influence of no potential.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.330
So then these electrons are
actually being aimed towards

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.350
your helium plus ions.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.580
So that's your target.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.770
Now if I continue reading the
problem, it says that the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.920
emmision spectrum includes the
line associated with the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.310
transition from n equals
3 to n equals 2.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.890
Calculate the minimum value of
the DeBroglie wavelength of

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.480
scattered electrons that have
collided with helium plus and

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.050
generated this line in the
emission spectrum.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.950
So it's an energy conservation
problem.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.010
And all this tells you is that,
you have an electron

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.780
that is being accelerated
through your potential.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.600
The electron is going to strike
a helium plus atom and

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.960
upon that you detect an
emission spectrum.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.910
Well what does that tell you?

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.360
That tells you that that
electron actually excited an

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.950
electron in the atom.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.710
The electron had to transition
to a higher state to absorb

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.340
energy and then decay and in
the process of decaying it

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.800
emits a photon, which
is what you detect.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.630
So this information
is given to you.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.415
But the problem asks to find
the value of the DeBroglie

00:03:57.415 --> 00:03:59.150
wavelength.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.220
So since this an energy
conservation problem, and this

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.510
is the very first step that
happens and I know that my

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.530
energy equation for a
charged particle is

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.220
simply q times the voltage.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.600
So I know that q, which is a
certain value of charge, the

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.400
product of these two when I'm
multiplying by 8.8 volts, this

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.730
yields 8.88 electron volts.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.120
So it's a new unit of energy
where we just saw the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.140
conversion.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.255
And the reason why this takes
this shape is because one

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:40.880
electron has the charge of 1.6
times 10 to the negative 19

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.835
coulombs and that's where the
conversion from electrical

00:04:42.835 --> 00:04:45.100
volts to joules come from.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.260
So I'm going to go ahead and
call this e sub i initial.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.740
Because this is our initial
energy that we're given.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.570
So we just start with this
energy, nothing else.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.370
Nothing else was given
from the problem.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.140
So we want to go ahead
and conserve this.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.690
So our final state, the
combination of whatever we are

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.500
solving, should not have a
higher energy than what

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.670
initially we started with.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.780
So because the problem says
that we have an emission

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.370
spectrum, I'm going to go ahead
and draw another image.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.560
I'll label this one,
initial and I'll

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.190
label this one, final.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:37.690
So my final image, you can
imagine a helium plus atom.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:44.990
And the electron strikes the
helium plus atom and we detect

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.620
a photon and you're getting
a scattered electron.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.280
That's what the problem says.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.740
Scattered electron.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:03.050
So what this tells me is that
this energy now is going into

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.340
creating a photon and
scattering an

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.510
electron from your atom.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.180
So if I was to equate those two
or what not I can already

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.360
say that, well in my final state
I detect an emission or

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.450
an emission spectrum.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.670
And I know what the
transition says.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.570
It goes from n equals
3 to n equals 2.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.100
That's what the problem
tells us.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.680
So if I take my equation, my
delta e of my emission

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.730
spectrum, is simply going to be
negative k, which is 13.6

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.980
electron volts.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.400
And I'm going to multiply
by the atomic

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.670
number, squared now.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.400
This is where people also make
mistakes during the exam.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.770
The atomic number is not 1.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.000
It's actually 2 because we're
talking about helium.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.200
And the atomic number is not
the number of electrons or

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.440
values in terms of an ion, but
it's actually the number of

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.140
protons that you have. So
helium has 2 protons.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.630
So I can multiply this by 2.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.120
And I'm going to square it.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.160
And I know that I'm going from
n and equals 3 to n equals 2.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.600
So if I plug this into my
equation I have 1 over 3

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.300
squared minus 1 over 2 squared,
which is 9 and 4.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.530
And if you plug this in, and
assuming that your calculator

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:37.920
works and is correct, you get a
value of 7.56 electron volts

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.230
because that was the unit
that I was using.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.270
Everything else is unitless,
so my energy is now 7.56

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.050
electron volts for
my transition.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.800
Which covers this part
for my photon.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.900
So now we're left with what
the energy of this is.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.920
So what is the energy of
the scattered electron?

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.730
Well if I equate the initial to
the final I know that the

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.950
final is a composition
of the transition

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.120
in my scatter state.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:16.110
So I know that e initial, which
is 8.88 electron volts,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:21.370
this equals to the energy for
the emission spectrum, which

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.610
is 7.56 electron volts.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.270
So I'll put the units in square
brackets so you don't

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.980
get confused.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:43.850
And then plus the energy of
the scattered electron.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.120
So if I subtract the two,
I get the energy of

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.290
my scattered electron.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.870
And that pretty much gives
me a value of--

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.080
after I subtract that--

00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:01.390
e of scattered electron
is equal to--

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:06.090
well the distance between these
two is actually 1.32

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.340
electron volts.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.330
But don't stop here because the
problem didn't ask you to

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.690
figure out the energy of
the scattered electron.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.150
It actually told us to figure
out what the DeBroglie

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.330
wavelength is of this
scattered electron.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.870
Now the fact that the electron
is scattered, to me that means

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.780
that the only energy
that this particle

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.140
has is kinetic energy.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.970
So it's a classical
form of energy.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:37.176
So I can go ahead and I can
equate this to just 1/2 mass

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:40.880
of the electrons times my
velocity squared-- whatever

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.010
velocity it has.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.160
Now I'd don't need to figure
out what the velocity is.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.960
This is just important to figure
out what the DeBroglie

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.750
wavelength is.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.840
So this is good.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.050
Now if we look at what our
DeBroglie wavelength is, we

00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:02.460
know that lambda is
equal to Planck's

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.640
Constant divided by p.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:15.140
And Planck's Constant has a
value of 6.6 times 10 to the

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:21.450
minus 34 with units
of joules seconds.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.460
So this is important too.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.670
Always keep track of your units
because dimensional

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.420
analysis will help you a lot
when solving these problems. A

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.620
lot of the times you're given
energy values in electron

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.050
volts but your solution will
have a constant that doesn't

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.500
have an electron volt, that will
have a joule, so you're

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.520
forced to make that conversion
or else your problem is going

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.700
to be wrong.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.820
OK so with that in mind,
we know what h is.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.800
But what about p?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.980
Well p is momentum.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.520
And classical momentum is just
mass times your velocity.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:57.390
So this is just mass times
velocity, but this is the mass

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.940
times our velocity.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.260
We know what the mass
of the election is.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.250
That's given on our table
of constants.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.970
But the velocity, we don't know
what it is but we can

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.850
grab it from our classical
energy.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.250
So if I look at my energy--

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:16.200
from the side so I'm going
to look at my energy--

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.450
I know that my energy--

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.984
I'm going to call this
scat, for scattered--

00:11:21.984 --> 00:11:27.810
the energy of my scattered
electron is simply 1/2 the

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.980
mass of the electron times
our velocity squared.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:36.880
Now if I multiply both sides by
2m, I'm going to go ahead

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.520
and get us to the point where I
can get an equation that is

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.960
just my mass times v.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.380
So I'm going to multiply both
sides by 2m, So I get 2 mass

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:55.360
of the electron, e scat of
the electron, equals--

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.125
if I multiply this by
2m, the two cancel,

00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:58.820
so I get an m squared.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.790
m squared times v squared
is essentially

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.250
just m times v squared.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:08.630
And this becomes just mass of
your electron v squared.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:16.580
Now if I take the square root
of both sides, I end up

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.510
getting a nice relation
for just m times v.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:24.990
So I know that m times v now is
just simply equal to this--

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.710
canceled, the square root
cancels the square.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:33.050
The square root of 2 mass of the
electron times the energy

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.780
of the scattered electron.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.750
So if I go back to my DeBroglie

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.550
wavelength, I have m v.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.830
So I can take that value as a
function of energy and just

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.820
substitute it into
my equation.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.410
And that'll help us get the
answer because we know what

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.900
the energy of the scattered
electron is.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.770
We calculated that on
the first part.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.380
So with that in mind we'll
come over here.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:01.590
Again this is 6.6 times
10 to the minus 34.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.760
And the units are
joules seconds.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:15.800
And down here I have the square
root of 2 times my mass

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.480
of the electron, which is on
your table of constants.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:24.620
And it's just 9.11 times
10 to the minus 31.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:30.070
And this has units of kilograms.
And the energy of

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:38.460
my scattered electron, which
is 1.3 times 1.32 and this

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.640
units of electron volts.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.610
Now this has units of
electron volts.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.402
This has units of joules.

00:13:46.402 --> 00:13:48.010
This problem's a little bit--

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.230
now you're not going to get a
good answer with that unless

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.160
you make the conversion.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.880
I pointed it out, the bullet
point in the beginning was

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.540
that 1 electron volt is equal
to 1.6 times 10 to minus 19

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.300
joules, so if I simply
multiply this by that

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:11.540
conversion, just 1.6 times 10
to the minus 19, this has

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:18.800
units now of joules
per electron volt.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.740
So this has units of joules
per electron volt.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.220
The equation turned out
to be pretty long.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.780
But this cancels the electron
volt and now

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.320
has units of joules.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.600
Which if you go through the
math, you're going to go ahead

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.820
and at the end get a unit
of just meters.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.940
Because joule is just kilogram,
meters squared per

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.380
second squared.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:44.260
So all that factors out and
you end up getting that.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.780
If you go through the math and
you get your math right, then

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:54.610
this should yield a value
of 1.06 times 10

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:59.920
to the minus 9 meters.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:06.550
So this is the value that
will get you the right

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.660
answer on the exam.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.410
Again this is lambda for your
DeBroglie wavelength because

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.740
that's what the problem is.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.120
So the problem asked for the
DeBroglie wavelength but it

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.800
give you all this information to
get to the point where you

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.890
needed to solve.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:25.050
And by conserving energy and
knowing the right conversion

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.660
factors between energies you're
able to get an answer,

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.740
which is good.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.940
It's really easy to complicate
things and get a

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.450
wrong problem now.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:41.280
I remember from grading the
exams, the most common error

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.410
that people faced was actually
letting the energy of the

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.900
electron be the energy
of a photon.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.320
Now that can't be because the
energy of a photon is just

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.950
your Planck's Constant
times a frequency.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:59.110
And that's the energy for
massless particles, your

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.390
electron has mass so if
it's moving it's not

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.410
going to be h nu.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.480
The energy is going to
be kinetic energy.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.370
1/2 mb squared.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.650
If it's not in an electric
field, that is.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:14.160
So with that in mind just be
confident when you solve these

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.690
problems and make sure that you
know exactly what energy

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.820
equations to use to get
the right answer.
