00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.000
So you know that's a fish.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.834
Oh, that's cool.

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:04.033
He's cute, or she.

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.266
You can't even tell.

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.066
But what is that fish thinking?

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.967
Is it like-- is it nostalgia?

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:11.166
Is it rage?

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.934
Maybe I'm just projecting.

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:15.232
But you can't really
tell what it's thinking.

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:16.033
It's a mystery.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:16.834
It's an enigma.

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:19.433
But watch this.

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:21.633
Eyebrows.

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:22.633
Now, you see it.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.000
Now, this fish has
an emotional life.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.834
You can really empathize with.

00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:29.666
So you want fish
to have eyebrows.

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:30.567
That's the secret.

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:31.367
Yes.

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:32.467
So is that so hard?

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:33.500
Is it so wrong?

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.934
Can you do that please?

00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:37.132
I'll work on it.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.200
Thank you.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.500
That'll be your next
big genetic project.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.633
It's just for their advantage.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.400
I mean, look at that.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.833
Well, Sylvia Earle loves every
fish in the sea, no matter

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:49.066
what, with or without eyebrows.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.367
And I asked her about
her love of the ocean.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:54.300
Just tell me, speak the love.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.333
And let's see what she says.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.233
When I think of people who
love the ocean, many of them

00:00:58.233 --> 00:00:59.833
just like sailing the ocean.

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:00.834
Yeah, or surfing.

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:01.767
Surfing, right.

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:04.066
So the ocean to
them is a surface.

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.132
I know.

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:07.000
And to you, it's a
three dimensional--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.800
The ocean

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.066
Is the wet part.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:09.867
The wet part.

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:11.567
Really?

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:13.000
It's not the top.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.166
What is the top?

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.133
It is the bottom.

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.166
Boat people, the
ocean is a surface.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.232
Right?

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:19.800
No, it's the juicy
part in the middle.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.333
It's this part.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.300
And it's alive.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.633
That's the thing.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.967
If people think of the ocean,
they think rocks and water

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:30.500
and, you know, a place to
sail or swim or to dump things

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.033
or to take things
out of the ocean.

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:33.233
But no.

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:37.000
The ocean is a living system.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.133
So Laurie, first, remind us
what it means for the ocean

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.232
to be a living system.

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:45.800
Because to most people,
it's just water.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.633
And it contains living things.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:52.066
But to think of it as a
living system, take us there.

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:56.100
So in the same way that a
forest with birds and trees

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.133
and bugs that are all
interacting is a living system,

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.567
the ocean's the same way.

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:05.133
It's not only full of life,
but it's all interacting

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:08.667
together in in
connected way that kind

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:09.967
of keeps it all functioning.

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:11.967
Isn't it just big
fish eat little fish?

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:13.133
That's part of it.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.200
But there's a whole
complex food web

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.132
there that most
people just don't see

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:19.133
and take into consideration.
