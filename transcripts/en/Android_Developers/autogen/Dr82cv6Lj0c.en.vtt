so Jacob the CEO of play lab who should
 

00:27:27.709 --> 00:27:31.959
so Jacob the CEO of play lab who should
be in the room today ok so they are a

00:27:31.959 --> 00:27:31.969
be in the room today ok so they are a
 

00:27:31.969 --> 00:27:34.829
be in the room today ok so they are a
game developer company from Thailand and

00:27:34.829 --> 00:27:34.839
game developer company from Thailand and
 

00:27:34.839 --> 00:27:37.569
game developer company from Thailand and
he told us that she loved to have the

00:27:37.569 --> 00:27:37.579

through spreadsheet and also seeing per
 

00:27:43.399 --> 00:27:46.449
through spreadsheet and also seeing per
device or per country comparison so the

00:27:46.449 --> 00:27:46.459
