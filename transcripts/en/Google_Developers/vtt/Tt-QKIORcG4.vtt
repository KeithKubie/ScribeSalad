00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.872
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.872 --> 00:00:10.840
A couple years ago, I got
involved with some people.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.020
Not Java coders.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.090
No.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.300
This isn't a talk about Java.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.100
These people were into fashion.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.269
Now, that's a bit out of
the stereotype for a coder.

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:23.560
But what's a coder going to do?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.970
Well, I studied.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.309
And it was interesting,
these principles of fashion.

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.350
Fast forward, and we're
working on our next game.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.530
We need an art style, but
we're short on artists.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.779
So what's a coder going to do?

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:38.270
Well, I studied.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.970
And surprisingly, it
was all very familiar.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.510
It turns out that the
principles of fashion

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.750
are just the principles
of aesthetics.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.030
And the principles of
aesthetics are universal.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.130
So if you learn something
about dressing well,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.430
then you learn something
about decorating your living

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.320
room, choosing a font
for your business card,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.720
and yes, improving the
visuals of your next game.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.387
So let me tell you
about what I learned.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.710
I learned that this is wrong.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.020
So wrong for so many reasons.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.210
But one of those reasons is
that there is no contrast.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.740
Now, these outfits
have contrast.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.200
Notice how the colors
define recognizable

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.610
shapes, so the eye knows
what it's looking at.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.150
Notice too how the
details draws your eye in,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.900
so that the eye knows what
it's supposed to be looking at.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.500
Now, this same principle
applies to games.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.130
In Prune, at the start of
the level, all of the colors

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.100
are solid and all of the
shapes are geometrical.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.450
Then, when a tree
starts to grow,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.570
it starts to add a little
detail to the scene.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.070
And at the end of
the level, there's

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.850
an explosion of
detail and colors.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.730
This addition of contrast
is immensely rewarding

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.750
aesthetically.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.660
It's like you are aesthetically
completing the scene.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.810
So contrast and shapes,
details and color.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.080
The eye needs contrast.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.940
OK.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.434
So contrast is good, right?

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.999
Then why is this so wrong?

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.040
There's no cohesion here.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.560
There's no focus.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.860
Everything is vying
for your attention.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.760
These outfits have repetition.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.010
Notice the repetition in
the colors, the shapes,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.400
even the formalness of
the pieces is repeated.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.030
Now, this need for repetition
applies to all visuals.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.250
In Alto, the
triangles of the trees

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.990
are repeated in the mountains.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.350
The circle of the sun
is repeated in one

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.760
of the trees on the right.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.870
The overall color is
consistent, and it

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.540
frames the one
strongly contrasting

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.150
shape-- your character.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.680
So repetition and shapes,
colors, and styles.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.563
It unifies your look and
allows you to focus attention.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.210
Now, for colors,
you can go wild.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.330
That's what Keita Takahashi
does in his games.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.797
And some people dress like
this, too, which is amazing.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.240
But there's a definite method
behind colors like this.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.524
Colors like this are
hard, which explains

00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:29.732
why most of the people in
this room are wearing blue.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.540
But colors can be easy, too.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.910
Sometimes you just see
a color combination

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.990
that you really love, so all
you have to do is remember that.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.870
And then you can
wear it yourself,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.730
or you can use it in your
next game, like in Journey.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.400
They didn't use blue for the
sky and brown for the sand.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.377
They chose colors that were
far more vibrant and impactful.

00:03:55.377 --> 00:03:56.960
And they knew those
colors would work,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.043
because they were probably
wearing them themselves

00:03:59.043 --> 00:03:59.972
just the other day.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.710
Or in Monument Valley.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.680
You can see how the
bold color palettes

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.280
add to the emotion of the game.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.730
When you look at the
most beautiful games,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.279
it's clear that they're not
driven by a technical mindset.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.310
They're not simply showing off
the latest lighting techniques,

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.000
for instance.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.400
They're driven, instead,
by a deep appreciation

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.200
for the principles
of aesthetics,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.440
like contrast, repetition,
color, contrast, repetition,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.088
and color.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.990
You can learn these
principles yourself, too,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.920
if you practice them every day.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.170
Here are three coders at
Google who do just that.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.570
And they don't practice
aesthetics by studying.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.460
No.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.200
They simply consider
each morning which

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.450
shoes go well with these pants.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.170
Thanks.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.370
