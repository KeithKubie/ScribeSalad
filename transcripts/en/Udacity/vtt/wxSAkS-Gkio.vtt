00:00:02.638 --> 00:00:04.918
Hey how you feeling?

00:00:04.918 --> 00:00:06.518
&gt;&gt; So much better.

00:00:06.518 --> 00:00:12.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really looks like
you're getting a lot done.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.530
&gt;&gt; I think he's in the zone now.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I think we should leave him alone.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.468
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:18.700
&gt;&gt; Well, anyway, we just scratched
the surface of code editors.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.280
But now you know it's out there.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.980
And just like everybody's different and
has their own way of doing things,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.720
it's the same with code.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.600
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.500
You should go out and
experiment with different code packages,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.666
keyboard shortcuts,
maybe even try a new code editor.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.500
You'd be surprised at
how fun it can be and

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.660
how easy it is to improve
your workflow that way.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.322
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'll have a chance
to practice in the next lesson.

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:41.340
You're going to dive deeper into
the layout and sizing of elements.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.953
I'll see you there.
