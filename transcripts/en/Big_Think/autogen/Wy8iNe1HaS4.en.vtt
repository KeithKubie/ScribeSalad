I think the process is important so

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529
I think the process is important so
 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.360
I think the process is important so
grant writing and science is important

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370
grant writing and science is important
 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.919
grant writing and science is important
it's difficult because the numbers are

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929
it's difficult because the numbers are
 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.540
it's difficult because the numbers are
so low and it's so hard to get funded

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550
so low and it's so hard to get funded
 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.459
so low and it's so hard to get funded
but at the same time while it's a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469
but at the same time while it's a
 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.770
but at the same time while it's a
painstaking process it makes sense to me

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780
painstaking process it makes sense to me
 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.109
painstaking process it makes sense to me
mean in any business or industry you

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
mean in any business or industry you
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.609
mean in any business or industry you
have to show that you're going to use

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
have to show that you're going to use
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.840
have to show that you're going to use
the money wisely and you've thought out

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
the money wisely and you've thought out
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.689
the money wisely and you've thought out
through all the different options so for

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
through all the different options so for
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.310
through all the different options so for
me so far I've really enjoyed the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
me so far I've really enjoyed the
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560
me so far I've really enjoyed the
process this is the process of thinking

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570
process this is the process of thinking
 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.990
process this is the process of thinking
through in advance and looking at all

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000
through in advance and looking at all
 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.250
through in advance and looking at all
the different outcomes that could come

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260
the different outcomes that could come
 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
the different outcomes that could come
into play and whether or not it's a so

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
into play and whether or not it's a so
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.090
into play and whether or not it's a so
it keeps you responsible and it keeps

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
it keeps you responsible and it keeps
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.799
it keeps you responsible and it keeps
you thinking very proactively about

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
you thinking very proactively about
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.299
you thinking very proactively about
what's the best way to do your science

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
what's the best way to do your science
 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.880
what's the best way to do your science
so I enjoy writing the grants and I

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
so I enjoy writing the grants and I
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.850
so I enjoy writing the grants and I
think it's important but at the same

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
think it's important but at the same
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.440
think it's important but at the same
time it's definitely difficult for a lot

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
time it's definitely difficult for a lot
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.650
time it's definitely difficult for a lot
of scientists because money is becoming

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
of scientists because money is becoming
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.569
of scientists because money is becoming
more scarce and this isn't a great time

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579
more scarce and this isn't a great time
 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.119
more scarce and this isn't a great time
for the national budget and science so

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
for the national budget and science so
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.040
for the national budget and science so
that that makes it difficult so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050
that that makes it difficult so
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.810
that that makes it difficult so
obviously I wouldn't want it if I you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
obviously I wouldn't want it if I you
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.510
obviously I wouldn't want it if I you
know projections were you know the norm

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
know projections were you know the norm
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.880
know projections were you know the norm
for a long period of time but I see why

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
for a long period of time but I see why
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.390
for a long period of time but I see why
it's important I think like most people

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
it's important I think like most people
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.640
it's important I think like most people
you know we find our inspiration or our

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
you know we find our inspiration or our
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070
you know we find our inspiration or our
excitement from all sorts of places so

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
excitement from all sorts of places so
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.929
excitement from all sorts of places so
and while there's a couple things that

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
and while there's a couple things that
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.370
and while there's a couple things that
are pretty fundamental to me like

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
are pretty fundamental to me like
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.700
are pretty fundamental to me like
medicine music I'm always you're always

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
medicine music I'm always you're always
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.960
medicine music I'm always you're always
dabbling right a hundred different

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970
dabbling right a hundred different
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.630
dabbling right a hundred different
things and that's very much the kind of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640
things and that's very much the kind of
 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.120
things and that's very much the kind of
these generation x and y's about like

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
these generation x and y's about like
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.060
these generation x and y's about like
exploring all sorts of things so when I

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
exploring all sorts of things so when I
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.440
exploring all sorts of things so when I
was at Oxford I really started getting

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450
was at Oxford I really started getting
 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.210
was at Oxford I really started getting
into the history of science so reading

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
into the history of science so reading
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.969
into the history of science so reading
all about all the early people and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979
all about all the early people and
 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.469
all about all the early people and
evolution actually like Darwin and walls

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
evolution actually like Darwin and walls
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.600
evolution actually like Darwin and walls
but also hooker and Lyle and Memphis and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
but also hooker and Lyle and Memphis and
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.670
but also hooker and Lyle and Memphis and
so I went this really big period of just

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
so I went this really big period of just
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.170
so I went this really big period of just
understanding the history of science and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
understanding the history of science and
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.609
understanding the history of science and
that was like that definitely inspired

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
that was like that definitely inspired
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.830
that was like that definitely inspired
me and kind of made me think about a lot

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
me and kind of made me think about a lot
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.960
me and kind of made me think about a lot
of the process in a very different way

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
of the process in a very different way
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.550
of the process in a very different way
end up writing a play about it because I

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
end up writing a play about it because I
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.600
end up writing a play about it because I
got so into it you know lately and then

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
got so into it you know lately and then
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190
got so into it you know lately and then
I go through these periods of just

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
I go through these periods of just
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.080
I go through these periods of just
really loving and then the fiction

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090
really loving and then the fiction
 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.149
really loving and then the fiction
writers so there's tons of them that I

both blank and tipping point really
 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.730
both blank and tipping point really
interesting for economics like so you

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740
interesting for economics like so you
 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.690
interesting for economics like so you
know you go through just different

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
know you go through just different
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.830

periods where different things become

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840
periods where different things become
 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.610
periods where different things become
mini obsessions and I'd say right now

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620
mini obsessions and I'd say right now
 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.020
mini obsessions and I'd say right now
that another mini upset like so I've

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030
that another mini upset like so I've
 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.640
that another mini upset like so I've
many many obsessions like right now

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
many many obsessions like right now
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.010
many many obsessions like right now

and you're going through the different

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100
and you're going through the different
 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.860
and you're going through the different
you go through each song and you go from

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870
you go through each song and you go from
 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.780
you go through each song and you go from
like you know easy to medium to hard and

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790
like you know easy to medium to hard and
 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.890
like you know easy to medium to hard and
then you go through all the difference

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900
then you go through all the difference
 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.940
then you go through all the difference
it's so fantastic so I'm very very close

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950
it's so fantastic so I'm very very close
 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.610
