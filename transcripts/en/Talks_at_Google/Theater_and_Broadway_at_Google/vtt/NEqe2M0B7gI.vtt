[MUSIC - "SUMMERTIME"
FROM PORGY AND BESS]

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:14.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.350
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That was beautiful.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.200
That was Sumayya Ali and David
Hughey, performing "Summertime"

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.030
from the Tony Award
winning musical,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.620
"The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess."

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.508
Thank you so much.

00:02:26.508 --> 00:02:31.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.650
We are so lucky to
have the wonderful cast

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.210
and a few creative members of
this production here at Google.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.420
I would like to welcome
Suzan-Lori Parks,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.360
the musical book adapter, and
the first African-American

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.881
woman to win the
Pulitzer Prize in Drama.

00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:56.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.060
We also have Diane Paulus,
the show's Tony Award

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.942
winning director.

00:03:00.942 --> 00:03:06.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.990
And Michael Strunsky, trustee
of the Ira and Leonore Gershwin

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.066
estate, and nephew
of Ira Gershwin.

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:18.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.280
Let's start with
you, Suzan-Lori.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.060
For those who might
not know, can you

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.910
please tell us what the story of
"Porgy and Bess" is all about?

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.210
SUZAN-LORI PARKS: Yes. "Porgy
and Bess" is a love story.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.520
It's set in Catfish
Row, which is

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.680
a neighborhood in
South Carolina.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.700
Now, the main action
concerns a man named Porgy.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.180
And he was born disabled.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.970
And because he was
born with a disability,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.910
he actually believes that God
has made him to be lonely,

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.160
without love.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.580
And of course, he's wrong.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.040
Because into his life
comes love in the form

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.440
of a woman named Bess.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.510
And "Porgy and Bess" is
also about the community

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.220
of Catfish Row.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.500
And you get to meet the good
folks and the bad folks,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.960
the church going ladies
and the scallywag men.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.090
You get to see them
survive a hurricane.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.420
BTW, Bess happens
to be also involved

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.530
with a guy called Crown.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.870
And so you get a little bit
of a love triangle going on

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.804
in there.

00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:13.970
DIANE PAULUS: Lots of drama.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.070
SUZAN-LORI PARKS: Lots of drama.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.349
And Diane, this is a
great American masterpiece

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.450
with a significant history.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.131
Can you tell us a little
bit more about that history?

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:24.880
DIANE PAULUS: Yes.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.560
This piece is a great
American masterwork.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.320
And it started as
a novel in 1925

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.790
called "Porgy," written
by DuBose Heyward.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.600
It later became a play that
DuBose's wife Dorothy basically

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.100
wrote.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.170
She encouraged her husband
to turn it into a play.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.711
They eventually
co-wrote it together.

00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:47.460
It premiered on
Broadway in 1927.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.360
George Gershwin was looking
for a subject matter

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.440
to write his great
American folk opera.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.204
He famously read the novel
of "Porgy" in one sitting.

00:04:55.204 --> 00:04:56.870
Wrote George Gershwin
a letter and said,

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.660
I want to turn
this into an opera.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.324
At the time, George Gershwin
said, oh, it's a play.

00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:02.740
It's having a
success on Broadway.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.640
So George patiently waited.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.330
And eventually, he
wrote it in 1935.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.690
He brought in his
brother, Ira Gershwin,

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.930
who worked on the libretto and
the lyrics with DuBose Heyward.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.860
It premiered in Boston,
1935, then went to Broadway.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.995
So this piece actually
began on Broadway

00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:21.230
in the musical theater stage.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.040
There's an incredible piece of
history that I want to mention.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.140
In 1936, the original cast
goes on a very short tour.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.370
They go to Washington, DC.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.060
And they play at the
National Theatre.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.100
And of course, when they arrive,
the theater is segregated.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.740
So the original Porgy,
named Todd Duncan,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.580
said, well, this is a problem.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.382
We're not going to perform this
if this theater is segregated.

00:05:42.382 --> 00:05:44.090
And the producers at
the National Theatre

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.887
said, well, that's
the way it is.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:46.720
He said, no, no, no.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.650
You don't understand.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.840
We're not going to perform.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.180
So the producers said, we
have a solution-- Wednesdays

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.770
and Saturday matinees
for black people.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.630
And Todd Duncan said,
not good enough.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.750
And Anne Brown, who was the
original Bess, 19-year-old out

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.959
of the Juilliard School,
had never acted in her life.

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:05.458
George plucked her
out of Juilliard,

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:06.870
took her into the show.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.304
She stood by Todd Duncan's side.

00:06:09.304 --> 00:06:10.720
Then the producers
at the National

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.630
said, all right, we've
got another solution--

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.180
the second half of the upper
balcony, for every performance,

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.440
for black people.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.610
And Todd Duncan and Anne
Brown, and at this point,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.910
the whole cast said,
still not good enough.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.170
They got a little nervous.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.022
The producers, the cast
was being threatened

00:06:24.022 --> 00:06:25.730
to be fined for
breaching their contract.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.010
They wouldn't relent.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.660
And in March of 1936,
the National Theatre

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.570
is desegregated for the
first time in its history,

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.220
thanks to this production.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.528
So yes--

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:40.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.630
To me, that is why
I do the theater.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.220
It's not just what's
happening now.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.640
It's the history we come from,
and the fact that this work has

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.450
had this long history
through the 20th century,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.980
onwards into the '50s,
with a production that

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.270
tours Europe with
Leontyne Price,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.910
William Warfield, Cab Calloway.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.180
The young Maya Angelou was
a dancer in the chorus.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.130
Becomes a movie in 1959
with Sidney Poitier,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.060
Sammy Davis, Jr., eventually
touring opera houses

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.360
all over the world.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.390
And then the great gift
of this production,

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.340
to have incredible, contemporary
artists like Suzan-Lori

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.430
Parks, Diedre Murray, our
choreographer, Ron Brown,

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.650
and this phenomenal cast
that you'll meet today,

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.530
who are bringing their
own humanity, their story,

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.010
their integrity to
add another chapter

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.720
to this incredible history.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.717
And Michael, as the
nephew of Ira Gershwin,

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:32.550
I'm sure you've seen
hundreds of productions

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.150
of "Porgy and Bess."

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.400
So tell us, what's different
about this Broadway production?

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.150
MICHAEL STRUNSKY: Well,
Diane has told you

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.170
all about the opera, the
development of the opera,

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.440
starting in 1935.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.960
Well, the family
has come to realize

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.320
that opera is a kind
of specialized taste.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.410
And "Porgy and Bess" has
such a wonderful universality

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.500
that we wanted to find
a team and put together

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.270
a team that could bring "Porgy
and Bess" back as a Broadway

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.230
musical.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:13.210
And we picked this
lady here on my left.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.960
And what you're going to see and
what you're going to hear today

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.900
is much more of the
Broadway musical version

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.440
than the opera version.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.510
The Broadway musical
version is accessible.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:34.740
It has a tighter dramatic
structure than the opera.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:40.470
Yes, it doesn't have the highs
and lows of opera performance.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.970
But at the same
time, we have come

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.990
to feel that this
is a gift that we

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.090
hope the country and the
world will appreciate,

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.490
that they can come
and see it in a more

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.227
understandable and viable way.

00:08:56.227 --> 00:08:57.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.970
And Diane, so this was
a musical on Broadway

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.660
with a lot of incredible
dancing and choreography.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.270
Could you tell us about how
that works into the show?

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.020
DIANE PAULUS: Yes.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.990
We have a great choreographer
named Ron Brown.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.330
And I think another
difference, often

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.680
when this is done in
a big opera house,

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.750
you have a separate
group of dancers

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.360
who are doing the dancing.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.700
But in this production,
we have a tight ensemble.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.362
Everybody is doing everything.

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:24.070
They are singing.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.736
They are acting.

00:09:24.736 --> 00:09:26.540
And they are dancing.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.030
And Ron's approach was, I think,
similar to all of our work

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:34.240
on the show, was to really
build authentic expression.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.570
That it's not a
Broadway musical,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.640
here we go, five, six,
seven, eight, jazz hands.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:45.560
This is about character and
history and people's soul

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.160
searching existence.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.980
And that was my quest
in the production.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.250
And it went everything,
for how we cast the show,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.950
how we did the costumes,
and how they move on stage.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.709
Every movement has meaning.

00:09:58.709 --> 00:09:59.500
And it's connected.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.875
SUZAN-LORI PARKS:
Can I just say,

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:03.890
we won't see the dances
today, but the dancing

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.135
is absolutely amazing.

00:10:05.135 --> 00:10:07.730
And I've seen the
show many, many times.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.677
I still cannot believe you
guys are dancing like you do

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:12.885
on stage at the Golden Gate,
and singing brilliantly,

00:10:12.885 --> 00:10:15.050
and acting at the same time.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.809
I'm amazed.

00:10:17.809 --> 00:10:23.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.844
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
finally, this version

00:10:25.844 --> 00:10:27.260
of "The Gershwins'
Porgy and Bess"

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.490
has had an exciting
journey-- the world premiere

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.540
at the American Repertory
Theater at Harvard University,

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.280
followed by the Broadway
revival that won the 2012 Tony

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.810
Award for Best Musical
Revival, pretty awesome.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.610
And so it won the Tony.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.530
So what is most exciting
out of all this?

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.810
What is most exciting about
taking this production

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.060
across the country?

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:54.170
DIANE PAULUS: Well, first of
all, making theater is hard,

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.550
like everything.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.800
And it takes time.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.897
And we have been on a journey
for years, building this show.

00:11:00.897 --> 00:11:02.230
And it's like making a painting.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.580
You just get to go in there
and deepen it and detail it

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.200
and rediscover it.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.612
And here we are in 2013.

00:11:09.612 --> 00:11:10.445
The world's changed.

00:11:10.445 --> 00:11:14.680
We can kind of feel the show in
a new way with new performers.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.600
I think this tour, taking
the show out across America,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.890
is, to me, sort of the
pinnacle of this journey.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.170
Because this is an
American masterwork

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.230
that belongs to
American audiences

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.245
all across the country.

00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:29.120
I mean, it was great.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.120
We did it up at Harvard.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.680
Great we did it on Broadway.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.600
But every single person in every
little hometown across America

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.430
should be able to see
this show and say, yes, I

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.020
understand the story.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:46.472
I relate to this struggle,
to this love, and to know it.

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:47.930
Not just people
who know the opera,

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.510
but for young people,
that's what's touched me,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.570
is that a young generation can
now say, George Gershwin, wow.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:55.860
He's good.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.640
And those lyrics, Ira and
DuBose, those are pretty good.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.390
And you know what?

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.490
That's our American
cultural history

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.760
that we need to educate
and give to people so they

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.334
can own it and be proud of it.

00:12:07.334 --> 00:12:08.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:08.750
Thank you.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.170
Thank you guys.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.940
So I'd now like to welcome
Nathaniel Stampley and Alicia

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.000
Hall Moran, who play Porgy and
Bess, to perform "Bess, You

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.714
Is My Woman Now."

00:12:18.714 --> 00:12:22.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.961
[MUSIC - "BESS, YOU
IS MY WOMAN NOW"]

00:17:20.862 --> 00:17:34.806
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:34.806 --> 00:17:35.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.340
That was so beautiful.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.030
That was so great.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.000
Thank you.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.620
So you guys play Porgy and Bess.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.110
Can you tell us, who are the
characters of Porgy and Bess?

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.790
NATHANIEL STAMPLEY:
Well, Porgy and Bess

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.250
are two people that probably
wouldn't normally be together.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.840
And through the course of
the show and this story,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.100
some extraordinary events
happen that bring them together.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.940
And they truly are each
other's true loves.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.290
And so once they're together,
their lives completely change.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.310
They become really
different people.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.740
And so it's wonderful to take
this journey every single night

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.922
with Alicia.

00:18:15.922 --> 00:18:18.200
ALICIA HALL MORAN:
And Suzan-Lori Parks

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.490
helped encourage us to
understand these characters as

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:27.840
essential as Romeo and
Juliet, Tristan and Isolde.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:34.689
These are two Americans
in love, in English.

00:18:34.689 --> 00:18:37.527
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:37.527 --> 00:18:38.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.540
And how did you
guys work to develop

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.805
both your individual characters
and their relationship?

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.230
ALICIA HALL MORAN:
Bess is a fiery woman

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.990
who often finds herself
on the outside of things.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.990
And I don't have any
difficulty understanding

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.598
that point of view.

00:18:59.598 --> 00:19:00.098
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:02.870
I had a really
lovely upbringing.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.020
So I think that for
me, all of the work

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.540
has been in understanding
kind of that emotional

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.360
disenfranchisement,
and really trying

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.640
to be more honest to
the humanity of it,

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:23.740
to resist mean mugging, to
resist feeling that there's

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:30.140
something dirty about being
unqualified for a moment.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.280
Because it could just
be the next moment where

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.020
you get that qualification.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.480
So it's been a real
journey for me.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.420
But Porgy's has
been also physical.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.710
And I think it would be amazing
if he talked about that role.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.780
It's really difficult.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.540
NATHANIEL STAMPLEY: I
think at the core of Porgy,

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.680
in playing this
role, I mean, it's

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.230
one of the greatest
roles ever written.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.820
And so it's just humbling,
and honored to be on the stage

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.250
and play this role that William
Warfield and Todd Duncan, Simon

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.120
Estes, I mean, these
are incredible artists

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.140
that have played this
role, Norm Lewis.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.610
And so it's exciting
to be in this role,

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.660
and to present it
in a way that is

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.040
very accessible to
American audiences.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.405
And it's an honor.

00:20:14.405 --> 00:20:15.780
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Great, thank you.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.050
And what has it
been like to be part

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.000
of the ART production at
Harvard and the Broadway

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.721
production, and now the tour?

00:20:24.721 --> 00:20:26.220
NATHANIEL STAMPLEY:
It's incredible.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.240
I mean, we've been,
both Alicia and I,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.650
we've been there since Day
One at the workshop, and then

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.980
the production at the ART,
which was truly amazing.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.350
Those first audiences, they
taught us a lot about the show.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:42.090
And I think we learned a lot.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.440
And then we came to New
York, had an incredible run.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.410
And we've got a
Tony to prove it.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.560
And now, we get a chance
to travel the country,

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.890
just sharing this
incredible masterpiece

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.490
that Diane was talking about.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.220
I think the most exciting
part about this production

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.270
is that we're going to
bring younger audiences.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.930
And we're going to introduce
this piece to them.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.420
Whereas people that are a
little bit older than us,

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.470
"Porgy and Bess"
means a lot to them.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.100
But for a lot of
younger audiences,

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.220
they don't understand
what "Porgy and Bess" is.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.080
Is it Por-gee?

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.370
Is it this, that?

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.760
And so we're here to sort of
spread the gospel of Gershwin.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.459
So it's wonderful.

00:21:23.459 --> 00:21:25.000
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you, thank you.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.234
And now, I'd like to invite a
few more people up on stage.

00:21:28.234 --> 00:21:29.900
We want to welcome
back Sumayya Ali, who

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.350
plays Clara, David
Hughey, who plays Jake.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.270
I'd also like to
introduce Kingsley Leggs.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.870
He plays Sporting Life,
and Alvin Crawford,

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.852
who plays Crown, up to
join Alicia and Nathaniel.

00:21:42.852 --> 00:21:47.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.660
So Sumayya and David, what
is it like starting off

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.329
the show with such an iconic
number as "Summertime"?

00:21:54.329 --> 00:21:55.620
SUMAYYA ALI: Well, no pressure.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.460
It's only been recorded
over 30,000 times,

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:03.710
more than any other
Broadway song ever.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:08.030
But at the root, it's
a beautiful lullaby

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.570
that parents are
singing to their child.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.850
And I think it represents
all the promise

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.070
and hope to come
for Catfish Row.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.360
So it's mostly my
taking myself out of it

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.370
and being true to the
story, and just using myself

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:24.967
as an instrument
to give a message.

00:22:24.967 --> 00:22:26.550
DAVID HUGHEY: I would
agree with that.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.330
And also, what's
really interesting

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.070
about this version is that in
the reworking of the piece,

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.070
they really wanted
to establish the love

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.180
that Jake and Clara have for
each other and for their child

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.660
right at the
beginning of the show.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.340
And so in this
version, Jake gets

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.460
to sing along for that reason.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.660
Traditionally in the opera, it's
only Clara who gets to sing it.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.727
And so it's a really
wonderful moment

00:22:48.727 --> 00:22:50.810
that we get to share, and
establish that, and sort

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.586
of speak that sort of blessing
over our child, if you will.

00:22:55.586 --> 00:22:56.960
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Great, thank you.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.390
And what does it
mean in the context

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.796
of the whole story
of "Porgy and Bess"?

00:23:02.796 --> 00:23:03.670
SUMAYYA ALI: Oh, wow.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.106
It means a couple of things.

00:23:05.106 --> 00:23:06.730
First of all, I think
it's establishing

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.529
the setting of Catfish Row.

00:23:10.529 --> 00:23:12.570
I'm talking about, everyone
knows it's summertime

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.457
automatically.

00:23:13.457 --> 00:23:14.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.820
They know the cotton's
high, living's easy.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.880
So I think it's a great
way to not only show

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.030
the love and magic
of this community,

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.440
but also just set everything
up, to just reel them

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.750
in for the adventure
to come, I think.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.970
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you, thank you.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.480
Alvin, hello.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.810
In "Porgy and Bess,"
Crown is the antagonist.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.900
But his relationship with Bess
isn't fully straightforward.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.360
What do you think
draws Bess to Crown?

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.535
And does Crown have any
redeeming qualities?

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:52.860
ALVIN CRAWFORD: Yes, Crown
does have redeeming qualities.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:59.610
But I think Crown is
misunderstood, I think.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.960
He loves Bess in his own way.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.890
But one thing I
would love to say

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:07.760
is that we all know that
person in the community who

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.580
is that guy.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.180
And we also know that couple
that shouldn't be together.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.470
And that is Crown and Bess.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:17.710
Because they have that
toxic relationship,

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.480
that they don't feed
each other well.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.440
As Nate was saying earlier,
they are good together.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.320
But Crown and Bess are not.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.690
But for whatever reason,
that toxic, drug induced haze

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.040
and love is why
they're together.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.120
But I would also say one of the
redeeming qualities about Crown

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.690
is that he's the guy that goes
to rescue Clara in the storm.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:44.080
So he also has a
place in Catfish Row.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.900
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.220
Kingsley, hi.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.610
Tell us, who is Sporting Life?

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:59.000
KINGLSEY LEGGS: Sporting Life
is a snake and a scoundrel.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.530
I always joke backstage,
because I have so many props,

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:05.280
that I have like pockets
full of good times.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.040
I've got playing cards
and money and dice

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.294
and hooch and happy dust.

00:25:10.294 --> 00:25:14.470
So he brings the
party to Catfish Row.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:18.580
But he's also directly
responsible for Bess's

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.137
downfall.

00:25:19.137 --> 00:25:21.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, and can
you tell a little bit more

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.592
about how he influences
that narrative?

00:25:23.592 --> 00:25:25.050
KINGLSEY LEGGS:
Well, he instigates

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.470
a lot of the tragedy
that happens.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:32.540
He's right at the centerpiece
of it, making it happen.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.220
Because he has his own
goal and his own objective.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.360
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.540
OK, and now we're going
to have another big hit

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.110
from the incredible score.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.160
Kingsley Leggs and
cast will perform

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.921
"It Ain't Necessarily So."

00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:58.192
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:58.192 --> 00:25:59.650
[MUSIC - "IT AIN'T
NECESSARILY SO"]

00:29:00.168 --> 00:29:14.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.410
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you guys.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.875
That song is so much fun.

00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:20.000
And the way you guys perform
it, it's just amazing.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.100
Thank you.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.412
And now, we'd like to take a
few questions from the audience.

00:29:24.412 --> 00:29:25.870
AUDIENCE: Just
wondering how you go

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.630
through the cycle of emotion.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:31.040
I imagine it's got to
be really draining.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.460
The story is so
deep and powerful,

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.610
how that cycle plays out
on a night to night basis,

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.550
how those emotions get
renewed, and how you really

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:45.570
deliver the message with
such heart every time.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:48.210
KINGLSEY LEGGS: I love being in
shows that are really dramatic

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.320
and have this kind of content.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.400
But I was just talking
with Suzan-Lori earlier,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.750
before we started this,
that this, I don't know.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.040
There's just something very
special about this show.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.370
Even watching them
sing that number today,

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.000
waiting over there,
I started crying.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
I was like, you've got
to get yourself together.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.340
There's such humanity
in this piece

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:15.560
that it's just such a joy to
tell this story every night.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.580
I have to remove
myself sometimes

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.690
from the rest of the
piece because of what

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.590
I have to do in the
piece, to keep it

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.310
all in perspective
and compartmentalized.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:31.820
But I think part of it is just
the joy of telling the story,

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:37.310
and because these people have
been such incredible stewards

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:41.420
of this piece and the
story and what we're doing.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.880
You just want to give it truth.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.920
You want to give it
all that you have.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.860
And you want it to reach the
person in the top, in the back.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.460
So it's just wonderful
to play every night.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.040
NATHANIEL STAMPLEY:
I'll chime in, also.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.610
With this particular
production, we

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:05.430
don't have the trappings of
really huge sets and a really

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.710
large cast.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.990
So the story is
in the forefront.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.050
And so that demands a
certain level of commitment

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.630
every single second
you're on the stage.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.770
So there's nowhere to
hide, first of all.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:23.030
And secondly, as you
can sort of sense today,

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.940
we are truly a community
on and off stage.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.310
And so that helps.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:32.870
And also, for me personally
in this role as Porgy,

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:38.020
I try to keep it as
light as I can offstage.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:44.350
I like to laugh and smile
and save my voice, as well.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.960
So that you're not living in
those really dark and heavy

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.910
moments 24/7.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:54.404
Because that's tough to carry
around with you all the time.

00:31:54.404 --> 00:31:56.529
SUMAYYA ALI: I totally have
to decompress and watch

00:31:56.529 --> 00:31:58.778
"Everybody Loves Raymond"
or something when I go home.

00:31:58.778 --> 00:31:59.565
I do.

00:31:59.565 --> 00:32:00.070
You do.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.640
You have to shake it off.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.740
ALICIA HALL MORAN: And also,
I have to say, those of us

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.650
coming from the
previous productions,

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.360
and also, now this
cast are veterans,

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.700
because they had a rehearsal
process in New York

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.140
together, shared.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.920
Really knowing the inner tracks
of the ensemble as well as we

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.340
do, we understand
the real strength

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.690
that Porgy gains is
from the community.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:28.950
The real strength
that Bess will find

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:33.380
when she's redeemed-- oh,
she messes it up by the end.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.680
But they come for
her, to heal her,

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.750
and to give your body weight
to the women in the cast.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.740
Or Sporting Life slithering
all over you, only Mariah

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.270
could prevent that.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:46.750
And he gets rid of her.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:49.880
So we really
understand that you're

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.880
going to get through the
day with the actual actors.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.510
But the characters
are going to make it

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.300
through because of
the actual community.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.400
And we represent
a new era of that.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.700
Because we know what
they're pulling.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.680
And it's crazy good.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.750
I love your question.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.024
Thank you so much.

00:33:06.024 --> 00:33:08.440
AUDIENCE: I'd like to hear a
little more about the process

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:12.680
of adapting the production
to what you call a Broadway

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.410
musical version as opposed
to the opera version?

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.165
There's the staging, there's
the music, there's the story.

00:33:19.165 --> 00:33:20.650
I'd like to hear
more about that.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:25.120
DIANE PAULUS: I think if the
opera is done uncut, which

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:29.570
sometimes it's done, it clocks
in at well over four hours.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:33.330
So I think we knew we wanted
to make a version that really

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:39.060
retained the incredible
score, that told the story as

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.530
specifically and as
truthfully as we could.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:45.770
But we wanted to just
like close up on it.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:53.800
We wanted to make it intimate
and focused and theatrical.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.740
So of course, our production
is like 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.200
So you're looking at cuts.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.906
And George and Ira made cuts.

00:34:00.906 --> 00:34:02.780
The first night after
it premiered in Boston,

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.840
they cut out 45 minutes.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.929
So you're going from guides from
the original authors of options

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:10.190
of things to cut.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:14.389
And Suzan-Lori and Diedre Murray
and myself and our music team,

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.870
our conductor and our
associate, we spent,

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:19.770
I'd say, at least
one year going bar

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:22.510
by bar through
that entire score,

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:25.570
laboriously figuring
out how to make the cut,

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.000
how to continue
the musical line.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.110
What is necessary?

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:33.360
What maybe could we take
out to strengthen something,

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.550
to make it even more
kind of immediate?

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:41.068
So it was an incredible process,
a careful, careful process.

00:34:41.068 --> 00:34:43.960
SUZAN-LORI PARKS: Yeah, maybe
a chunk might have been cut.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:48.960
And then add a few words here
to make the character arc

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.170
stronger, a lot of
basic dramaturgical,

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.909
architectural work to track
each of these characters.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:59.290
Each and every one of
these main characters

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.460
has a very, very strong
and definite character arc.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:07.270
And sometimes, we might
cut a character out,

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.400
a minor character, and
replaced him or her

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.690
with one of the main
characters to carry that story

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.546
line through.

00:35:13.546 --> 00:35:15.670
AUDIENCE: "Summertime" got
rearranged a little bit,

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.020
to have an extra singer in it.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.074
So was there much of that
kind of change, as well?

00:35:20.074 --> 00:35:21.490
DIANE PAULUS:
Definitely, thinking

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:24.520
about how to tell the story.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.380
And I think the point that
Sumayya and David were making,

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:31.040
that this idea-- you know,
people hear "Summertime."

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.160
And you kind of
go, oh, that hit.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.640
Or, oh, Fantasia sang that.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.710
So our production's like,
no, no, look at the story.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:43.580
Look at what the song
means, with Daddy and Mama

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.320
standing by.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.470
And there you can see
that daddy and mama

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.150
looking over their baby.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:52.230
So every choice was
driven by the story,

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.059
to really intensify the story.

00:35:54.059 --> 00:35:56.350
SUZAN-LORI PARKS: I just want
to say an exciting thing.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.710
You see Jake and Clara
singing this wonderful song

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.290
to their child at the top.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.610
And then if you know the show
already, or if you've seen it,

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:07.626
or if you might see it, watch
for when it gets reprised.

00:36:07.626 --> 00:36:08.750
And that's in the original.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.552
But watch how that
songs gets reprised.

00:36:10.552 --> 00:36:12.760
And remember the first time
you heard it in the show,

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.540
and the meaning that it takes on
as we travel through the show,

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.956
and the other things going on
on stage, especially when we

00:36:17.956 --> 00:36:19.230
hear it the last time.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.000
What is going on?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.500
DIANE PAULUS: It's
sung three times.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.680
And the tragic thing is,
those two characters die.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.690
So you start the show.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:27.509
And if you know the
story, it's almost

00:36:27.509 --> 00:36:28.800
like you almost can't watch it.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.310
It's just like, all the
hope in that moment.

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:33.410
But again, as Alicia
was saying, you

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:36.450
see how the community
rises up through it.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:44.380
It's that uplifting growth
admits terrible adversity

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.844
and tragedy.

00:36:45.844 --> 00:36:47.260
MICHAEL STRUNSKY:
One thing that's

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.510
true about this is
that the emphasis here

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:55.310
has been on story, just as
any good theatrical piece has

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:57.210
to respect story.

00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:01.860
And we've taken,
Diane and Suzan-Lori

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:05.960
have taken that as a charge.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.670
And I believe they've solved it
really, really magnificently.

00:37:11.932 --> 00:37:14.570
SUZAN-LORI PARKS: I always
like hearing you say that.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.410
I never get tired of that.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:19.250
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.250
I am completely in awe that I'm
in the same room as Suzan-Lori

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:23.390
Parks and Diane Paulus.

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:26.749
Actually, I'm a graduate
of the ART in 2006.

00:37:26.749 --> 00:37:28.290
Sadly, I missed you,
because you have

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.520
been doing amazing
work there, amazing.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.580
It's so impressive.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:36.050
And my question is
actually two things.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:41.210
How is it that you, A, came
upon this play or musical,

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:42.630
that you wanted to revive it.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:47.190
And two, how is it that you have
created, in many of your works,

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:52.949
somehow found the balance of
artistry and audience appeal

00:37:52.949 --> 00:37:54.990
in such a way that you
make-- obviously, audience

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:57.992
keep coming back and loving
everything that you've done.

00:37:57.992 --> 00:37:58.950
Where do you find that?

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:00.629
Because it doesn't
seem to me like

00:38:00.629 --> 00:38:02.670
you've sacrificed any
artistry in any of the work

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.302
that you've done.

00:38:04.302 --> 00:38:06.760
DIANE PAULUS: Well, I'll answer
your second question first.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.760
I believe in the audience.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.400
I believe audiences are smart.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.020
They want to be challenged.

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.090
They want to feel.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:18.900
I think it's a very generous
act, an audience, in this day

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.030
and age, when we're all so
busy, to come out of our lives

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:25.410
and be live in a room together.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.830
So we have an obligation
to meet that audience.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.800
And that's where I
start as a director.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.590
It's really not about like,
my art, what I want to do.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.330
No, I think, why
tell the story now?

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.390
What's the event?

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:39.400
What can we communicate?

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.400
Why should an audience bother
to come see "Porgy and Bess"?

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.920
That's where I start.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.280
And rather that being
distracting or pandering,

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.350
it's actually the catalyst
for me as a director.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:52.442
And that's the theater.

00:38:52.442 --> 00:38:54.150
I mean, when you work
in the theater now,

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:57.190
you really have to think, what
is the theater as a medium?

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.700
It is about live transmission.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.720
It can only happen in the
presence of an audience.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.350
Not a lot of other
artistic mediums

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:10.380
are that dependent on the
living, breathing moment.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.936
And I think in our day and age,
to feel present and alive--

00:39:12.936 --> 00:39:14.310
I mean, it was a
question of you,

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:18.037
all saying about being in
the moment, that's a gift.

00:39:18.037 --> 00:39:19.870
I mean, that's why I
love doing the theater.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.950
It's like, rehearsal,
you're in the moment,

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:23.320
to come into a room.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.640
And that's, I think,
what an audience craves.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.902
You forget the past.

00:39:26.902 --> 00:39:28.360
You stop thinking
about the future.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.900
And you are in the
present, emotionally,

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.860
psychically with
these characters.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.400
And this is a piece
that allows you

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.520
to go deep, as Kingsley said.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.940
So when I was approached by the
Gershwin estates and the DuBose

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.590
Heyward estates, would you
be interested in this charge

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:48.880
that Mike said?

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.300
We know it exists as an opera.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.841
And it will always
exist as an opera.

00:39:51.841 --> 00:39:54.230
But what about
creating a version that

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:56.360
really celebrates
it as a musical?

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.170
Would you want to do that?

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.910
And what writer would
you like to work with?

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.360
That really came
from the estates.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.410
That was a huge sign to
me of the willingness

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:12.630
to really make this feel
relevant to our lives today.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.380
And working with
Suzan-Lori, I was

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.630
dying to work with this lady.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:16.296
Are you kidding?

00:40:16.296 --> 00:40:17.360
She's a genius.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.970
And her dramaturgical
mind is so strong.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:20.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:24.800
This experience
of creating this,

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.250
and then, it's about them.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.865
The art of a director is,
I know something about it.

00:40:30.865 --> 00:40:32.490
Suzan-Lori, we know
something about it.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.022
But then it transfers
to the cast.

00:40:35.022 --> 00:40:37.230
And that's how they get
through every night, I think.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.510
Because they are
telling the story.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.510
They are the keepers of
the torch and the flame.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:44.670
And they are holding that
much more than us now.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.820
We've given it.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.012
We've raised the baby.

00:40:47.012 --> 00:40:49.470
And then the baby has to go
out in the world, in this case,

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:50.095
across America.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:55.400
AUDIENCE: I know you
mentioned briefly

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.680
Leontyne Price and that tour.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.380
And I think you were
referring to the 1955 tour

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.550
to the Eastern Bloc.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.870
So I know that was a huge deal.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:04.580
Because that was the
first American musical

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:08.401
or American opera that came to
USSR and all those countries.

00:41:08.401 --> 00:41:10.900
And I know they had a different
message to spread back then.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.250
But I'm wondering, if you
had the opportunity now,

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.620
maybe you will,
where would you take

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.050
this production in the world?

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.610
And what kind of
message would you

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:22.530
want to say now, as
opposed to back then?

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.120
MICHAEL STRUNSKY:
Well, I'm not sure

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.890
that the message is anything
more than what you see.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:29.070
The message is there.

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:34.290
It's truth, and what
Suzan-Lori and the rest

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:39.030
of the creative cast believe
that community was like.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:43.110
And yes, we're open to
taking-- a matter of fact,

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:45.400
we are doing a
production in London

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.790
at the outdoor theater
there this coming summer.

00:41:52.094 --> 00:41:54.230
SUZAN-LORI PARKS: I
think what's wonderful

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:58.230
about this production is
that while our work on it

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.440
was, or my work on
it was dramaturgical

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.450
and architectural,
I think what happens

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:05.740
is, in this day
and age, there is

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.620
a political component
that we can't escape.

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:14.730
And that is as simple as people
of African descent are people.

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:15.950
We are people.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.720
And I think that is
dovetailed exactly

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.449
hand in glove with the
message, if you will,

00:42:21.449 --> 00:42:23.490
of the very first production
of "Porgy and Bess."

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:26.760
I think that's what Mr.
Gershwin's and the Heywards

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.719
were saying.

00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:30.260
I think that's what it said when
we went to the Eastern Bloc.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.390
And that's the beauty
of this country,

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:35.610
that we can say that
about all of us.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:38.080
We are all in it together.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:40.200
And when we take that
and we go abroad,

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.140
or we go just to various cities
around the United States,

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.150
we are all in it together.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:46.060
Hello.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.180
And when we go abroad
and take that message,

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.940
we are all in this together,
that is a very powerful message

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:54.200
for the world, to remember
that it's all of us

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.610
together in here.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:58.341
So it's good stuff.

00:42:58.341 --> 00:43:00.209
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:00.209 --> 00:43:03.011
FEMALE SPEAKER: One more
question, one last question.

00:43:03.011 --> 00:43:07.300
AUDIENCE: I have a question for
Sporting Life, Porgy, and Bess.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:11.750
Individually, do you think your
characters would have liked

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:15.050
to have seen a sequel
to Porgy and Bess?

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:21.900
And to Michael, do you know if
your Uncle Ira and George, had

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.130
he lived, had planned a sequel?

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.670
MICHAEL STRUNSKY:
Not that I know of.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:32.430
And I guess emotionally, I
would very much doubt it.

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:35.950
They had plenty of
other things to do.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:40.994
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:40.994 --> 00:43:43.410
NATHANIEL STAMPLEY: I'll just
say, in this day and age now

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:49.200
of prequels, I'm actually
more interested in that, this

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.550
before story.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:57.780
And the way that this
production is put together,

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:02.130
it really is up to the audience
to decide what happens.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:06.120
And I think that's where,
as actors and audience,

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.870
we're all in the
same room, that's

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:10.400
one point where we
all get together.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.066
You decide.

00:44:11.066 --> 00:44:13.440
Everyone walks out of the
theater with different answers.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.850
So at the stage
door, I enjoy to hear

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:19.464
what happens with
Porgy and Bess.

00:44:19.464 --> 00:44:21.130
ALICIA HALL MORAN: I
love this question.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:23.550
Because you're going to hear
our personalities in how

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:25.820
we answer it.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.530
So his idea would
make money with before

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:31.350
and a blockbuster after.

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:36.540
And my idea is kind of that
it's being presented as a fable,

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.350
in a sense, in the original,
and in the way it's

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:41.080
been recreated here.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.130
So that just like
Diane said, it's

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:46.830
heartbreaking when the young,
beautiful couple comes out

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.980
for "Summertime"
with their baby.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:58.130
Because you know by the end, and
the harlot is holding the baby.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:02.450
Man, oh, man, that's
the cycle-- the baby,

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.220
the birth, the birth
of something else.

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.810
It's going to go well for you,
or it's going to go badly.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:10.840
You kind of get another
shot at it the next day

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.860
in the next show.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.530
So I think we are, each
of us, are everyone.

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:19.620
Not an every man, so much,
specifically in the narrative

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:25.200
structure, but like Aesop's
Fables, there's no before.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.290
There's no after.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.540
It's its own universe.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.290
You're going to be the
dinosaur this time,

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.895
and the monkey next
time, that kind of idea.

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:34.400
And I know there's no
dinosaurs in Aesop's.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.415
Don't get all technical with me.

00:45:37.415 --> 00:45:43.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.730
KINGLSEY LEGGS:
That was awesome.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:47.680
I agree with Nate.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.310
I think what's extraordinary
about this piece is

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:54.360
that it's not wrapped
up in a bow at the end.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.770
And it allows everyone to have
their own interpretation of,

00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:59.800
how does the story end?

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.212
How do you think it ends?

00:46:02.212 --> 00:46:03.420
How would you like it to end?

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.220
And I think that's
wonderful for everyone.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:11.490
I think probably the dying
question for everyone is,

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:13.504
does he find her in New York?

00:46:13.504 --> 00:46:14.670
Does he make it to New York?

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:18.810
Does he find her in New York?

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:21.930
But I really feel that
it's best the way it is.

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.550
It's best that we don't know.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.800
I think that goes along with the
message and the spirit of what

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.530
the piece is.

And now, the last song
we're going to hear today

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.090
is Nathaniel and
the cast singing,

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.890

MICHAEL STRUNSKY: You should
know that the next scene is

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:54.380
shortly after Porgy and Bess
get together for the first time.

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.700
It's morning.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.530
And I'll let the cast
take it from there.

00:47:03.974 --> 00:47:05.432
