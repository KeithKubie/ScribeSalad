00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.730
According to the USPS, mail can be considered
“undeliverable” due to a number of factors

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.760
ranging from insufficient postage to the person
it’s addressed to refusing to accept it.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.230
Regardless of the reason the mail cannot be
delivered, the USPS states that: “All nonmailable

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.690
pieces are returned to the sender.”

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.449
This seems like a pretty cut and dry statement
that leaves very little room for interpretation.

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.920
However, there’s always an exception to
the rule and in the case of undeliverable

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.640
mail that exception is things like periodicals,
which are deemed to have little to no value

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.010
after a certain point due to their timely
nature and will be disposed of accordingly.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.330
That said, publishers can request to have
such items returned to them if they so wish.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.670
So what about the case of mail that is undeliverable
and happens to have no visible or legible

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.710
return address?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.820
The Postal Service has had measures in place
to deal with these so-called “dead letters”

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.850
almost since the service first began in earnest
in the 1700s with the awesomely named position

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.440
of Inspector of Dead Letters, being created
by an act of Congress way back in 1777.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.030
The first Dead Letter Office, on the other
hand, wouldn’t exist until 1825, when the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.710
sheer amount of dead mail necessitated the
creation of a dedicated service to deal with

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.710
it all.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.180
Today, undeliverable mail without a return
address will be pre-processed by postal workers

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.100
and, unless it doesn’t meet certain criteria
which we’ll discuss in a moment, will be

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.900
sent to the Mail Recovery Center in Atlanta.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.979
(Up until 1992, the Mail Recovery Center was
officially known as the Dead Letter Office,

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.100
but the USPS opted to change it to better
reflect the ultimate goal of returning mail.)

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.420
In any event, as noted on their website, the
Mail Recovery Center generally doesn’t accept

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.259
anything worth less than about $25 or something
that can’t reasonably be traced back to

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.780
someone like keys, cosmetics and food.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.480
In this case, the items will either be recycled,
disposed of or in some cases, donated to charity.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.780
Of course, exceptions can and will be made,
but this is handled on a case-by-case basis.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.450
For example, if an undeliverable letter or
package contains something that clearly has

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.650
sentimental value (such as photographs or,
in one case, postal worker Lori Ferguson-Costa

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.560
had the pleasure of processing a dead-package
containing a jar that in turn contained a

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.109
placenta) , it will be processed to try to
track down the original sender or intended

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.200
recipient, despite it having no real monetary
value.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.330
You might at this point be wondering what
about if they find money and despite their

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.730
best efforts they can’t track down who sent
the letter or where to send it to?

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.370
It will simply be tallied up and given to
the US treasury.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.389
So what goes into the “processing” step?

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.439
First, a Mail Recovery Clerk has to physically
open the letters and packages to discern exactly

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.060
what they contain, making people in this position
just about the only individuals in the US

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.739
legally allowed to open another person’s
mail without it being a federal crime.

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.540
As you can imagine, this means security is
tight and everything the clerks find has to

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.989
be meticulously recorded and noted down to
stop someone just walking out of the building

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.529
with a pocketful of other people’s stuff.

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:28.689
Beyond just opening the packages and letters,
the mail clerks in question will go to fairly

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.500
extensive lengths to try and return or deliver
dead mail.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.549
In one case noted in a Smithsonian piece on
the day in the life of one of these workers,

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.930
the worker at the center of the article, Vera,
opened a package with no identifying marks

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.780
whatsoever on the outside, but managed to
use a phone number contained inside to ultimately

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.180
track down the package’s original owner.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.089
In another case, the aforementioned postal
worker Lori Ferguson-Costa got a call from

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:54.139
a woman who’d recently had her baby die
of SIDS.

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.139
(If you’re curious, see: What Causes Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome.)

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.719
The woman, who was in tears at the time, explained
that she’d mailed a photograph of her baby

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:02.799
that she didn’t have any copies of, the
last one taken before the baby’s death,

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.199
but the recipient (the grandmother) never
got it.

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.540
Lori then got a detailed description of what
was in the photograph and after a pretty extensive

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.790
search around the Mail Recovery Office manged
to find it, despite going off of only the

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.580
woman’s description of the picture.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.229
Essentially, any clue whatsoever, even small
ones, in the package will be followed up on

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.830
until the clerk manages to find out where
the package was intended to go or who sent

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.830
it.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.710
As for how long this all takes, the usual
amount of time the Mail Recovery Office will

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.360
hold things varies and is handled on a case-by-case
basis depending on the item and the clerk’s

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360
preference.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.990
For example, if the item in question is clearly
worth a lot of money or seems like it probably

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.310
holds significant sentimental value like a
wedding dress or jewellery, the Mail Recovery

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.189
Office will hold onto it for upwards of a
year (and in some cases even longer, such

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.860
as a jar containing the cremated remains of
one W.C.G.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.631
McLeod who lived from 1891 to 1977, which
postal worker Vera stated was there when she

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:03.570
got the job and she intends to keep it around
until she retires, hoping someone will claim

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.570
it).

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.830
However, since it just isn’t feasible for
the Mail Recovery Office to hold onto something

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.280
indefinitely, in the vast majority of cases,
after every avenue to return something is

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.470
explored and they’ve held onto an item long
enough for someone to miss it and file a claim,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.349
they are left with no choice but to sell it
at in a bulk auction, the profits of which

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.580
are funneled back to the Postal Service.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.620
So with all their efforts, how successful
are they at bringing dead mail back to life?

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.370
According to official figures, they are able
to deliver or return 68% of the dead mail

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.390
“with obvious value“, a figure which drops
to a lower, but not insignificant 43% when

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.349
you factor in all dead mail.

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.560
When you consider that only about 0.05% of
mail is deemed “undeliverable” in the

00:05:44.560 --> 00:08:38.490
first place, that’s a pretty remarkable
overall delivery rate.
