00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.120
In this problem, we're asked
to figure out the length of BC.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.850
We have a bunch
of triangles here,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.030
and some lengths of sides,
and a couple of right angles.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.290
And so maybe we can
establish similarity

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.715
between some of the triangles.

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:16.340
There's actually three different
triangles that I can see here.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.372
This triangle, this triangle,
and this larger triangle.

00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:21.080
If we can establish
some similarity here,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.070
maybe we can use
ratios between sides

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.890
somehow to figure
out what BC is.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.050
So when you look at it, you have
a right angle right over here.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.150
So in triangle BDC, you
have one right angle.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.450
In triangle ABC, you
have another right angle.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.870
If we can show that they have
another corresponding set

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.890
of angles are congruent
to each other,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.550
then we can show
that they're similar.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.950
And actually, both of those
triangles, both BDC and ABC,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.879
both share this angle
right over here.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.920
So if they share that
angle, then they definitely

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.400
share two angles.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.550
So they both share that
angle right over there.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.100
Let me do that in
a different color

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.410
just to make it different
than those right angles.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.370
They both share
that angle there.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.680
And so we know that
two triangles that

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.710
have at least two
congruent angles,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.750
they're going to be
similar triangles.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.370
So we know that
triangle ABC-- We

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.760
went from the unlabeled angle,
to the yellow right angle,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.274
to the orange angle.

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:28.440
So let me write it this way.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.800
ABC.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.510
And we want to do
this very carefully

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.550
here because the same
points, or the same vertices,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.052
might not play the same
role in both triangles.

00:01:46.052 --> 00:01:48.510
So we want to make sure we're
getting the similarity right.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.080
White vertex to the
90 degree angle vertex

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.160
to the orange vertex.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.840
That is going to be similar
to triangle-- so which

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.480
is the one that is neither a
right angle-- so we're looking

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.674
at the smaller triangle
right over here.

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:06.590
Which is the one that
is neither a right angle

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.600
or the orange angle?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.785
Well it's going to be
vertex B. Vertex B had

00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:12.160
the right angle when you think
about the larger triangle.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.300
But we haven't thought
about just that little angle

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.500
right over there.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.460
So we start at
vertex B, then we're

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.140
going to go to the right angle.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.530
The right angle is
vertex D. And then

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.070
we go to vertex C,
which is in orange.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.170
So we have shown that
they are similar.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.820
And now that we know
that they are similar,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.594
we can attempt to take
ratios between the sides.

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:38.760
And so let's think about it.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.520
We know what the
length of AC is.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.320
AC is going to be equal to 8.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.740
6 plus 2.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.680
So we know that AC-- what's
the corresponding side

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.340
on this triangle
right over here?

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.131
So you could literally
look at the letters.

00:02:54.131 --> 00:02:57.800
A and C is going to
correspond to BC.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.310
The first and the third,
first and the third.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.180
AC is going to correspond to BC.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.180
And so this is interesting
because we're already

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.660
involving BC.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.490
And so what is it
going to correspond to?

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.180
And then if we look at BC
on the larger triangle,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.080
BC is going to correspond to
what on the smaller triangle?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.770
It's going to correspond to DC.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.850
And it's good because
we know what AC, is

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.220
and we know it DC is.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.860
And so we can solve for BC.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.410
So I want to take one more
step to show you what we just

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.950
did here, because BC is
playing two different roles.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.710
On this first statement
right over here,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.670
we're thinking of BC.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.240
BC on our smaller
triangle corresponds

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.790
to AC on our larger triangle.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.560
And then in the
second statement,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.860
BC on our larger
triangle corresponds

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.840
to DC on our smaller triangle.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.670
So in both of these cases.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.480
So these are larger
triangles and then

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.920
this is from the smaller
triangle right over here.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.640
Corresponding sides.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.510
And this is a cool
problem because BC

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.530
plays two different
roles in both triangles.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.690
But now we have enough
information to solve for BC.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:17.360
We know that AC is equal to 8.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.750
6 plus 2 is 8.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.610
And we know the
DC is equal to 2.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.660
That's given.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.390
And now we can cross multiply.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.360
8 times 2 is 16 is
equal to BC times BC--

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.370
is equal to BC squared.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.650
And so BC is going to be equal
to the principal root of 16,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.960
which is 4.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.930
BC is equal to 4.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.610
And we're done.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.340
And the hardest part
about this problem

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.200
is just realizing that BC
plays two different roles

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.214
and just keeping your
head straight on those two

00:04:49.214 --> 00:04:49.880
different roles.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.630
And just to make it
clear, let me actually

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.490
draw these two
triangles separately.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.935
So if I drew ABC separately,
it would look like this.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.090
So this is my triangle, ABC.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.680
And then this is a right angle.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.490
This is our orange angle.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.187
We know the length of this
side right over here is 8.

00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:15.770
And we know that the length of
this side, which we figured out

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.730
through this problem is 4.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.010
Then if we wanted to draw BDC,
we would draw it like this.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.780
So BDC looks like this.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.340
So this is BDC.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.080
That's a little bit
easier to visualize

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.660
because we've already--
This is our right angle.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.940
This is our orange angle.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.550
And this is 4, and this
right over here is 2.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.930
And I did it this
way to show you

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.660
that you have to flip this
triangle over and rotate it

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.294
just to have a
similar orientation.

00:05:50.294 --> 00:05:52.460
And then it might make it
look a little bit clearer.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.050
So if you found
this part confusing,

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.750
I encourage you to try to flip
and rotate BDC in such a way

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.620
that it seems to
look a lot like ABC.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.250
And then this ratio
should hopefully

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.620
make a lot more sense.
