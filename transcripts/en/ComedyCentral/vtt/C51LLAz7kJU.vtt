It's been a great show.

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.272
I had a playdate with my BFFs,

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:08.741
Mike got murky
with some ethicists

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:10.610
and I showed Ana Marie Cox

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:13.679
why she should never have me
on her podcast.

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:16.783
("Wah-wah" gibberish)

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.385
I know. I know, general.

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:21.954
I'm getting to it.

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:24.390
Mooch?

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:25.892
Do I really have to go?

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.227
(audience groaning)

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.930
Now that our love is so new?

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:34.200
I'm sorry,
but Kelly says you got to.

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:37.170
For real this time.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.907
At least now can I go see
my wife and newborn son.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.876
(laughter)

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:49.615
No, I'm not gonna to do that.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:52.752
But there is one more thing
before I go.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:56.122
There's an old
Italian expression.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:58.124
You know what it is.

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:00.626
I know, baby.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.295
(cheering and applause)

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:04.264
Oh, my God.

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:08.401
("Wah-wah" gibberish)

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.403
-Take him away, general.
-I love you.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.572
-I love you, Mr. President.
-Take him away.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.073
I love you. I love you.

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.174
-I love you.
-I freaking love you.

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:16.609
-I love you so much.
-(sobs)

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:17.810
I'll miss you, Mr. President.

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:19.512
I'll miss you, Christian man.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.814
I'll miss you most of all.

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:23.649
Look, he's trying to do it.

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:24.884
I told you.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:26.752
He's really trying to do it.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:28.621
He's trying
to suck his own (bleep).

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:32.091
You'll never make it,
you fat bastard.

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:33.860
(grunts)

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:35.628
There we go.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:37.897
-Back to complete chaos.
-Ah, ew.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.463
Just the way I like it.
