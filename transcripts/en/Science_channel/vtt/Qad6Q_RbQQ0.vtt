Narrator:
INSIDE THIS ICONIC CLOCK TOWER
HANGS BIG BEN ITSELF,

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:14.947
THE NEARLY 14-TON BELL THAT
GIVES THE TOWER ITS NICKNAME.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:18.684
THE BELLS THAT CHIME ON
THE QUARTER-HOUR SIT AROUND IT.

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:21.387
THEIR STRIKES ARE CONTROLLED
BY THE INTRICATE

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:24.123

AT THE HEART OF THE TOWER.

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:29.129
IT KEEPS THE CLOCK ACCURATE
TO WITHIN JUST 2 SECONDS A WEEK.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:34.901
ON EACH SIDE, 312 SHARDS OF OPAL
GLASS MAKE UP THE CLOCK FACE.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.371
THE COPPER MINUTE HANDS
ARE 14 FEET LONG --

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:42.141
AS TALL AS A DOUBLE-DECKER BUS.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.578
THESE FAMOUS DIALS HAVE KEPT
LONDON RUNNING ON TIME

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:48.114
FOR 160 YEARS.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:54.653
LIKE ANY ORDINARY WRISTWATCH,
THIS CLOCK NEEDS WINDING,

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:58.091
JUST AS IT DID
IN VICTORIAN TIMES.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.860
PUT THE WINDING HANDLE ON...

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.864
AND THEN WINDING FOR ABOUT
THE NEXT HOUR AND A HALF.

COMMISSIONED THIS CLOCK IN 1854,

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:10.937
THEY INSISTED BIG BEN
BE THE BIGGEST,

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:14.473

IN THE WORLD...

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.657
HE GETS AN ACCURATE READING
OF GREENWICH MEAN TIME

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.594
AND THEN HEADS TO THE BELFRY.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:37.197
IT'S CURRENTLY ALMOST 10:00 A.M.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:41.534

SO, WHAT YOU'LL SEE --

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.738
THIS IS THE FIRST HAMMER
THAT MOVES,

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.173
SO IT DOESN'T COME AS A SHOCK.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.041
IF YOU WATCH THAT ONE,
IT'LL LIFT UP

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.477
AND DROP AND PLAY THE 16 NOTES.

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:53.813
THEN THERE'S A PAUSE
OF ABOUT 10 SECONDS,

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.013
AND THEN THAT ONE WILL GO.

00:01:55.013 --> 00:01:57.149
IT'LL BE ANY MOMENT...

ROARS ACROSS THE CAPITAL

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.413
AT 118 DECIBELS,

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:30.883
ALMOST AS LOUD
AS A JET PLANE TAKING OFF.

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:34.453
SO, IS THE CLOCK ON TIME?

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:36.089
WE'RE ONE SECOND SLOW.

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.692
TRADITIONALLY,
WHAT WE DO, WE ADD A PENNY.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:42.228
ONE PENNY --
OLD PRE-DECIMAL COIN --

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:46.999
SPEEDS THE CLOCK UP JUST TO
BRING THE CLOCK BACK INTO TIME.

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.168
Narrator: LIKE THOSE
ORIGINAL CLOCK KEEPERS,

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:52.504
IAN KNOWS THIS TINY WEIGHT
RAISES THE PENDULUM'S

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:55.474

AND MAKES IT SWING FASTER.

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:58.577
WE'VE CORRECTED IT,
AND IT'S COME BACK UP TO TIME.

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:00.713
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
FOR A 160-YEAR-OLD CLOCK.
