00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.830
STEVE BAZYL: Hi everyone and
welcome to this week's Google

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.120
Developers Live for
Google Drive.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.300
Today we are joined by two
developers from Floreysoft.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.040
This is Daniel and Oliver.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.320
They make a bunch of
really cool web

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.879
apps for Google Drive--

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.270
including Ultradox, which we
reviewed here a few months

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.750
back, and some new apps that are
some really cool editors

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.310
for developers using Drive.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.960
I don't go into too much
detail since Daniel and

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.880
Oliver, you can tell us a little
bit more about what

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.590
you've been working on,
about Floreysoft.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.360
And give us a demo of some
of your new apps.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.170
DANIEL FLOREY: Thanks, Steve.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.220
Hi, everybody.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.460
OLIVER ZEIGERMANN: Hi.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.870
DANIEL FLOREY: So we are
building apps for the Google

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.450
platform since 2008.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.720
And so we started with a very
small application that allows

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.110
you to share contacts between
different accounts.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.440
We've been in the Enterprise
world for a

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.590
very long time now.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.887
And so Enterprise applications
used to be like, boring apps

00:01:54.887 --> 00:01:55.750
for boring people.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.820
But we thought that
on the Google

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.200
platform we could do better.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.380
And so, yes, I would like
to show you some of our

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.840
applications and of course
mainly the ones that are

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.400
integrated into Google Drive.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.430
So maybe I can just get started
by sharing my screen

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.860
and hopefully you will
be able to see it.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.960
So this is the application I've
been talking about, the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.560
Shared Groups application, where
you can share contacts

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.160
between different Google or
Google Apps accounts.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.890
So that was the one we've
been starting with.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.330
It sounds quite simple, because
you just keep contacts

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.370
in sync between different
accounts.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.700
But technically it's
quite challenging.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.290
It's based on the Google
App Engine.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.520
And once we did that, we thought
Enterprises also would

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.780
need real Enterprise contact
management application.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.470
So this was the second one that
we created, also based on

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.340
App Engine.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.930
And it's more or less comparable
with a Gmail

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.330
contact manager.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.820
But it also provides a bunch of
features targeted towards

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.090
the Enterprise.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.400
For example, you will find all
the fields in the contact

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.500
manager that are available in
the contact API but are not

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.300
available in the Google
Mail contact manager.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.510
So you will find all these
fields in here.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.910
And this was the first time
that we got in touch with

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.770
Google Drive.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.280
So we added the capability to
add documents and files from

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.650
Google Drive to contacts.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.940
So if you do that, this will
launch the [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.410
on Google file [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.580
And it will store the files
as URL in the contacts.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.640
So that you are able to open the
files also from your Gmail

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.800
contact manger, but it looks
a little bit nicer in here.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.170
And maybe another feature that
I would like to show is that

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.890
you can create organization
charts for your contacts.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.055
And this is built using the
Play end framework that is

00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:36.390
based on the Google
Web Toolkit.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.820
And we also have some
Google Maps

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.370
integration, stuff like that.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.110
So if you select multiple
contexts you will see them on

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.630
Google Maps.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.040
And all of this is
quite easy when

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.080
leveraging the cloud platform.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.290
So from a development
perspective, it never has been

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.600
easier to integrate nice
features without doing much

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.330
coding yourself.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.660
STEVE BAZYL: And the contact
manager, for those who are

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.450
interested in it, that's
available in the Google Apps

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.670
Marketplace, correct?

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.660
DANIEL FLOREY: Yes, right.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.760
So you can add it to your own
Google Apps domain and this

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.850
will be available domain-wide
for your Google Apps users.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.650
And if you're using Gmail, we
also have a nice integration

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.460
to your Google mail interface.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.800
So that you can open up this
contact manager in a gadgets

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.700
view right in your
Gmail interface.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.770
So that you can copy and paste
some information from your

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.500
mail right to the contacts.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.780
So you are able to edit
the contacts right

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.030
in the Gmail interface.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.990
OK, now to the applications
that we've created from

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.180
scratch for Google Drive.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.950
So the first one is our
Ultradox application.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.200
This one allows you to create
and print PDFs online right

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.650
from the cloud.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.450
And we are leveraging a lot
of Google stuff here.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.930
For example, we are using Google
Cloud Print to be able

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.060
to create and print documents
right from the

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.550
cloud on your printer.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.980
I'm not going to show that, but
you can check it out if

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.620
you are interested.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:33.590
And this application will more
or less assemble data from

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.490
different data sources and
generate a PDF from this data.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.150
So this example that I've just
opened, typical example where

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.310
you want to create
invoices based on

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.340
data from time sheets.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.080
So if you're working as a
freelancer, this makes sense.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.140
So you can track your times
in a Google spreadsheet.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.850
I've just switched into the
expert mode, where you can

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.650
customize this document.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.760
If you click on edit, it will
open the time sheet right from

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.240
Google drive, and you can make
changes and generate a new

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.020
invoice based on data
in your spreadsheet.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.510
And the template that
we are using to

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.680
generate the document--

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.820
it's also just good
old Google Docs.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.865
So you can just launch our
template editor and then you

00:07:33.865 --> 00:07:38.650
will find just a Google document
with some magic place

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.780
holders in it.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:46.030
And they will allow you to
generate nice-looking tables

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:51.670
or embed the pie chart from your
spreadsheet right into

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.210
the generated PDF document.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.080
STEVE BAZYL: I remember when you
launched this app, we did

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.370
a quick review of it a few
days after it launched.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.580
And it's a great app, and I know
you've done a lot of work

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.350
on it in the past few months to
add out some new features.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.390
But it definitely fills
a big gap for people

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.040
who use Google Docs--

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.230
adding those mail merge
capabilities, templating and

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.240
all sorts of dynamic
documents.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.280
It's an app I actually really
enjoy using and find valuable.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.670
DANIEL FLOREY: So it's quite
a complex beast.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.150
So it's not something that
the end user really

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.230
gets at first sight.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.930
But if you dive into the
functionality you can do a lot

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.030
of stuff with it.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:39.530
One feature that we were looking
to integrate was,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.039
sometimes people want to have
some more sophisticated logic

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.370
into their documents.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.250
For example, if they have a
Google Form where users submit

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.630
some data, then they want
to do some sophisticated

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.420
calculations and
then render the

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.290
output into their documents.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:02.070
And so we were looking for a
very simple JavaScript editor

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.030
that we could embedded into
this application so that

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:11.910
people would be able to just
select and create JavaScript

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.840
files in the same way that they
can do it right now with

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:22.100
the spreadsheets, other
contacts, other documents.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:28.330
And that was the reason that I
started to look at the Chrome

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.020
Web Store, if I could find a
very, very simple JavaScript

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.340
editor for Google Drive.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.790
And I found a lot
of great ideas.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.100
But they all looked too
complicated for our use case.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.420
So I decided to create
something

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.260
really simple from scratch.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.860
And so that's the latest
addition to our applications.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.230
It's called Editey, and it comes
with a bunch of very

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.230
simple editors.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.880
So for example, if you want to
create a JavaScript file, you

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.200
can simply create this
file from the Google

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.180
Drive Create menu.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:17.290
And then you can just write
JavaScript code in the same

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:22.080
way that you can work
on Google Documents.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:29.750
So for example if you rename
the file from here it will

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.820
update the file on Google
Drive instantly.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:39.120
And let me make this program
more sophisticated.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.320
So if you are working on these
files, you will find a lot of

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.480
menu items that may look
familiar to you, because we

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.040
tried to stay as close to
Google Docs as we could.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.580
So you can, for example, open
the revision history and see

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.020
all the changes that
have been saved.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.140
And you can restore the
revisions just in the same way

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.110
that you can do it
with Google Docs.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.770
So that was quite easy.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.440
So I thought, if that was easy
then I could also add some

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.150
HTML and CSS editors.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:23.550
And so I came up with--

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.640
let me just share this with--

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.630
the other editor types, so they
all have their own icon.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.990
So if you open or if you see
these files in a folder you

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:41.010
can just see at first sight if
that's an HTML file, CSS file

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.250
or a JavaScript file.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:52.330
And you can also open multiple
files at once by selecting

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.610
both of them and clicking
on Open With Editey.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:01.810
And this will give you
a simple view of both

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.290
files side by side.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.130
So this makes working on
these files quite easy.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.810
And of course all changes will
automatically be saved on

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.060
Google Drive.

00:12:15.685 --> 00:12:22.100
You can just resize the
different panels and you can

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.860
open as many files as you
like in this view.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.330
So if you have multiple files
of the same type they will

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.940
just be stacked in
the tap panel.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:37.180
And the nice thing is that on
Google Drive there's a secret

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.680
feature, I would call it, that
allows you to publish files on

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.700
the web as a website.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.560
So if you click on the folder
and select share public on the

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:52.300
web, then you can really
launch these files as a

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.460
website on the web.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:59.560
And let me show you
how this works.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.230
So if you--

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.290
maybe I was too fast.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:08.270
If you click on the folder and
say, Open With Editey, then it

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:15.280
will open the website in the
preview mode, I would call it,

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.700
or the website mode.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.500
So you have the different
source files on

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.660
the left hand side.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.820
And you get a preview
of this website on

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.310
the right hand side.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:33.540
So this is quite nice, to do
some kind of prototyping right

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.370
on the web.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:39.410
Because you now can just launch
this website, post it

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.440
on Google Drive on the web.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.270
And if you make any changes
to your source code, it's

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:50.140
instantly visible
on Google Drive.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.640
But if you are working on a
real-world website you don't

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.445
want to have this URL
starting with

00:13:55.445 --> 00:13:57.290
Google Drive or something.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.870
You just want to have it
on your own domain.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:07.150
So if you are using Google Apps,
you are able to map end

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.160
applications on Google
App Engine to

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.860
your Google Apps domain.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.430
And so I just took advantage
of this feature.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:19.110
And so if you're a Google Apps
customer, and you have a

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:25.440
verified domain, then you can
simply publish this website to

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.690
your own domain.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.450
And it's not really doing
any copy stuff.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:37.340
It will just tell our
application that if someone

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:45.370
goes to this domain, it will put
some proxy stuff to solve

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.610
the pages from Google Drive
but it will look as if it

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.890
would come from your
own custom domain.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.510
So that's quite nice, because
you can make changes on your

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:01.160
website and they will instantly
be visible right on

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.980
your domain.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:08.364
And so if anybody's interested,
this example--

00:15:08.364 --> 00:15:09.810
now it's live.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:15.030
Everybody can go to this page
and if you click on the sketch

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:20.070
of paper plane, then it
will trigger Ultradox.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.080
So if you go to this website for
the first time you have to

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.410
authorize access to your
Google+ profile.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:31.390
And this will then take some
data from your Google+

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:36.540
profile, send it to our Ultradox
application and

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.510
Ultradox will--

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.270
should, let's see--

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:46.460
so it will create a mail
and send it to you.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:53.120
And you will find a paper
plane attached with your

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.940
Google+ photo, with a QR
code, and your name.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.300
And you can print it and---

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.550
STEVE BAZYL: Make it fun.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.490
Hopefully it flies well.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.856
That's really cool.

00:16:07.856 --> 00:16:12.090
And it's nice to see how the two
apps all tie together and

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:13.360
really let people do
some really cool

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.400
stuff with Google Drive.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.660
DANIEL FLOREY: And it's really
fun to see that you can really

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.990
use and take advantage of all
the Google APIs for just

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.340
creating such a simple web site
where you just call a

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:31.150
bunch of APIs and it instantly
works off of Google Drive.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:36.040
So no magic sort of
stuff included.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.460
AUDIENCE: Was it hard to have
those different icons for the

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.010
different content types?

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.880
DANIEL FLOREY: That was
something quite tricky,

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.860
because basically we just
created a single application.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:56.530
And so if you are creating an
application for Google Drive

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:01.470
you typically just create
a single icon for this

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.600
application.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.150
And I would really recommend
everybody to try to make a

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.569
nice icon, because then your
first impression on the Chrome

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:11.819
Web Store will be much better.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.119
So I came up with a solution--

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.915
let me try to switch
to another video.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.870
So if you have a look at the
Google API console, we created

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:38.940
a bunch of projects just to be
able to provide the different

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.910
file icons and map them to--

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.015
so this for example is the
JavaScript editor.

00:17:50.015 --> 00:17:55.080
It comes with a set of
JavaScript file icons and is

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.910
mapped to the JavaScript
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:06.270
And if you are creating a
new document, then this

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.853
URL would be called.

00:18:06.853 --> 00:18:10.240
And we distinguish the different
file types by their

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.990
sub-domain.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.510
And so once our application gets
called the first Create

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.270
time with this Create action,
then we can create the proper

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.920
file type and redirect the user
more or less to our main

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.500
Editey application.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.050
So they are all working
on the same

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.790
application, on App Engine.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:34.960
So that's important to allow
people to share files and

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.560
stuff like that.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:43.690
But to get a different file
icons, we had to create this

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:48.580
application and the Google API
console for each file type.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.180
STEVE BAZYL: This is something
that we could probably

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.500
certainly make easier for
applications like yourself,

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.575
like yours, where you create
different types of content

00:18:56.575 --> 00:18:59.990
with the same application and
wanting to have those

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.480
represented as distinct
actions.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.050
So definitely something that
we'll add to that to the list

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.970
of feature requests.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.590
DANIEL FLOREY: It really depends
where you want to have

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.450
the complexity.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:14.670
Because if you allow multiple
file items and icons in the

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.460
API console, then the console
itself may get quite

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.490
complicated.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:24.510
But really, from a user
perspective it would be really

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.500
nice if you were to have a
Create menu on Google Drive.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.190
Maybe with a sub menu for the
different file types that an

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.910
application can handle
and create.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.460
But maybe it's just a very
special case, I don't know.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.110
But probably other users
may come up with the

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.200
same request as well.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.420
STEVE BAZYL: The downside to
having multiple applications

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.420
is you end up having to
authorize multiple application

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.550
to read the content.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.890
So if you're constantly
switching between content, or

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.350
at least that first couple times
of loading all those

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:04.230
apps and authorizing could
be a little bit onerous.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.990
But they're really cool apps.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.290
And I've actually installed
these on my own account and

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.740
have started using them.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.290
They're really nicely done, and
I love that they're very

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.030
familiar to myself, certainly,
as somebody who uses Docs on a

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.180
daily basis.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.530
It feels like it's just another
version of Google Docs

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.410
that handles all the--

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.710
DANIEL FLOREY: I think if you're
a small company, I

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.970
think it's really my
recommendation to stay with

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:36.380
something that a bigger
company has developed.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.240
So for example, Twitter
Bootstrap, I think that's

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.580
quite great instead of starting
to create your own

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.400
style sheets and stuff
like that.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.640
If you're a small company,
why try to

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.840
reinvent everything yourself?

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.540
So I think it's just fair
to just more or

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.460
less copy their layout.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.860
Especially if you're focusing
on the same user base.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.450
And I think it's also good
for the Google Drive--

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.540
be consistent with all
the applications.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.060
Look at least a little
bit familiar.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.920
STEVE BAZYL: Certainly we
encourage people to have their

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.960
own brand, but having certain
conventions, and usability

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.310
standards, and everything really
helps in making users

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.930
feel comfortable with those
applications and reduce that

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:24.490
learning curve.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:28.110
So great job on those
applications.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.255
Do you have-- other than, it was
a great trick with showing

00:21:31.255 --> 00:21:33.130
the multiple applications.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.180
Is there anything else that
comes to mind that developers

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.210
who might be thinking about
building apps for Drive--

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:45.410
tips that you might share, or
any advice for how to be

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.180
successful?

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.150
DANIEL FLOREY: I think maybe
when starting a new

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:55.840
application I think it's really
a good idea to find out

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:01.790
what is the right granularity
if you want to share stuff.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:09.130
Because it makes sense to take
most of functionality that is

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.200
available, like sharing and
revision history and maybe

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.220
real time API and all the stuff
that you get more or

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:16.735
less for free.

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:19.790
You just have to provide
a nice user interface.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:24.890
But the product part is
already done for you.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.830
And so I think you have to make
sure that you find the

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.470
right size of pieces
that you want to

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.300
share with other users.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.880
For example, if it comes to
contact sharing I think it

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.290
would not make much sense to
have this file item on Google

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.580
Drive for each contact.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:47.490
Maybe it would make sense to
have one icon or one item for

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.580
a contact group, or whatever.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:54.810
So I think if you find the
proper size of items that you

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.190
want to share and you want to
work on, then you can really

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.000
take a lot of advantage
from the

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.100
features that are available.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.800
OLIVER ZEIGERMANN: Talking
about real time API?

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.730
There's stuff in the pipeline
for real time API.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.070
DANIEL FLOREY: Yes.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.410
So, definitely.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.340
So we are planning right now.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.410
Editey, we started with the
very simple, basic stuff.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.890
And there's--

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:26.080
at least in the midterm we are
planning to fill the missing

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.870
features that you would find
on Google Docs, like

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:33.700
commenting and [INAUDIBLE] and
real time collaboration.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.650
And so we are looking to
integrate that into Editey

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.970
over the next weeks.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.140
So that's something that is a
little bit difficult for us

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.670
because we still are using
the Web Toolkit for our

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.400
applications.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.400
And we have a bunch of
components that we can reuse

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.290
in every application.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:54.670
So we may stick with it for a
while even though it's not the

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:55.920
hottest stuff.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.120
As we are using Google Web
Toolkit, of course, we have to

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.560
write a Google Web Toolkit
wrapper for the real time API.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.870
So that takes some time.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:13.570
But once that is done, it's
quite easy to add features.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.150
STEVE BAZYL: I'd be curious to,
as you make more progress

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:19.050
on that, to learn a little bit
more about your experience and

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.220
how that goes, and some
of the challenges.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.890
Maybe it may turn out
to be really easy.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.920
Personally, I love the
real time API.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.640
It's really fun to play with--

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.250
DANIEL FLOREY: So if anyone
interested, we've also open

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:38.470
sourced our Google Web Toolkit
wrapper for the picker.

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.210
So you will find that
on Google Code.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:45.800
So I think that if you are using
Google Web Toolkit and

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.445
want to leverage some features
from the Google Drive API you

00:24:50.445 --> 00:24:53.500
can just check out the code
from Google Code.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:25:00.160
And this will give you
a nice good wrapper

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.330
for the picker API.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:03.660
STEVE BAZYL: That's great
and good to know.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:07.140
Do you know what the URL
is for that offhand?

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.090
Or a project name that people
can search for?

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.297
DANIEL FLOREY: I think it's
Good Google Picker,

00:25:12.297 --> 00:25:13.788
something like that?

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.460
I can share it with you later.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.740
STEVE BAZYL: Or post to the
Google+ community, I know

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.770
you've been active
there as well.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.840
It'd be great if you just
share a link to that for

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.050
people who are interested in
using GWT and Drive together,

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.170
that's a nice bit of reasonable
functionality that

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.740
they can just pick
up very quickly.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.710
So I really look forward to
seeing what happens with the

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.620
real time API and Editey,
as well as

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.790
new features in Ultradox.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:50.870
Again, it's a really
cool application.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:56.550
And thanks to both of you
for being here today.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.350
I know it's late on your end,
and you've probably had a long

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.920
day already.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.040
But I really appreciate you
taking the time to join us and

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.230
tell us about what you've
been doing.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.220
And we'll certainly touch base
again after you've played

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.875
around with things in the
real time API and

00:26:12.875 --> 00:26:14.125
see how things go.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.340
That's all for today.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.500
For next week, we'll be here
talking about tips and tricks

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.280
and some best practices for
Google Drive, and how to do

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.700
certain optimizations and make
your apps perform better.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.250
So we'll nail down that details,
and share it on the

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.930
Google+ community.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.530
Until then, we'll see
you guys next week.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:36.780
Thanks.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:27:29.475
