00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.101
We first covered space junk way back in December
2012, things have changed around here, but

00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:07.101
in space?

00:00:07.101 --> 00:00:08.640
They’ve only gotten worse.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.530
There are more than half-a-million pieces
of pieces of space junk floating around above

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.620
you, totalling over 7,500 tons [6.8M kg] of
stuff.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.310
It’s not just spent rocket stages, or dead
satellites.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.260
There are bolts, flecks of paint, bits of
shrapnel… and no matter the size, they’re

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.339
all going thousands of meters per second waiting
to collide with something important!

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.999
Size doesn’t really matter.

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.110
There are more than 20,000 pieces of space
debris larger than a softball, but so many,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.880
about 500,000, are just marble-or-larger-sized
pieces.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.520
If any of these hit a spacecraft, they could
cause some serious damage.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.580
So, we have to clean it up.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.820
And when we talk about cleaning up space we
really mean one thing: nudging fast-moving

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.380
space debris so it falls into Earth’s atmosphere.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.940
From there, friction with the air will burn
it up or it can fall into the sea.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.380
But that’s not easy.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.860
Any spacecraft planning to de-orbit some junk
will have to: match the target’s orbit,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.430
burn fuel to catch up to the speed of the
junk, then grab it (which could be hard if

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.130
it’s tumbling out of control), then burn
more fuel to slow down the now two spacecrafts,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.570
and put them both into a decaying orbit that
will cause the burn up or splashdown of the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.590
junk.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.619
Whew.

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.299
The European Space Agency is diving into this
problem headfirst -- launching a new robot

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.649
spacecraft in 2024.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.530
It’s called e dot deorbit.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.530
Pronounced e-deorbit.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.899
The ESA’s craft will have a robotic arm
(or maybe a net -- they’re still planning

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.369
this one out) and will catch one of their
8-ton derelict satellites.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.290
From there they can slow, redirect and burn
it up.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.299
They’re not the only ones thinking a net
would be the way to go.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.530
A new space-junk-cleaner-upper called Brane
Craft takes this way further.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.200
It’s basically just a membrane of solar
panels and plastic with tiny rockets.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.200
Like Aladdin’s carpet!

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.780
The 1-meter square craft is designed to envelop
and redirect smaller pieces of junk.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.219
But you get all that.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.640
The incredible thing is just how thin it is!!

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.749
It’s essentially the thinnest possible design…
two special Kapton plastic membranes with

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:07.611
the fuel for the ionic liquid thrusters trapped
in the 10 micron-wide gap between the ‘branes!

00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:08.680
The total weight?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.040
35 GRAMS.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.950
They could stack these like pizzas and launch
them all at once.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.950
It’s ingenious.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.170
But of course, is still in planning stages.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.610
Which is why this last one is the most exciting,
for us at least.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.960
The D-Sat is a tiny Italian-made cubesat launched
on an Indian rocket in June 2017.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.800
It’s basically a cubesat with a d-orbit
decommissioning device or D3 on it.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.650
The D3 is like a death engine!

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.780
It has independent communications and power
systems and that way sat manufacturers can

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.860
slap this little box on their satellites -- pre-planning
for the sat’s death.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.250
Once the sat is dead, the D3 powers up and
sends the craft to Davey Jones.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.930
It’s not a solution to the junk up there
now, but could reduce for future junk.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.650
Of course, these are only proof-of-concepts.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.770
That big ESA mission?

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.910
The 2024 launch is just a test… to see if
a net is the way to go, and how best to burn

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.850
up the tech… then (maybe) a private company
will take on the challenge!

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.880
And let’s hope they do.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.010
There are tons of other plans out there, these
are just some of the more fun ones.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.970
According to Benjamin Bastida, space junk
expert for the ESA: even if we stopped going

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.980
to space… in 200 years large pieces will
break into hundreds of thousands of pieces.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.090
This could potentially make space unusable!

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.910
Luckily for us, some of the most creative,
and perspicacious minds on the planet are

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.710
working this shiz out.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.450
Even if we stop going to space now, we’ll
still have to deal with all this.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.510
So, do you have a favorite plan to stop space
junk?

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.960
Tell us about it in the comments.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.850
Did you know Mars could maybe have an atmosphere
again?

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.790
There’s a craaaazy NASA plan to do just
that -- watch our video about it here.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.880
I really love this video.
