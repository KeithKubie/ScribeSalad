00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 
I think it's a difficult question to

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520
I think it's a difficult question to
 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.840
I think it's a difficult question to
answer yes or no I think that the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850
answer yes or no I think that the
 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.670
answer yes or no I think that the
question is more about it's not

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680
question is more about it's not
 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.589
question is more about it's not
necessarily about a specific country

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599
necessarily about a specific country
 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.780
necessarily about a specific country
where a specific solution will be found

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
where a specific solution will be found
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.150
where a specific solution will be found
to pour the world out of its global

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160
to pour the world out of its global
 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.340
to pour the world out of its global
economic crisis I think it's much more

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350
economic crisis I think it's much more
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.580
economic crisis I think it's much more
about identifying an area or a theme

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590
about identifying an area or a theme
 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.840
about identifying an area or a theme
we're involved log in the renewable

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
we're involved log in the renewable
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.170
we're involved log in the renewable
energy and energy efficiency projects in

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
energy and energy efficiency projects in
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.929
energy and energy efficiency projects in
in China and I think that there is an

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
in China and I think that there is an
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.929
in China and I think that there is an
awful lot of opportunity for a growth in

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
awful lot of opportunity for a growth in
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.060
awful lot of opportunity for a growth in
the commercial components of transfer of

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
the commercial components of transfer of
 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.700
the commercial components of transfer of
technology and I think that if we can

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710
technology and I think that if we can
 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.799
technology and I think that if we can
inspire technology transfer and then

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
inspire technology transfer and then
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.380
inspire technology transfer and then
have the correlation the correlative

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
have the correlation the correlative
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.740
have the correlation the correlative
effects of growth involved in

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
effects of growth involved in
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.950
effects of growth involved in
the overseas countries where the energy

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
the overseas countries where the energy
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.750
the overseas countries where the energy
where the technology is actually being

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
where the technology is actually being
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.340
where the technology is actually being
developed as well as growth of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
developed as well as growth of
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.979
developed as well as growth of
Technology production in China and I

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
Technology production in China and I
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.570
Technology production in China and I
think that if we can grow that then it

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580
think that if we can grow that then it
 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.360
think that if we can grow that then it
will help to pull out the world out of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
will help to pull out the world out of
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.670
will help to pull out the world out of
its economic crisis so I think it's been

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
its economic crisis so I think it's been
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.780
its economic crisis so I think it's been
lots of discussion about a green

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790
lots of discussion about a green
 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.549
lots of discussion about a green
revolution and a green revolution is not

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
revolution and a green revolution is not
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.710
revolution and a green revolution is not
just about saving the environment it's

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720
just about saving the environment it's
 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.900
just about saving the environment it's
also about economic opportunity and I

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910
also about economic opportunity and I
 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.719
also about economic opportunity and I
hope I very much hope that the world

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
hope I very much hope that the world
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.910
hope I very much hope that the world
begins to see that and people

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
begins to see that and people
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310
begins to see that and people
particularly countries and commercial

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
particularly countries and commercial
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.540
particularly countries and commercial
industry begins to take advantage of it
