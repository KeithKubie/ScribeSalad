00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.690
We've been doing a lot
of examples where we just

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.850
take implicit
derivatives, but we

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.030
haven't been calculating
the actual slope

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.869
of the tangent line
at a given point.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.660
And that's what I want
to do in this video.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.620
So what I want to
do is figure out

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.770
the slope at x is equal to 1.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.880
So when x is equal to 1.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.000
And as you can imagine,
once we implicitly

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.440
take the derivative
of this, we're

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.350
going to have that as
a function of x and y.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.140
So it'll be useful
to know what y

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.612
value we get to when
our x is equal to 1.

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:40.070
So let's figure
that out right now.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.420
So when x is equal to 1, our
relationship right over here

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.234
becomes 1 squared,
which is just 1

00:00:46.234 --> 00:00:52.080
plus y minus 1 to the
third power is equal to 28.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.770
Subtract 1 from both sides.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.020
You get y minus 1 to the
third power is equal to 27.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.760
It looks like the numbers
work out quite neatly for us.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.500
Take the cube root
of both sides.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.760
You get y minus 1 is equal to 3.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.110
Add 1 to both sides.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.432
You get y is equal to 4.

00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:10.140
So we really want to
figure out the slope

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.620
at the point 1 comma 1 comma
4, which is right over here.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.970
When x is 1, y is 4.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.480
So we want to figure out the
slope of the tangent line

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.920
right over there.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.910
So let's start doing some
implicit differentiation.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.030
So we're going to
take the derivative

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.610
of both sides of this
relationship, or this equation,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.090
depending on how
you want to view it.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.640
And so let's skip down
here past the orange.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.890
So the derivative with
respect to x of x squared

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.660
is going to be 2x.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.270
And then the derivative with
respect to x of something

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.870
to the third power is
going to be 3 times

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:02.060
that something squared times
the derivative of that something

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.450
with respect to x.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.260
And so what's the derivative
of this with respect to x?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.200
Well the derivative of y with
respect to x is just dy dx.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.080
And then the derivative of x
with respect to x is just 1.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.720
So we have minus 1.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.670
And on the right-hand
side we just get 0.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.020
Derivative of a constant
is just equal to 0.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.420
And now we need to
solve for dy dx.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.620
So we get 2x.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.936
And so if we distribute this
business times the dy dx

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:36.879
and times the negative 1, when
we multiply it times dy dx,

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.170
we get-- and actually I'm
going to write it over here--

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:49.347
so we get plus 3 times y
minus x squared times dy dx.

00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:51.430
And then when we multiply
it times the negative 1,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:01.490
we get negative 3 times y
minus y minus x squared.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.460
And then of course, all of
that is going to be equal to 0.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.530
Now all we have
to do is take this

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.660
and put it on the
right-hand side.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.780
So we'll subtract it from
both sides of this equation.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.189
So on the left-hand side--
and actually all the stuff

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:16.730
that's not a dy dx
I'm going to write

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.188
in green-- so on
the left-hand side

00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:26.100
we're just left with 3 times
y minus x squared times dy dx,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.860
the derivative of
y with respect to x

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.920
is equal to-- I'm just going to
subtract this from both sides--

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.600
is equal to negative
2x plus this.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:43.090
So I could write it as 3 times
y minus x squared minus 2x.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.819
So we're adding
this to both sides

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.610
and we're subtracting
this from both sides.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.160
Minus 2x.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.700
And then to solve
for dy dx, we've

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.530
done this multiple
times already.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.280
To solve for the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.230
The derivative of
y with respect to x

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.180
is going to be equal to 3 times
y minus x squared minus 2x.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.370
All of that over this stuff,
3 times y minus x squared.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.320
And we can leave it
just like that for now.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.240
So what is the derivative
of y with respect to x?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.120
What is the slope of the
tangent line when x is 1

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.720
and y is equal to 4?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.860
Well we just have to substitute
x is equal to 1 and y

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.160
equals 4 into this expression.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:36.840
So it's going to be equal
to 3 times 4 minus 1 squared

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.900
minus 2 times 1.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.480
All of that over 3
times 4 minus 1 squared,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.485
which is equal to
4 minus 1 is 3.

00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:49.460
You square it.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.436
You get 9.

00:04:51.436 --> 00:04:53.950
9 times 3 is 27.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.490
You get 27 minus 2
in the numerator,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.110
which is going to
be equal to 25.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.900
And in the denominator, you
get 3 times 9, which is 27.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.770
So the slope is 25/27.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.102
So it's almost 1, but not quite.

00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:12.310
And that's actually what it
looks like on this graph.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.500
And actually just
to make sure you

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.860
know where I got this graph.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.495
This was from Wolfram Alpha.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.540
I should have told you
that from the beginning.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.410
Anyway, hopefully
you enjoyed that.
