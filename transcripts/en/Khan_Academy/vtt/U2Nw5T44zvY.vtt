00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.870
Welcome back.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.100
Where we left off in the last
video, I had just purchased a

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.290
$1 million house.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.220
To do it, I went to the bank and
I said, bank, can you give

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.910
me $750,000?

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.020
They said, sure, Sal, you have
an excellent credit rating,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.190
and you look like an all
around great guy.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.420
So we'll give you $750,000.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.080
And so I took that $750,000 and
the $250,000 that I had

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.440
saved up through a lifetime of
hard work, and I went and I

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.540
bought that house.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.500
After that transaction, this is
what my personal -- well,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.620
this might not involve
everything, but it could be--

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.770
my personal balance sheet.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.660
But it looks like my whole
world is this house.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.660
Which in a lot of cases, it
is, for a lot of people.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.750
So in this situation,
what are my assets?

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.820
I have a $1 million house
on my balance sheet.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.430
I have one asset in the world.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.210
I guess you can't quantify
charisma and good looks.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.990
So the only real tangible
asset I have is

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.420
a $1 million house.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.050
And what are my liabilities?

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.990
Well I owe $750,000
to the bank.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.030
And so we learned in the last
video -- and you shouldn't

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.460
view this as a formula.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.410
It should start to make a little
bit of intuitive sense

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.640
-- that assets are equal to
liability plus equity.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.385
Or the other way to view it is,
assets minus liabilities

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:11.680
is equal to equity, right?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.000
Subtract the liability
from both sides.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.190
And you know that if I have $1
million of assets, I owe

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.530
$750,000, if I were to resolve
everything, what I'd have left

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.830
over at the end is $250,000.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.810
And I could make that happen.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.700
I could sell the house for $1
million, hopefully, and then

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.430
pay the bank back.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.130
And I would have
$250,000 left.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.220
So that's what equity is, just
what you have left after you

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.820
resolve everything.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.430
Or another way -- and this
makes sense to you.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.710
If you talk about all the things
you own minus all the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.040
things you owe to other
people, equity

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.040
is what's left over.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.490
Or that could be
owner's equity.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.060
So now let's play with some
scenarios of what happens,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.780
maybe, when the market value
of the house changes.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.760
So let's say, what happens when
-- oh, and one important

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.280
thing to note, this bank,
they're not just going to give

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.080
me $750,000 just to do
anything with it.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.610
They're not going to say, hey,
Sal, here's $750,000.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.260
I know you'll pay it back
to me, but you can go

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.690
gamble it in Monaco.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.470
They want to know that they have
a good chance of getting

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.470
at least the money that they
give, the loan amount, and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.100
that is often referred
to as the principal.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.740
They want to know that they're
going to be able to get that

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.220
principal back one day.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.230
So what they say is, Sal, we're
only going to give you

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.260
this loan, but this loan
has to be backed.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.960
Or it has to be collateralized
by some asset.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.120
And so what I say is, OK, well,
you know I'm taking this

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.940
loan out to buy a house,
a $1 million house.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.230
If for whatever reason, I lose
my job, or I disappear

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.850
somehow, or whatever happens.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.710
If I can't pay you the $750,000,
you get the house.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.610
You'll get this $1
million house.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.800
And right now that looks like
a pretty good deal to the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.710
bank, right?

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.830
They almost hope that I'll
default, because

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.840
they gave me $750,000.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.680
If after a day I just say, you
know what, bank, I can't pay

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.330
this loan, I don't have the
income, or I lost my job, I

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.810
can't afford the mortgage.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.350
They get a $1 million
house overnight.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.610
They would have made
$250,000, right?

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.700
They would have essentially
gotten all my equity for free.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.220
So in that situation, the bank
works out pretty good.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.620
And that's why they make sure
that there's something that

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.980
they can grab onto if you
can't pay the loan.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.740
And that's why, back in the good
old days, and I think the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.930
good old days are going to come
back again, and I think

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.590
they already are -- that the
bank wants you to put some

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.100
down payment in a house.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.500
Because there's a situation
where, let's

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.000
say that I do this.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.770
I borrow the money, and
I buy the house.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.050
And I lose my job, or
you know, whatever.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.850
I just drink away all of
my money, whatever

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.080
the case may be.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.210
And so the bank,
they foreclose.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.020
Foreclose means that Sal isn't
paying on his debt, so we're

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.880
going to take the collateral
back that he

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.420
gave for the loan.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.080
So in that situation, the bank
says, Sal can't pay, we're

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.270
taking that house.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.090
Well when they take that house,
there's a situation

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.860
where maybe they're not
going to get $1

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.940
million for that house.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.850
They don't want to sit and wait
for months and months and

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.980
months while a real estate
agent tries to sell it.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.410
So the bank might just auction
off the house.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.090
And when it auctions off the
house -- actually I think

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.790
there are laws that it can't get
more than the mortgage, or

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.550
anything more than the mortgage
it gets, it actually

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.930
has to pay taxes, or -- we won't
go into all of that.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.550
But it will auction off the
house, and maybe it can only

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.769
auction off the house
for $800,000.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.399
Right?

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.070
So the $1 million asset
would really

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.980
become an $800,000 asset.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.670
And so the bank keeps this
equity cushion, right?

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.350
That if they loan $750,000 for
a $1 million house, and then

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.260
the $1 million house only sells
for $800,000, the bank

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.190
still gets all of their
money back.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.820
That's why, in the good old
days, the banks wanted you to

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.430
put 20% or 25% down, because
they know even if the value of

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.560
the house drops by 20%
or 25%, it'll all

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.690
come from your equity.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.810
And maybe I should draw a
diagram to see that situation.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.680
Let's say that for whatever
reason, I have to sell this

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.840
house in a fire sale.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.190
Or let's say I can't sell the
house and the bank is forcing

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.790
me to liquidate my assets.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.210
The banks says well then,
I want that house back.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.530
So in that situation -- well
actually, that's not a good

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.080
situation because the bank
will just -- I'll

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.110
just get wiped out.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.290
Let's just do the situation
where let's say a neighbor's

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.120
house sells for-- a neighbor's
house that is identical.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.780
An identical neighbor's house,
sells for $800,000, right?

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.680
So in that situation, if I want
to be honest with myself,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.360
and if I want to be honest with
the balance sheet-- and

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.340
actual real companies have to
do this-- I'll say, you know

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.450
what, this asset, I have
to revalue it.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.840
I cannot in all honesty say that
this is now worth, that

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.030
this is a $1 million asset.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.860
So I would revalue the asset.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.000
And this is actually called
marking to market.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.480
You probably heard
of this concept.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.810
Marking to market means I have
an asset, and every now and

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.625
then, maybe every few months,
every quarter -- a quarter is

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:56.270
just a fourth of a year -- I
have to figure out what that

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.240
asset is worth.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.850
And the best way to figure out
what that asset is worth is to

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.000
see what identical assets
like that are

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.290
going for on the market.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.340
And very few houses are
completely identical.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.630
Well there are, in
a few suburbs.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.990
Very few assets are completely
identical.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.290
But let's just say that I know
for a fact that an identical

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.730
house just sold for $800,000.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.210
So I have to be honest. And I
have to mark it to market, and

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:23.940
then say that my assets are
now an $800,000 house.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.680
My same house.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.920
Nothing really happened, but the
market value has dropped

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.260
by $200,000 for whatever
reason.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.520
Maybe the car factory nearby
has gone out of business.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.860
So in this situation,
what happens?

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.440
What is my new balance sheet?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.490
Well has my liability changed,
because my neighbor's house

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.310
sold for less?

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.650
Well, no, as far as the bank
is concerned, I still owe

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.030
$750,000 to the bank.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.440
This is a liability.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.220
I still owe $750,000.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.930
This is assets, of course.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.180
So what's leftover?

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.240
What would be left over if I
were to liquidate at the

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.630
market price, if I were
to sell the house

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.950
at the market price?

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.620
Well I would have $50,000
left over.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.090
Essentially when the market
price of my asset dropped, all

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.670
of that value came
out of my equity.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.710
I'll do actually a whole other
video on the benefits and the

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.890
risks of leverage, because
that's very relevant to what's

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.200
happening in the world today.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.710
But I think you get a sense
of what's happening.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.230
Equity kind of takes
all of the risk.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.090
So in this situation, this is
why the bank wants you to put

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.020
some down payment.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.490
Because the bank, if you can't
pay this loan right here,

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.770
they're going to take
your house.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.270
And even in the situation where
the value of the house

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.000
went down, if you can't pay the
loan, the bank will still

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.940
be able to get its
$750,000, right?

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.390
If you just leave town, or lose
your job, and you just

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.060
tell the bank I can't pay
anymore, they're just going to

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.540
take this house, sell it,
hopefully for $800,000,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.260
because that's what your
neighbor sold it for.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.020
And they're going to get the
money back for their loan.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.840
So that's why the bank wants you
to put some down payment.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.210
And then there's the other
situation, which is maybe a

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.180
more positive situation.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.120
And this is what happened in
much of the world, and

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.440
especially in areas like
California and Florida and

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.580
Nevada over the last
five years or so.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.060
And I'll do a whole video
on why it happened.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.950
But let's say your neighbor's
house, a year later, didn't

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.180
sell for $800,000.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.250
Let's say the identical
neighbor's house

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.150
sold for $1.5 million.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.230
And you say, gee whiz.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.250
That's great.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.020
Now my house is also worth
$1.5 million because I'm

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.020
marking to market.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.150
So now my asset -- nothing
has really changed.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.110
It's still the same house.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.669
But I guess, since someone else
sold it for $1.5 million,

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.909
I guess I could, too.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:45.180
So my asset is now a
$1.5 million house.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:45.920
What are my liabilities?

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.320
Well your liabilities still
haven't changed.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:55.810
I still owe $750,000 to bank.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.410
This is liabilities.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.280
So what's left over?

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.530
What's my equity?

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.200
Well, assets minus liability.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.860
So I have $750,000 of equity.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.200
That's awesome.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.820
Even though the house
appreciated by 50%, right?

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.990
It went from $1 million to $1.5
million, my equity grew

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.900
three-fold.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:21.020
It appreciated by 200%.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.650
I think you're starting to get
the benefits of what happens

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.410
when you do leverage.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.750
Leverage is when you use
debt to buy an asset.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.840
But when you use leverage, the
return that you get on your

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.550
asset gets multiplied when you
get the return on your equity.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.070
I hope I'm not confusing you.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.150
But in this situation,
all of a sudden I

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.610
have a ton of equity.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.230
And I'm running out of time.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.760
But in the next video
I'm going to talk

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.820
about how this happened.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.200
Because you saw it in a
lot of neighborhoods.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:50.370
A lot of houses appreciated
from about 2001 to 2005.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.830
And people, all of a sudden,
just sitting on their house,

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.130
ended up with a lot of equity.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.380
And they felt that, wow, I just
went from having $250,000

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.050
of net wealth to $750,000
of wealth,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.900
without doing anything.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.940
Just by my neighbor's house
selling for more.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.190
I'll see you in the next video.
