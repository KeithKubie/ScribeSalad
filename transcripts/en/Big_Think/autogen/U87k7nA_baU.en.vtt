think the house committee on science and
 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.950
think the house committee on science and
technology right now which is obviously

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960
technology right now which is obviously
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.350
technology right now which is obviously

started to speak very eloquently about
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.050
started to speak very eloquently about
the importance of science in America in

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
the importance of science in America in
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.410
the importance of science in America in
the future of America so it most

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
the future of America so it most
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.640
the future of America so it most
definitely most definitely is both a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
definitely most definitely is both a
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.980
definitely most definitely is both a
democrat or republican issue i think

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
democrat or republican issue i think
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.749
democrat or republican issue i think
that i think that what we're starting to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
that i think that what we're starting to
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.310
that i think that what we're starting to
see is the recognition that science is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320
see is the recognition that science is
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.969
see is the recognition that science is
not a you know an issue to sort of block

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
not a you know an issue to sort of block
 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.249
not a you know an issue to sort of block
off and isolate as a you know an issue

progress because you can most certainly

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
progress because you can most certainly
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.649
progress because you can most certainly
look at science and see its consequence

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659
look at science and see its consequence
 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.230

on national security you can look in

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
on national security you can look in
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.700
on national security you can look in
science and see its consequence on

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
science and see its consequence on
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.590

science and see its impact on education
and obviously math and science education

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000
and obviously math and science education
 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.069

what America stands for and it's
interesting to note that in the last few

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240
interesting to note that in the last few
 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.090
interesting to note that in the last few
years there have been more space

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100
years there have been more space
 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.300

United States than from within the
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.660
United States than from within the
United States and it's in fact many

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
United States and it's in fact many
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.610

space programs that although today are
 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.950
space programs that although today are
not pushing technological boundaries

geopolitical buttons and sort of
 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.270
geopolitical buttons and sort of
national pride buttons and the space

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
national pride buttons and the space
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.620
national pride buttons and the space
program in various parts of the world
