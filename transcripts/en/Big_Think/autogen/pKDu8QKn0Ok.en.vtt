we are responded to in society because
of our sex but if we think about this

era of the potential of science and we
 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.070
era of the potential of science and we
think about the fact that men and women

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080
think about the fact that men and women
 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.710
think about the fact that men and women
are different biologically you know

differences is just enormous what it
 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.649
differences is just enormous what it
means when we think about sex

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659
means when we think about sex

differences in health and disease is

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250
differences in health and disease is
 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.300
differences in health and disease is
that men and women differ in every

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310
that men and women differ in every
 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.640
that men and women differ in every
aspect of health and disease and the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650
aspect of health and disease and the
 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.600
aspect of health and disease and the
potential for discovery here is is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610
potential for discovery here is is
 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.860
potential for discovery here is is
tremendous today we only are at the very

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870
tremendous today we only are at the very
 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.110
tremendous today we only are at the very
early stages of understanding what some

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120
early stages of understanding what some
 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.810
early stages of understanding what some
of those differences are from a clinical

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820
of those differences are from a clinical
 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.710
of those differences are from a clinical
standpoint and we are really have a long

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720
standpoint and we are really have a long
 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.320
standpoint and we are really have a long
way to go before we fully understand the

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330
way to go before we fully understand the
 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.170
way to go before we fully understand the
scientific base for some of those

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180
scientific base for some of those
 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.200
scientific base for some of those
differences so just to give you an

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210
differences so just to give you an
 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.350
differences so just to give you an
example if you look at a woman who has

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360
example if you look at a woman who has
 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.050
example if you look at a woman who has
heart disease or blockages and her

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060
heart disease or blockages and her
 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.330
heart disease or blockages and her
arteries or symptoms that make one think

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340
arteries or symptoms that make one think
 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.100
arteries or symptoms that make one think
she might have blockages in her arteries

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110
she might have blockages in her arteries
 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.649
she might have blockages in her arteries
we know that those symptoms differ

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659
we know that those symptoms differ
 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.899
we know that those symptoms differ
between men and women now that's a

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909
between men and women now that's a
 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.240
between men and women now that's a
clinical observation what we don't know

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250
clinical observation what we don't know
 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.840
clinical observation what we don't know
is why we see those differences in

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850
is why we see those differences in
 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.999
is why we see those differences in
symptoms then if you do testing in a man

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009
symptoms then if you do testing in a man
 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.449
symptoms then if you do testing in a man
or a woman the qualities of the test the

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459
or a woman the qualities of the test the
 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.220
or a woman the qualities of the test the
sensitivity and the specificity the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
sensitivity and the specificity the
 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.410
sensitivity and the specificity the
characteristics of the test differ

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420
characteristics of the test differ
 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.449
characteristics of the test differ
between men and women certain tests are

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459
between men and women certain tests are
 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.309
between men and women certain tests are
better in women than they are in men and

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319
better in women than they are in men and
 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.300
better in women than they are in men and
then

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310
then
 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.540
then
very interestingly when you actually

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550
very interestingly when you actually
 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.500
very interestingly when you actually
look at the type of disease women have

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510
look at the type of disease women have
 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.930
look at the type of disease women have
so what their arteries actually look

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940
so what their arteries actually look
 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.610
so what their arteries actually look
like the arteries can look different

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620
like the arteries can look different
 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.220
like the arteries can look different
and what we begin to understand is that

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230
and what we begin to understand is that
 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.530
and what we begin to understand is that
some of the gold standard tests that

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540
some of the gold standard tests that
 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.920
some of the gold standard tests that
we've been using for many years that are

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930
we've been using for many years that are
 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.220
we've been using for many years that are
based on the typical disease that men

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230
based on the typical disease that men
 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.729
based on the typical disease that men
have may not function as well in women

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739
have may not function as well in women
 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.460
have may not function as well in women
and so we've had many years of women

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470
and so we've had many years of women
 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.710
and so we've had many years of women
undergoing these tests and being told

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720
undergoing these tests and being told
 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.710
undergoing these tests and being told
that they are actually fine so today

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720
that they are actually fine so today
 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.500
that they are actually fine so today
we're in a different place we understand

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510
we're in a different place we understand
 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.449
we're in a different place we understand
that there are some of these differences

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459
that there are some of these differences
 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.190
that there are some of these differences
some of that knowledge is not as

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200
some of that knowledge is not as
 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.190
some of that knowledge is not as
generalized and as widely understood as

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200
generalized and as widely understood as
 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.940
generalized and as widely understood as
we need it what we don't understand is

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950
we need it what we don't understand is
 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.530
we need it what we don't understand is
biologically why do we see those

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540
biologically why do we see those
 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.470
biologically why do we see those
differences so as you can see there's

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480
differences so as you can see there's
 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.850
differences so as you can see there's
this cycle between

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860
this cycle between
 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.410
this cycle between
clinical observation science getting the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420
clinical observation science getting the
 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.539
clinical observation science getting the
word out translation of that science to

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549
word out translation of that science to
 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.970
word out translation of that science to
clinical care and observation once again

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980
clinical care and observation once again
 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.620
clinical care and observation once again
feeding more science

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630
 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.330
I wouldn't say that there are specific

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340
I wouldn't say that there are specific
 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.610
I wouldn't say that there are specific
issues that are unique to women what I

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620
issues that are unique to women what I
 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.430
issues that are unique to women what I
would say is that there are issues that

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440
would say is that there are issues that
 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.010
would say is that there are issues that
are either more prevalent in women that

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020
are either more prevalent in women that
 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.880
are either more prevalent in women that
need to be focused on and some risks

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890
need to be focused on and some risks
 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.990
need to be focused on and some risks
that impact women differently so for

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000
that impact women differently so for
 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.090
that impact women differently so for
example if you look at diabetes for

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100
example if you look at diabetes for
 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.220
example if you look at diabetes for
reasons that we don't fully understand

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230
reasons that we don't fully understand
 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.390
reasons that we don't fully understand
the impact of diabetes on women's heart

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400
the impact of diabetes on women's heart
 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.170
the impact of diabetes on women's heart
health seems to be more profound than it

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180
health seems to be more profound than it
 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.070
health seems to be more profound than it
is in men so diabetes will wipe away

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080
is in men so diabetes will wipe away
 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.410
is in men so diabetes will wipe away
some of the early protection women have

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420
some of the early protection women have
 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.960
some of the early protection women have
against heart disease but women will be

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970
against heart disease but women will be
 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.380
against heart disease but women will be
more likely to die of cardiovascular

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390
more likely to die of cardiovascular
 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.820
more likely to die of cardiovascular
disease and then when you layer over

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830
disease and then when you layer over
 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.150
disease and then when you layer over
that some differences in for example

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160
that some differences in for example
 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.670
that some differences in for example
across racial and ethnic groups you see

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680
across racial and ethnic groups you see
 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.770
across racial and ethnic groups you see
some very stark differences for example

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780
some very stark differences for example
 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.220
some very stark differences for example
in african-american women compared with

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230
in african-american women compared with
 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.290
in african-american women compared with
white women with african-american women

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300
white women with african-american women
 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.900
white women with african-american women
having much higher rates of diabetes and

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910
having much higher rates of diabetes and
 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.390

depression depression is more common in
 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.170
depression depression is more common in
women and it also seems as though

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180
women and it also seems as though
 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.300

depression may be more linked to the
 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.470
depression may be more linked to the
development of further events for the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950
 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.730
there are some newer technologies in the

there are some newer technologies in the
 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.530
there are some newer technologies in the
area of Cardiology that I think are very

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540
area of Cardiology that I think are very
 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.130
area of Cardiology that I think are very
exciting for women so for example if we

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140
exciting for women so for example if we
 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.190
exciting for women so for example if we
look at the fact that women are more

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200
look at the fact that women are more
 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.850
look at the fact that women are more
likely to lay down plaque in their

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860
likely to lay down plaque in their
 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.210
likely to lay down plaque in their

arteries in a way that it is diffusely
 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.600
arteries in a way that it is diffusely
laid down as opposed to there being a

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.920
laid down as opposed to there being a
very discrete blockage in the artery

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930
very discrete blockage in the artery
 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.900
very discrete blockage in the artery
that can be opened up for example with a

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910
that can be opened up for example with a
 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.720
that can be opened up for example with a
stent if women have that more diffuse

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730
stent if women have that more diffuse
 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.750

and this is very important because it

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050
and this is very important because it

us look at all patients differently and
it's always my belief that by looking at

it's always my belief that by looking at
 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.370
it's always my belief that by looking at
women and looking at the science and

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380
women and looking at the science and
 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.230
