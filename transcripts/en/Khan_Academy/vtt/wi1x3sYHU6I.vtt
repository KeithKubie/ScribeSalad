00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] We've done many videos

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.580
on the price elasticity of demand,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.030
now we're going to focus on
the price elasticity of supply.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.840
And it's a very similar
idea, it's just being applied

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.100
to supply now, it's a
measure of how sensitive

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.100
our quantity supplied is to
percent changes in price.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.270
And we will calculate
it as our percent change

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.340
in quantity supplied for a given,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.060
for a given percent change in price,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.060
percent change in price.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.120
Now, to make this a
little bit more tangible,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.260
let's look at a simple market,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.260
let's say this is the market
for apples, right over here,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.510
where our vertical axis is price,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.060
and this could be thousands
of dollars per ton,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.440
and then our horizontal
axis is quantities,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.550
and maybe this is in tons per day.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.950
And this supply schedule
and this supply curve

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.810
are essentially describing the same data.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.270
So, let's think about our
price elasticity of supply

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.470
as we go from point A,
point A, to point B.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.710
Well, on the supply schedule,
point A is this point

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.790
right over here, our price
is four, our quantity is one.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.890
And point B is right over here.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.490
So let us calculate
from point A to point B

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.040
our price elasticity of supply.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.970
So, first of all, what is going to be

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.530
our percent change in price?

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.830
Well, we're going from four to six,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.850
so it's an increase of two,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.640
so our percent change in price

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.260
is going to be equal to two,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.060
is how much we increased
from a base of four,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.363
times 100% and that of course
is going to be equal to

00:01:56.363 --> 00:01:59.370
a 50% increase in price.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.950
And then what is going to be
our percent change in quantity?

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.010
Well, we're going from one to two,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.120
so we're starting at a base of one.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.560
We are increasing by one,
and then multiply that

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.543
times 100%, that gives us 100%.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.010
So, when we have a 50% increase in price,

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.190
that resulted going
from point A to point B,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.500
in a 100% increase in quantity supplied.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.820
So, 100% divided by 50%,
that is going to give us,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.310
this is going to be equal to two.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.640
Now, what if we go from
point B to point C?

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.630
So, this is point C right over here.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.500
I encourage you, pause this video

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.150
and see if you can calculate
the price elasticity of supply

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.983
when going from point B to point C.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.593
Well, we're going to do
a similar calculation.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.820
Our percent change in price.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.820
We start at a base of six
and we are increasing by two.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.120
So we're gonna multiply that times 100%.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.160
So that is approximately,
this is 1/3 times 100%,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.260
so approximately 33.3%.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.370
And then what is our percent
change in quantity supplied?

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.870
Well, we are going to
go from two to three.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.860
So we start at a base of
two, we increase by one.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.400
So plus one, and multiply times 100%.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400
And so that's going to be given,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.910
it's going to be equal to 50%.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.930
And so when we have a 1/3 increase,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.930
or 33.3% increase in our price,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.030
we have a 50% increase
of our quantity supplied,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.210
when we go from point B to
point C right over here,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.160
and then one way to think about it is

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.660
50% divided by 1/3 is the
same thing as 50% times three,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.870
and so this is going to be equal to,

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.020
this is going to be equal to 1.5.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.020
So, just as we saw when we calculated

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.250
price elasticity of demand,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.660
either when you have a linear curve here,

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.300
your price elasticity
of supply can change.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.130
It is not the same thing as slope.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.270
Now another thing to
keep in mind is the way

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.630
that I calculated price elasticity
of supply in this video,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.580
which is arguably the simplest way,

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.380
you would not get the same value

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.980
when you're calculating the
magnitude going from A to B

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.090
than if you went from B to A.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.250
There are slightly more
advanced techniques,

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.210
the mid-point technique, for example,

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.730
that will give you the same answer

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.530
regardless of which direction you go in,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.620
but that's beyond the
scope of this first video.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.100
Now, just as we discussed
in the demand case,

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.620
there are cases that you would consider

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.330
to be more inelastic supply and cases

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.680
where you would consider
to be more elastic supply.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.830
So, one way to think about it is,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.830
if the magnitude of your
price elasticity of supply

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.450
is less than one, and of
course this is magnitude

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.830
so it's going to be greater
than or equal to zero,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.110
well, then you're talking
about inelastic price

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.400
elasticity of supply, inelastic.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.770
That's a situation in
which our quantity supplied

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.380
is not going to change
so much depending on,

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.780
is not going to be so sensitive
to our change in price.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.380
Now, if our price elasticity of supply

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.820
is greater than one,
that's generally considered

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.620
to be elastic, for a given
percent change in price,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.720
you're getting a larger than that percent

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.953
change in quantity supplied.
