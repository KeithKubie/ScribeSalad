00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.376
So what is the most important lesson
you took out of being a founder in

00:00:04.376 --> 00:00:05.152
your company?

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:10.482
&gt;&gt; Well,
I learned business lessons, right.

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:13.893
There are things I learned about running
a company that I think were valuable.

00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:15.241
I've written a bunch about this,

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:19.790
sort of saying don't rely on one
channel to acquire all your customers.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.970
And if you do, know the risks.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.210
When you're young, as a company,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.130
you have to rely on things to
a degree that's probably not healthy.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.290
And you gotta make that trade,
and know where it came from.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.990
Actually, Google did the same thing,
right, Google's Yahoo deal.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.565
When Yahoo was sending them all of their
search traffic, that made the company.

00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:40.539
Had Yahoo pulled the contract or
said no, I think Larry and

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.012
Sergey would be in a different place.

00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:44.331
And maybe, they probably would have
figured it out, because it's them.

00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:46.596
But that's a trade you gotta make.

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:51.415
But for me personally, I think I just
learned a lot about what I'm good at,

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:54.036
what I'm bad at, how to manage people.

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:57.720
How to manage co-founders and
work with co-founders

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.300
like people who are your equals,
but you have to keep them on track.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.000
Which is very difficult, especially as a
CEO, where they're keeping you on track,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.110
you're keeping them on track.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.990
That's a really tough thing to manage.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.600
&gt;&gt; And from a product point of view,
what is your insights?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.350
&gt;&gt; Know your customer really well.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.930
We built the wrong product at first.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.300
Because we had a conception of our
customer that wasn't accurate, I think,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.870
in terms of how we initially
built our marketplace.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.390
And I think we didn't understand
our customer quite well enough.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.800
And we didn't really solve our
own problem when we started.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.520
And I think we should have.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.157
I think we would have been
a more successful company,

00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:38.200
had we hewn closer to our
own really deep problems.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.542
because we lost a lot of
iteration cycles on that.

00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:43.166
So if I where to start another company,
if I left and

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:46.500
started a company,
I think it would be something that I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.250
understood more intimately as
someone who experienced that thing.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.053
&gt;&gt; Right, so
why would I want to be a entrepreneur?

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:59.270
&gt;&gt; I don't know that you do.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.920
It's a funny thing, I think that people
give different answers to this question.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.310
Because I think it's actually
different for different people.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.090
I don't think there's one way that you
can look and say, I checked these boxes,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.380
I know I want to be an entrepreneur.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.770
For me,
it was a question of degree of control.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.344
I had worked at companies beforehand,
and

00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:21.062
just never felt like I was actually
influencing the success or

00:02:21.062 --> 00:02:24.940
failure of those companies, or
the vision of those companies.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.297
And I wasn't happy with that.

00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:31.503
I play well with others, but
I'm not great at being managed,

00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:33.240
depending on who the manager is.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.770
So that's something that indicates
maybe I should be a founder.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.988
And I wanted to do something really
large, that was kind of out-sized to

00:02:39.988 --> 00:02:43.000
the opportunity set offered
by working in a company.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.861
We kind of look at startups as the most
rapid way to impact the largest number

00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:48.102
of people in the world.

00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:53.981
To think that Facebook went
from nothing in 2005 to having

00:02:53.981 --> 00:03:00.548
1.3 billion monthly active users
in ten years, is astonishing.

00:03:00.548 --> 00:03:04.448
There's nothing else on Earth that I
think has reached that many people

00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:05.300
that quickly.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.629
I think the closest examples
are probably religion, right.

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.275
And those take centuries to
hit that many people at that

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:17.240
deep a part of their life.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.680
It's technology that can do that.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.780
Radio and television before that, and
now it's startups on the Internet.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.270
&gt;&gt; So passion has a big part of it.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.920
&gt;&gt; Huge.
I mean,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.730
you have to believe in what you're
doing, or really want to do it.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.640
I think there are people who found
companies not because they're

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.280
particularly passionate, but because
they see a really great opportunity for

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.420
making money.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.110
And I think that that's always in there
somewhere for people starting companies.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.470
They want to be billionaires or
something like that.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.450
But I think for the most part
the people who really succeed

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.365
are the people who aren't doing
it because of the money itself.

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:57.410
There was a great quote or

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.720
great thing that I heard when I was on
Wall Street, which is both good and bad.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.240
There's good and bad to this statement.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.780
But a lot of people there say
that money isn't the goal.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.912
It's not how you win the game,
it's how you keep score.

00:04:10.912 --> 00:04:11.575
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:13.850
&gt;&gt; Right, and I think that's true for
a lot of people.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.290
They're not actually earning money for
money's sake.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.339
They're earning money because
it's the metric, right?

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.279
It's the proxy for

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.130
showing that you built something huge,
something huge and valuable.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.510
So I think that if your
drive is to change lots and

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.970
lots of people's daily lives,
how they work, or

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.100
impact a lot of people, then you should
probably try to start a company.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.500
If you want just more autonomy
in your life, start a company.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.630
It doesn't have to be a startup, right.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.900
It can be a business.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.570
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Like a small business that gives you

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.690
freedom in your life.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.220
That's amazing.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.590
Don't fetishize the idea of startups and
these things that will touch everyone,

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.080
if you just want to build
something with your own hands.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.770
I think fundamentally that's
what it comes down to.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.320
&gt;&gt; Very cool, starting a company.
