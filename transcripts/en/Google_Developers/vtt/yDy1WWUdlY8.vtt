HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Apologies for the delay.

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.940
Thank you for coming.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.540
Really appreciate it.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.060
Obviously, a lot
of interest lately

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.660
on how Google's two computing
platforms, consumer computing

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.897
platforms, Chrome OS and
Android, could come together.

00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:15.480
It's been a lot of speculation
on that and a lot of discussion

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.970
about that.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.780
The approach we've
taken generally

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.470
is to take the best
attribute of each

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.230
and share it with the other.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.080
So for instance,
yesterday at the keynote,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.970
we talked about how
updates on Android

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.670
will use similar technology
to how Chrome OS updates work.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.750
And today, we wanted to
talk about a technology

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.990
in the opposite direction
and give you a bunch of demos

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.884
and leave room,
hopefully, for Q&amp;A. So I'm

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:41.550
going to be very brief
here and actually

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.100
introduce Kan, director of
product management for Chrome

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.750
OS, to update you on
our latest technology.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.150
KAN LIU: Thanks, Hiroshi.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.640
And good morning, everyone.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.080
Most of us use our laptops
every day, and many of us

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.470
use them hours at a time.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.940
We use our laptops
whenever we want

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.490
to be creative or
productive, whether it's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.590
researching a family vacation,
or building the next killer

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.600
app, or just comparison
shopping to find a new laptop.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.940
Having the speed of a keyboard,
the precision of a mouse

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.360
pointer, and the multitasking
capabilities of a large screen

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.810
can be extremely useful in
these kind of situations.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.270
But for many years, laptops
and computers in general

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.320
were really hard to use.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.410
They were slow,
and they got slower

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.060
the longer you used them.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.440
They were insecure.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.800
They were never up to date.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.940
And worst of all, not everyone
could afford one, at least not

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.380
a good one.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.420
So five years ago, we set
out to rethink the computer

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.870
and make computing a lot
more accessible for everyone.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.470
This meant building an operating
system that was fast, secure,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.890
and simple, but
most importantly,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.520
focused on helping users get
their everyday stuff done.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.420
And that's how
Chromebooks were born.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.720
They're fast to start up,
easy to set up, simple to use,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.870
and designed to be secure.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.140
They're also always up to
date, and they get better

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.670
with every update.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.460
Chromebooks are also incredibly
easy to manage and share,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.880
and these attributes
and values have really

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.835
resonated with our users.

00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:40.190
It has led to continued
momentum in Chromebooks.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.340
In fact, today, all
the top computer makers

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.370
are building and
selling Chromebooks,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.110
like Lenovo, Dell, HP,
Samsung, and many, many more.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.740
In the education
market, Chromebooks

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.980
are now outselling all
other devices combined.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.770
And we're also seeing strong
growth from enterprise,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.820
where Chromebooks,
Chromebox for meetings,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.910
and other purpose-built
Chrome devices

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.240
have been adopted
by large companies

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.020
like Whirlpool, Toyota,
Pinterest, and many more.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.710
And of course, consumer demand
has been as strong as ever.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.730
In fact, according to
IDC, in Q1 of this year,

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.770
Chromebook shipments
overtook Macs in the US.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.790
So what that means is
thanks to your support,

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.480
Chrome OS is now the number
two most popular PC operating

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.990
system in the US.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.100
We're incredibly humbled
and excited about this,

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.000
but this is really
just a reflection

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.600
of how well Chromebooks have fit
the needs and use cases of what

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.220
people are looking for.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.880
So that's how things have
unfolded over the last five

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.840
years.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.130
But in that time, the way
people use computing has also

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.890
changed a lot.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.950
In particular, apps,
both iOS and Android,

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.860
have become a huge part of our
personal computing experience.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.820
Whether it's checking the
weather app for your barbecue,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.460
consuming the latest
snaps on Snapchat,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.450
or just sending your favorite
track to your Sonos system,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.010
apps have become a central
part of our everyday lives.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.360
So we wanted to make
Chromebooks even better

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.260
by combining these experiences
and use cases with what people

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.880
already love about Chromebooks.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.000
This means bringing together
the breadth and versatility

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.180
of the millions of
apps in the Play store

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.780
with the speed, simplicity,
and security of a Chromebook.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.730
So that's why today,
we're announcing-- you

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.150
may have already heard--
we're bringing the Play

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.850
Store to Chromebooks.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.714
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.370
So this means you'll
now be able to access

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.880
all your favorite Android
apps and games not

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.900
just on a phone or a tablet, but
also on a laptop running Chrome

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.140
OS.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.250
So your Chromebook now
will have the world's

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.540
most popular and powerful
browser and the world's

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.370
most popular app store,
enabling multitasking

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.950
productivity apps like Adobe
Lightroom, Photoshop, Office,

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.095
Skype, plus all the
games you've already

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:49.260
come to love like "Clash
of Clans," "Hearthstone,"

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.050
"Need for Speed," and many
more, all on one device.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.690
This also means you'll now have
access to apps and experiences

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.480
that you never had
access to on a PC

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.480
before, like
Snapchat, for example,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.050
or our YouTube for Kids app.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.950
So this means-- and I'm not
saying you should do this--

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.050
but you can actually
write your term paper

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.400
and get your snaps
all on the same device

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.190
without ever having to take
your phone out of your pocket.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.580
So I'm here with
Katy Roberts Hoffman,

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.020
one of the product managers
on the Chromebook team,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.005
and we're going to show
you how this all works.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.770
All right, so let's switch
over now to the demo machine.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.400
One of the first
things you'll notice

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.815
is this looks a lot like Chrome
OS, and that's because is it.

00:06:40.815 --> 00:06:43.730
It's the same Chrome OS our
users have come to love.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.560
It's fast.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.270
It's simple.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.130
It's secure.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.250
But one of the big changes-- for
those of you with a sharp eye,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.840
you may have already
noticed this.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.460
There's now a Play Store icon
pinned to the bottom shelf.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.620
So let's go ahead and open
up that icon, and here

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.052
you have the entire Play Store.

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.510
You'll be able to
browse through it

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.340
as you would on any
other Android device,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.320
and you install any
app that you want.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.370
In fact, let's try installing
this "Bejeweled Stars" app.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.170
This looks like a
pretty fun-- for an app,

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.420
so let's go ahead and start
the installation process.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.270
And there you go.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.130
It's installing.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.495
So now, while this
is installing,

00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:22.370
one of the things I want
to talk to you about

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.930
is how seamlessly we've
integrated Android framework

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.159
into Chrome OS.

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:30.200
So things like-- for
example, she just showed you

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.440
the Notifications Center,
for Android notifications

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.184
will seamlessly open up in the
Notification Center as well.

00:07:38.184 --> 00:07:40.225
So all of this is seamlessly
integrated together.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.810
One of the things that I've
been meaning to do recently

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.860
that my wife keeps
reminding me about

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.684
is building a poster for my
daughter's third birthday.

00:07:51.684 --> 00:07:54.100
And so I'm going to take an
example here and actually show

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.410
you how I'm going to do
this on a Chromebook now.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:01.704
So to give you a little
background, my daughter's

00:08:01.704 --> 00:08:03.870
favorite activities and
favorite things in the world

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.080
are-- one is Piglet,
and two is ice cream.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.010
Unfortunately, I don't actually
have a photo of my daughter

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.250
with both Piglet and ice cream,
so I need to create one first.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.220
Wouldn't it be great if I could
Photoshop a photo like that?

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.430
So I've actually got Photoshop
Mix already installed

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.990
on this device from
the Play Store,

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.410
so I'm going to open that up.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.160
And here, I've already got
loaded a photo of my daughter

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.190
with Piglet from
our last vacation.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.650
She's actually trying to
feed Piglet a pen right now.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.280
Let's see if we can add a
photo of ice cream instead.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.159
So let's go ahead and
click the Plus button.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.367
It turns out Adobe Stock
has some great photos in it.

00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:40.740
And in fact, they've got
a really one of Neapolitan

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.947
ice cream cone--
which, by the way,

00:08:42.947 --> 00:08:45.280
is a really great dessert
that starts with the letter N,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.142
in case anybody's looking
for something to vote.

00:08:48.142 --> 00:08:49.600
So it's a little
out of proportion.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.204
That's OK.

00:08:50.204 --> 00:08:51.870
So she has a touch
screen here, so she's

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.980
going to use her fingers
to actually rotate and put

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.000
the ice cream cone and resize
it to just the right place.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.710
So this looks pretty
good, but this still

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.960
doesn't look quite right because
the ice cream cone is actually

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.227
sitting on top of her hand.

00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:05.810
So let's go ahead
and cut out the part

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.710
of the cone that's
overlapping so it

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.970
looks more like she's holding

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:09.035
It.

00:09:09.035 --> 00:09:10.150
So go ahead and zoom in.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.680
Again, she's using her hand
here to manipulate directly,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.596
and it's just really
easy with her finger just

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.320
to cut out exactly the
portion of the photo that's

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.740
overlapping.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.840
So we've done this with
multiple layers with her hand.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.880
It's just really
easy on a Chromebook.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.040
And now all of a sudden,
we've got a great image.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.320
But I'm going to save this
now so I can import this

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.600
into the poster I'm
actually working on in Word.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.850
So let's go ahead and save it.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:33.584
It's saved.

00:09:33.584 --> 00:09:35.000
Let's go ahead and
close that out.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.150
Now, switch over
to Office, where

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.526
I've already got
the poster loaded,

00:09:39.526 --> 00:09:40.650
but it's missing the photo.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.400
So let's go ahead and
click Insert Pictures,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.130
and let's select the photo
that we just created.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.280
And there you go.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.790
I think that looks pretty good.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.215
So now I'm going to go ahead
and share this with my wife,

00:09:54.215 --> 00:09:56.070
and it's pretty easy
on a Chromebook now.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.945
All you have to do is
click the Share button,

00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:01.970
send as an attachment,
file type, Gmail.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.630
And just like that, the
Gmail app automatically

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.820
pops up with a document
already attached,

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.865
and all I have to do is type the
email address, and it's sent.

00:10:11.865 --> 00:10:13.990
And that's because of the
way that we've seamlessly

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.276
integrated the Android
intents system into Chrome OS,

00:10:17.276 --> 00:10:19.150
so it's the exact same
experience you already

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.149
have on your phone, simple
flow that you already

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:23.360
have on your phone or a tablet.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.020
So another really compelling and
great feature of Android apps

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.950
is that they work
really well offline.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.910
For example, if you're on
an airplane without Wi-Fi,

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.260
you can still edit your photos.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.020
You can still play your
favorite playlists.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.180
You can still type up a
document or watch a Play movie.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.680
All that stuff just
works seamlessly

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.220
on Android devices
and Android apps.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.492
So here we've got another
demo machine set up,

00:10:47.492 --> 00:10:49.200
and if you look at
the right corner here,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.533
you'll see that it's completely
disconnected, completely

00:10:51.533 --> 00:10:52.227
without Wi-Fi.

00:10:52.227 --> 00:10:53.810
And I'm going to go
ahead and show you

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.910
another one of my
favorite games, which

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.960
is "Galaxy On Fire 2."

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.270
So this app is awesome.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.410
It's super smooth from
a graphics perspective.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.490
It allows her to actually
use the touchscreen controls

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.320
to go ahead and fly around.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.740
And because it's
on a laptop, it's

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.850
using the desktop
class hardware as well.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.155
So this experience is
actually pretty great.

00:11:14.155 --> 00:11:15.530
Maybe one of the
things we can do

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.690
is actually switch over
to the Play Movies app

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.960
so I can show you how I
can watch a real movie.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.710
So I've got the Play
Movies app open here.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.865
And again, because we're
completely offline,

00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:28.140
apps like Play Movies just work.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.950
And this is showing
me all the movies

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.169
that I've already downloaded.

00:11:32.169 --> 00:11:33.960
It turns out I'm a big
"Kung Fu Panda" fan,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.330
but I actually haven't had
time with everything going on

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.524
to catch up on the
latest "Kung Fu Panda 3."

00:11:38.524 --> 00:11:40.690
So why don't we go ahead
and click "Kung Fu Panda 3"

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.160
and play it and click play?

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.740
And there it goes.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.320
I can now watch my movie
completely offline without ever

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.590
having any internet connection.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.410
So this isn't obviously
just true for Play Movies,

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:59.595
but it's also true for things
like your Play Music, your Play

00:11:59.595 --> 00:12:00.594
Books.

00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:03.010
For Google Photos, which happens
to be a really great app,

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.877
that works completely offline.

00:12:04.877 --> 00:12:07.210
So you can sync all your
photos and be able to view them

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.410
on an airplane.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.910
And now all these
apps and experiences

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.510
work completely offline
on a Chromebook as well.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.720
So thanks, Katy.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.490
And that was just
a small glimpse

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.530
of some of the cool
new things you'll

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.300
be able to do on a Chromebook.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.430
And we're super excited about
this, but since this is I/O,

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.860
let's geek out for a moment
and actually tell you

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.480
guys about how we did this.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.790
So we've been working
very closely and side

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.360
by side with the Android
team to make both Chromebooks

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.460
and Android better.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.420
For example, as Hiroshi
mentioned earlier,

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.620
we've actually brought
the Chrome OS A/B update

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.030
system to Android N.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.070
While we were doing
this, we realized

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.110
that we can use the Linux
container, which is actually

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.120
a really popular technology
that's used in data centers

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.340
around the world and Google
actually uses in our own cloud

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:08.140
infrastructure today, to
bring Android framework on top

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.930
of the existing Chrome OS stack.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.520
So this allows us
to bring together

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.250
the best of both worlds.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.520
For example, in addition to
Android security features

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.860
like SC Linux,
the container also

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.210
provides a secure and
isolated runtime environment,

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.580
and all of this is built on
top of the security foundations

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:35.030
of existing Chrome OS, such
as verified boot, user data

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.119
encryption, continuous
updates every six weeks.

00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:40.910
And this isn't just
for the Chrome OS side,

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.990
but also for the Android
framework as well.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.850
So that means all
these apps will

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:50.340
be running on the latest
stack with the latest security

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.690
patches and the latest APIs.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.670
And this container is
actually integrated completely

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:04.160
with the Chrome OS system
services like input/output,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.560
graphics, connectivity.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.720
We've basically built an Android
hardware abstraction layer,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.060
and we've put the Android
framework on top of it.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.950
This enables us to run the full
Android framework natively,

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.130
and that's how we can
ensure Android apps can

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:27.420
run full speed with no overhead
and no performance penalties

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.570
from emulation or
virtual machines.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.380
This also means that
Chromebooks are now

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.810
fully compatible
with any Android app.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.380
Of course, like all
Android devices,

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.690
regardless of whether it's a
phone, tablet, or a laptop,

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.660
the Google Play Store will
allow installation of apps

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:51.280
based on the hardware
components on these devices.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.640
So for example, a
phone dialer app

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.330
may require cellular
capabilities

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.580
in order to install.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.060
So with Play Store
coming to Chromebooks,

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.060
we've been working
with our partners

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.300
to ship more and more devices
that will have the hardware

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.000
components to support more
of these use cases and apps

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.020
that users want to install
on their computers.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.610
And because of the
increased value

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.370
that users are now
getting, our partners

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.300
are also shipping
more premium devices,

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:26.100
like some of these from
Dell, HP, and Lenovo

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.010
that have already
come out recently.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.670
And finally, the Play
Store and Android apps

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.800
will work regardless of the
SLC platform on the device.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.300
This means it'll support
both ARM and Intel platforms.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.050
In fact, today's demos
were run both on a ARM

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.420
device and an Intel device.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.350
So next, I'm actually
going to bring up

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.845
my friend and colleague,
Rajen, who leads the Chrome OS

00:15:52.845 --> 00:15:55.390
and Android education
and enterprise

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.540
teams to give you a
little bit more insight

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.090
and talk about the
implications of having the Play

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:04.824
Store on Chromebooks for both
enterprise and education.

00:16:04.824 --> 00:16:09.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.660
RAJEN SHETH: Thank you, Kan.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.160
And with enterprise
and education,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.410
we talked a little bit about
how Chromebooks have been

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.650
a great success in education.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.380
But really, to take a step
back, the reason for this

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.720
is that there are two
big trends happening

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.500
in enterprise and education.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.390
The first is more and more
companies and schools are

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.870
moving to the cloud.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.270
What seemed kind of
heretical 10 years ago

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.470
is actually now
becoming mainstream.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:35.160
And so we see the
Chromebook as a great way

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.980
for businesses and schools
to take advantage of that.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.400
But the other big thing is
that businesses and schools

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.470
want to bring computing
to more of their users,

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.830
more of their employees,
more of their students,

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.790
and actually transform their
organizations by doing so.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.614
So we've seen this
in schools first.

00:16:51.614 --> 00:16:53.530
That's the first place
that this has happened.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.540
So as an example, we have
about 50 million students

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.030
that are using Google Apps for
Education on an active basis,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.460
and there are many other
cloud-based applications,

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.875
things like Khan Academy,
things like Brain Pop that

00:17:05.875 --> 00:17:08.240
are being used throughout
schools to really transform

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.230
education.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.140
But the thing that schools told
us about five years ago was

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.660
this is all great,
but it's not great.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.880
It doesn't let us
change our curriculum

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.130
unless we're able
to get computing out

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.690
to more of our students
on a daily basis.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.540
Chromebooks fit that
need extremely well.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.670
They were easy to use, easy
to manage, easy to share,

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.250
and also very affordable.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.500
And so schools really gravitated
to Chromebooks as the way

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.010
that they could bring productive
tools to their students

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.600
and actually change
how they teach.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.770
As Kan mentioned,
last year, a majority

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.080
of the devices that went out
into schools in the United

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.790
States were Chromebooks.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.550
But more importantly,
it's actually

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.080
changed how those schools teach.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.830
Schools can actually
move more towards

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:54.300
individualized education and
blended learning, concepts

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.015
that actually make it so
that students learn better.

00:17:57.015 --> 00:17:59.350
And that's the thing
that we're most proud of.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.670
We're now seeing that same
trend happen in business.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.040
Over 2 million businesses are
using Google Apps for Work.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.680
But in addition
to that, there are

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.480
many other cloud-based
applications

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.990
that businesses
are migrating to,

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.820
and so the Chromebook
again is a perfect fit

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.400
for that kind of environment.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.070
But also, what we're also
hearing from our customers

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.190
is that there are many
employees that they want

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.820
to give access of computing to.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.030
As an example, there
are 3.2 billion people

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.720
walking into a workplace
in the world today.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.240
However, there are only about
750 million PCs in businesses

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:34.990
today.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.510
So there are many,
many users that

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.590
don't have any
access to computing,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.340
and we want to change that.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.440
We've already seen this happen
with Chromebooks-- for example,

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.220
in retail stores, where they're
enabling all of their employees

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.120
to have access to computing
and changing their processes as

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.740
well.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.850
We've seen this happen in places
like hotels and restaurants

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.140
and manufacturing
plants as well.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.190
We've invested very
heavily over the course

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.500
of the last couple of years
to really make Chromebooks

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.252
fit well in the enterprise.

00:19:03.252 --> 00:19:05.210
We've invested in making
sure that we integrate

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.610
with enterprise
infrastructure so it really

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.460
fits in well with what
businesses have today.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.580
We've also worked
with our partners

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.860
like HP, Lenovo,
Dell, Acer, and Asus

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.950
to have enterprise-specific
Chromebooks that really meet

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.920
the needs of business users.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.320
But the one big thing
that was still missing

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.770
is app compatibility.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.350
Can I do the kinds
of things that I

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.320
need to do on this device?

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.980
And this is where
we think having

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.910
Android apps on the Chromebook
will be transformational.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.760
Now businesses can use
all of the key apps

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.710
that they typically
use, whether it's

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.030
things like QuickBooks,
or Office, or Skype,

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.830
or many, many
others that are now

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.420
available in the Play Store.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.852
But in addition to that,
they can use them offline.

00:19:47.852 --> 00:19:50.060
Students can start to use
a lot of the learning tools

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.060
that are available on
Android and actually

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.240
bring touch-based applications
to students, for example,

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.390
in lower grades.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.240
And so we think that this can
actually transform, really,

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.621
how businesses approach
computing once again.

00:20:02.621 --> 00:20:04.120
So with that, I'll
bring Kan back on

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.300
to round up our session.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:09.890
KAN LIU: Hey.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.200
Thanks, Rajen.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.064
So we think all of this is
really great for our users,

00:20:14.064 --> 00:20:15.980
but we also believe this
is going to be really

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.520
great for developers too.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.870
If your app runs on an
Android device today,

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.490
it will now be able to
run on a Chromebook too.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.070
So with the same Android
framework and platform

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.720
you're used to, you'll be
able to bring your existing

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:36.190
apps to a whole new category
of devices and form factors,

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.620
and that opens up all
kinds of new possibilities.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.300
As a developer, you can
now create new experiences

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.010
for track pads,
keyboards, larger

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.130
screens, multiple windows.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.470
It also means new
business models.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.940
Desktop software
can oftentimes be

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.570
priced in the
hundreds of dollars

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.660
or even thousands of
dollars, and that's

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.960
because we can be more
productive and more creative

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.350
on our laptops.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.780
We can create a movie.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:10.340
We can design a whole house,
or we can write our PhD thesis.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.030
So when is all this actually
coming to Chromebooks?

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.750
Google Play will start rolling
out in the next Chrome Dev

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.660
Channel, M53.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.320
It'll be available
on select devices

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.350
first, with many more
devices to follow soon after.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.340
We hope this will be a
great way for developers

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.730
to start testing their
existing apps on Chromebooks

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.990
and even start creating new
experiences for this form

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.900
factor so that they'll be ready
when we start rolling this out

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.930
to users later this year
along with new hardware that

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.700
has been designed with
the Play Store in mind.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:55.160
So as we've always
said, Chromebooks

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.580
have always been
about making computing

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.490
more accessible for everyone.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.400
And by bringing together the
best of Android and Chrome OS,

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.540
we believe we're making
a big leap forward

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.960
because not only are we
addressing many of the use

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.140
cases and needs that people have
with their Chromebooks today,

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:19.040
but we're also betting on the
millions of Android developers

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.540
that are out there
innovating every day

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.080
to create new experiences and
experiences that have never

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.360
even been possible on
a PC platform before.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.370
So this is just the
beginning, and we're

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.640
super excited to see what the
future holds for everyone.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.110
So thank you all for
coming, and now I'm

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.810
going to actually bring up
a few members of the team

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.250
and open it up to
press Q&amp;A. Thank you.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:54.200
