00:00:13.436 --> 00:00:16.136
It was June 2014.

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:18.063
I was 30 years old,

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.229
and I received a call
from my doctor's office

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:23.320
to say my test results were in.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.833
So I walked up to see her
in my lunch break, and my doctor said

00:00:28.857 --> 00:00:32.512
she was very sorry to tell me
that I had breast cancer.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:38.688
I didn't want to believe her
and at first, I didn't.

00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:42.497
You see, I'm a lawyer
and I needed some evidence.

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.204
So I'm very embarrassed to tell you all

00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:49.078
that I stood up and I walked around
to where she was sitting

00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:51.992
so that I could look
over her shoulder and verify

00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:54.121
what was written
on the page in front of her.

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:55.347
(Laughter)

00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:56.958
Malignant carcinoma.

00:00:57.864 --> 00:01:01.188
But still not wanting
to believe it, I said,

00:01:01.212 --> 00:01:06.813
"Now, malignant carcinoma,
you're sure that means cancer?"

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:08.043
(Laughter)

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.734
She told me she was sure.

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:14.876
Back at work, I handed over
the urgent things that needed to be done

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.196
while I was having more tests
to see if my cancer had spread.

00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:21.895
But at that moment,
work wasn't my priority.

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:26.166
I was thinking about how I was going
to tell my family and friends

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.390
that I had cancer.

00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:30.133
How I was going to answer their questions

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:33.252
about how bad it was
and whether I was going to be OK,

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:35.093
when I didn't know that myself.

00:01:36.307 --> 00:01:37.998
I was wondering if my partner and I

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:40.339
would ever have an opportunity
to start a family.

00:01:41.094 --> 00:01:44.538
And I was figuring out
how I was going to tell my mother,

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:48.315
who had herself had breast cancer
when she was pregnant with me.

00:01:49.165 --> 00:01:51.093
She would know how I was feeling

00:01:51.117 --> 00:01:53.744
and have an idea of what lay ahead for me.

00:01:53.768 --> 00:01:58.356
But I also didn't want her
to have to relive her cancer experience.

00:01:59.568 --> 00:02:01.862
What I didn't appreciate at the time

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:06.370
was that work was about to play
a huge role in my treatment and recovery.

00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:10.537
That it would be my coworkers and my job

00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:12.569
that would make me feel valuable and human

00:02:12.593 --> 00:02:15.388
at times when I would have
otherwise felt like a statistic.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.553
That it would be my job
that would give me routine and stability

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:23.402
when I was dealing with so many
difficult personal decisions

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:24.998
and so much uncertainty.

00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:29.155
Like, what sort of breast
reconstruction I was going to have.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.299
And at a time like that,

00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:35.877
you would think that I would turn
to my family and friends for support.

00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:38.607
And yes, of course I did that.

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:41.735
But it would ultimately be my colleagues

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:46.132
who would play a huge role
in my day-to-day life.

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:49.615
And they would be
the ones to make me laugh.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.823
You see, we were a pretty close team,

00:02:52.847 --> 00:02:55.410
and we shared a couple
of really good in-jokes,

00:02:55.434 --> 00:02:59.395
like this time they overheard
someone ask me

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.174
how I got my hair so shiny and perfect --

00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:06.994
without knowing that it was,
of course, a wig,

00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:09.145
and you know, it was a very good wig

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.325
and it did make getting ready
in the mornings very easy.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.696
(Laughter)

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.339
But in little moments like this,
I appreciated what their support meant,

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:21.537
and I wondered what I would
have done without that network.

00:03:22.716 --> 00:03:26.874
I've spoken with so many people,
women in particular,

00:03:26.898 --> 00:03:29.771
who haven't had the chance
to have that network

00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:33.771
because they haven't been given
the opportunity to work through treatment.

00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:37.740
And there are several reasons for this.

00:03:37.764 --> 00:03:41.585
But I think it mostly comes down
to overly paternalistic employers.

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:46.744
These employers want you to go away
and focus on yourself.

00:03:47.077 --> 00:03:49.323
And come back when you're better.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:52.596
And they use those kinds of phrases.

00:03:53.135 --> 00:03:56.309
And while these responses
are well-meaning,

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.253
knowing the benefits it brought me,

00:03:58.277 --> 00:04:01.269
it makes me incredibly frustrated

00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:05.161
when people are told
that they couldnâ€™t or shouldn't work,

00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:08.450
when it's something that they want to do
and physically can do.

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:12.815
So I started to look into
what an employer is required to do

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.545
when someone presents
with a cancer diagnosis.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:21.243
I discovered that under Australian law,
cancer is considered a disability.

00:04:21.835 --> 00:04:25.248
So if you are unable to perform
your usual work duties,

00:04:25.272 --> 00:04:29.192
your employer is obligated
by the Disability Discrimination Act

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:32.315
to make reasonable adjustments
to your working arrangements,

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:34.783
so that you can continue to work.

00:04:36.014 --> 00:04:38.880
What would reasonable
adjustments look like for me?

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:44.507
I knew the obvious impacts
my diagnosis was going to have on work.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.341
Medical appointments would be scheduled
during business hours,

00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:52.715
and I knew that I would need time off
to recover from surgical procedures.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.919
Again, being a typical lawyer,

00:04:55.944 --> 00:04:59.815
I had done my due diligence
on what to expect from treatment.

00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:02.816
Admittedly, a lot of that
was through Doctor Google,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.875
perhaps not my best move
and I wouldn't recommend that.

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:07.045
(Laughter)

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:10.349
But while I was ready
for all the physical side effects,

00:05:10.373 --> 00:05:13.798
what really scared me
was this thing called chemo brain.

00:05:15.103 --> 00:05:18.234
Chemo brain presents itself
through memory loss,

00:05:18.258 --> 00:05:20.455
an inability to concentrate

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.813
and an inability to solve problems.

00:05:23.226 --> 00:05:24.988
And if this happened to me,

00:05:25.012 --> 00:05:27.806
I wondered how I was going to do
my job as a lawyer.

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:30.209
Would I be forced to leave work?

00:05:30.924 --> 00:05:35.273
And how could I possibly
have a discussion with my manager

00:05:35.297 --> 00:05:38.196
about reasonable adjustments
to my working arrangements

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.736
when I didn't know
how I was going to be impacted?

00:05:41.823 --> 00:05:45.045
I was fortunate to have
a supportive manager

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.887
who was happy to see
how things went as we went along,

00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:52.008
rather than requiring
a concrete plan up front.

00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:56.887
I was lucky that while
he may not have even known

00:05:56.911 --> 00:05:59.641
about this concept
of reasonable adjustments,

00:05:59.665 --> 00:06:02.363
to him, it was just common sense.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.474
But I've learned that it's not
common sense to everyone.

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:11.926
Everyone going through treatment
will learn how it impacts them

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.743
and what their limitations are.

00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:16.934
And they'll learn to adjust for that.

00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:21.615
So for me, there were the tips and tricks
that I learned about the treatment itself,

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.369
like, before you go to chemo,

00:06:23.393 --> 00:06:25.702
you need to make sure
you're really well hydrated

00:06:25.726 --> 00:06:29.107
and that you're warm, because it helps
the nurses to find your veins.

00:06:29.474 --> 00:06:32.418
And make sure that you don't eat
any of your favorite food,

00:06:32.442 --> 00:06:34.395
either before or after chemo,

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.688
because you're going to be
throwing that up

00:06:36.712 --> 00:06:38.814
and you won't ever
want to look at it again.

00:06:38.838 --> 00:06:40.028
(Laughter)

00:06:40.052 --> 00:06:41.607
I learned that one the hard way.

00:06:42.292 --> 00:06:45.244
And then there were the tricks
for managing my workflow.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.477
I scheduled chemo for first thing
on a Monday morning.

00:06:49.171 --> 00:06:52.243
I knew that from the time
I left the cancer care unit,

00:06:52.267 --> 00:06:56.696
I had about four hours
before this fog screen would come down

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.560
and I would start to be sick.

00:06:58.863 --> 00:07:03.037
So I would use that time to clean my inbox
and make any urgent calls.

00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:07.882
The worst of the sickness would be gone
within about 48 hours.

00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:10.466
And then I would log back
into work from home.

00:07:12.053 --> 00:07:15.196
This treatment continued
and I knew what to expect.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.649
I was able to set reasonable expectations
with my business partners

00:07:18.673 --> 00:07:20.562
about what I could do

00:07:20.586 --> 00:07:22.778
and the time frames that I could do it in.

00:07:23.387 --> 00:07:27.418
But I still remember
the hesitation in their voices

00:07:27.442 --> 00:07:29.649
when it came to asking for things.

00:07:29.673 --> 00:07:32.498
And asking me to do things
by a certain time.

00:07:32.522 --> 00:07:34.516
And trust me, these were people

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.807
that were not afraid
of setting a good deadline.

00:07:36.836 --> 00:07:37.986
(Laughter)

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:42.014
I got the impression they didn't want
to put any extra pressure on me

00:07:42.038 --> 00:07:43.791
while I was going through treatment.

00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:46.522
And while I appreciated the sentiment,

00:07:46.546 --> 00:07:48.679
I actually needed the deadlines.

00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:51.839
To me, that was something
within my control

00:07:51.863 --> 00:07:54.807
and something
that could stay in my control

00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:56.990
when there were so many
things that couldn't.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.148
And as I was working from home,

00:08:00.172 --> 00:08:03.609
I was thinking about how employers
should be applying this concept

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:06.005
of reasonable adjustments
in our current age,

00:08:06.712 --> 00:08:10.014
where one in two Australian men and women

00:08:10.038 --> 00:08:13.204
will be diagnosed with cancer
by the age of 85.

00:08:13.815 --> 00:08:18.823
So, as we continue to work
longer and longer into older age,

00:08:18.847 --> 00:08:22.283
the chances of having a serious illness
while we're in the workforce

00:08:22.307 --> 00:08:23.457
are increasing.

00:08:24.584 --> 00:08:29.584
And with technology enabling us
to work anywhere, any time,

00:08:29.608 --> 00:08:33.401
reasonable adjustments
are no longer contingent upon

00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:36.318
whether or not you can continue
to physically make it

00:08:36.342 --> 00:08:38.228
into the physical office.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.522
Reasonable adjustments are also not about

00:08:41.546 --> 00:08:45.544
just offering a longer break
or a comfier chair to sit in,

00:08:45.568 --> 00:08:47.972
although those things might be good, too.

00:08:48.854 --> 00:08:50.164
At the very least,

00:08:50.188 --> 00:08:53.433
we need to be applying
the flexibility policies and strategies

00:08:53.457 --> 00:08:55.268
we've developed for other scenarios,

00:08:55.292 --> 00:08:58.535
like for people
with family responsibilities.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:04.331
But how can we ensure that people
are even having a conversation

00:09:04.355 --> 00:09:07.760
about what reasonable adjustments
might look like for them

00:09:07.784 --> 00:09:10.823
if a manager's first response is to say,

00:09:10.847 --> 00:09:14.427
"Oh no, don't come back to work
until you're better."

00:09:15.435 --> 00:09:17.133
And a light went on for me.

00:09:17.903 --> 00:09:19.975
It must be compulsory for managers

00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:23.236
to have to have these conversations
with their employees.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:26.133
And lessons from people like me,

00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:29.061
that have really benefited
from working through treatment,

00:09:29.085 --> 00:09:31.085
need to be more widely shared.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.934
And I thought about what could be done
to guide these conversations,

00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:39.561
and then an amazing
colleague of mine, Camilla Gunn,

00:09:39.585 --> 00:09:41.958
developed a "Working with Cancer" toolkit.

00:09:42.855 --> 00:09:46.482
The toolkit provides a framework
for those diagnosed,

00:09:46.506 --> 00:09:49.498
their managers, their carers
and their coworkers

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:53.358
to have conversations about cancer
and the work support available.

00:09:54.101 --> 00:09:56.510
Camilla and I have now been
to other organizations

00:09:56.534 --> 00:09:57.753
to talk about the toolkit

00:09:57.777 --> 00:10:00.364
and how it can help to guide through

00:10:00.388 --> 00:10:04.124
what, quite frankly, are otherwise
some pretty awkward conversations.

00:10:04.632 --> 00:10:08.551
And I'm pleased to say that the uptake
of the toolkit is increasing.

00:10:10.005 --> 00:10:12.545
So what should be
a manager's first response

00:10:12.569 --> 00:10:14.983
when somebody says that they're sick

00:10:15.007 --> 00:10:17.769
and they don't know
how it's going to impact their work?

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.688
It must be this:

00:10:20.712 --> 00:10:24.490
"To the extent that you
are able, and want to,

00:10:24.514 --> 00:10:26.847
we would love to work out
an arrangement for you

00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:28.957
to continue to work through treatment."

00:10:29.518 --> 00:10:33.446
We need to start positively engaging
people with serious illness

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.970
to keep them in the workforce,

00:10:35.994 --> 00:10:39.127
rather than paternalistically
pushing them away.

00:10:40.299 --> 00:10:44.344
I've told you my story
because I want you to know the benefits

00:10:44.368 --> 00:10:46.440
that working through treatment brought me.

00:10:46.836 --> 00:10:48.863
And I also want to change your perceptions

00:10:48.887 --> 00:10:51.330
if you think that somebody
going through treatment

00:10:51.354 --> 00:10:54.925
is just bored, frail and vomiting a lot.

00:10:55.784 --> 00:10:58.696
And yes, these things
were true some of the time,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.966
if not a lot of the time,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.411
but I was also determined
to push myself at work

00:11:03.435 --> 00:11:05.165
as much as I had always done.

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:10.236
And I was able to do that
because my employer gave me the choice.

00:11:11.307 --> 00:11:13.552
Most importantly, I'm telling you

00:11:13.576 --> 00:11:17.752
because while it's a seemingly
obvious choice to give someone,

00:11:17.776 --> 00:11:21.134
it's not one that is always
offered or encouraged.

00:11:21.158 --> 00:11:22.308
And it must be.

00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:24.833
Thank you.

00:11:24.857 --> 00:11:28.944
(Applause)
