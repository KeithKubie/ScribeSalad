00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the graph, we can talk about something called an Eulerian path.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is the path that starts off with some node on the graph, let's say A in this case.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And it moves along the edges from node to node,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
hitting every edge exactly once, and then ending it from node to the graph.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In this case, we have an Eulerian path that's started at A and ended with D.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Euler by the way was a famous mathematician, Leonhard Euler.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
He made a number of contributions to discrete math and ultimately, computer science.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Here's something that we can notice about a graph.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If it has a Eulerian path, notice what has to happen to all the nodes along the path.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Here's what we did in this example, we went from A to B, to D, to A, to C, to D.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now let's consider the degree of all the nodes in the graph.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
A has a degree of 3, B has a degree of 2, D has a degree of 3, and C has a degree of 2.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Notice that these nodes B and C, which were not either at the beginning or ending of the path,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the Eulerian path, have an even degree and that has to be.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What happens if all the nodes that are not in the beginning and ending nodes

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
have to had even degree because the path has to go in one edge and out another edge.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Every time that node gets passed through, 2 of the edges are visited,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and none of them are visited twice and none of them are skipped.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So it has to be that all these nodes that are intermediate on the path have even degree.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The beginning and ending nodes are different though.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If the path starts off at A and leaves A along one of the edges and that consumes one of those edges.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The beginning and ending nodes, A and D in this case, have to have odd degree

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
because, in addition to any times that the path moves through them and comes up the other side,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
it either leaves in the beginning or enters at the end without a corresponding other side.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Those have to be odd, all the other ones have to be even.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It turns out that this relationship is in "if and only if"--that is to say if the graph is connected

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and has exactly 2 odd degree nodes, then it has an Eulerian path, and if not, then it doesn't.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now, there is one exception to this. What if all of the nodes in the graph are even degree?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Let's take a quick look at a special case here.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Here is a graph with 5 nodes and the degree of all of the nodes is even--2, 4, 2, 4, and 2.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Can a graph like this with only even degree nodes have an Eulerian path?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
One possible answer is no, the start and the end edges of the path had to have odd degree,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
which is the ruling in this case, so it can't have an Eulerian path.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Another possible answer is yes, but it depends on the particulars of the graph in question.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Some graphs with only even degree nodes have Eulerian paths and some don't.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Another possibility is that the answer is yes, all such graphs do.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Any graph that's connected and has only even degree nodes

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
will have an Eulerian path in a particular form.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Another possible answer is yes, because all graphs do.

00:02:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You can't really have a graph that doesn't have an Eulerian path.
