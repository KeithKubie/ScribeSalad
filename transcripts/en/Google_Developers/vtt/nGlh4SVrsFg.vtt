[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.990
FILIP: Hello, everyone, and
welcome to the next episode

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.885
of "Flutter Boring Show."

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:11.760
I'm here with Andrew.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.462
Hi, Andrew.

00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:13.420
ANDREW: Hey, everybody.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.030
FILIP: Today, we'll talk about
how to make Flutter better

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.060
by the magic of bug reports.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.260
ANDREW: Yeah, the
key to progress.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.510
FILIP: So this is
actually something

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.470
that Eric, the manager of
Flutter, asked us to do.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.330
Actually, he just
asked, did you ever

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.870
show in the "Flutter Boring
Show" how to file a bug?

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.310
And I realized we didn't, and we
hit a bug last time, actually.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.830
But we figure, when we
were talking about slivers,

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.160
in that case, and when
we found that bug,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.460
we didn't just want
to stop doing slivers

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.680
and start filing bugs.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.220
So we just postponed it, and
then I filed the bug later.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.760
But I think it's a really good
thing to talk about, right?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.470
Because you do
make Flutter better

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.169
just by giving feedback
to the team and all that.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.960
ANDREW: Yeah, I heard
something interesting

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.650
that Eric said just sort
of off-hand the other day.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.150
He was like, software doesn't
work until people use it.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.980
It's important to the
success of Flutter

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.040
that people use it, and then
let us know how it's working.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.330
These bugs can often influence
not only quality but features.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.730
People submit feature
requests, too.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.690
They're very important
for the engineering team.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.680
FILIP: We both go to events
and talk to developers.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.660
And sometimes you
hear things that

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.500
should definitely be filed
as a bug and are not,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.410
just because people--

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.650
I'm not sure if it's going to
be worth it and so on and so

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.150
forth.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.500
It's going to be worth it.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.190
We promise.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.875
ANDREW: Yes.

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:56.750
People are listening.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.890
FILIP: Yes.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.720
That is to say, don't
be afraid to file bugs.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.130
Sometimes you don't have the
time to really go deep into it.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.700
It's better to have a bug
that is not completely ideal,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.980
but it's there, so the
team knows about it,

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.840
other than to have
no bug at all.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.400
Actually, I think you told
me that recently, I think,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.250
Ian was able to
kind of triangulate

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.430
an issue from, like,
three incomplete bugs.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.500
But because they
were there, even

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.170
though they weren't perfect,
they led them to fix an issue.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.260
OK, so that's the theory.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.730
Obviously, search first.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.640
There's many bugs
that are there.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.430
We might actually
even show it later.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.430
This episode is a how to
file a good bug for Flutter.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.800
I hear that Andrew
has hit a bug.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.510
ANDREW: I recently
ran into a bug.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.860
On my laptop here, I'm working
on Veggie Seasons, which

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.240
is a sample app up right now
at our sample repo, which

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.820
is flutter slash samples.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.630
And we're doing some work on it.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.210
We got our shots of
vegetables from the studio.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.120
We have some people here who are
photographers and actually took

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.640
pictures of vegetables
just for the sample.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.470
Thank you again to the retails.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.630
Those people are awesome.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.390
So it's a sample of
our Cupertino widgets,

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.130
which implement
the Cupertino spec.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.290
And while we were
working on search--

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.270
so up here, I have
a search thing.

00:03:44.355 --> 00:03:47.150
If I just wanted to see
asparagus, I can type that in.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.160
If I keep going here,
I can put in some text

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.660
and filter them all out.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.410
This is using a
Cupertino text field.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.314
And I noticed, you can
go in and select text.

00:03:57.314 --> 00:03:58.980
And I wanted to see
how that would work,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.802
and I ran into this.

00:04:00.802 --> 00:04:01.760
So it's a little thing.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.800
It's not little pop-up tool
tips for cut, copy, and taste,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.640
is it?

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.140
Paste.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.790
Must be paste.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.180
They aren't respecting the
safe area as they should.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.538
And so this is something
that the engineers working

00:04:18.538 --> 00:04:20.329
on Cupertino definitely
want to know about.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.620
This is something that must
have been a gap in the test

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.610
or something like that.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.570
So this is what
we should report,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.490
so they can know that
it's an issue and fix it.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.530
FILIP: OK, so yeah, let's do it.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.800
I'll just be talking along.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.800
But all of the work
will be done by Andrew.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.450
It goes to GitHub.com
slash Flutter for issues.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.570
ANDREW: Yes, so Cupertino
is part of Flutter,

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.960
the SDK itself.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.657
That's one of the packages
that comes with it built in.

00:04:48.657 --> 00:04:50.240
And so most of the
issues, by the way,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.990
are managed through
Flutter slash Flutter.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.350
Some of the things have
their own little bits,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.937
like the intelligent plugin
has its own issue tracker

00:04:57.937 --> 00:04:58.770
and stuff like that.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.702
But our samples
repo, for example,

00:05:00.702 --> 00:05:02.160
doesn't have its
own issue tracker.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.994
We actually ask people to file
them at Flutter slash Flutter.

00:05:05.994 --> 00:05:06.910
So let's come in here.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.790
And first, let's see if there's
an outstanding bug, which

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.190
I have actually not-- this
could be a very short episode.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.042
I actually haven't checked this.

00:05:17.042 --> 00:05:18.260
Let's see what we got.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
FILIP: OK, we're scrolling.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.370
Yeah, I don't think it's there.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.080
ANDREW: OK, thank you.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.900
FILIP: Good.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.858
ANDREW: It would have
been a very short episode

00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:37.900
if I hadn't checked that.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.108
So first thing, obviously,
check to see if somebody's

00:05:40.108 --> 00:05:41.000
filed a bug already.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.600
You can come in, and you can add
your bug report to an existing

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.575
one and say, hey, I ran
into this with this code.

00:05:47.575 --> 00:05:48.950
Here's my Flutter
Doctor outputs,

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.283
so you know what version I'm
using and things like that.

00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:52.520
That's one thing.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.940
FILIP: Also, tips
for finding bugs

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.620
is, obviously, error
messages, especially the part

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:08.030
which is the same
whatever you use.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.350
Some people will try
to search for things

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.620
that include the path in their
app, which obviously won't

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.390
find what you are looking for.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.840
But for example, if we
put in a text field,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.480
it's the same in every project.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.810
So that's helpful.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.890
And also, if you just
see a bug, and you

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.170
don't have anything to add--

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.220
can you open one of the bugs--

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.680
it's helpful to take
the first of the issues

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.330
here and add a reaction
to it with a thumbs up.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.830
We actually look at this.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.440
And the issues with
the most thumbs

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.514
up will kind of
have more attention.

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:57.680
ANDREW: The engineering
team, they can sort by that.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.480
Those are the ones that
people care about the most.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.521
They're going to get a
little bit more attention.

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:04.580
FILIP: Yeah, so whenever you
feel the need to say something

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.820
like plus-one, or me, too,
or I see this as well,

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.610
or what's happening,
just do a thumbs up,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.010
and it's going to be better.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.032
ANDREW: Yeah, especially
for feature requests.

00:07:16.032 --> 00:07:17.490
You see a feature
request for like,

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.440
oh, I wish there was
a widget to do this,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.305
or I wish this widget could
do this, something like that.

00:07:22.305 --> 00:07:24.680
If somebody has already posted
that, and you come in here

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.846
and it already exists,
definitely go in and be like,

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:27.590
yeah, me, too.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.250
That would help my app.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.545
I need that use case
covered as well.

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:34.920
But we don't have
an issue, so we

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.880
got to go over to yonder
new issue button over here.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.550
FILIP: And there's
three things--

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.900
difficulty installing.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.000
That's not it.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.690
I have a problem
with my Flutter app,

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.510
or I want help writing my app.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.280
Most of the time,
you will probably

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.637
click the button in the middle.

00:07:53.637 --> 00:07:54.970
ANDREW: In the middle one, yeah.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.890
So that's what we're having.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.950
A widget is buggy,
or it looks wrong.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.740
That's definitely
else right now.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.560
And so some of this
is filled out for us.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.620
FILIP: Please, don't
ignore the comments here.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.950
The comments tell you
exactly what to do.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.620
Let's go through
them one by one.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.050
So if you're looking
for support that we did,

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.860
steps to reproduce.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:32.940
So I think any good bug has a
repo case or something similar.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.739
So in our case, the repo
case is actually pretty--

00:08:37.739 --> 00:08:40.280
ANDREW: We have a guide for this
people could check out, too.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.216
FILIP: Oh, wow.

00:08:41.216 --> 00:08:42.049
Yeah, I didn't know.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:43.580
ANDREW: [INAUDIBLE] must
have put this together.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.800
So we also have a guide.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.714
We have video form
and guide form.

00:08:47.714 --> 00:08:49.130
A lot of this, I
think, is covered

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.819
in the comments within the bug
report tool itself in GitHub.

00:08:52.819 --> 00:08:54.860
But if you would like a
little more information--

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.210
FILIP: The crash log--

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:56.930
Nice.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.880
ANDREW: So this
is there as well.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.540
Now I've completely derailed
your train of thought

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.248
that you were on.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.910
I'm sorry.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.070
FILIP: No, this is good.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:08.570
So yeah, I was like, is this
a completely necessary video?

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.820
But no.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.070
So steps to reproduce--
in our case,

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.970
what's the steps to reproduce?

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.020
ANDREW: So that's
a good question.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.700
This isn't the biggest
app in the world,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.840
but this app has some structure
to it and things like that.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.370
And so I can say, like, I used
a Cupertino text field that

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.290
was near the top of the screen.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.630
And I can detail those steps.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.850
It might also potentially
be a good idea

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.770
to try and narrow
down this use case

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.960
and actually get code to
reproduce it in the bug report.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.920
Do you want to try that real
quick and see what we do?

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.090
FILIP: We could try that.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.930
To be clear, I think,
in this particular case,

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.560
this might not be
needed, unless someone

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.050
wants to write a test case,
which it would be very helpful,

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:55.550
I guess.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.270
So maybe, yeah.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.145
Maybe just to be super good
citizens, we can try that.

00:10:00.145 --> 00:10:01.520
ANDREW: I wonder
if we could just

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.480
take this widget out and just
use it on its own temporarily.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.860
So let's go into main here.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.660
Let's see if I can get this
to paste and copy here.

00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:22.560
FILIP: Oh, yeah.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.560
ANDREW: Let me come do that.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.760
I can just say, run app.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.290
And I'll give it Cupertino apps.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.450
This is a Cupertino widget.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.950
I definitely need that.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.939
Then I could just do home--

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:40.980
FILIP: As the search for?

00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:46.120
ANDREW: Yeah, let's try that
and just see what happens.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.250
This may just completely
crash and burn.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.820
And first, I'll have to restart,
which I recently found out

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.220
there is a key command for--

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.160
Command-Shift and Backslash.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.252
FILIP: Yep.

00:11:02.252 --> 00:11:04.715
I'm not sure if
that's on every--

00:11:04.715 --> 00:11:08.810
ANDREW: So that puts me in the
middle, but I still got it.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:09.810
FILIP: Yeah, OK, cool.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.394
So yeah, I think we can just--

00:11:11.394 --> 00:11:13.310
ANDREW: Let me see if I
can just nudge this up

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.247
to the top real quick.

00:11:15.247 --> 00:11:16.330
How am I going to do that?

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:23.350
I could do a medium-sized
box, something like that.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.130
FILIP: The easy way
would be column with one

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.290
of those things expanded.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.594
ANDREW: There you go.

00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:35.260
FILIP: Coulombs.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.718
ANDREW: I can't
even spell columns.

00:11:36.718 --> 00:11:38.790
Columbs-- we're measuring
electrons today.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:50.231
Yes, let's do children, and
that's an array, actually.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:58.760
Let's do another.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.684
I can expand it down here.

00:12:00.684 --> 00:12:02.100
Can I just do
expand it like that,

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.360
or does it need a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.350
FILIP: Oh, interesting.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.600
ANDREW: Finding new use cases.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.990
Everyone's favorite
default child--

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.011
container.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.560
Since I'm in run app itself--

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.834
helps to get the
right key command.

00:12:34.834 --> 00:12:36.900
There we go.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.539
FILIP: That might be
a little too wide.

00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:39.830
ANDREW: That might be too wide.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.000
Here.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.040
We'll put a little sized box in.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.420
FILIP: Well, actually, you
could put it into safe area

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:53.340
just to show that the whole
thing, it is in a safe area.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.572
ANDREW: That's a good point.

00:12:56.572 --> 00:12:59.030
FILIP: I mean, the column would
be in the safe area, right?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.710
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.090
I didn't realize that you
already had the size box.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.034
ANDREW: No, it's OK.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:15.210
I'll restart.

00:13:19.622 --> 00:13:22.850
Let's see if I can
still reproduce this.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.590
Cool.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:29.859
So now, we have our
significantly smaller--

00:13:29.859 --> 00:13:31.400
FILIP: Yeah, can
you get rid of that,

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.590
by the way, the
preferred orientation?

00:13:37.504 --> 00:13:38.920
ANDREW: Then we'll
definitely have

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.070
to restart this one more time.

00:13:45.854 --> 00:13:48.174
Cool.

00:13:48.174 --> 00:13:48.840
And there it is.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.587
OK, this isn't bad.

00:13:50.587 --> 00:13:52.170
This is still, like,
80 lines of code.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.440
But somebody can
take this one file,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.460
and throw it into an
empty Flutter project

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.880
and very quickly
reproduce this bug.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.160
We're talking to mostly
software engineers here.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.618
Everybody knows
how much that helps

00:14:06.618 --> 00:14:11.250
find the root cause of a problem
when there's no magic involved.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.834
So let's take this, then.

00:14:13.834 --> 00:14:15.750
Actually, let's just go
back to our bug screen

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.770
and see what we can do.

00:14:19.611 --> 00:14:20.860
This is just a comment, right?

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.665
So we can probably
take that out now.

00:14:22.665 --> 00:14:25.040
So steps to reproduce--

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.410
well, title.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:34.440
FILIP: Title-- you could
leave it as the last thing.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.830
Actually, it helps, because it
might help you find other bugs.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.495
ANDREW: Which apparently is
a new feature from GitHub.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.220
What do we call them, tool tips?

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:46.720
FILIP: Yeah.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.888
Safe area, OK, yes.

00:15:01.888 --> 00:15:05.080
ANDREW: There we go.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.860
And so that's our title.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.790
So steps to reproduce
is next, so we

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.360
can put in a brief description.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.840
FILIP: You brief description
was basically in the title,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.675
but yeah.

00:15:21.675 --> 00:15:22.550
ANDREW: Look at that.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.490
So I have this code.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.500
I'll move steps to reproduce
from there, because that's

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.060
where titles go--

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.960
at the top of things.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.210
Now, we can paste our code in.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.990
And then I can pull out--

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.514
some of these
imports aren't used,

00:15:40.514 --> 00:15:41.805
so just the first and the last.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.630
Shoot, I'm referencing
colors in here.

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:57.896
FILIP: Is it fine?

00:15:57.896 --> 00:15:59.020
ANDREW: It's probably fine.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.420
FILIP: I mean, you
don't need this,

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.293
right, the Veggie Seasons think
they won't have access to--

00:16:05.293 --> 00:16:07.610
ANDREW: Yeah, that is the
thing that they wouldn't.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.900
So this can come out.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.480
FILIP: That's another one.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.063
ANDREW: This is Dart
code, by the way.

00:16:18.952 --> 00:16:20.410
FILIP: Oh, you had
the color there.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:21.868
ANDREW: That's what
I was thinking.

00:16:21.868 --> 00:16:24.040
So if I comment
this out, then I'm

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.932
stuck with some colors
that don't work.

00:16:25.932 --> 00:16:34.907
But I can do this real quick,
like, a background gray.

00:16:34.907 --> 00:16:39.880
I can just pull
these out real quick.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.610
FILIP: Yeah, OK.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.210
So yeah, ideally,
you want as few lines

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.800
as possible, obviously.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.090
But you don't need to
stress it, I guess.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.580
Yeah, nice.

00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:07.460
ANDREW: There's an
active blue right here.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.240
Interesting all these
things that the iOS does.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.569
And our audience are like,
obviously those exist.

00:17:15.497 --> 00:17:16.961
I'll make this one black.

00:17:20.865 --> 00:17:22.567
FILIP: OK, let's try it.

00:17:22.567 --> 00:17:24.150
ANDREW: Yeah, I'm
actually making sure

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.050
that it still works.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.216
That's probably a good idea.

00:17:26.216 --> 00:17:27.280
So do a hard restart.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.490
Yeah.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.240
Thank God, it didn't work.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.400
FILIP: So you don't
need all that basically.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.880
ANDREW: Yeah, we'll go
ahead and paste this in.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.330
There we go.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.060
FILIP: So yeah, the
three double vectors,

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.930
I think, we don't
need to explain.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.495
ANDREW: Although those putting
the dart at the end of it--

00:17:47.495 --> 00:17:49.120
I don't know if that's
required or not.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:49.840
I always do it--

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.500
FILIP: Yeah, it'd be like--

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.490
ANDREW: --to be like a
little handling-- by the way,

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.360
this is Dart code.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.342
FILIP: Yes, yeah, so yeah.

00:17:54.342 --> 00:17:55.654
ANDREW: So we don't need this.

00:17:55.654 --> 00:17:57.070
We don't need any
of that anymore.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.240
FILIP: Cool.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.950
ANDREW: Don't need any of
this commented out code.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:03.910
There we go.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:04.670
FILIP: Cool.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.370
ANDREW: So now I've got
something that's all in one,

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.600
so it's completely
self-contained.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.140
And one of the
engineers can just

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.182
cut and paste it into a
project, see immediately

00:18:14.182 --> 00:18:15.140
what I'm talking about.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:15.681
FILIP: Right.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.790
So we have that.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:24.650
Now, the reason why they're
asking us for step by step is

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.860
often because-- especially
if you have an error,

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.520
they want to know
what to do, but--

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.120
yes, exactly.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:38.508
ANDREW: Now we have to actually
have some random characters.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.710
Highlight it.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.020
Helps to spell it correctly.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.942
Although that's
optional sometimes.

00:18:55.942 --> 00:18:56.900
And then what do we do?

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.260
So we-- can I clear this?

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.960
So we came in here,
we tapped on--

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.930
we added a bunch of characters.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:06.920
We double tapped,
and then that's it.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.180
FILIP: That's it, OK.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.970
And so at this point, especially
since this is a visual bug,

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:19.162
really, it's really helpful to
include a screenshot, which--

00:19:19.162 --> 00:19:19.870
ANDREW: Oh, yeah!

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.640
FILIP: --you can do.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:27.270
So yeah, I mean, because
as soon as someone

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.990
who does Cupertino widgets
sees that screenshot,

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.051
he will immediately
know what's going on.

00:19:32.051 --> 00:19:33.550
ANDREW: I should
mention I'm running

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.480
this on a device with a notch.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.430
FILIP: Ooh, yeah.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.115
Nice.

00:19:45.115 --> 00:19:47.310
ANDREW: What am I actually
using, just so I know?

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.976
FILIP: iPhone X?

00:19:47.976 --> 00:19:50.115
ANDREW: This is a XS Max.

00:19:50.115 --> 00:19:52.560
FILIP: Ooh!

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.905
Is it slower?

00:19:53.905 --> 00:19:56.335
ANDREW: 10S Max?

00:19:56.335 --> 00:19:57.460
Is that how you pronounce--

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:57.850
FILIP: I don't know.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.740
ANDREW: Because it was the
IPhone 10 instead the iPhone X,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.990
even though I called it the
X for, like, three months.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.390
FILIP: Yeah, I just
say X and that's it.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.580
OK, so-- doo, doo, doo.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.770
ANDREW: So we got that.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:09.790
And you were just
talking about--

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:10.230
FILIP: Screenshots.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.438
ANDREW: Taking a picture, OK.

00:20:11.438 --> 00:20:15.350
FILIP: Yes, so
make a screenshot.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.594
On a Mac, that's pretty easy.

00:20:16.594 --> 00:20:18.260
ANDREW: So we can
do-- what is up with--

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.530
FILIP: Command-Shift-4 and
then Space is my favorite.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.580
ANDREW: What's the one
where you get to connect--

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.579
you, like, draw the box
that you're cutting out.

00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:28.960
FILIP: That's Command-Shift-4.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.430
Command-Shift-4, yeah.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:35.190
But then if you do Space
now, just hover over it

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.355
and do [CLICKS TONGUE].

00:20:36.355 --> 00:20:39.120
ANDREW: Oh, and does that make--

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.856
FILIP: That will give you like a
screenshot of that window only.

00:20:43.856 --> 00:20:46.240
ANDREW: Does it go
to the file system?

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.055
FILIP: It goes to
the desktop for me.

00:20:49.055 --> 00:20:51.900
ANDREW: So I think one of
the other things, just to--

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.460
I think it's easier to
do from my keyboard.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.970
I think it's this one?

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.410
So Control-Shift-Command-4
will do it to the clipboard.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.640
FILIP: Oh!

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.691
ANDREW: And so we can
come in here and do this.

00:21:06.691 --> 00:21:08.466
FILIP: I didn't know that.

00:21:08.466 --> 00:21:13.600
ANDREW: And I think I can
come in and just go like that.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.540
FILIP: That's cool.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.435
ANDREW: I can't remember
who told me that.

00:21:17.435 --> 00:21:18.749
FILIP: Preview.

00:21:18.749 --> 00:21:20.540
ANDREW: So we've got
our nicely formatted--

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.380
FILIP: Yeah, nice.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.895
ANDREW: My, that's huge.

00:21:22.895 --> 00:21:24.840
FILIP: That's
normal, that's fine.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.928
ANDREW: OK.

00:21:25.928 --> 00:21:27.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.160
It's a very large bug.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.330
OK, so let's go back
into our Writes thing.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.910
FILIP: OK, yeah, and I
think you're basically done.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.950
I mean, if this was an error
again, we could do-- actually,

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:38.450
let's use--

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:39.830
ANDREW: Let's do Flutter
doctor real quick.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.340
FILIP: Yeah.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.900
ANDREW: Do you want to do that?

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.460
Always a good idea
to include this,

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.380
I feel, even if
they don't need it.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:44.580
FILIP: Yes.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.210
ANDREW: Nobody's ever sad
to see Flutter doctor.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.500
FILIP: I think dash v is
what they're asking for,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.370
just because it
gives you more info.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.652
ANDREW: We can do that too.

00:21:52.652 --> 00:21:53.890
FILIP: Is it--

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:54.800
ANDREW: Like that?

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.900
FILIP: Yeah, I think so.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.610
Yeah, OK, yeah.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.486
ANDREW: Bam!

00:22:02.486 --> 00:22:05.610
FILIP: All the
checkmarks, all good.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.590
Yeah, OK, so that's one.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.650
And I also want to
just show how to do

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:18.060
Flutter run verbose from an
ID, which is not completely

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:18.582
like some--

00:22:18.582 --> 00:22:19.290
ANDREW: OK, yeah.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:20.220
FILIP: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.460
So you have it there?

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.250
I mean, Flutter
actually is there?

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.460
So yeah, like, what
I would normally do

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.350
is just open a terminal and just
run Flutter around dash dash

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.500
verbose, right?

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.200
But if you don't
like terminals--

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.415
and I don't blame you--

00:22:35.415 --> 00:22:38.670
you just go to the run
configuration-- or debug

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.290
configuration actually.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.735
Which is I think over
here in the main like--

00:22:43.735 --> 00:22:46.110
ANDREW: Oh, you mean like in
here, in the configurations.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.401
FILIP: Yeah, add configuration.

00:22:47.401 --> 00:22:52.080
And just add additional
arguments dash dash verbose.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.180
I think that's
what it is, right?

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:54.940
ANDREW: Like that?

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.160
FILIP: Can you go
back to the Get Help?

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.010
Yeah, Flutter run verbose, yes.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.470
I think that's what it does.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.470
And now you always run verbose.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:08.580
But if you do like--

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.000
ANDREW: So I'd have to restart
this at this point, right?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.390
FILIP: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.140
ANDREW: We completely
restart the process.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.340
FILIP: See, and
you get all this.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.850
So I still recommend terminal.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:22.472
But if you prefer
this, that's great.

00:23:22.472 --> 00:23:23.430
And you can just like--

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:24.240
ANDREW: That is indeed verbose.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.880
FILIP: It is very
verbose, correct.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.180
So yeah, I think--

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.830
is there something
else that they are--

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.230
ANDREW: So let's go back
in-- so, we got to paste in--

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.910
FILIP: Yeah, I don't think in
this particular case anybody

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.365
is actually interested in locks.

00:23:40.365 --> 00:23:41.490
ANDREW: Yeah, not for the--

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.371
I don't think so.

00:23:42.371 --> 00:23:42.870
FILIP: Yeah.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.330
ANDREW: But I can always
put Flutter doctor

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.680
so everybody knows what
version of the SDK I'm using.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.770
FILIP: Yes, that's true.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.110
Oh, and Flutter analyze as well.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.760
So I think that-- yeah.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.220
Just to follow what they
want, the Flutter doctor

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.715
is at the end.

00:24:00.715 --> 00:24:01.820
ANDREW: Oh!

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.690
I messed up the--

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.128
FILIP: Yeah, it's here.

00:24:05.128 --> 00:24:08.044
ANDREW: OK.

00:24:08.044 --> 00:24:11.932
Let me just back all this up.

00:24:11.932 --> 00:24:12.880
FILIP: Yeah.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.560
ANDREW: I guess I'll take this
fake headline that I made out.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.390
FILIP: Yeah.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.170
That's where-- OK.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.170
ANDREW: There we go.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.900
Following the
instructions for the web.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.300
I don't think there's
anything here.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.510
FILIP: Yeah, no.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.970
ANDREW: Ooh!

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.135
Oh, because we just
pasted all the code in.

00:24:38.135 --> 00:24:38.680
FILIP: Right.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.050
ANDREW: And I'm in the middle
of implementing something

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.008
completely [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:42.008 --> 00:24:43.442
FILIP: Yeah, let's not.

00:24:43.442 --> 00:24:44.650
Just pretend there's nothing.

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:45.950
ANDREW: Yeah, let's do that.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.551
It is normally a good idea.

00:24:47.551 --> 00:24:48.050
FILIP: Yes.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:52.200
ANDREW: And to be honest,
you should always have--

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.440
you should always use analyzer.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.910
Where's my FA alias
that I use all the time?

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.870
It looks for Dart files
and then pipes them

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.370
into Flutter format, and then
Flutter Analyze after that.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.382
FILIP: Ooh, I'm not familiar.

00:25:05.382 --> 00:25:06.090
What do you mean?

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.048
ANDREW: Yeah, what is--

00:25:11.518 --> 00:25:12.946
FILIP: Oh, Flutter--

00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:14.015
ANDREW: FA, this one.

00:25:14.015 --> 00:25:15.420
FILIP: Flutter format
and Flutter analyze.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.780
ANDREW: I use this all the time.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.890
FILIP: Oh!

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:18.720
I like that, that you
have an alias for that.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.511
ANDREW: So it looks
for all the Dart files,

00:25:20.511 --> 00:25:22.630
pipes them in the Flutter
format using xargs,

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.285
and then after that--

00:25:25.285 --> 00:25:27.145
so they're all
formatted in place.

00:25:27.145 --> 00:25:29.020
And then after that, it
runs Flutter analyze.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.780
That's my last thing before
I try to commit code,

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:33.720
I run that alias.

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.000
FILIP: Do you have
Dart installed?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.090
Because what I do--

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.590
ANDREW: I installed Dart.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:48.550
I have the Dart SDK that
Flutter installs in its cache.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:52.940
FILIP: Oh, OK, so you don't--
yeah, because if at home,

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.820
you have Dart installed, you
just do Dart format, dot.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.100
And it will just go
through the whole directory

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.980
and will analyze and format
everything, which is cool.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.020
It's really cool.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.510
Anyway, but we're
on attention here.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.590
So I think we have that.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.980
So just some things to realize.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:19.840
So we did add a repo case.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.600
We did follow the instructions
that they gave us.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.150
One thing that actually
the Flutter community

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.400
is really good at--

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.270
but in general in open
source sometimes--

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.960
it's not that great is
the lack of emotions.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:44.980
Sometimes bug reports can have a
little bit of how could this be

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.240
and all this.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.770
So thank you, Flutter
community, for being awesome.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.580
And keep doing this.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.150
There is--

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.399
ANDREW: Should I go ahead
and submit this, by the way?

00:26:57.399 --> 00:26:59.480
FILIP: I'm just going
through a checklist here.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.770
So there is the
expected behavior,

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.420
which we did not include.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.310
In this case, I think it's all--

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.930
again, it's sort of obvious.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:13.790
But there is a reason why
people ask for it in bugs.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.840
Because sometimes it's
like, oh, this doesn't work.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.250
And you as a developer or
the developer of that tool

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:24.350
will be like, OK, so what did
you expect to happen, right?

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.260
So its expected
behavior is great.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:26.870
ANDREW: Yeah, because
every once in a while,

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.420
you run into
something that works,

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.045
but it doesn't work
in the way that you

00:27:30.045 --> 00:27:31.341
were intending to use it.

00:27:31.341 --> 00:27:31.840
FILIP: Yeah.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.090
ANDREW: And if you just
change up how you're using it,

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:34.976
it's fine.

00:27:34.976 --> 00:27:35.620
FILIP: Yeah.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.350
ANDREW: And sometimes that's
OK, and sometimes it's--

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.690
I haven't seen this come
up in the case of Flutter--

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.960
poor API design in other
things that I've seen before.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.904
Like, suddenly you
see bugs where just

00:27:45.904 --> 00:27:47.320
the API was designed
in such a way

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.300
that nobody really understands
how to use it properly.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:49.930
FILIP: Right.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.680
ANDREW: And so that
is a bug with the API.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.970
FILIP: Yes, yes.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:59.590
So more content is almost
always better than less.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:04.270
So if you're
undersized, just add it.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.940
Screenshots, videos, we
did, so that's great.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.140
Often, if you're
an engineer, you

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.890
will immediately jump to
solutions and diagnosis.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:23.260
And what works best always
impacts just the symptoms,

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.230
and then you can
add your diagnosis.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.030
But sometimes-- I do this a lot.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.990
I'm like, I think this
should be fixed by X.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.900
ANDREW: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.490
FILIP: Yeah, yeah, and
someone is like, ugh, no.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.480
So that's great.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:43.740
And I really like the
mongoose vs. antelope--

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.640
what do you call
it, like metaphor?

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.390
You don't know it?

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:46.920
ANDREW: No.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.180
FILIP: So apparently--

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.860
I don't know where I read it.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.620
But basically-- and I
do this all the time.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:58.750
If I find a bug, I
act as a mongoose.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.930
Like, I see something,
and immediately I

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.690
try to fix it in
many different ways.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:08.750
I Flutter clean everything
and do all these things.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.800
So I'm like a mongoose
that's attacked, right?

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.620
And the antelope-- what
it does if it's attacked,

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.470
or like if there is some
trouble, it freezes.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.180
So you should be an antelope.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.170
Like if something--

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:21.980
ANDREW: Like freezes or stops?

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.240
FILIP: OK, don't touch anything.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:30.400
Sometimes it's really helpful to
have your computer in the state

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.252
where it happened.

00:29:31.252 --> 00:29:31.960
ANDREW: Ah, yeah.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:36.550
FILIP: Because-- A,
you could basically

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:43.390
erase some of the stuff that the
implementer then needs to see.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.300
And sometimes actually
by trying to fix the bug

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.560
you will have another thing that
kind of counteracts the bug.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.650
But it actually doesn't
help, because either you

00:29:53.650 --> 00:30:01.000
don't report it then, or it's
just there's two levels of bugs

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.370
that need to be unrolled.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:07.780
So if something
doesn't work, kind of

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.820
assume that this is
a bug with Flutter

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.580
and report it before
trying to figure out stuff.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.340
OK, so that's great.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.190
Let's submit, I think.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.514
If you are happy, I'm happy.

00:30:22.514 --> 00:30:25.050
ANDREW: And we should talk
about what happens to a bug

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:25.860
after this.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.930
But real quick before
we move on, I also--

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.010
this has come up
a couple of times

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.676
when I've talked to
people just randomly

00:30:30.676 --> 00:30:32.610
at talks and things like that.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.972
There are people who
feel reluctant to file

00:30:34.972 --> 00:30:37.305
a bug because they just assume
it's their fault somehow.

00:30:37.305 --> 00:30:38.420
FILIP: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.994
ANDREW: And I should make
clear, the engineering team--

00:30:40.994 --> 00:30:42.660
they really want bug
reports, because it

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.857
helps them make the SDK
better, makes Flutter better

00:30:46.857 --> 00:30:47.440
for everybody.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:53.190
But also, Flutter-- I mean,
everybody on Flutter--

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.400
and I've seen in the
community for the most part--

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.160
they're not jerks.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.460
Like I've filed bad bug reports
before that were my fault.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.100
I've posted emails
to the Google group

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.039
before where it was
clearly like I'm

00:31:04.039 --> 00:31:06.330
the only one in the room that
doesn't understand what's

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:06.860
going on.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.570
That's happened to me.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.850
And people were very patient
and very nice about it.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.350
No one is going to jump on
your bug report and be like,

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.560
oh, you're stupid, you should
have just done this and this,

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.476
and you would have worked
around this problem.

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:20.220
That is not going
to happen to anybody

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.310
that submits a bug report.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.000
So if you run into something--

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.490
and especially if you take the
steps to isolate it and give

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:30.180
a good bug report, people
will react with appreciation,

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.070
even if it ends up not being
a problem with the SDK itself.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.350
They're still going to be
glad that you came to them.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:39.310
So don't be afraid to file one.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.310
FILIP: Yeah, cool.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.580
So we have our bug.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.740
Let see what other
things we have in GitHub

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.289
that people might
like to look at.

00:31:49.289 --> 00:31:50.080
ANDREW: Yeah, sure.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.310
FILIP: So that's Issues, there's
Code, obviously, Pull Requests,

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.642
Projects-- what's projects?

00:31:54.642 --> 00:31:55.350
ANDREW: Oh, yeah.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.370
So Projects-- I think we talked
about a little of this before.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.170
This came up during
the Ask Flutter

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:05.180
part of the Q&amp;A a little bit.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.570
But you know, Flutter
is open source.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.180
It's also developed in the
open for the most part.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.360
Like almost everything
that's going on with Flutter,

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.670
you can find people
working on GitHub.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:19.412
And that includes project
planning for a lot of stuff.

00:32:19.412 --> 00:32:21.620
So Cupertino Table View
right now is being worked on.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.150
That's another Cupertino
widget that's coming along.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.050
And so you can come
in here and say, OK, I

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:30.420
want to know what's the progress
of this, and here it is.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.310
These are the issues
where the team

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.890
is tracking what's going on.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:39.630
So it looks like there are a
few widget work features that

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.480
are still being done over here
in edit mode, some reordering

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.154
stuff.

00:32:43.154 --> 00:32:45.570
He's got some other tasks--
this looks like Matt's the one

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.597
working on it--

00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:48.180
about getting into
the Flutter gallery

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.830
so people can see it there,
and it's a good way to test it.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.170
But if you're ever curious
what people are working on

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.040
or anything like that, you can
come into this projects page

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.570
and get a good handle on it.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.590
FILIP: Yeah, I like--

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:02.370
ANDREW: Hierarchy is up here.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.720
FILIP: Yeah, I like how if
you just look at issues--

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.500
right, like you have a bunch
of issues that are just

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.660
unstructured, this
is the structured way

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.780
of how the Flutter team
sees the work ahead.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.259
So I think that's
really cool to look at.

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:17.550
ANDREW: Yeah, and so this
looks like some tooling stuff

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.710
that Greg's working on.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.980
Some of these like
speed up pub get

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.750
in bots is just like
testing framework

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.120
stuff that the average person--

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.761
I never have to think about
that you, because Greg does it.

00:33:32.761 --> 00:33:33.635
But it's still there.

00:33:33.635 --> 00:33:35.290
You can still come in and--

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:36.955
(LAUGHING) even
individual engineers

00:33:36.955 --> 00:33:38.330
just have their
little task list.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:41.450
Like this is [? Jiao's ?] stuff.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:46.775
He's working on a bunch of
Cupertino things, and so on.

00:33:46.775 --> 00:33:50.120
FILIP: Cool, so
that's projects here.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.660
That, I think, is a
good segue to Dart lang.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.710
ANDREW: Oh yeah.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:59.692
FILIP: So we have
Flutter, GitHub, Repo,

00:33:59.692 --> 00:34:00.650
which is about Flutter.

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:08.030
But obviously, Flutter is a big
customer of Dart, and of all--

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.620
you write Dart.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:14.900
And so many of the things that
might be either buggy, or you

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.870
want some features added are
actually Dart feature and not

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:20.159
Flutter features.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.859
So if you go to the Dart lang--

00:34:22.859 --> 00:34:23.900
ANDREW: Oh, that's right!

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.320
I was looking at
the language funnel.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.710
FILIP: Yeah, the
language funnel.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.500
So in general, just
the Dart lang org

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.679
is where the SDK lives,
where all the things like,

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:36.639
for example, Dart code
formatting, that start

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:42.530
style, the actual test
that Flutter is building

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:45.290
upon with their test framework.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.940
So all this is
there, and you can

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.580
definitely-- that
team is as open as far

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.770
in terms of features.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.630
But they also have
in their language,

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:58.580
which is where they are
designing the Dart language.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.620
They have projects there.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.990
So these are all markdown files.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:05.960
But if you go to
projects, you will

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.554
see what they are looking at.

00:35:07.554 --> 00:35:08.345
ANDREW: The funnel.

00:35:08.345 --> 00:35:10.460
FILIP: And it's
called the funnel.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.680
And I like this,
because basically, it

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.590
goes from left to right, from
being discussed all the way

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.820
to ready for implementation.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.960
And again, it's a
more structured view

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:25.910
of what's coming, and I think--

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.484
ANDREW: And so this is like
the being discussed column

00:35:28.484 --> 00:35:29.400
over here on the left.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.960
And so this is the stuff that
may be part of Dart some day,

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.092
or might not be, you know?

00:35:35.092 --> 00:35:36.550
Like multiple return
values, that's

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.885
something that-- like
Python has multiple returns

00:35:39.885 --> 00:35:40.760
and things like that.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.082
But maybe that fits Dart,
maybe it does not fit Dart.

00:35:43.082 --> 00:35:44.540
FILIP: I think a
lot of people will

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.740
be interested in the second
column, first thing--

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.905
sound non-nullable types
with incremental migration.

00:35:50.905 --> 00:35:51.760
ANDREW: Yep.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:57.950
FILIP: Yeah, so if you want
to be part of spec-ing this,

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.450
then jump in.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:00.890
ANDREW: Yeah, or just--

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:01.941
be one of these thumbs.

00:36:01.941 --> 00:36:02.690
FILIP: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:03.690
ANDREW: You can come
in-- and we were

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.120
talking about feature
requests for Flutter.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.494
It certainly
applies to Dart too.

00:36:06.494 --> 00:36:09.200
If you see something in here,
you can come in and say like--

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.210
even just yes, I vote on this.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:12.650
This is important to me.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:14.960
And you can also come in
and comment, and be like,

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.470
here's some code
I wrote recently.

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.400
And I would love it if it looked
like this instead, something

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.180
like that.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.130
FILIP: Yeah, that could
be another episode

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:26.860
of like how to write good
language feature requests.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.840
Anyway, OK, so that's that.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.080
And the last thing we could
talk about is pull requests.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.820
So obviously, there's a lot
of work involved in just

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.800
creating a good bug report.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.736
And you're distracting the
audience by reading this.

00:36:42.736 --> 00:36:43.360
ANDREW: I know.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:43.760
I'm so--

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.801
FILIP: (LAUGHING) And me.

00:36:44.801 --> 00:36:47.330
ANDREW: I can't wait for
spread collections to make it.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.585
FILIP: Yeah.

00:36:49.585 --> 00:36:54.020
So if it looks like a good and
easy fix, don't be afraid to,

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.240
again, create a PR.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.217
We have a lot of external
contribution in Flutter.

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.680
ANDREW: Oh, yeah.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.760
FILIP: So that's cool.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:09.420
And if you just want to tip your
toes into Flutter development,

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.420
as in like the Flutter SDK
development, search for easy

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.290
fix.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.600
That's a filter
that the team adds

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.580
to things that should be pretty
easy, even for a third party

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:26.390
or for someone who's not super
familiar with the Flutter code

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:27.860
to fix.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.446
So I recommend it.

00:37:30.446 --> 00:37:32.879
ANDREW: Yeah, sample code
for popular API docs.

00:37:32.879 --> 00:37:35.420
That's definitely something that
somebody can come in and do.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.300
Whereas, I isolate termination
to terminate all isolates--

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.340
FILIP: Yeah, well, for
Chinmay it's an easy fix.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.740
ANDREW: Yeah.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.080
FILIP: Anyway, so
yeah, thank you.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.310
I mean, unless you have
other things to add?

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:53.810
ANDREW: No, I'm just--

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:56.110
yeah, you can check to see
if anybody's assigned to it

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:56.818
or working on it.

00:37:56.818 --> 00:38:01.805
You can check to see the
comments that people have left

00:38:01.805 --> 00:38:02.930
on it and things like that.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:05.150
And it's a good
way to get started.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.490
FILIP: Yeah.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:12.410
So the main message, filing
good bugs is a skill.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:13.776
And don't be afraid to do it.

00:38:13.776 --> 00:38:14.900
ANDREW: An important skill.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.840
FILIP: And an important skill.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.380
Thank you.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.380
We'll see you next time.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:19.996
ANDREW: Yep.

00:38:19.996 --> 00:38:20.620
Bye, everybody.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.370
