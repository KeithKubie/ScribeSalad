00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.500
Fill in the blanks to form
a system of linear equations

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.579
in the variables x and y with
infinitely many solutions.

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:10.620
So you're going to have
infinitely many solutions

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.510
if essentially both
of these equations

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.450
are describing the same line.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.200
If they're both essentially
the same equation,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.520
they are the same constraint.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.660
And we can graphically
imagine that.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.790
Let's say that that's our
y-axis, and this is our x-axis.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.460
And we could even try to
graph this right over here.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.380
If we were to put this
into slope-intercept form,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.310
you would have 5y is
equal to 2 minus 4x.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.670
And then if we divide both sides
by 5, you get y is equal to--

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.900
and I'll swap these--
negative 4/5 x plus 2/5.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.790
So this line up here is going
to look something like this.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.260
It's y-intercept is at 2/5.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.410
And it's going to have
a negative 4/5 slope.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.160
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.420
So that's what the
line looks like.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.680
So we're going to get an
infinite number of solutions

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.810
for the system.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.020
If the second line,
if when we graph it,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050
is essentially the
exact same line,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.760
it overlaps at
every x and y that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.960
satisfy the first equation.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.460
Now, the easiest way to think
about what these blanks should

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.600
be is, well, how do
I fill in the blanks

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.420
here so it is really just a
direct algebraic manipulation

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.140
of this first equation?

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.810
And we have a clue here.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.490
On the right-hand side of the
first equation, we have a 2.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.620
On the right-hand side of the
second equation, we have a 4.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.200
So if we want a direct
algebraic manipulation, clearly

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.095
on the right-hand side,
you have multiplied by 2.

00:01:41.095 --> 00:01:42.970
And if you want this to
be the same equation,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.720
you have to do
that to both sides.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.130
So let's multiply
both sides by 2.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.740
So 4x times 2 is 8x.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.450
5y times 2 is 10y.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.100
So this equation
and this equation

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.890
are the exact same constraint.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.150
They represent the
exact same line.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.770
They have an infinite
number of solutions.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.520
Let's do another example.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.729
Which of the following
choices of a will result

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.790
in a system of linear
equations with no solutions?

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.840
So you're going to have
no solutions as if you

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.970
take the same
combination of x and y's,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.222
but you get to a
different number.

00:02:22.222 --> 00:02:23.680
Or another way of
thinking about it

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.263
is if you plotted
this equation and it

00:02:25.263 --> 00:02:29.140
had the exact same slope, but
it had a different y-intercept.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.800
So let's think
about it both ways.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.280
So first, let's try to
algebraically manipulate

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.450
the second equation so that
the left-hand side looks

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.744
exactly the same as the
left-hand side up here.

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:42.160
And then we just
have to make sure

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.640
that the right-hand
side is different.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.240
And then you will
have no solutions.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.500
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.710
So it looks pretty close.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.220
If we multiply the left-hand
side by a negative 1,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.690
it's going to look just like
the left-hand side over here.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.440
So let's do that.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.960
Let's multiply the left-hand
and the right-hand side

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.780
by negative 1.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.370
So it's essentially
the same equation.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.700
So negative 6x times
negative 1 is positive 6x.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.090
7y times negative 1 is minus 7y.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.100
And a times negative
1 is negative a.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.990
So notice, now on the
left-hand side we have the same

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.820
combinations of x's and y's.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.740
We have 6 x's minus 7 y's.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.065
If on the right-hand side these
two things were to be equal,

00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:28.940
then we'd have the
scenario that we just saw.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.740
We would have the
exact same line.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.837
If negative a was equal to 4,
we would have the same line.

00:03:33.837 --> 00:03:34.920
So let me write that down.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.085
If negative a is
equal to 4, then we

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:41.085
are dealing with the same
line/equation/constraint.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.920
And like the
previous scenario, we

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.790
would have an infinite
number of solutions.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.252
On the other hand, if
negative a is not equal to 4,

00:04:00.252 --> 00:04:01.960
then there's no way
that there's anything

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.140
that will satisfy both of them.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.485
Here you're saying
that whatever your x is

00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:06.735
and whatever your y is, take
6 of the x's and subtract

00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:08.170
7 of the y's, and you get 4.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.250
If here you take 6 of
the x's and subtract 7

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.440
of the y's and you get
a different number,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.898
then there's never
going to be an x

00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:15.610
and a y that satisfy
both of them.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.290
So if negative 8
is not equal to 4,

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.180
then you're going to
have no solutions.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.900
Or another way of saying this is
if a does not equal negative 4,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.321
obviously, if a is
equal to negative 4,

00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:31.070
then negative a is
going to be equal to 4.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.560
So as long as a is not
equal to negative 4,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.940
you're going to
have no solutions.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.100
So a can be any number
except for negative 4.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.730
Now, another way
to think about this

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.720
is to put them both in
slope-intercept form.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.900
And you'll see that they'll
have the same slope.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.880
And then you would
just want to have

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.450
them have different
y-intercepts.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.630
And they're going to be parallel
lines that don't overlap.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.850
So this top one right over
here, if we subtract 6x

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.070
from both sides,
you get negative 7y

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.150
is equal to negative 6x plus 4.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.510
Divide both sides by negative 7.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.800
You get y is equal
to 6/7 x minus 4/7.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.220
So that's this first one
right up here written

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.721
in slope-intercept form.

00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:21.220
Now, the second
one, I'll just start

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.690
with exactly what they gave us.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.110
Let me add 6x to both sides.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.710
So this is the second one.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:34.580
So if I add 6x to both sides,
I get 7y is equal to 6x plus a.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.520
And then if I divide
both sides by 7,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:43.110
I get y is equal to
6/7 x plus a over 7.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.360
So notice in slope-intercept
form, our first equation

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.170
looks like that.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.280
And in terms of a, our second
equation looks like that.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.570
So they definitely already
have the same slope.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.720
They have the exact same slope.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.662
If a is equal to
negative 4, then these

00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:05.370
are going to be the
exact same equations.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.411
They're going to have the
exact same y-intercept.

00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:09.940
You're going to have an
infinite number of solutions.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.820
On the other hand, if a is
anything other than negative 4,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.180
you're going to have a
different y-intercept.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.609
And these two things are
just going to be parallel.
