00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.969
Let's start with a brief overview of Software

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.000
Defined Networking, or SDN. We'll first start by

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.690
defining SDN, and in particular we'll talk about

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.330
what is a Software Defined Network, then well

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.700
talk about what are the advantages of SDN

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.350
over a conventional network architecture. We'll overview the

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.200
history of SDN, the infrastructure that supports it,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.870
in particular how SDNs are designed and built and

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.160
the applications of SDN. Specifically, what they can

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.000
be used for and how they can be

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.710
used to simplify various network management tasks. Perhaps

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.920
the best way to understand what an SDN

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.220
is Is to compare it to the behavior

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.160
of today's networks. Today's networks have two functions.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.090
The first is the Data Plane, whose task

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.450
it is to forward packets to their ultimate destination.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.990
But in order for the Data Plane to work,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.300
we also need a way of computing the state

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.390
that each of these routers has that allows the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.450
routers to make the right decision in forwarding traffic to

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.430
the destination. The state that lives in each of

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.190
these routers that allows the routers to make these

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.430
decisions about how to forward packets are called routing

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.920
tables. It's the job of the network's Control Plane to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.620
compute these routing tables. In conventional networks, the Control

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.900
and Data Plane both run on the routers that are distributed across the network.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.530
In an SDN, the Control Plane runs in a logically centralized controller.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.210
Additionally, the controller typically controls multiple

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.230
routers across the network and often,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.470
the control program exerts control over all

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.620
the routers in the network, thus facilitating network-wide

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.920
control. These two characteristics are the defining

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.790
features of a Software Defined Network. The separation

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.750
of data and control allows a network

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.640
operator to build a network with commodity devices,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.670
where the control, resides in a separate control

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.490
program. This re-factoring allows us to move from

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.370
a network where devices are vertically

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.390
integrated making it very tough to innovate

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.170
to a network where the devices have open interfaces that can be controlled by

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.800
software. Thus, allowing for much more

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.430
rapid innovation. Let's survey a brief history

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.250
of SDN. Previous to 2004, configuration was

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.070
distributed, leading to buggy and unpredictable behavior.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.960
Around 2004, we had the idea to control the network from

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.860
a logically centralized high level program. That logically centralized

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.920
controller focused on the border gateway protocol, and was called the routing

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.990
control platform, or RCP. In 2005, researchers

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.669
generalized the notion of the RCP for different planes. The decision

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.750
plane which computed the forwarding state for

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.515
devices in the network, the Data Plane,

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:06.754
which forwarded traffic based on decisions made

00:03:06.754 --> 00:03:10.062
by the decision plane. And the dissemination and

00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:13.527
discovery planes, which provide the decision plane

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:16.145
the information that it needs to compute

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:19.610
the forwarding state, which ultimately gets pushed

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.856
to the data plane. Around 2008, these concepts

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:25.409
effectively hit the mainstream, through a

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.755
product called OpenFlow. OpenFlow's intellectual roots are

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:33.823
with the RCP and 4D. But OpenFlow

00:03:33.823 --> 00:03:37.267
has made practical when merchant silicon vendors

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:40.137
open their APIs, so that switch chipsets

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:43.860
could be controlled from software. So suddenly

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.960
there was an emergence of cheap switches that were build based on open chip

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.620
sets that could be controlled from

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.860
software. This development effectively allowed us

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.080
to decouple the control plane and

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.080
the data plane in commodity switching hardware.
