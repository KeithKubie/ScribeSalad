JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hello,
and welcome to

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.340
YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.350
We have an exciting show
for you today.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.120
We'll talk about developer
experience and getting started

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.490
with the YouTube API.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.420
But first, let me introduce
my esteemed guests today.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.830
In the studio, I have
Fred Sauer.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.560
How you doing, Fred?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.190
FRED SAUER: Hi, how
are you, Jarek?

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.470
Thanks for having me today.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.790
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Doing good.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.790
Today's my birthday, so this is
a very special show for me.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.160
FRED SAUER: Excellent.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.280
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And
then Daryl Chang,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.810
how you doing, Daryl?

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.299
DARYL CHANG: Hi, good,
how are you?

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.330
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
I'm doing good.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.320
Daryl, as you might remember,
has guest starred in one of

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.180
our shows a few weeks ago,
live from New York.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.310
He's our intern, going back
to Stanford very soon.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.690
But before we let you go, Daryl,
we need to talk about

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.170
your awesome project.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.120
So my name is Jarek
Wilkiewicz.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.310
I work for YouTube Developer
Relations.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.120
Let's talk about the motivation
of this project,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.050
maybe starting with you Fred,
I know you've been busy

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.980
working on Cloud Playground.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.660
Tell us what it is and
what problem are

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.320
you trying to solve?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.590
FRED SAUER: So I've been a
developer advocate on the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.300
Cloud Platform for
many years now.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.850
And consistently, the feedback I
get from developers who have

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.410
been on the platform building
applications, that they're

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.320
very happy with the features
and the capability and just

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.340
how easy it is to manage their
applications at scale.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.300
But it turns out when developers
first get started,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.960
there's an initial hurdle of
just getting Hello World up

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.740
and running.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.810
When all the tools are
unfamiliar, when you're

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.650
working on a new platform,
that's when

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.290
it's really the hardest.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.840
And if you liken it to a
relationship, it seemed like

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.090
we were asking developers to
invest heavily first, download

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.020
an SDK, download a runtime, get
your laptop set up, and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.630
then you can try it out
and fall in love.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.130
And I thought, maybe let's
turn it around.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.060
Let's go on a date first.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.700
Let's try it out, get a chance
to fall in love, and then do

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.750
the rest of the stuff.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.480
So the Cloud Playground is
a way to start building

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.320
applications, small Hello
World, guestbook-type

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.850
applications right from
your web browser--

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.600
zero downloads, zero installs,
just get going.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.905
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And fall in
love at the first sight.

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:06.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.870
FRED SAUER: Absolutely.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.570
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
This is great.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.460
Well, Daryl, I know you've
been working with that.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.110
And I was thinking perhaps
instead of talking about the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.810
project, maybe you could
give us a quick

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.210
demo of what it does.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.980
DARYL CHANG: Yeah, sure.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.910
So this summer, I've been
working on the Cloud

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.370
Playground embed for the
developer's site.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.590
So why don't we go to the
developer's site right now?

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.450
So in the developer's site, we
have static code examples that

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.730
demonstrate how to use
different APIs.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.110
And with the Cloud Playground
embed, now we can interact

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.600
with these different code
samples and run and modify the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.400
code within your browser.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.310
For example, right now, we're
on the YouTube Data API for

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.190
Python for App Engine.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.590
And you can see that this code
sample for Search by Keyword

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.090
has a button in the
top right corner.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.450
If you click this Run/Modify
button, you'll be able to

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.120
interact with this
sample code.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.130
It loads the Cloud
Playground embed.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.880
And you can see that there's
a code editor

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.120
and an output container.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.260
Now, in order to need to correct
output, you need to

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.860
set up a project and get
your API access key.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.590
So click this link here and
follow the instructions.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.040
Why don't we roll the video
to see how to do that?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.330
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.060
-In this segment, we'll be
talking about how to obtain a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.780
developer key to make YouTube
API calls and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.570
run the sample code.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.920
To do this, we'll need a
registered Google account.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.605
The first thing we want
to is browse at

00:03:28.605 --> 00:03:30.320
a Google API console.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.320
We can find this at
code.google.com/apis/console.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.900
Or we can just search for Google
API console in our

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.120
favorite search engine.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.780
We'll need to create
a project the first

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.970
time we open the site.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.830
Projects are groupings of APIs,
and it may make sense

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.020
for us to create different
projects for every new

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.000
application that we write.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.960
For running the sample code, we
only need one project and

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.610
one set of API keys.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.750
After we enable our project,
we'll need

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.050
to enable some services.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.060
Let's click through to the
Services menu if we're not

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.500
already on this page
and scroll down.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.000
We'll want to enable the YouTube
Data API and the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.710
YouTube Analytics API first.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.779
Let's toggle the YouTube Data
API from Off to On.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.870
The very first time we do this,
we'll be presented with

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.520
the Terms of Service.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.120
We'll want to read the Terms
of Service and Accept if we

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.510
want to be able to
use the API.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.430
Now, when we scroll down, we'll
see that the YouTube

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.735
Data API has been accepted
and enabled.

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.530
We'll click On to also enable
the YouTube Analytics API.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.590
The Search by Topic code sample
requires the use of

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.310
Freebase API, so we'll need
to enable that, as well.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.320
There's a separate Terms of
Service that we'll need to

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.570
read and accept.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.320
Once this is done, we'll need
to access our API keys.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.790
We can do this by clicking API
Access in the navigation menu.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.910
There are two types
of API access--

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.410
simple and authorized.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.260
If all we want to do is search
for videos, channels, and

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.630
playlists, all we need
is simple API access.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.600
The key is already provided
to us in our project.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.500
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.717
DARYL CHANG: All right, so going
back now to the Cloud

00:05:34.717 --> 00:05:38.770
Playground embed, all we need to
do is to Copy and Paste the

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.110
API access key to where
it says Replace Me.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.820
Now that we've done that, we
can make the API call.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.970
And all we have to do
is click the Run

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.220
button to see the output.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So what's
happening right now is the

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.730
code that you modified, luckily
within the editor,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.180
gets sent over to the app
engine, executed, and then you

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.390
see the results, right?

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.860
And this is happening against
the API key that you have

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.240
configured in the
previous step.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.060
DARYL CHANG: Right, exactly.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.480
So you can see the output here,
which is in iframe of

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.070
the deployed App Engine site.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.670
And we can see that we get
results for the query term

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.900
"dog" using the Search
by Keyword API.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.790
Now, let's say that
you want to make a

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.480
modification to the code.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.080
All we have to do is make the

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.810
modification in the code editor.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.850
So Jarek, let's say you want to
change the query term "dog"

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.450
to "cat" instead.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.930
All we have to--

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.380
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sounds
fun to me.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.860
DARYL CHANG: --do is make the
modification and press the

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.160
Play button.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.900
And again, this is redeploying
the site.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.795
And now we should see the
results for the keyword "cat"

00:06:50.795 --> 00:06:59.040
instead of "dog." And as you can
see here, videos for cat.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.340
Let's say that you don't like
the modifications you made,

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.930
and you want to go back to the
original sample code that we

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.440
had on the site.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.130
All we have to do is click
the Reset Project button.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.670
And it'll reset the project to
the original sample code.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.620
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So if I made
a mistake, because I don't

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.100
know Python well,
I could easily

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.730
recover by hitting Reset.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.260
DARYL CHANG: Exactly.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.500
So any mistakes you've made,
anything you don't like, just

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.720
hit the Reset Project button,
and you'll be fine.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.300
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.420
DARYL CHANG: And let's say you
do like the modifications you

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.990
made, and you want to continue
developing locally.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.450
All we have to do is click the
Zip button to download the

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.990
project as a zip file.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.340
So as you we see here, I've
gotten the project as a file,

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.590
and I can continue developing
locally.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.250
But you have to remember that
you have to download the App

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.440
Engine SDK and any other
necessary files in

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.250
order to run it.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.620
So that's a quick demo of what
the Cloud Playground can do on

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.170
the dev site.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.410
And I hope that helps developers
get started with

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.140
API calls more easily.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Absolutely.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.490
Well, thank you very much
running the demo.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.520
I would like to talk a
little bit more about

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.400
what's under the hood.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.380
And Fred, I know you've been
working a lot on this project.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.780
Tell us a little more
of what happens.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.650
How does this all work?

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.940
FRED SAUER: Well, the Cloud
Playground, as Daryl was

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.080
showing us, consists
of two parts.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.350
The top half of the Cloud
Playground is a sort of a mini

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.720
development environment.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.790
You can edit text files.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.240
There's actually a way to
manipulate projects.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.820
And there's nothing really
special about this

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.360
application.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.130
It's just a way of maintaining
files in the cloud.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.429
They actually are maintained in
the App Engine Data Store,

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.480
and every project has a unique
set of files, which are the

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.450
source code, the sample code,
that you're looking at.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.250
What's really interesting is
the bottom half of the user

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.510
interface, which is an iframe
that's embedded into the main

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.550
user interface.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.880
And when you press the blue Play
button, what we do is we

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.770
go out to App Engine, and based
on the URL, there's a

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.700
project ID in the URL.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.340
And we use that to grab all
the files that you've been

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.060
modifying and keeping
up to date.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.540
And we eval them at run time.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.880
And the server figures
out the results.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.100
In this case, the sample code
is calling a YouTube API.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.730
So we call the actual production
YouTube APIs, and

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.076
we get the results sent
back, and we send

00:09:21.076 --> 00:09:22.940
them back to the client.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.010
And so what we have is sort of
an App Engine app running on

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.750
top of an App Engine app.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.640
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Mm-hm.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.440
FRED SAUER: It's a little bit,
maybe, recursive and sometimes

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.170
messes with your mind
a little bit.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.240
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.280
FRED SAUER: But luckily, when
you use the Cloud Playground,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.510
you don't have to think
about this.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.170
You can think about it as you're
just writing some code

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.120
on App Engine that runs.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.030
And then when you're ready to
go to the full experience,

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.360
when you think, this date went
pretty well, and now I want to

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.320
take this relationship with App
Engine a step further, you

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.410
can download the SDK and the
Python runtime, if you don't

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.550
have one installed.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.960
You can run this locally, and
then you can deploy it to

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.360
production, and you have
a real production app.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.930
And then whenever you like,
you can come back to the

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.950
playground and maybe try
something else out.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.140
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great, well,
this is really exciting.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.440
So Daryl, I know you need to go
back to school, but I was

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.280
going to ask you, what are the
types of things you think will

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.710
be worthwhile to add?

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.680
What are the potential
enhancements that we could

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.490
make to this project?

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.200
DARYL CHANG: Yeah, so one of
the things we were going to

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.925
work on is to add a wizard
to the dev site page.

00:10:27.925 --> 00:10:28.290
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Mm-hm.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.660
DARYL CHANG: So, for example, in
the example I just showed,

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.770
you had to go to the API
console and set up your

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:33.920
project there.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.810
But we want developers to be
able to set up their projects

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.510
within the page, itself.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.970
So what I want to do is set up
some sort of wizard in the

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.200
site to reduce the amount
of navigation

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.585
developers have to do.

00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:48.450
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.270
Anything, Fred, on your side
that you're willing to share

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.750
with our audience?

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.560
I know we typically don't
talk about roadmap.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.720
But what are the types of things
that keep you awake at

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.871
night as far as new enhancements
that you could

00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:03.670
add and you are not right now?

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.060
FRED SAUER: That's
a good question.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.080
So there's a lot of things
I'd love to do.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.380
A lot of people ask for
various features.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.710
The good news is the
Cloud Playground is

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.800
an open source project.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.850
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Mm-hm.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.450
FRED SAUER: So if you log into
the Cloud Playground at

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.540
cloud-playground.appspot.com,
and you scroll down to the

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.100
bottom right, there's a little
link to the Git repo.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.710
You can clone a copy and add
features yourself or

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.230
contribute them back,
obviously.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.140
That's what open source
is about.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.530
I think maybe the biggest
feature on the roadmap for me

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:37.330
would be somehow add support
for other languages.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.140
We started out with Python 2.7,
just because it was easy.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.870
You can do eval on the server.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.840
Maybe you want to do
Java or Go or PHP.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.360
Java and Go, they require
a compile step.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.000
So you have to take your source,
compile it, and then

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.150
execute it.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.100
So that adds a little
bit of complexity.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.200
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: A little
bit of complexity.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.730
FRED SAUER: Just a little bit.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.300
So maybe we could take Compute
Engine instances and combine

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.350
them with the App Engine front
end user interface and provide

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.040
support for N languages,
and then just keep

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.420
the cranking N up.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.060
But ultimately, I want to see a
very smooth transition from,

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.740
hey, we just met.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.920
Let's go on a date.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.060
Let's have a little bit
longer relationship.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.260
And hopefully, this is a
long-lasting relationship with

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.620
the platform.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.280
But on each step, hopefully
it's a very smooth,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.365
incremental, and you can wade
into the waters as gradually

00:12:30.365 --> 00:12:32.060
or as quickly as
you would like.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.935
And when you're ready, you
can always take the next.

00:12:36.935 --> 00:12:37.230
That's where we're headed.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.390
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great, that
all sounds very exciting.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.220
Well, thank you very much for
joining our show today.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.960
I think this is a really great
addition to our developer

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.610
documentation.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.370
It's going to make the
five-minute user experience on

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.320
our site much better.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.705
I would like to invite you all
that are watching to send us

00:12:53.705 --> 00:12:54.220
your feedback.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.500
If there is features or any
other feedback you have about

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.310
this functionality, please
reach out to us.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.940
We're on Google+ and Twitter.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.370
And then, last but not least,
if you would like to help us

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.300
take this to the next level,
we are hiring.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.050

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.890
information about the positions
that we have open.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.440
Well, until then, see you next
time live on YouTube

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.350
Developers Live.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.435
Thank you very much, Bye.

00:13:20.435 --> 00:13:22.170
FRED SAUER: And happy
birthday, Jarek.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:22.770
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you.
