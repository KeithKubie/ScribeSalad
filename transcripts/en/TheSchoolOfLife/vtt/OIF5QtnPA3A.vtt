00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.020
When we imagine where in the world we’d
be happiest, we’re often prompted to imagine

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.430
places filled with people; a cosy home with
family, a party with friends, a busy office

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.970
or bar, well-lit streets teaming with cheerful
faces… But defining happy places in these

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.570
terms misses out what can be the deep appeal
of far less publicised and distinguished sorts

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.560
of environment: locations that are starkly
downbeat, empty, melancholic, architecturally

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.079
compromised and isolated – but where we
nevertheless experience a deep pull, coming

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.380
to feel, perhaps, that we belong here far
more than in the gaiety, elegance and colour

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.649
of familiar vistas. We may have an instinctive
sense that we are true natives of the isolated

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:57.890
motorway diner at 11pm. Or of the open road,
under a boundless sky in which a billion stars

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.039
are starting to appear. Or of dusk at the
container port – or of night under the shadow

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:09.320
of vast electricity pylons marching across
the landscape to an unknown city whose eerie

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.430
orange aura glows over the hills. In these
lonely, isolated places, we have an opportunity

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.140
to meet with bits of ourselves with which
the routines of daily life don’t allow us

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.870
to commune. We are keeping an appointment
with a disavowed side of our characters, and

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.490
can have internal conversations of a sort
that are drowned out by the normal chatter,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.759
the smiling and the casual enquiries of our
regular lives. We are recovering a sense of

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.299
who we are, turning over memories and plans,
regrets and excitements – without any pressure

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:54.030
to be reassuring, purposeful or just (so-called)
normal. The bleakness all around is a relief

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.869
from the false comforts of home. We don’t
have to pretend any longer. The environment

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.781
supports us in our wish to own up to a sadness
we have had to hide from for too long. The

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:12.290
fellow outsiders we encounter in these lonely
places seem closer to offering us the true

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.540
community we crave than the friends we should
supposedly rely on. In their sad faces and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.970
grief-stricken eyes, we recognise the most
sincere, bruised bits of ourselves. They seem

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.370
like our true brothers and sisters – also
unable to accommodate their characters within

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.850
the strictures of the ordinary world, outcasts
and – in their own way – visionaries.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.690
There can be something almost beautiful about
the ugliest kinds of lonely places: plastified,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.690
brightly lit, garish, cheap. The lack of domesticity,
the pitiless illumination and anonymous furniture

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.910
offer an alternative to ordinary sentimentality
and good taste. It may be easier to give way

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.030
to sadness here than in a cosy living room
with wallpaper and framed photos.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.459
If we are defined by the places where we feel
‘at home’, some of these may have nothing

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.670
at all to do with homeliness as we presently
conceive of the term; and yet they may comprise

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.680
our truest and best homes nevertheless.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.880
Our wisdom display cards explore what it really means to be wise and how we can strive to become more enlightened in our everyday lives.
