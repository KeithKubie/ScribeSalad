00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.105
- [Lecturer] When we think
about European exploration

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:06.522
in the Americas, we tend to start at 1492

00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:10.932
with Christopher Columbus showing up

00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:12.948
at the island of Hispaniola,

00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:16.531
but in this video I
want to take a step back

00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:19.421
a few decades and talk
about the conditions

00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:21.674
that led to Christopher Columbus's

00:00:21.674 --> 00:00:23.461
voyage in the first place.

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.017
What was he doing there?

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:26.383
So let's zoom in a little bit

00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:29.453
and take a look at what the world

00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:32.919
would have looked like to
someone in western Europe

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:34.669
around the year 1450.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.867
So to a European, this would have been

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:41.725
about the extent of the known world.

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:42.725
Now they wouldn't have had anything

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:44.661
like the level of this detail,

00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:48.643
but they certainly knew that there were

00:00:48.643 --> 00:00:51.643
very good things to be had in India,

00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:54.961
and China,

00:00:56.445 --> 00:00:58.807
and the Middle East.

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:02.390
Excellent trade goods
like silk and spices,

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:07.579
and they knew there was
quite a lot of world

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.553
outside of Europe and Africa,

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:13.629
but they didn't think that
there was much out there.

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:15.656
And they expected there
would be some small islands

00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:19.084
on the range of Iceland perhaps,

00:01:19.084 --> 00:01:22.678
but they had no conception
that there were two

00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:26.858
gigantic continents on the other
side of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:26.858 --> 00:01:29.296
It's a frequent misconception that people

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:32.294
in this time period thought
that the world was flat.

00:01:32.294 --> 00:01:35.991
Learned people of the era
knew that the world was round.

00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:38.697
In fact they had known so
since the time of the Greeks.

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:41.720
What they did know was that
the world was pretty large.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.298
In fact they correctly
estimated that the circumference

00:01:46.298 --> 00:01:49.215
of the globe is about 25,000 miles.

00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.695
And so they knew that given
the shipping technology

00:01:56.695 --> 00:02:00.695
that they had, it would
be impossible to go west

00:02:03.174 --> 00:02:06.279
and arrive at the east, while still having

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:09.257
enough food and water to supply your crew.

00:02:09.257 --> 00:02:13.424
Now why would anyone have
dreamt of going west to get east

00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:18.619
when they could have simply
gone east to get east?

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:22.335
Well the answer is that
the over land route

00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:25.418
was long and it was expensive because

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:31.834
the Middle East and north
Africa and even parts of Spain

00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:37.965
were controlled by Muslim empires

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:42.268
like the Ottomans and the Moors.

00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:45.685
And so any time trade came from the east,

00:02:48.156 --> 00:02:51.549
China and India and
the Middle East itself,

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.292
it went through a series of traders

00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:57.220
and a series of empires along the way,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.553
picking up taxes

00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:01.825
and markups.

00:03:05.532 --> 00:03:07.325
Which meant that by the time a good

00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:10.992
reached western Europe
it was pricey indeed.

00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:14.598
And since Muslim traders were in control

00:03:14.598 --> 00:03:18.098
of the Mediterranean here and at the east,

00:03:19.024 --> 00:03:21.203
taking a ship through there caused

00:03:21.203 --> 00:03:22.944
pretty much the same problem,

00:03:22.944 --> 00:03:25.133
so why not go around the coast of Africa?

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:26.432
Well that was certainly something

00:03:26.432 --> 00:03:29.015
that Europeans were keen to do.

00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:31.333
The only problem is that the wind

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.821
goes in the wrong direction

00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:37.083
and it's very treacherous
sailing around the tip of Africa

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.865
to come up into the Indian Ocean.

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:40.507
So what changed?

00:03:40.507 --> 00:03:43.340
How did this over land trade route

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.365
become an over sea trade route?

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:49.267
Well for that we have to
look a little bit closer

00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:51.665
at the Iberian peninsula.

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:55.665
So this land mass here
is the Iberian peninsula.

00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:01.912
And at the time, the Iberian peninsula

00:04:01.912 --> 00:04:05.496
was controlled by a number
of different groups.

00:04:05.496 --> 00:04:09.769
The southern part was under Muslim control

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.936
of the Moors, as they were
called, or Moroccan Muslims

00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:18.864
and they called this area Al-Andalus

00:04:22.546 --> 00:04:25.130
and we're talking about this area here,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.963
and the Spanish called it Granada.

00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:34.058
The western part here was
under the control of Portugal,

00:04:36.447 --> 00:04:37.697
as it is today.

00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:40.994
So we got Portugal.

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:47.583
The eastern part, this area here,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
is the kingdom of Aragon

00:04:56.604 --> 00:04:58.937
and then a central part here

00:05:01.818 --> 00:05:03.735
was kingdom of Castile.

00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:10.222
So as far as Europeans were concerned

00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:13.389
this was kind of the end of the world.

00:05:15.863 --> 00:05:19.561
This was as far southwest as you could go

00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:23.089
on the European continent and heaven knows

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:27.046
what was out here until
in the early 1400s,

00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:30.171
Portugal's Prince Henry the Navigator

00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:32.671
began investing in navigation.

00:05:34.064 --> 00:05:38.038
And one of the important discoveries made

00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:42.103
by the Portuguese was a new kind of ship

00:05:42.103 --> 00:05:45.690
and this ship was called the caravel.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.047
So what's cool about the caravel is that

00:05:49.047 --> 00:05:51.730
caravels are ocean worthy but they're also

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.897
very easy to maneuver and
they can sail into the wind.

00:05:59.263 --> 00:06:02.846
So, that means that
the problems of sailing

00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:07.391
around Africa begin to
get a little bit easier

00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:10.354
and so in this early era of the 1400s,

00:06:10.354 --> 00:06:14.354
the Portuguese began
expanding their exploration

00:06:16.614 --> 00:06:20.300
farther and farther down
the coast of Africa,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.221
and they come across these islands

00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:24.807
now that they don't have to hug the coast.

00:06:24.807 --> 00:06:27.807
The Canary Islands, and farther west

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:33.848
this is so small you can
barely see it here, Madeira

00:06:34.807 --> 00:06:36.057
and the Azores.

00:06:38.308 --> 00:06:40.145
And they quickly discover
that these islands

00:06:40.145 --> 00:06:43.145
are ideal places to grow cash crops.

00:06:45.756 --> 00:06:47.339
Specifically sugar.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.593
They also discover that some of the people

00:06:52.593 --> 00:06:56.744
who live on these islands,
in fact the Canary Islands

00:06:56.744 --> 00:07:00.327
had a native population
called the Guanche.

00:07:01.233 --> 00:07:05.184
They immediately attempted to
enslave these native people

00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:09.229
and then quickly discovered
that they would die of disease.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.648
And we'll talk more
about why native people

00:07:11.648 --> 00:07:14.545
seemed to be so susceptible

00:07:14.545 --> 00:07:17.147
to European diseases a little bit later.

00:07:17.147 --> 00:07:19.933
So now they have great
places to grow sugar,

00:07:19.933 --> 00:07:22.166
but they don't have a workforce.

00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:25.312
Well they're discovering another workforce

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:29.479
along the coast of Africa
as they begin to set up,

00:07:30.764 --> 00:07:33.401
this is the Portuguese
we're talking about here,

00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:37.559
trading posts on the west coast of Africa

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:40.142
where they're purchasing slaves

00:07:42.465 --> 00:07:45.465
from African traders or Arab traders

00:07:46.844 --> 00:07:50.679
who had a long history of trading slaves

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:54.429
from the interior of
Africa out to its coast.

00:07:55.706 --> 00:07:57.007
So in the early 1400s,

00:07:57.007 --> 00:07:59.405
Portugal is doing very well for itself.

00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:02.529
Seems that they're leading
this colonial game.

00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:07.139
They've pretty much invented
the plantation system,

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:08.926
and they're getting
quite wealthy off of it.

00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:11.609
So the eyes of Europe turn to Portugal

00:08:11.609 --> 00:08:16.528
and they think all right how
can we replicate their success?

00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:18.717
Meanwhile, back on the Iberian peninsula

00:08:18.717 --> 00:08:21.842
there's a political and religious shakeup,

00:08:21.842 --> 00:08:25.842
so the kingdoms of Castile
and Aragon are united

00:08:27.694 --> 00:08:29.694
when Ferdinand of Aragon

00:08:33.077 --> 00:08:34.994
and Isabella of Castile

00:08:37.557 --> 00:08:40.898
and I recognize that my Spanish
pronunciation is terrible,

00:08:40.898 --> 00:08:45.065
they get married in 1469
and unite their two kingdoms

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.660
into what becomes the kingdom of Spain.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:57.305
So what had been Castile
and Aragon becomes Spain.

00:08:57.305 --> 00:09:00.319
And then united, these
two Catholic monarchs

00:09:00.319 --> 00:09:05.126
turn their attentions to
what's called the reconquista.

00:09:05.126 --> 00:09:07.709
So reconquering the territories

00:09:08.787 --> 00:09:12.954
that had been controlled
by Muslims for Christians.

00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:18.909
Some call this kind of an
extension of Crusader thinking,

00:09:18.909 --> 00:09:23.076
and Ferdinand and Isabella
complete the reconquista,

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:26.503
expelling the Moors from the territory

00:09:26.503 --> 00:09:28.836
that is today Spain in 1492.

00:09:30.122 --> 00:09:33.208
So now we've reached 1492 and we've got

00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:36.708
a will, that is a desire for luxury goods.

00:09:38.303 --> 00:09:39.989
We also have a little bit of

00:09:39.989 --> 00:09:42.300
good old fashioned nationalism here.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.167
Spain's closest neighbor is
Portugal, who are currently

00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:48.029
very powerful and wealthy, so they've got

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:50.635
perhaps some rivalry in their hearts,

00:09:50.635 --> 00:09:54.039
and we've got a way which is the caravel

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:58.206
that is making more and
more ocean sailing possible.

00:10:00.263 --> 00:10:04.071
And into this exciting moment
steps Christopher Columbus,

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:06.292
and we'll talk more about
him in the next video.
