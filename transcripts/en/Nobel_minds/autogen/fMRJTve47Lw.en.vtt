my<00:00:24.189><c> mother</c><00:00:24.400><c> was</c><00:00:24.580><c> a</c><00:00:24.610><c> high</c><00:00:24.939><c> school</c><00:00:25.210><c> teacher</c><00:00:25.419><c> and</c>

my mother was a high school teacher and

my mother was a high school teacher and
so<00:00:26.050><c> I</c><00:00:26.439><c> think</c><00:00:26.529><c> education</c><00:00:26.980><c> was</c><00:00:27.730><c> very</c><00:00:27.939><c> big</c><00:00:28.180><c> for</c>

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 align:start position:0%

that the laser was fine and then make
