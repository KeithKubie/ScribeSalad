(electronic music)

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.510
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.770
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.960
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.510
Our guest today is Tanya Marie Luhrmann,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.230
who is the Watkins University professor

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.080
in the Stanford Anthropology Department.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.713
Her books include Persuasions
of the Witchcraft,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.630
The Good Parsi, Of Two Minds,
and When God Talks Back.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.000
Professor Luhrmann, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.380
- Thanks, it's great to be here.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.200
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.710
- Well, I was born in Dayton, Ohio

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.160
because my dad was in the Air Force,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.370
but I was actually raised on
the East Coast in New York City

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.110
and outside, in New Jersey.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.030
- And you mentioned, in
one of the introductions,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.540
the influence of your grandfather,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.650
who was a Baptist minister.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.470
Talk a little about that, 'cause later,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.630
we'll talk about your
book on the evangelicals.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.523
- He was just such a lovely man,

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:46.833
and I still have this vivid memory of him

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.100
taking me on his shoulders
as we walked across the park.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.110
And it somehow

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.110
melds with the memory in my mind

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.520
about Saint Christopher
carrying the baby Christ child.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.190
And I don't want to,
sort of, draw an analogy

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.490
between myself and Christ,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.350
but between my grandfather
and Saint Christopher,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.430
as somebody who was just,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.300
you know, he was just that person

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.070
who would take care of you.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.570
He was a very adventurous man.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.570
He was polylingual.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.253
He was a missionary in Burma.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.530
Unlike my grandmother, he
wasn't so eager to convert.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.670
He was eager to learn languages.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.580
He loved to get on the back of an elephant

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.960
and go into the jungle, and
pulled teeth for people,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.450
and to do, sort of, simple medical work.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.910
He and my grandmother both taught school

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.280
in this mountainous area
of what was then Burma,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.210
and told stories.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.660
He was kind of an adventure buff,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.890
and he died too young.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.890
But he died off exploring
in his later 60s,

00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:06.482
which, at that age, was kind of old

00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:09.590
to get an RV and drive
off into the desert,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.943
and cruise around.

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:14.190
And I always thought
that there was something

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.890
kind of wonderful about that,

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.980
about kind of living
your life to the fullest

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.990
to the last.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.340
- Where did you do your
undergraduate work?

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.621
- I was at Harvard.

00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:25.450
- And what did you major in?

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.220
- Folklore and mythology.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.740
- So you were an anthropologist,
or an anthropology major?

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.960
- Well, I was not.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.630
So, folklore was its own program.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.350
There was this great
professor called Albert Lord,

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.320
who was partially responsible
for the Lord-Parry hypothesis,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.630
the Parry-Lord hypothesis
about the making of oral epics

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.640
and how they were kind of created.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.050
There was a sort of
implicit grammar to the way

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.050
that the singer of tales
put together his story.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.250
And so, because of Lord,
there was this, kind of

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.300
odd idiosyncratic, and quite
wonderful, undergraduate major,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.543
which introduced you to
the literature of folklore,

00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:17.070
and to the ways that, you
know, certain classic questions

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.840
about how to understand
these myths and stories

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.263
that people tell to themselves.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.673
I mean, I loved it.

00:04:24.673 --> 00:04:27.040
I actually came to college with the idea

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.870
that I would be a philosopher,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.120
and this next story

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.700
is about what it is like to be 17.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.600
But I remember reading Kant and thinking

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.940
that this was cheating.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.060
He saw a puzzle that he wanted to explain,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.760
which was that people
thought in similar ways,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.630
you know, robustly, from person to person,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.980
and he solved it by just asserting

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.960
that there were categories
of the understanding,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.370
and I thought that was
kind of interesting,

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.270
but I also thought that people
were really complicated,

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.223
and I wanted to know about the
differences between people.

00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:06.530
I also wanted to know about the stories

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.740
they told themselves, and I
thought that those stories

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.240
were at least as important as any

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.980
categories of the understanding

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.410
through which we grasped our world.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.070
- And then, where did you
do your graduate work?

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.140
- At the University of
Cambridge in the UK.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.290
- And who did you work under there?

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.853
- My formal adviser was Ernest Gellner.

00:05:28.853 --> 00:05:31.010
I actually started working
with Stephen Hugh-Jones,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.600
but he left for the Amazon
partway through my time there,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.113
and Ernest was just arriving.

00:05:37.217 --> 00:05:39.623
So, it was a wonderful match.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.490
Ernest is an anthropologist,
but also half a philosopher.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.660
He thought about the
rational and the mythical,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.050
and the way that people
are and are not logical,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.720
and means and directed
and organizing their life

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.050
in a way that these variations are framed

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.000
in different social groups.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.180
Geoffrey Lloyd was also a
very important influence.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.800
He's a classicist who tries to understand

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.160
what he calls the mentalities,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.200
that was a word that was
in vogue at the time,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.000
trying to understand, how do
you make sense of the fact

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.230
that the Greeks, you know,

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.770
came up with what we now call science?

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.520
Was it scientific to them?

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.960
What did it mean for them to
use an experimental method?

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.300
How do you openly understand that?

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.040
And so, both of them were
great at asking questions,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.200
and pushing me, and arguing with me.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.200
It was a great education.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.090
- I get the sense that,
especially in your earlier years,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.740
but then later, also,
there's a real sense of

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.960
distancing yourself as an observer,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.970
but also embedding
yourself at the same time,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.370
in sort of a respectful sense of

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.040
the stories that people tell themselves

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.750
as they belong to these groups.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.270
That seems to be present
in your very early years.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.433
- Thanks, yeah.

00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:13.380
I've I never had much physical courage.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.730
I like to drive slowly on the freeway,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.433
I don't climb mountains,

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:23.480
but I really find it
fascinating to try to figure out

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.400
how somebody else thinks.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.410
So I tend, in general,
not to be so frightened

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.680
by ways of thinking
that seem very different

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.060
to other people.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.000
And I think that what it takes
to be a good anthropologist

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.540
is this capacity to empathically connect,

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.130
and also stand back.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.890
So on the one hand,
you are embedded enough

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.630
so that you can feel it when the magic

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.883
shoots through your body.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.063
I've never really had this,

00:07:56.063 --> 00:07:58.830
and you know, a part of
what I do is I studied

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.300
psychotic distressed people
who are really disconnected

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.690
from reality, and you can't really have

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.030
a true grasp of that experience,

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.530
but grasp it enough to have a feel

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.730
for the way people describe it.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.410
But you also need to
kind of be standing back

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.453
and saying, oh.

00:08:21.344 --> 00:08:22.570
What happened?

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.940
Why did I feel the magic
shoot through my body?

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.283
How would I explain that?

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.630
Putting the magic aside,
what's going on in the body?

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.640
What's going on in the mind?

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.870
What's going on in the social
world in which I was embedded

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.483
that enabled me to have
such an experience?

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.110
- And you are

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.010
both an anthropologist and a
psychological anthropologist.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:47.843
- [Tanya] That's right.

00:08:47.843 --> 00:08:52.540
- So is the skill set the same for both,

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.880
or do they complement each other

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.530
and bring different skills to the table?

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.900
- I think to be a
psychological anthropologist,

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.820
so that's an anthropologist with one foot

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.750
in the psychological domain,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.820
you're interested in
emotions and in thinking,

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.017
and in the structure of the mind,

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:14.810
and the way people carve
up the world cognitively,

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.800
so you really have to
be pretty comfortable

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.560
with sitting and listening to
people talk about themselves.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.430
You also have to be really comfortable

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:28.170
with ambiguity and failure.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.220
So, one of the things that
I find so striking about

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.090
trying to understand how people
experience God, for example,

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.140
is that you never know.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.270
You can learn an awful lot, but, you know,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.970
real understanding just always
disappears over the horizon

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.833
because people are so complicated.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.280
You know, language is
remarkably important,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.010
but it's, in ways, a flimsy vehicle

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.160
for conveying anything as complicated

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.110
to somebody's experience of God,

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.560
so the more that you come to understand

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.980
how somebody experiences,

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.820
subjectively experiences their world,

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.040
you need to tolerate that you can grasp

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.123
only a tiny portion of what they do.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.400
- So in terms of temperament

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.257
for somebody who's doing both
of these things, anthropology,

00:10:22.257 --> 00:10:25.980
it sounds like
self-confidence is important.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.260
Is that is that the right word?

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.050
'Cause you're moving between worlds,

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.683
and moving out of worlds.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.480
- Well, I find that

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.800
self-confidence is nice, it's
a good thing to have in life,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.450
you need to be robust enough
to come back to yourself.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.530
But I think the skill that you really need

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.523
is the ability to kind of, you know,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.763
seek to identify with somebody else.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.300
There's actually a funny way in which

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.950
the good anthropologist,

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.150
I think this is true
for all anthropologists,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.020
but really, particularly for people

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.770
who are really trying to understand

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.030
the structure of the agricultural life,

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.440
but what it's like to live
in somebody else's skin.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.363
You know, when you're talking to somebody,

00:11:20.241 --> 00:11:22.400
there's a piece of you
that's trying to figure out

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.300
what it's like to be them,

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.460
and so there's almost as
if you have a time delay,

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.120
in that way that you're
responding to people.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.953
So I think

00:11:34.586 --> 00:11:39.586
it's not unrelated to being
the skills of being an actor,

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.910
I think, except that
it's almost the opposite,

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:46.420
but I think actors become very conscious

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.240
of who they are in the room,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.590
and you know, the
anthropologist more needs to

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:56.605
have this negative capability,
the sense of being aware,

00:11:56.605 --> 00:11:59.040
always thinking about
what it would be like

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.110
to be somebody else.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.200
And so, again, you've got
to tolerate limitations

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.860
because who knows what
it's like to actually

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.800
live in somebody else's skin?

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.763
But it's more like a novelist's skills,

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.710
except you're constrained by the fact

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.890
that you're not making it up.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.270
You're sitting with real people

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.230
and you're trying to
figure out what it is like

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.340
to write a ritual, sit with
somebody who's psychotic,

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.740
if you're a psychiatrist,

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.350
what it's like to pray.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.560
And so, you yourself can
learn a little bit about that

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.570
by praying and sitting with
people who are psychotic,

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:42.110
or writing a ritual, but
you never quite know.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.260
So you always have the sense
that you're triangulating

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.210
from many, many different
sources of information,

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.070
and you're trying to help
yourself to construct

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.210
a sense of what this
different world is like

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.120
in trying to lay out the
steps that it would take

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.380
somebody who wasn't from that
world to sort of go native

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.180
to some extent in that world.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.440
And then you, the anthropologist,
have to kind of be able

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.033
to do that and come back.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.700
- And you come back

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.640
and you record and analyze,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.070
and one of the remarkable
things about your work

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.070
is it's very hard to put your books down

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.350
'cause they're so well-written.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.393
- [Tanya] Thank you.

00:13:21.393 --> 00:13:24.510
- So you said novelist, like a novelist,

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.090
so in other words, the book that comes out

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:33.090
is not a novel, but
you're carrying forward

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.440
what you've learned.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.960
- Right, and one of the things
that you're trying to do

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.480
is tell this story in a way
that's true to the people

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.840
that you're describing, but
also makes them come alive

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.340
to the people who are reading.

00:13:50.359 --> 00:13:54.300
You, the anthropologist,
know what this world is like.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.320
You then try to set it down in prose,

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.380
and that's often, you know,

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.350
it's really a sobering
experience to spend three hours

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.017
in an evening, with a group of people,

00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:12.320
and then come back and
you try to write it down

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.670
for three hours, and my goodness!

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.230
There's all this stuff
that just drops out,

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.370
and what remains is that, you know,

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.820
skeletal structure that
you've sketched out.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.790
And so, what you're trying to learn to do

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:29.910
is to use your words to evoke,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.910
to capture, to point, to get people to

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.430
get some sense of what it's like.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:41.720
And it's so interesting
reading ethnographies.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.370
The good old-fashioned
ethnographies were kind of wonderful

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.380
because they were written with the idea

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.730
that nobody who was reading them

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.780
had ever been to, say, Africa.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.940
So, I was studying at Cambridge.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.720
Most of the people I was meeting had done

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.840
their field work fieldwork in Africa.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.608
And so, the books were
full of these descriptions

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:03.560
of red earth and a hot sun

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.262
that, you know, the reader
hadn't experienced before.

00:15:08.262 --> 00:15:12.680
And I find one of the
challenges of writing

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.740
about a world that people know is that,

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.920
you know, you write about
evangelical Christianity.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.360
People know a lot about
evangelical Christianity,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.240
and yet in some sense,
often, they know nothing,

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.420
and so it's a slightly
different writerly challenge.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.880
And so it's an interesting challenge.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.700
- And the good writing

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:39.050
seemed to be important
because as an anthropologist

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.343
and a field worker,

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.100
we've already said to be
respectful of the community,

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.230
but then you have to capture that,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.510
and not embed it in jargon.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.343
- [Tanya] Right.

00:15:51.343 --> 00:15:55.730
- Really, because otherwise,
you will lose the empathy

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.610
that you have had and you
won't convey it to the reader

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.380
who also has to empathize, right?

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.460
- That's right.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.420
Yeah, that's right.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.500
- So, what was your dissertation on?

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.300
Let's go back to your graduate education.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.830
- Well, I called it as science,

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.220
or children offspring of Prospero.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.810
It was about these middle-class folks,

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.000
mostly middle-class folks in London,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.723
who practiced what they
called magic and witchcraft.

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:25.710
I'd been reading Evans-Pritchard,

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:30.390
and all these anthropological
accounts of people

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.790
in preliterate settings who
practiced witchcraft and magic,

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.210
and had a lot of ideas about magic.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.960
And on my way off to graduate school,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.410
I picked up a book in
the Harvard bookstore

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.113
that told you how to be a witch.

00:16:43.542 --> 00:16:44.380
It was kinda great.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.018
It was written by somebody
in Berkeley, and--

00:16:47.018 --> 00:16:48.340
- Was there a degree in--

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.330
- No, she wasn't describing one,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:52.980
but it turned out that there was.

00:16:54.866 --> 00:16:59.250
And I was just floored by this
description of being a witch,

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.310
being a magician in this modern,

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.050
sophisticated, complicated world.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.500
And I thought it would
be really interesting

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.930
to try to understand how
magic became compelling

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.930
to somebody, and how it
seemed real to people

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.820
who had been brought up, in theory,

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:19.820
in a very post-magical, very
modern, even post-modern,

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.780
scientifically sophisticated world.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:27.780
And so, I went searching
for this in England.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.510
So here I was at Cambridge,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.510
sharing this book to people
and chatting about it,

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.137
and somebody finally said, "Oh,

00:17:37.137 --> 00:17:39.887
"a friend of a friend of a
friend of a friend of mine

00:17:39.887 --> 00:17:41.057
"is a witch.

00:17:41.057 --> 00:17:43.140
"You ought to give her a call."

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.447
And so, I called her
up and said, you know,

00:17:45.447 --> 00:17:47.557
"Hi, I'm a Cambridge anthropologist,

00:17:47.557 --> 00:17:48.947
"and I'm interested in witchcraft.

00:17:48.947 --> 00:17:49.857
"I hear you're a witch.

00:17:49.857 --> 00:17:51.650
"Can I come talk to you?"

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.210
And I went out to see her,

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.620
and it turned out that
she was a great woman.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.440
She also brewed her own wine,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.170
which was pretty intense.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.643
Vintage was about three weeks.

00:18:11.268 --> 00:18:13.101
It was a little tough,

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.850
but she was fascinating.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.630
And she introduced me to
a whole world of people

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.920
who were, on the one hand, sophisticated,

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.920
well-educated, some
with Cambridge degrees,

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.510
and on the other hand, practicing magic,

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.160
and this was a world that
thought that there were

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.010
different kinds of reality.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.420
There was the material world,
then there's other stuff.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.400
This other stuff has power,

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.720
and you can use your mind to harness it,

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.850
direct it, push it in different directions

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.290
so that you can get the house next door,

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.820
or cure your back problem,

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.793
bring truth into English
politics. all kinds of stuff.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.800
So that's what I did.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.150
I tried to make sense
of how what these folks

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.263
were doing was persuasive to them.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.500
- And you point out, actually,

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.750
and I think this is a point you make

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.850
in several of your books,

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:18.850
is that we live in a
complex world, generally,

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.660
in which we're very
uncertain and ambivalent

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.560
about the meaning of things,

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.940
and this is a defining condition

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.470
for many of the communities you look at.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:36.310
So they're trying to come to term

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.830
with their own ambivalences
about the world,

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.435
and they recognize those ambivalences.

00:19:42.435 --> 00:19:44.800
- And I think what I was really aware of

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.540
was how complicated these commitments

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.003
to the supernatural were,

00:19:50.745 --> 00:19:53.930
and it's not that people aren't clear

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.710
about what they believe, but that

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.120
although they might believe

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.433
that the magic is real,
or that God is real,

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.830
in some ways, that's always
a conditional commitment,

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.610
even though they really believe it.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:15.460
And if you think about
it, any church service

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:20.460
is surprisingly work-intensive.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.280
I mean, you know, think
of the amount of effort

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.640
we go to build a church.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.780
We spend a lot of money, a lot of time.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.430
We build this huge thing,
and then we fill it with,

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.010
you know, sense and music
and people, and all this.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.590
You know, if people took for granted,

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.910
and it was not at all a
question of whether God existed,

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.230
you wouldn't have to do all that stuff.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.800
And there's a way in which
God is really real for people,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.000
the magic's really real for people,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.230
but they're also making God
real, and making the magic real

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.780
at the same time.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.490
And particularly in a sophisticated world,

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.470
like London, or you know, the South Bay,

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.233
or East Bay, whatever,

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.990
people know that there are other people

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.410
who have very different
understandings of the world.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.360
They encounter people who believe

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.620
different things things
about the ultimate,

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.620
and they can't but be
aware of those differences.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.950
You can't write all those
people off as crazy.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:28.820
And if you take some of them
as being sensible people,

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.770
then you have this, you know,
what do you do with that?

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.220
And so, that was one of the things

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.450
I was trying to understand,

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:41.450
how people allowed their
fundamental commitments

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.640
to be alive to them.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.580
- And you found that there was,

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.470
in the ritual and the apparatus of magic,

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.770
something that was
reminiscent of religion.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.603
- [Tanya] Absolutely.

00:21:57.603 --> 00:21:58.436
- Yeah.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.380
- I really began,

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.820
remember, I was going to graduate school

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.880
back in the days of the linguistic turn,

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.990
and we were gonna understand
everything with language.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.610
I didn't even have the
tools of cognitive science

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.220
to articulate it then,

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.250
but I thought that what
I was gonna do when I,

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.210
you know, wandered into this magical world

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.150
and I tried to understand it,

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.430
I thought I was gonna be understanding,

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:28.430
looking for and identifying,
and sketching out words,

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:33.490
metaphors, representations,

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.220
narratives that people would acquire.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.930
So you'd be a non-magician,

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.620
you'd start hanging out
in these magical worlds,

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.230
and you would acquire a way
of thinking about the world

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.390
that would just reshape your
way of explaining events,

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.600
and I certainly found those.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.980
But what I also found was that

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.460
the magicians were very clear.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.230
So these were people who met in groups

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:02.040
of between, oh, 10 and 100,

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.460
and they would do these rituals,

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.840
and the rituals would involve
running around and whatever,

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.810
but they really involve
shedding your mind,

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.903
visualizing something powerfully,

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.790
and allowing the power,
however you understand that,

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.320
to come through your mind
and go out to the world.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.950
People were very clear
that if you were going to

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.190
do magic, you had to practice,

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.593
and the practices were things like,

00:23:27.593 --> 00:23:31.223
I mean, I did take a course
in magic, nine-month course,

00:23:34.464 --> 00:23:36.220
with what was called a supervisor.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.590
I wrote essays, they were
graded, and I had an exercise.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.980
So, 15 minutes a day, I
had to sit in my room,

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.580
shut my eyes, and imagine in my mind's eye

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:51.140
that I was flying through the air.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.330
I was going to this garden in the sky.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:59.330
I was building, in that garden,
an altar with a chalice,

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.213
and whatever else.

00:24:02.213 --> 00:24:05.030
I was planting the garden,
and it was, for me,

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:09.170
my own magical altar on
which I could do rituals

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.210
that would change the world.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.470
And so, 15 minutes a day, I
had to do these practices,

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.960
which involved, basically,
shutting my eyes

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.890
and imagining stuff.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.410
People were very clear that if
you wanted to practice magic,

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.500
you had to do those exercises.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:28.090
And what floored me is
that the exercises worked,

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.513
and by that, I mean that they changed me.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.640
I never felt I was leaving my
body to fly to this garden,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.843
but I felt different.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:45.910
The garden got more and more powerful,

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.830
sort of realistic.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:53.160
I had a couple of striking experiences.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.590
I felt magic move through my body,

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.743
and I really felt it.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.130
I'm not making an ontological claim here

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.310
about the reality of magic,

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.543
but I felt that move through my body.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.993
I was in a ritual and I saw God,

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:15.343
not externally in the world,
but I saw God in my mind's eye.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:20.650
This particular God, who
was sort of a horned God,

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:25.650
and a kind of, sorta James
George Frazer kind of, you know,

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.563
ancient peoples God.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.440
I woke up one morning and I saw six druids

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.703
standing by the window, so I saw them.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.880
You'd call it, technically,
a hallucination.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.610
It's not so hard to have them
between sleep and awareness,

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.470
but turns out they're kind of common,

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.970
but it was very striking to me.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.990
And I was reading this book
that was written by a witch

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.890
called The Mists of Avalon,
all about the Arthurian story.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.960
And other people would report
these experiences as well.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.840
It wasn't like it was just me.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.247
People would say things like, "Oh,

00:26:08.247 --> 00:26:10.667
"I saw the goddess, it was
the most amazing experience.

00:26:10.667 --> 00:26:13.417
"I looked into the
mirror and there she was,

00:26:13.417 --> 00:26:15.620
"and it wasn't me, I saw something."

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.880
They would talk about
hunting on the astral plane,

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.360
and sometimes, it was pretty clear

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.570
they had a powerful experience.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:28.083
Goodness knows how you
make sense of that, again,

00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:30.770
ontologically, what's really happening,

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.570
but they had these powerful experiences.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:38.150
And so, I realized that if I was,

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.890
ultimately, really gonna understand that,

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.040
I'd have to start
understanding these changes

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.960
that happen to people as a result

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.000
of these practices they did.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.430
And over the decades, I came to look at

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.760
what the witches were
doing more carefully.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.810
Looks an awful lot like Christian prayer.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.430
- And the important point here,

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:04.720
which you actually carry
into other studies,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.151
is that it's, just to
repeat what you're saying,

00:27:08.151 --> 00:27:12.300
that it's not necessarily belief or ideas,

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.820
but it's really the practice

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.740
of doing, in this case, magic,

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:23.740
that in some way, helps shape your mind

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.253
so that, in a way,

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.240
some of what's going on here sounds like

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.180
a novelist, basically, in a way,

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.220
for the people who are
actually doing this stuff.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.053
- Absolutely.

00:27:38.053 --> 00:27:40.340
So, in substance, I see myself as doing

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.840
a sort of social anthropology of the mind,

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.740
looking at the way that
people use practices and ideas

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.520
within a certain social world

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.520
to micro-construct their
subjective experience,

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.560
and to shift their
psychological responses.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.430
So, you know, humans have a certain packet

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.670
of psychological capacities,

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:04.940
but the practices, the social practices,

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.910
in which those humans are located,

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:11.570
and the way that they attend
to their inner experience

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:15.600
during religious and other practices

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.170
really changes their experience
in pretty powerful ways.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.790
So when I think about my
contribution to anthropology,

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.340
I think about the way that culture

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.090
really gets under your skin

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.263
and changes your experience profoundly.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:33.130
- And it's important here
that magicians hang around

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.000
with magicians, right?
- Absolutely.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.840
- So they're getting the communal support

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.980
that reinforces this.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.410
- Absolutely.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.090
I mean, you can do

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.940
some of these techniques by yourself,

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.810
read a bunch of books, sort of
carry your community with you

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:54.490
in the form of printed words,
but it's much more powerful

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.310
when you're with a group
of like-minded people

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.120
who are practicing
certain things together.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.490
One of the most amazing
things I saw when I was

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.280
hanging out in the magical world

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.650
were people who almost went on voyages

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.340
in their mind together.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.270
So you would see people, and
we have records of people

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.740
who would sit together,
and they would relax,

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.760
and they would describe to each other

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.330
what they were seeing in their mind's eye,

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.800
and they were describing
it so that other people

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.520
in the group could have this experience.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.350
And when the group was
skilled and small enough,

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.260
people could take on the
story from each other,

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.550
and they would have, together,
this shared experience

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.780
that was also an imagined experience,

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.590
or at least, they were
using their imagination

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.793
to experience it.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:47.560
I thought that was fascinating.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.260
- You have a line here

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.620
that was one of two lines that I thought

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.600
were really, you say of the 1960s,

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.540
people discovered tarot
cards at about the same time

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.140
as they discovered bean sprouts, actually.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.493
So in other words,

00:30:06.665 --> 00:30:11.665
it's a phenomena that's
sort of generally out there

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.850
in the world, but these communities

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.801
take a particular form.

00:30:18.801 --> 00:30:19.640
- Absolutely.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.920
So, one of the things, the
big thing that happened

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.230
in the '60s is that the

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.950
ordinary middle-class life blew open,

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.510
and people began to
search for the spiritual

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.000
in new ways.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.950
They do that in Christianity
in particular ways,

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:40.360
they did it outside of
Christianity in particular ways.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.850
They were using some
of the same techniques,

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.080
and they were all searching for something

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.110
that was more palpably real to them

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.670
than God had been in the standard

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.610
mainstream churches of the '50s.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.460
- Mm-hmm.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:01.140
Now, before you did the
work on the evangelicals,

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.794
you worked on psychiatrists,

00:31:03.794 --> 00:31:08.040
and psychiatrists are a community

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.020
that, in the end,

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.840
finds illness and disease,

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.590
and some of what you're dealing with,

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.490
namely what people have in their minds,

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.400
and how their practice
changes their minds.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.400
So, how did you come to
to work on psychiatrists,

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.330
and what did you find?

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.483
- So it's sort of the other
side of my interest in religion.

00:31:34.918 --> 00:31:37.600
When people embrace religion,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.360
they are seeking to
change their mental world

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.210
in particular ways,

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:44.873
often to make themselves,

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.530
this is not the whole point of religion,

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.020
but I think that you
could think of religion

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:55.020
as an emotion management
and mind management system

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.910
that changes the way
you experience yourself.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.590
It seeks to calm your anxious voices,

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.320
give you a sense of
confidence, that you're loved,

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.620
that you're doing good
in the world, whatever.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.810
Mental illness is the
other side of that story.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:13.420
There are ways in which people's
minds get out of control,

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.740
the anxious voices don't quiet down.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.365
They sometimes hear people speak,

00:32:19.365 --> 00:32:21.760
and people aren't speaking.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.443
They are horribly depressed,
they feel anguish.

00:32:30.445 --> 00:32:34.945
The book on psychiatry is
really about the observation

00:32:35.832 --> 00:32:38.110
that the way that we think about the mind

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:41.010
changes some of the mental experience.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:44.220
And the vehicle for thinking
about that more deeply

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.520
was watching young
psychiatrists come to terms

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.590
with what mental illness was

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.540
from two different perspectives.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.490
I was in that world at a
time when there was tension

00:32:55.490 --> 00:33:00.320
between the biomedical model
and the psychodynamic model,

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.660
so there were both, you know,

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:07.570
scientists in white coats
who were in lab coats,

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:11.850
who thought of themselves
as curing illness

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.320
by giving medication, and you know,

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.820
and illness was disease.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.460
And there were folks who were, you know,

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:23.300
wearing tweed jackets and talking
about emotional suffering,

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:28.300
and trying to help people manage their own

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.120
sense of distress through
developing a better relationship

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.520
with somebody else.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.740
And so, that was my
vehicle to watch the way

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.550
that young psychiatrists came
to understand mental illness

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.203
from two different perspectives,

00:33:40.605 --> 00:33:43.840
and how differently those perspectives

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.530
represented mental illness.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:49.410
- And in the choice

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:52.210
about the kind of psychiatrist you were

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:55.200
was also socially based, basically, right?

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.220
In other words, because the
work of medicine was changing,

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.270
you were getting insurance plans

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.970
that may want to pay for pills,

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:07.250
but not for extended psychoanalysis.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.083
- Right.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.393
And so,

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.113
you know, residencies where
young psychiatrists are trained,

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.420
were shifting rapidly,

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.720
and there was an expectation
that you would find

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.970
your meal ticket by
prescribing medication,

00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:26.710
rather than conducting psychotherapy,

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.113
that's changed a little now,

00:34:29.392 --> 00:34:32.730
and different places emphasized
one more than the other.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:35.500
But there was still these
two different models

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.653
of psychiatry in any residency.

00:34:41.221 --> 00:34:43.340
And you could see the way they interacted,

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.210
you could see the way that people tried

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:46.393
to make sense of them.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:52.530
And I could see that the
loss of psychoanalysis,

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.830
I thought, was hard on patients,

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:58.910
and the rise of what I'll call
the vulgar biomedical model

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.390
was hard on patients.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.720
And then eventually, I went
off and started studying

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.410
people who were struggling

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:08.470
with serious psychotic disorder as well.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.440
- And you say, at one point here,

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:15.010
biology is the great moral
loophole for our age.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.583
- Yeah, thank you.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.150
I think it is.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.983
I mean,

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.910
we think, increasingly,

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:28.910
if we have a body-based
vision of human action,

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:33.300
then nobody's choosing
to act in an immoral way.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.770
It simply happens.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:38.030
You were addicted to
gambling, for example.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.300
You were psychotic, and so not responsible

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.453
for a crime you may have committed.

00:35:46.148 --> 00:35:49.020
You committed suicide
because you were depressed,

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.650
you didn't choose to do it.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:51.483
And I think that

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.420
it's just striking,
particularly when you have

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.740
a vulgar, and I don't think
that most psychiatrists

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.430
hold a vulgar biomedical model, but

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:08.320
particularly at the
height of that excitement

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.740
about discovering that drugs would affect

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.070
psychiatric illnesses, there
was a sense that, you know,

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:19.560
we were all just biochemical air bags,

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.733
and you could kind of
move the bag this way

00:36:24.733 --> 00:36:27.360
or move the bag that way, but
it didn't have anything to do

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.050
with human choice or intention.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:33.140
- So in the book, you
wind up really focusing

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.930
on the psychiatrist, but
not on the mentally ill.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:38.763
- That's right.

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:41.850
There was only a last chapter
in which I talked about

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:43.740
the cost to patients,

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.980
and I thought that the cost was greatest

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.900
to the most ill patients.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.620
If you have somebody with depression,

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.760
serious depressive disorder,

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.853
relatively common experience for folks,

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:02.140
if you attribute that depression

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.658
not to anything that anybody did,

00:37:04.658 --> 00:37:09.300
or not to any way which
you were disappointed

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.040
by somebody else's action,

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.600
but you simply see it as a brainstorm,

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.630
and you take a medication,

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.080
and the depression goes away,

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:19.083
you're fine.

00:37:20.866 --> 00:37:23.890
You don't have to think
about morality at all.

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:26.810
You don't have to think about
anyone's responsibility,

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.310
you don't have to think about yourself

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.133
as a choosing agentic person.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.370
You come back to baseline.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.670
You don't have to worry
about the disorder.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:38.790
If you think about

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.120
a serious illness, like schizophrenia,

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.053
as a matter of a broken brain,

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.250
you remove all moral
personhood from that person

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:51.570
because their brain is broken

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.397
and they're never gonna
get back to baseline,

00:37:53.397 --> 00:37:55.530
and it turns out that
that's a little exaggerated.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.940
Some people do come back to baseline.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.960
Many more people recover
than we, and in fact,

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.120
give them credit for doing.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.600
But in representing people
who are chronically ill

00:38:08.744 --> 00:38:10.870
as having faulty brains,

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:13.830
we just take their
selfhood away from them.

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.590
- It's interesting because, in a way,

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:20.590
in this book, you are
observing the observers,

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:26.210
and you are looking at how they learn

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:31.210
to judge what is wrong with
this particular patient,

00:38:31.702 --> 00:38:35.490
and their choices about
what's wrong with this patient

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:37.790
are affected by their training.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:39.640
- Sure, right, yeah.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.990
- So in a way, it would seem to be

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:49.970
taking another cut if
this problem of observing

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.713
and being respectful of a body of people

00:38:52.713 --> 00:38:54.283
who, in this case, are ill.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:39:00.150
- Yeah, I mean, I wasn't
holding psychiatry to blame.

00:39:00.616 --> 00:39:03.820
I was thinking about these
great cultural shifts

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.990
that shaped the way that
people think about the body,

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.873
and think about the soul, and
think about other persons.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.630
- Next, you did a book on evangelicals.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:15.520
- [Tanya] I did.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.930
- Was that hard to get into,

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:22.930
or was that something that
your background made easier?

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.070
- Well, I was always puzzled

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:31.520
by the power of the response I saw

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.970
to people training to be magicians.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.200
I wanted to understand it more deeply,

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.460
and one of the things I learned

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.590
from hanging out with psychiatrists

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:43.640
is that there were ways to ask
those questions more deeply.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:48.220
And I've acquired a more
psychological sophistication

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.160
in thinking about the way
that certain practices

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.563
changed your mental experience.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.453
So I did this project,

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:04.080
in part, motivated because
the kinds of things

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.950
that the Christians said to me

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.290
was very much the kinds of things

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.103
that the witches said to me.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.697
The Christians said, "If
you want to know God,

00:40:12.697 --> 00:40:13.763
"you've got to pray.

00:40:14.667 --> 00:40:18.937
"Prayer is hard, and it's gonna take work,

00:40:18.937 --> 00:40:20.607
"and it will change you.

00:40:20.607 --> 00:40:23.200
"Some people will change
more than others."

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.550
And they talked about that change

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.840
in ways that was quite similar to the way

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.600
that the witches talked about change.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.600
In some ways, what they
said was very different.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.340
There's a whole theological language

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.350
that the witches and
magicians did not use,

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:44.730
but they would even sometimes
say that prayer practice

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.160
led to sharper mental imagery,

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.660
and that was very interesting.

00:40:48.885 --> 00:40:50.710
That's not the kind of thing that you say

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:53.840
because you want a signal
that you're a pious person.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:58.840
And so, that's what
led me into that world.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:04.570
I felt I'd learned something
from the psychiatric work

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:08.660
that would help me to think
more deeply about the puzzle

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.910
I was left with as the
result of the magical work,

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:17.890
and I thought I could
begin to solve that puzzle,

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:21.690
or explain that puzzle, by
looking at evangelicals.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.410
And one of the things that's really clear

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.060
about evangelical
Christianity is you can't say

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.500
that they're a bunch of oddballs

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.740
the way you can say about witches.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.530
You could say that witches
aren't very important.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.020
I mean, who's a witch?

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.410
Arguably, more people in Berkeley

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.580
than other parts of the
world, but you know.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:40.220
It's like you can't say,
to a group that constitutes

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.140
something like 40% of
the American population,

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:43.980
these are oddballs.

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.040
You have to take their
experience seriously.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.510
- Now, how did you go about studying it?

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:50.300
Did you actually join a church,

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.170
become a participant in a
church, and which church?

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:54.860
- So, I joined something called the,

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.130
or I went to the Vineyard
Christian Fellowship,

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:03.130
and it really represents the
way that American Christianity

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.133
shifted after the Vietnam War,

00:42:07.606 --> 00:42:10.030
you know, with all of these shifts,

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:14.090
towards a God who's
experienced more intimately

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:18.730
and immediately, and more
powerfully, more experientially.

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:21.980
And so the Vineyard is one of
these churches that grew up

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.300
out of the hippie Christians,

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.120
and turns out they had
a big effect on the way

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.870
that the American Christian
Church has changed.

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:36.770
And this is a church that
encourages you to experience God

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.143
as interacting with you.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.400
The Christian God has
always been understood

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.920
as an interactive God,

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.660
but sometimes, it wasn't
for everybody in the church.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.240
And this church really invites
you to have a personal,

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.780
intimate, and conversational
relationship with God.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.340
So I went searching for a
church, found the Vineyard,

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.340
and then started going to the Vineyard.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:06.170
- And you're arguing that

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:09.190
you observed the practice

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:11.423
changing the mind,

00:43:12.895 --> 00:43:16.820
so it's not as if you're reading the Bible

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.800
and memorizing the Bible,

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.380
and developing a set of ideas,

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:26.150
but it's by doing the work of prayer

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:30.563
that you then open your mind to God.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:32.860
Talk a little about that.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.140
- So I should say that the Bible

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.512
is still pretty darn important.

00:43:36.512 --> 00:43:38.860
What people are trying to do, in effect,

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.760
which is something the
early church fathers

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.270
and the Medieval clerics did,

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:45.090
they're trying to replace
ordinary human imagination

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:47.370
with imagination of the Scriptures.

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:50.230
But what people are doing

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.640
is they're trying to
experience God as talking back

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.690
in what I would call
these imaginal dialogues.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:01.650
So this is a term that
somebody like Mary Watkins

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:04.990
or Frederic Myers used to
describe these conversations

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.340
we have with other people
who aren't present.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.840
You talk to your dog, you talk
to yourself in the mirror,

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.590
you talk to your mom who's
not present, you talk to God.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:17.420
And they use the word
imaginal to describe the fact

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.860
that these inner voice conversations,

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.250
you've got to use your imagination

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.130
to have those conversations,

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:26.590
but the person having the conversation

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:28.560
doesn't necessarily think that it is

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.740
an imaginary experience.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:35.740
And so, when people come
into a church like this,

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:40.120
they seek to come to experience themselves

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:44.450
as hearing, talking to God
in prayer about anything,

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:48.030
about, you know, their exam on Friday,

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.390
about their bad date the previous night,

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:53.060
about where they want to go on vacation,

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:57.150
I mean, all the stuff you
talk to a best friend about,

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.430
even maybe more than you
talk to a best friend about,

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:04.470
and you really want to hear
what God has to say about that.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.590
And so, people experience
that in many different

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:08.513
kinds of ways.

00:45:09.825 --> 00:45:11.800
Sometimes, people experience God

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.520
very actively, talking back and forth,

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.120
and some people don't.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.350
But you're really trying
to create this experience

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:21.030
in which God is talking back,

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:23.280
you recognize his voice in your mind,

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.450
and that conversation you're having is not

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.360
anchored in your imagination.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.940
It's rooted in the world in some ways,

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:33.933
and so you've got to learn how to do that.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.420
First of all, you've got
to hold the conversation.

00:45:40.899 --> 00:45:44.685
A pastor says things like,
"Have a cup of coffee with God."

00:45:44.685 --> 00:45:46.380
You know, you have your cup of coffee,

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.140
pour a second cup of coffee for God.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.240
Sit there at the table with
the two cups of coffee.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.920
It'll help you have this conversation,

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.990
and just talk to God and see
whether anything happens.

00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:01.050
For something to happen,
you've got to pick out

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:03.670
a thought in your mind
that you might have thought

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:07.230
as being your own mind, your own thought,

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.770
but you learn to recognize
is not self-authored,

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:12.400
but other-authored.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.070
And so, there are
certain thoughts you have

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.100
that are good candidates for this.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.460
So, you know, you're talking to God,

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.760
and you're having this conversation,

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.150
and maybe you're sort of
making up what God says,

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:29.180
and then a word pops into
your mind, you know, Christy.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.410
I should call Christy.

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:31.860
God wants me to call Christy.

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.810
If a thought is spontaneous,

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:40.580
you weren't thinking about it at the time,

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.250
it feels louder than other thoughts,

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:46.070
it's a better candidate
to be a thought from God.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.717
If it's in accord with
Scripture, the pastor will say,

00:46:49.717 --> 00:46:52.717
"If God tells you to jump
off a bridge, it's not God.

00:46:52.717 --> 00:46:54.517
"You've made a misidentification."

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:57.370
The thought should make you feel good,

00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:00.273
because in this church,
God is good and loving.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.620
He loves you, you should feel loved.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.960
And then you should kinda
check it out with other people,

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.510
get them to pray about it with you,

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:11.670
or see whether you can confirm
the experience in other ways.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:13.720
So that's the first thing that people do.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:20.820
They begin to discern how
God is speaking to them,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.860
they practice, practice, practice,

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:27.900
they use their imagination
to represent God,

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.830
and they develop very
complicated ideas about

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.430
when it's God and when it's not God.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:35.660
So if God is speaking to you in your mind,

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.200
you are extremely, you know,

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.680
I know that secular liberals
get very freaked out

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.420
by that idea, you know.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.110
George Bush said that God
told him to invade Iraq

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:46.513
makes people very anxious.

00:47:48.653 --> 00:47:52.000
But I thought the people
were really pretty thoughtful

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.400
about all the stuff that
intervened between them and God.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.950
Then they had this really rich sense

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:03.370
that they could be wrong,
maybe it's not God,

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.780
maybe it's their own desire,
maybe God's not telling them

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:09.623
to go out with so-and-so,
maybe they just wanna do that.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:14.110
- How do we distinguish,

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:16.410
'cause a secularist would
look at this and say

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:21.100
either these people are being
brainwashed, on the one hand,

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.860
or very demeaning and say,
you know, they're crazy,

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:27.270
they're like mentally ill people.

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:31.580
How do you distinguish
between these categories

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:36.580
of a discipline talking to God
to somebody who hears voices

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:39.480
and loses control, on the one hand,

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.000
and on the other hand, people
who are being brainwashed,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.360
basically, by their ministry?

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.543
- I wouldn't call it brainwashed.

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:58.690
People come to these
churches and sometimes,

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:01.370
the pastors of these churches
will hold political views,

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:03.622
or other people hold political views,

00:49:03.622 --> 00:49:05.490
that seem very comfortable to people,

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:06.860
to newcomers to the church,

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.390
and other observers become very agitated

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:13.270
by those political views for, you know,

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:14.820
reasons that aren't surprising.

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:21.670
The really kind of
complicated question, I think,

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:24.630
is the relationship
between these practices

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:27.160
where people are schooling
and disciplining their mind

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.800
and mental illness.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.170
And I think that in some crude sense,

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:36.910
it's an easy distinction because
people who are mentally ill

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.000
are often very unhappy.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.720
They feel there's something going wrong,

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.650
and their voices aren't
telling them things

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:47.980
that are consonant, they're
not in accord with Scripture,

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:52.450
is what a Christian would say,
or they have very odd ideas.

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:55.800
And often, particularly
the person who is having

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.220
these back and forth
conversations who meets criteria

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:02.170
for a diagnosis like schizophrenia,

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:04.750
they have auditory experiences,

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:07.600
and those auditory experiences
are really pretty disturbing.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.000
So in general, you got folks in church,

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.070
they're having inner voice conversations,

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:19.070
they're seeking to
sculpt those experiences

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.920
so that they are

00:50:22.676 --> 00:50:24.827
helpful, healthful, happy, whatever,

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:30.853
and very, very rarely do they
have an auditory experience.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.120
Turns out these are not so uncommon

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.900
in the context of the general population.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.040
If they do, it's short, it's
rare, and it's startling,

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.440
but it's not distressing.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.523
So you're driving along the road,

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:49.427
and God pipes up out of
the backseat and says,

00:50:49.427 --> 00:50:51.380
"I will always be with you."

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.960
Kinda great.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.710
You're a little startled,
you're a little freaked out,

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:57.520
but it's kinda great.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:01.830
Somebody who is psychotic
and hearing voices,

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:03.980
they are hearing not six words,

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.980
but they're hearing
paragraphs, conversations,

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:13.473
voices all the time, 700
voices, a cloud of voices.

00:51:15.967 --> 00:51:20.460
And what those voices say, it's
really pretty awful usually.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.250
I mean, really terrible, terrible things.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:26.810
And so, there's this very
crude anD obvious difference.

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:31.810
What's messier is that line

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:36.570
where people probably meet
criteria for schizophrenia,

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:37.790
but they're really holding themselves

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:38.840
together really well,

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.170
and maybe they pass.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.960
And so, we could we could
talk more about that.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.020
I do think that these
mind management techniques

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.790
are at the heart of therapy,

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:52.630
they're at the heart of mindfulness.

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:56.190
These are techniques people
use to manage their anxiety,

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:59.700
and sometimes, they help
people who are vulnerable.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:04.700
- You make a comparison with
what's called, in fiction,

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:09.520
magical realism, that in some ways,

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.240
these communities you're talking about

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.230
are versions of that, that
they're applied to real life.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:17.090
- Yeah.

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:20.460
So if you think about magical realism,

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.380
what it does is a technique.

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.890
You drop in supernatural magical stuff

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:27.960
as if it's just there.

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.730
You don't mark it as something
special and different.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:33.410
That's how you're supposed
to be experiencing God,

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:35.870
as if he's right there.

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:39.770
I know exactly where he
is, and there's a sense

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:44.480
that you're trying to
create that for yourself.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.987
So people calmly and
casually say things like,

00:52:48.987 --> 00:52:51.793
"Well, you know, the other
day, God told me to X.

00:52:52.647 --> 00:52:55.727
"Oh, the other day, I really felt that God

00:52:55.727 --> 00:52:58.337
"strongly said to me that I should do Y."

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:04.430
And you're at church and
you sing a worship song,

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:06.473
and you pause for God to talk to people.

00:53:08.992 --> 00:53:11.630
And the idea is to really let God not be

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:16.010
part of 45 minutes on every Sunday

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:18.470
in which you think a little
bit about the Scripture,

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:22.580
but somehow, an ongoing
presence in your life.

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.730
I started asking people whether God

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:26.760
was like an imaginary friend,

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.430
and I had in mind the
10-year-old, or the six-year-old,

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:33.390
you know, you have to
keep a place at the table

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:35.360
for the imaginary companion.

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:39.210
And people would say, "Oh,
yes, but he's not imaginary."

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:41.320
So he's kind of real in the world,

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.643
and that's what you're aiming for.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.790
It's a complicated dance because

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.070
it's hard not to notice
that God is invisible.

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:57.040
And in fact, adults behaved with God

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.720
kind of the way young children

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.453
behave with invisible friends.

00:54:03.503 --> 00:54:05.710
You set a place at the table for God,

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:07.390
and sometimes you don't.

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:11.740
And maybe on Tuesday morning,
it's really, really important

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:13.960
to you that you've been experiencing God,

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.160
and you just kind of
forget that he's there.

00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:20.820
It takes a certain
amount of work and effort

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.330
to keep God always in mind,

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:27.130
and that's kind of central
to the action of this church.

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.940
That's what they're
trying to do to get you

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.650
to keep God always in mind.

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:35.410
- Is there a lesson or
two that you've learned

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:38.020
from these experiences

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:43.060
by observing these communities,

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:45.090
empathizing with them,

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:47.460
and these are communities

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:49.470
that at least part of the population

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:53.990
would be dismissive of, and
not understand the richness

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:55.330
of what's going on?

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:58.330
- Yeah, I mean, one of
the bluntest lessons

00:54:58.330 --> 00:55:02.593
is that mind management, to
use a secular term, works,

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:05.690
and it works more effectively

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:10.680
if you can carry God with you

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.990
and believe that God is external to you.

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:15.690
So if you think about
what people are doing

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:18.463
as being something that's
a lot like therapy,

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:25.030
you know, you're kind of
building this external being up,

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.410
using all your best examples of loving,

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:29.900
caring, thoughtful, wise people.

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.590
And you've got the community around you,

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:33.480
the real people around
you, trying to persuade you

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.990
that this representation,
this God, this is really real,

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:41.150
and you give yourself time to consult God

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:43.050
when you're anxious or scared,

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:45.800
or something lousy has happened,

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:49.520
and you allow this God to remind you

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.332
that the world's good, you're loved,

00:55:51.332 --> 00:55:53.963
life is lovely, life is beautiful.

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:56.650
That's kinda great.

00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:59.620
We have abundant evidence
that going to church

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.850
is good for you, on
average, statistically.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:06.010
We don't understand this
fully, but on average,

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:07.903
you go to church once a week,

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:10.710
you live two to three years longer.

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:15.710
It's not quite as good as 30
minutes of exercise every day,

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.320
but it's pretty darn good.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.923
That's really striking.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.040
- One final question.

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:27.860
Is there something that
secularists could learn

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.263
from what you've studied,

00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:36.560
as they deal with fundamentalists

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.580
and evangelicals in politics?

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:40.730
In other words, is there a lesson

00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:46.690
that might create a common ground here

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:47.870
in the future?

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:48.703
- Yeah.

00:56:48.703 --> 00:56:50.110
I mean, there are a couple of lessons.

00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:54.300
First of all, the evangelical
community is more complicated

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.743
and more diverse than most
secular liberals imagine.

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:04.460
There are many green evangelicals,

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:06.380
there are many liberal evangelicals,

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:09.633
there are many evangelicals
who voted for Obama,

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:15.490
not most evangelicals, but
even in the last election,

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:18.580
where it was when 80%
of the evangelical vote

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.560
was for the Republican ticket,

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.963
it's like one in five.

00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:28.140
That's a lot more than
most people imagine.

00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:32.700
Many evangelicals are more well-educated

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:35.450
and more sophisticated
than people imagine.

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:38.010
And I think the basic lesson that

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:44.820
the experience of God
is not a mistaken belief

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.560
that people carry with
them because they're dumb,

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:52.380
but a rich practice in
which people are using

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:56.250
an experience of God in order
to feel more comfortable

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:58.340
and at ease in the world.

00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:01.280
I think that's really important
because I think it helps,

00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:05.330
in having these conversations, to see that

00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:08.010
there's something smart and sophisticated

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:10.210
that somebody else is doing.

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:12.510
Evangelical world is a
very complicated world,

00:58:15.848 --> 00:58:18.200
and that's just a real
truth about the world.

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.730
And sometimes, the things that people say

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:24.880
get up my nose too.

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.750
That doesn't mean that it's true

00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:29.340
for all of the community.

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.460
- Well, on that note, Professor Luhrmann,

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:35.090
I want to thank you for being
here today on our program.

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:38.270
Fascinating account of your
intellectual journey, thank you.

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:39.860
- Thank you very much for having me.

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:41.730
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:44.262
for this Conversation with History.

00:58:44.262 --> 00:58:47.762
