00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.238
Let's try another problem where we find the lowest common denominator. You'll

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:08.560
need to factor these denominators first, since they're not just monomials. As a

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.146
hint, your LCD will contain a constant and two binomials. And you'll want to

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:16.902
make sure you leave it in factored form. I know you might not have seen this

00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:21.737
before, but I want you to give it a try. If you get stuck, there's always this

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:22.470
solution.
