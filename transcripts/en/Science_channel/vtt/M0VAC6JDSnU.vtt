00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.567
Narrator:
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STEAMING FOOD
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:11.000
ONCE UPON A TIME, STEAMERS
WERE MADE OUT OF CLAY POTS

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.901
WITH PERFORATED FLOORS.

00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:15.667
TODAY, WE'VE COME UP
WITH ALL SORTS OF METAL

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:17.300
AND PLASTIC INNOVATIONS.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.200
THE TRADITIONAL BAMBOO STEAMER
IS A PERFECT BALANCE

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.501
BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.033
PERFECTED BY
GENERATIONS OF CRAFTSMEN,

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.901
TRADITIONAL BAMBOO STEAMERS ARE

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:31.734
LIGHTWEIGHT, STRONG,
AND DURABLE.

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:34.167
THEY LOOK LIKE
SIMPLE COOKING TOOLS,

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.968
BUT BUILDING THEM REQUIRES
ENORMOUS ARTISANAL SKILL.

00:00:37.968 --> 00:00:42.167
THE CRAFTSMAN BUYS LENGTHS
OF BAMBOO FROM LOCAL FARMERS.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.400
HE USES A TRADITIONAL PLANER
HE CRAFTED HIMSELF

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.968
TO SMOOTH THE BAMBOO JOINTS.

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:54.501
A CUSTOMIZED CHOPPER TOOL HELPS
HIM SPLIT THE BAMBOO LENGTHWISE.

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:59.234
HE INSERTS A BAMBOO STICK
TO HOLD THE SPLIT OPEN.

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:02.334
AFTER REMOVING THE CHOPPER,
HE PULLS ON THE STICK

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:05.167
TO SPLIT
THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE BAMBOO.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:10.734
THE CRAFTSMAN SPLITS
THE SECTIONS AGAIN.

00:01:10.734 --> 00:01:12.601
TO ASSEMBLE THE STEAMER BASE,

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:16.400
THE CRAFTSMAN WILL SPLIT
THE BAMBOO INTO 32 PIECES.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.467
THE COVER WILL REQUIRE
128 PIECES.

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:26.167
A CUSTOM-MADE KNIFE KNOCKS DOWN
THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE BAMBOO.

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:27.868
FOR THE STEAMER'S COVER,

00:01:27.868 --> 00:01:31.067
THE CRAFTSMAN SPLITS
THE BAMBOO HORIZONTALLY.

00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:38.167
NEXT, THE CRAFTSMAN USES THIS
SLICING TOOL TO CUT THE WOOD.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.567
HE SETS THE DESIRED WIDTH

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:45.801
AND SLICES A THIN SHEET
OF WOOD LENGTHWISE.

00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:53.167
HE USES THIS SECTION OF WOOD
TO FORM THE BASE OF THE STEAMER

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:56.934
AND SLIDES A BAMBOO RING
OVER IT TO HOLD IT IN PLACE.

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:04.567
THEN, HE PUNCHES SMALL HOLES
WITH A DRILL...

00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:10.200
...AND REINFORCES THE JOINT
WITH STAINLESS-STEEL WIRE.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.067
THE INSTALLATION PROCESS
BEGINS --

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:19.033
FIRST, BY INSTALLING
A SERIES OF INNER RINGS

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:22.434
WHICH WILL SERVE TO REINFORCE
THE STRUCTURE OF THE STEAMER

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:27.000
AND TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE LEVELS
OF STEAMERS INSIDE IT.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.767
THE CRAFTSMAN USES
SPECIAL TECHNIQUES TO ENSURE

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:34.267
THAT EACH JOINT IS PERFECTLY
ALIGNED FOR MAXIMUM STRENGTH.

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:38.567
WORKING ALMOST ENTIRELY BY HAND
WITH SKILLS ACQUIRED OVER TIME,

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:40.968
HE METICULOUSLY CREATES
A STRONG,

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:43.534
YET LIGHTWEIGHT PIECE
OF KITCHEN EQUIPMENT.

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:52.400
THE BASKET STILL NEEDS A BOTTOM
TO REST DUMPLINGS IN.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.334
THE CRAFTSMAN BEGINS BUILDING
THE BASKET FLOOR

00:02:55.334 --> 00:02:59.133
BY CUSTOM-FITTING
A SERIES OF RUGGED CROSSPIECES.

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:03.033
HE ENSURES THAT EACH PIECE FITS
PERFECTLY BEFORE PROCEEDING.

00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:08.801
THEN, HE INSERTS THIN,
MORE PLIABLE PIECES OF BAMBOO

00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:11.200
TO HOLD
THE CROSSPIECES IN PLACE.

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:16.868
NEXT, HE LAYS THE FINAL LAYER
ON TOP,

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:19.033
PLACING THE PIECES
WITH THEIR OUTER SIDES

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:22.501
FACING UP TO FORM
A SMOOTH SURFACE FOR FOOD

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:24.501
TO SIT ON WHILE STEAMING.

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.534
WITH THE FLOOR OF THE STEAMER
IN PLACE,

00:03:30.534 --> 00:03:32.567
IT'S TIME TO SECURE
THE UPPER PIECES

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:35.300
BY BINDING THEM
TO THE SUPPORT PIECES.

00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:42.334
TO DO THIS, HE THREADS
A STAINLESS-STEEL WIRE

00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:43.534
THROUGH THE CRACKS,

00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:46.167
TWISTING THE ENDS TIGHTLY
TO THE BASE.

00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:51.334
THEN, HE GIVES
THE INNER SUPPORT RINGS

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:52.667
UNDER THE STEAMER FLOOR

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:55.968
A FEW TAPS,
SECURING THEM IN PLACE.

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:58.634
THE BASKET'S BASE
IS NOW COMPLETE.

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:04.000
NEXT, THE CRAFTSMAN BEGINS

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.801
WEAVING THE BAMBOO PIECES
TOGETHER

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:07.667
THAT WILL FORM THE COVER.

00:04:09.868 --> 00:04:14.801
HE USES A TRADITIONAL PATTERN
CALLED A TWILL WEAVE.

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:18.801
THEN, HE INSERTS PAPER BEFORE
ADDING A SECOND LAYER OF BAMBOO.

00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:24.667
THE PAPER WILL HELP PREVENT
STEAM FROM ESCAPING

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:26.701
THE BASKET TOO QUICKLY.

00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:30.534
HE THEN SNAPS IN A SERIES OF
CAREFULLY SIZED REINFORCEMENTS

00:04:30.534 --> 00:04:32.601
TO KEEP THE LAYERS IN PLACE.

00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:38.667
FINALLY, HE CUSTOM-FITS
ANOTHER INTERIOR RING

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:41.767
UNDER THE REINFORCEMENTS
TO HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER,

00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:44.367
TAPPING IT
CAREFULLY INTO POSITION.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.501
THE STEAMER COVER
IS NOW COMPLETE.

00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:51.133
