00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.090
So I've been requested to do
the proof of the derivative of

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.300
the square root of x, so I
thought I would do a quick

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.300
video on the proof of the
derivative of the

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.370
square root of x.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.680
So we know from the definition
of a derivative that the

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:22.280
derivative of the function
square root of x, that is equal

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.520
to-- let me switch colors, just
for a variety-- that's equal to

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.080
the limit as delta
x approaches 0.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.595
And you know, some people
say h approaches 0,

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:36.360
or d approaches 0.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.450
I just use delta x.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.450
So the change in x over 0.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.830
And then we say f of x
plus delta x, so in this

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.910
case this is f of x.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:52.260
So it's the square root of x
plus delta x minus f of x,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.640
which in this case it's
square root of x.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.140
All of that over the change
in x, over delta x.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.580
Right now when I look at that,
there's not much simplification

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.945
I can do to make this come out
with something meaningful.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.540
I'm going to multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.790
by the conjugate of the
numerator is what

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.200
I mean by that.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.480
Let me rewrite it.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.740
Limit is delta x approaching
0-- I'm just rewriting

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.280
what I have here.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.650
So I said the square root
of x plus delta x minus

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.610
square root of x.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.200
All of that over delta x.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.490
And I'm going to multiply
that-- after switching colors--

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.840
times square root of x plus
delta x plus the square root of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.260
x, over the square root of x
plus delta x plus the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.250
square root of x.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.420
This is just 1, so I could of
course multiply that times-- if

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.110
we assume that x and delta x
aren't both 0, this is a

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.090
defined number and
this will be 1.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.010
And we can do that.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.130
This is 1/1, we're just
multiplying it times this

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.900
equation, and we get limit
as delta x approaches 0.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.510
This is a minus b
times a plus b.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.360
Let me do little aside here.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.880
Let me say a plus b times
a minus b is equal to a

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.150
squared minus b squared.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.600
So this is a plus b
times a minus b.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.410
So it's going to be
equal to a squared.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.010
So what's this quantity squared
or this quantity squared,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.180
either one, these are my a's.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.450
Well it's just going
to be x plus delta x.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.430
So we get x plus delta x.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.050
And then what's b squared?

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.380
So minus square root of
x is b in this analogy.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.640
So square root of x
squared is just x.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.760
And all of that over delta
x times square root of x

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.210
plus delta x plus the
square root of x.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.900
Let's see what
simplification we can do.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.580
Well we have an x and
then a minus x, so those

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.480
cancel out. x minus x.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.460
And then we're left in the
numerator and the denominator,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.690
all we have is a delta x here
and a delta x here, so let's

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.770
divide the numerator and the
denominator by delta x.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.822
So this goes to 1,
this goes to 1.

00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:26.350
And so this equals the limit--
I'll write smaller, because I'm

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:34.920
running out of space-- limit as
delta x approaches 0 of 1 over.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.780
And of course we can only do
this assuming that delta--

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.220
well, we're dividing by delta
x to begin with, so we know

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.420
it's not 0, it's just
approaching zero.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:50.320
So we get square root
of x plus delta x plus

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.860
the square root of x.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.550
And now we can just
directly take the limit

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.410
as it approaches 0.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.440
We can just set delta
x as equal to 0.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.140
That's what it's approaching.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.260
So then that equals one
over the square root of x.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.790
Right, delta x is 0, so
we can ignore that.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.120
We could take the limit
all the way to 0.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.000
And then this is of course just
a square root of x here plus

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.160
the square root of x,
and that equals 1 over

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.350
2 square root of x.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.890
And that equals 1/2x
to the negative 1/2.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.900
So we just proved that x to the
1/2 power, the derivative of it

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.220
is 1/2x to the negative 1/2,
and so it is consistent with

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.700
the general property that the
derivative of-- oh I don't

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:50.850
know-- the derivative of x to
the n is equal to nx to the n

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.150
minus 1, even in this case
where the n was 1/2.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.100
Well hopefully
that's satisfying.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.960
I didn't prove it for all
fractions but this is a start.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.120
This is a common one you
see, square root of x, and

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.770
it's hopefully not too
complicated for proof.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.180
I will see you in
future videos.
