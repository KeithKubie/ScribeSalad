conversation and people had to become

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120
conversation and people had to become
 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.089

and open to some level of discomfort one
 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.509
and open to some level of discomfort one
of the things we asked for from the

having a productive conversation it's
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.280
having a productive conversation it's
not so much that people go negative but

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
not so much that people go negative but
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.679
