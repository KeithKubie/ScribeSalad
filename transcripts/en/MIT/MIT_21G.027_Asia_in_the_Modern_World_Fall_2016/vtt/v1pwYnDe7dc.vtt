SHIGERU MIYAGAWA: MIT
recently did a study

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.310
of future of MIT education.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.580
And right at the top,
what we have to do

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.830
is to teach teamwork
and leadership

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.560
above technical skills.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.750
And the neat thing
about getting students

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.670
to work with visual
materials, is

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.970
that because there's so much
information, that you've

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.232
got to work in teams.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.740
Just having one
perspective is interesting,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.650
but having two perspectives
is really interesting.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.220
And having multiple perspectives
on the same material

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.450
is just extraordinary,
and people debate.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.970
This is something else, the
idea of critical thinking.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.750
You really debate based
on whatever evidence

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.670
you can find in the image,
and historical and cultural

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.530
knowledge that you gain from
your readings and the video.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.470
And so the idea of teamwork
really comes into play.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.250
And you can see people
playing leadership roles.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.580
And people sort of switch
leaders and leadership

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.230
as they go from one
image to the next,

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.610
depending on what they feel
comfortable talking about.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.510
Here's some things to keep
in mind about incorporating

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.260
visual materials.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.400
The first thing that one should
know, we know this already,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.790
is that young people are
exposed to visual materials

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.610
by the ton on a daily basis.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.690
And yet, they are never
taught how to interpret them.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.360
What happens with visual
materials, is that you go in,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.950
you react emotionally,
and then you come out.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.690
Without carefully
analyzing the content.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.260
Unlike written material.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.560
Written material, you have
to go through word by word

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.780
and think about what is this?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.310
What does this say?

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:06.600
And so it's critical that we
teach how to read visuals.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.780
That's one point.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.740
The second point is that there's
a ton of visuals out there.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.850
You have to curate them.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.950
You can't just throw students
into this collection of visuals

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.740
without some sense of knowing
where those visuals come from.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.730
If you want students
to publish the visuals,

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.230
then you have to
think about copyright.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.730
And students should be
taught about copyright.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.630
What things you
can and cannot do.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.350
So these are all
21st century skills

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.334
that you can teach
with visual material.
