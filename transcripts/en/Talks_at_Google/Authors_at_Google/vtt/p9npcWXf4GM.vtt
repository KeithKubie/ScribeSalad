00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.550
RON LIEBER: Hi, y'all.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.050
Thanks so much for coming.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.610
I want to start by telling
you a little bit about how

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.170
that boy with that hair became
this guy with a little bit

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.820
less hair, and became somebody
who was obsessed with money

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.980
for a living, but also obsessed
with talking to kids about it.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.180
And it happened because
of something that happened

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.730
to me and to our family.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.230
That's my brother
David right there.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.910
He's a Googler who keeps
the world safe for you

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.102
guys in Washington, DC.

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:40.060
With all the people who
are trying to regulate,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.269
you have to do that.

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.310
So you have him to thank
for-- wait, what was it?

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.770
Permission list innovation.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.510
Yeah, David keeps the world safe
for permission list innovation.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.610
So anyway, that's
me at 10 or 11.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.920
When I was about 12, when
David was about seven

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.012
and his twin sister was
seven, our parents split up.

00:00:58.012 --> 00:00:59.970
If any of you guys have
been through a divorce,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.250
you know that it can
change things financially.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.010
It can change things
emotionally, too.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.680
But financially, what happens
is that one household turns

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.840
into two.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.772
That itself often causes a
decline in general standard

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:14.480
of living, because
the two houses usually

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.280
are not separately as
nice as the one house was.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.350
So it starts there.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.270
At the same time, one of
our parents lost their job.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.120
And it was another
10 or 15 years

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.680
until our family got back to
where we had been economically

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.000
before.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.090
So we were lucky
in some respects.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.480
We went to a really terrific
private school in Chicago

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.880
the community rallied around.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.850
All of us Lieber kids
went on financial aid.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.730
It was completely seamless.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.340
But four years later, I
was ready to go to college.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.000
I was ready to
apply for college.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.590
I knew I would
need financial aid.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.260
I didn't know very much
about how the system worked.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.430
Neither did my mother.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.060
But what happened
right at that moment

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.900
when I was a senior
in high school

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.089
was that my mother,
somebody slipper her--

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:56.630
we still don't even
know who it was--

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.160
somebody slipped her the phone
number of a guy who could help.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.210
And it turned out,
this guy-- and his name

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.710
has been lost to
history, although I

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.197
am this close to tracking
it down as we speak,

00:02:09.197 --> 00:02:11.280
because I need tell him
that I've been out talking

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.380
about him-- this guy
was an Assistant Dean

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.430
of Financial Aid at Northwestern
University, about 10 miles

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.860
north of where we lived.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.670
And what we were told was that
this guy knew all the tricks

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.470
to the financial aid system.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.250
So we went to see this guy.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.220
He takes us into his
office at Northwestern.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.110
It's 5:01 PM on a weekday.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.140
All of his colleagues
are gone so that they

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.580
don't know what he's doing.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.650
He closes the door.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.020
He locks it behind them.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.050
We put $100 on his
desk, and he proceeds

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.130
to explain to us all of the
secrets of the financial aid

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.550
system.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.040
He wasn't encouraging
us to break the law.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.330
He was just explaining--
this number goes here,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.290
and this number goes
here, and if you really

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.560
want to make yourself look
as attractive as possible

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.780
to the equations that the
financial aid deans are using--

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.560
this was
pre-algorithms-- he said

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.402
you put your numbers
in this place,

00:03:01.402 --> 00:03:03.360
and maybe you move your
money from this account

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.050
to that account.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.910
And it's all perfectly
legal, but it will help you.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.140
And it did.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.590
I got into college.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.080
I got a really generous
package of financial aid.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.540
I got out of school with under
$10,000 in student loan debt.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.960
It made a huge difference.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.710
And I learned a couple
of things from that

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.810
that turned out to be really
important to me later in life.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.920
First of all, I
learned that the world

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.590
is filled with complex
systems involving money,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.170
and that they are made
to be hacked, legally.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.860
And the second part
was the mere fact

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.850
that my mother had even
taken me along for that ride

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.182
in the first place, because
she didn't have to, right?

00:03:45.182 --> 00:03:46.890
She could have just
put the financial aid

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.530
forms in front of me and
told to sign on line 127,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.390
and I would have had
to read the rest of it,

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.380
and she could have shielded
me from all of that.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.710
But she didn't.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.330
She knew that this was
going to affect my life even

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.740
more than it impacted hers.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.310
And she saw no reason
to hide from me.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.690
She had no shame about the fact
that we didn't have enough.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.010
She was, in fact, proud that
she was ingenious enough

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.670
to get the number for the guy.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.640
So I went along for the ride.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.870
I had a front row seat for
all of these machinations.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.029
Each and every year, in
fact, we met with the dean

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.130
at Amherst College, where I
intended to ask for more money.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.430
I was a part of the process.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.260
And so there is
no reason, really,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.140
to shield kids from this stuff.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.200
It impacted my life.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.130
It was important.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.830
I didn't think all that
much about that incident,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.170
that chapter of my
life, until much later.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.302
It was 2002.

00:04:42.302 --> 00:04:44.760
The Wall Street Journal was
starting their personal journal

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.860
section, the Consumer News
section that they still

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.350
run to this day.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.690
I got hired to work
for that section,

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.880
to write for that section.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.360
And what the editors there,
in the tradition of the very

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.000
best editors, what they did,
what they saw in me that I had

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.370
not seen in myself was they
said, Ron, your beat in life

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.050
and your beat in the newspaper
ought to be beating the system.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.410
And it all clicked for me.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.580
It was like windows opening up
in my brain all of a sudden.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.680
Because I remembered
what we had done

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.400
with financial aid,
and the fact that I

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.880
had spent all the
1990s exploiting

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.980
every last loophole of the
frequent flyer miles system--

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.380
that that was the person I was.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.160
It was the person I had become.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.180
It was the life's call
and the work calling

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.540
that I was growing into.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.112
So I became the
person at the journal

00:05:31.112 --> 00:05:33.570
who wrote the story about how
to return all of your wedding

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.380
gifts for cash,
which it turns out

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.630
is something that you can
do at certain select stores.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.360
And this information
had been traded

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.700
on the wedding underground,
but most people didn't know.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.280
And so I made sure
everybody knew it.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.020
Some of you may be aware that
yet another Yahoo is trying

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.220
to start helicopter service
from the heliport to JFK,

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.370
as if that's something
that makes sense to do.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.374
Well, it turns out,
the last time somebody

00:05:57.374 --> 00:06:00.040
tried to do this was right after
we started the Personal Journal

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.790
section.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.670
And I had a hunch
that taking the subway

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.630
would actually be faster
than taking the helicopter,

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.370
so we tested it.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.470
The subway beat the
helicopter by seven minutes.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.870
So how is that possible?

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.370
This is the question
my editor asked

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.700
before I asked him
for $250 so I could

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.285
take the helicopter myself.

00:06:19.285 --> 00:06:20.660
I said, what people
don't realize

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.370
is that you have to cross
town to get to the heliport.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.304
That could take 40
minutes at rush hour.

00:06:26.304 --> 00:06:27.720
And then you have
to wait for TSA,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.260
and then you have to
get on the helicopter,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.650
and then you have to
get off the helicopter.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.350
And what the helicopter
people do not tell

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.725
you is that there's only one
drop off for the helicopter.

00:06:34.725 --> 00:06:37.155
The helicopter doesn't
take off and land

00:06:37.155 --> 00:06:39.100
at each successive terminal.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.700
They just dump you
at terminal seven,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.366
and if your flight
is in terminal three,

00:06:42.366 --> 00:06:44.810
you'll be walking for
23 minutes to get there.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.390
So the subway beat
the helicopter,

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.760
and I became that person.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.500
And the journal realized
relatively quickly

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.070
after that that what I was doing
was actually personal finance.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.860
They had defined
personal finance earlier

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.424
than that as just investing.

00:06:58.424 --> 00:06:59.840
And they were very
good at writing

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.180
about investing, very good
at writing about the markets.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.910
But all this other stuff,
all of these different ways

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.160
that money hits you in the
wallet, that money hits you

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.440
in the brain, the connections
between money and emotions,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.102
and all the decisions that
we have to make-- this

00:07:13.102 --> 00:07:14.560
was something else
entirely, and we

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.829
realize that we should
write about it more.

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:18.620
Within a couple years,
"The New York Times"

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.661
noticed what I was doing.

00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:21.950
They hired me as their
personal finance columnist.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.450
I thought I was on
top of the world.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.530
I knew it all.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.170
And then I had a child.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.440
And there is nothing that
shakes up your worldview

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.960
or your self confidence
by being solely or duly

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.570
responsible for somebody else.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.600
And very quickly, within
just a couple of years,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.820
our daughter was asking us
a lot of really complicated,

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.570
cosmic questions about money.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.800
And I was tongue tied.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.800
I was tongue tied because
these money questions involve

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.660
a lot of deep seated emotions,
and feeling, and shame,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.540
and yearning, and envy, and
confusion about where we stand

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.910
and how we stack up.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.410
They were parenting
questions, too.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.120
This kid, my flesh and blood--
I wanted to imprint her

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.090
with all of my best values
and none of my bad habits--

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.790
was asking me these
intense questions.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.240
I wanted to get
the answer right.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.730
And even though I played
Dr. Money in the newspaper

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.280
on the weekends, I did not
know what to say to her.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.750
So I did what I
normally do now when

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.460
I don't know the answer
to a question-- I

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.010
asked the internet.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.500
And on a blog on
newyorktimes.com,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.210
I started posting some
of these questions

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.810
that I was hearing
about from kids.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.070
And I posted some answers,
some rough drafts.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.760
A bunch of commenters poured in.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.037
We would revise the answers.

00:08:38.037 --> 00:08:39.620
We had some pretty
good scripts going.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.107
But then right around the
time of Occupy Wall Street,

00:08:42.107 --> 00:08:44.190
I heard from a couple of
parents in the community,

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.170
greater New York City.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.520
They said to me, Ron,
we've got a problem here.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.400
In our community, the people
with more-- people with more

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.250
money than average, more
stuff, with bigger homes--

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.110
they're starting
to feel demonized.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.100
Some people at the
school and other parents

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.220
are starting to make comments
that the kids shouldn't take

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.920
taxis to school, that
they should stop talking

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.520
about their vacations when
they're on school property,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.300
that they should leave
their cell phones at home,

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.420
that the birthday party
should be less lavish.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.250
And those parents felt like
they were having to apologize,

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.300
not just for what they had,
but ultimately, who they were.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.116
And that didn't feel very good.

00:09:25.116 --> 00:09:27.880
And the people with less,
they were just as upset.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.370
They felt like their noses
were being rubbed deliberately

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.790
in other people's affluence
at a time when a lot of people

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.050
were really hurting.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.575
And the schools were
totally useless.

00:09:38.575 --> 00:09:40.950
Because to the extent that
they had diversity curriculums

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.530
at all, they were talking
almost entirely about race

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.350
and saying absolutely
nothing about social class.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.840
And it's a tough conversation
to have in New York City,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.300
particularly in
a private school.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.150
But even in some of
the private publics

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.410
where you need to
afford a $1 million

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.550
apartment or a
$5,000 monthly rent

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.829
to get into the school
district in the first place.

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:03.620
Because if you're having
that conversation,

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.180
then you are acknowledging
that 40%, 50%, 60%,

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:14.000
80% of the people in the
school are in the 1% or the 2%.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.650
And then you are
elite if not elitist.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.180
And that's a difficult thing
to reckon with, to really check

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.820
your privilege in that way.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.370
So those conversations weren't
going on at the schools.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.815
Parents were talking about it
in huddles on the sidelines.

00:10:28.815 --> 00:10:30.690
They saw what I was
writing in the newspaper,

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.689
and they said, Ron, you
should come in and speak

00:10:32.689 --> 00:10:34.792
to our entire parent
body and set everybody

00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:35.750
straight on this stuff.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.670
So I only hesitated
for one single second

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.020
before saying yes.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.137
And it wasn't because
I knew the answer,

00:10:46.137 --> 00:10:48.220
but it was because I knew
this was a fundamentally

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.870
new question in
personal finance,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.280
and I'm always
looking for those.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.500
Because the basics we've more or
less solved for at this point.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.810
You know you're supposed to
spend less than you make,

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.420
and get your estate in order,
get all those documents ready,

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.460
have enough insurance,
put a bunch of money away

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.220
for retirement-- maybe in index
funds, maybe in Google stock

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.180
if you have no
choice in the matter,

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.660
and you're not allowed to
sell, you're locked up right.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.317
So this is what we do.

00:11:13.317 --> 00:11:14.900
But this question,
this whole question

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.740
of how to deal with kids
and their pressing questions

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.080
about money, and
social class, and who

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.340
has more, and who has less,
and how that came to pass,

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.927
and whether it's fair--
this felt new to me.

00:11:27.927 --> 00:11:30.010
So I tried to figure out
what all of these parents

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.522
had in common.

00:11:31.522 --> 00:11:33.830
And I asked myself a question.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.570
I said, all right,
well, if it was you,

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.546
and you were trying to think
of the single worst word

00:11:39.546 --> 00:11:40.920
that somebody
might theoretically

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.480
use to describe your child, a
word that would be the biggest

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.880
indictment of your own, my own
parenting, what would it be?

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.650
And the first thing that
popped in my head was spoiled.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.090
And it wasn't so much because
it's the worst thing on Earth.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.410
I wouldn't want somebody
describing my child as mean.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.868
I wouldn't want
someone to describe

00:12:00.868 --> 00:12:03.390
my child as racist or cruel.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.200
But spoiled, it made the
hair rise on my arms,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.340
because I knew it really
was an indictment of me

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.000
if somebody were
ever to use that.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.650
Because spoiled
is a passive verb.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.010
It's not just an adjective.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.060
Spoiled by whom?

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.280
Spoiled by you, by
us, by the parents.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.380
Because kids aren't
born that way.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.229
Spoiled kids are generally made.

00:12:22.229 --> 00:12:24.520
So I thought, OK, if that's
what we're trying to solve,

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.124
for then what's the
opposite of spoiled?

00:12:27.124 --> 00:12:29.540
And that wasn't useful at
first, because if you look it up

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.660
in the thesaurus,
you get fresh, which

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.090
is useful for produce
and meat and stuff,

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.590
but not for children.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.810
So I tried to make a
list of all of the values

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.170
and virtues and character
traits that add up

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.030
to the kinds of
grounded, decent kids

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.405
that we're all
trying to push out

00:12:46.405 --> 00:12:50.390
into the world-- things
like modesty, and thrift,

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.770
and prudence, and patience,
and delayed gratification,

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:59.650
and perseverance, and grit,
and perspective, and curiosity.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.570
Generosity is a big one.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.462
And I looked at that list.

00:13:03.462 --> 00:13:07.210
And I thought, whoa,
you can use money

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.550
to teach every single
one of those things.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.870
So rather than assume, as
some of those schools are,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.590
that money subverts
values, that talking

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:23.010
about it leads to the creation
of money grubbing children,

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.500
or that their
questions about money

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.380
were impolite or impolitic
or age inappropriate--

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.350
what if we did the inverse?

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.350
What if we actually
embraced those questions,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.970
we answer them transparently,
but in an age appropriate way?

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.390
What if we used those
questions to lead us

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:45.410
on years-long conversations
and even family rituals

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.670
around saving and
spending and giving,

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:52.990
all in the interest of
imprinting all that good stuff?

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.010
What if we did that instead?

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.950
And so what the
opposite of spoiled is,

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:04.210
first and foremost, is a
solemn promise to our children.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.260
It's a generational
manifesto, really,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.690
that says more
than anything else

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.170
that we are going to do
better at this money stuff

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.760
than our parents did.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.400
We're going to
talk about it more.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.960
We're going to take our
kids questions seriously,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.710
and we are going to answer
every single one of them.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.060
And it makes perfect sense.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.920
Because more than anything else,
it's kids' job to be curious.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.030
They're supposed to figure
out how the world works.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.780
Money is clearly
a source of power,

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.770
but it's also a
source of mystery.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.920
Grownups don't talk
about it very much.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.490
Kids need some math skills, at
least 10-year-old math skills,

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.735
to really reckon
with the numbers.

00:14:43.735 --> 00:14:45.110
So they're trying
to sort it out,

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.860
and they're getting
little snippets of it.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.660
And if we're trying
to hide it from them--

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.290
or even worse, if
we're lying-- that's

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.240
not going to be good for
a variety of reasons.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.160
And so if you're like me, you
probably heard some version

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.720
of this answer to at least
one of your money questions

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.200
when you're growing up.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.580
So you're asking, how
much does the house cost,

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.770
or how much money do
you make, or what to you

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.710
pay our babysitter, and the
answer is, almost inevitably--

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.750
at least at some point in
many people's childhood-- it's

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.370
none of your business.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.610
So this is a problematic answer
for a whole bunch of reasons.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.150
First of all, it's not true.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.100
It's literally
factually inaccurate.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.500
Because if you are a member
of the household, a member

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.100
of the family
business, in a sense,

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.180
its revenues and expenses
of course impact you.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.460
So it's stuff that
affects your daily life,

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.850
and of course you're
going to ask about it.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.199
But even worse, if you
shut down kids in that way,

00:15:44.199 --> 00:15:46.240
if you tell them that it's
not of their business,

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.520
the lesson that they get is
this matter of great import

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.340
is utterly and
completely off limits.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.860
And so if they want to know
about this really important

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.650
thing, then the
best place to go is

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:04.770
Google, or their friends on the
playground, or someplace else,

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.730
even though we as
parents almost certainly

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.590
want to be the primary resource
for really important stuff.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.240
And if it happens with money,
they may come to the conclusion

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.824
that they shouldn't
ask you about sex,

00:16:15.824 --> 00:16:17.448
and they shouldn't
ask you about drugs,

00:16:17.448 --> 00:16:19.190
and they shouldn't
ask you about help.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.830
Because this is important
stuff, it's consequential stuff,

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.020
it's scary stuff.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.020
And if you're shutting
them down on money, well,

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.936
you might shut them down
on those things, too,

00:16:27.936 --> 00:16:30.980
and so they'll just keep
their curiosity to themselves.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.250
So if anything else,
please wipe the phrase none

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.422
of your business from your
vocabulary if you possibly can.

00:16:38.422 --> 00:16:40.630
If you're looking for a
better answer, an all purpose

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.750
answer that works for every
single money question,

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.470
I'd suggest this.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.300
Your kid wants to know
how much you make,

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.646
or whether you're rich,
or whether you're poor,

00:16:49.646 --> 00:16:51.770
or why you didn't give
money to the homeless person

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:52.353
on the street.

00:16:52.353 --> 00:16:55.310
Just look back at them and
say, oh, why do you ask?

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.130
And it's not an accusation.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.630
It's meant to convey the fact
that we honor their curiosity,

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.490
that we appreciate it, that
we are glad that they asked,

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.500
but that we want to
know what made them

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.800
think of it in the first place.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.050
Particularly the younger ones,
the bigger cosmic questions--

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.609
are we rich, are we poor.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:17.880
Those aren't usually what
they're looking to answer.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.250
So if they're asking you
how much money you make,

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.690
but you know that they don't
have the math skills to reckon

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.950
with a six figure number
or a seven figure number

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.690
if they're talking
about real estate

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.460
that you own in Manhattan,
then often, they're

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.080
asking about something else.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.270
And often, it's a
question that is

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.600
something to do with a
generalized query about

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.479
whether they are OK.

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:45.770
They're asking about rich or
they're asking about poor,

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.610
because they've overheard an
argument that two parents are

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.930
having, or they've
overheard a single parent

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.830
on the phone with a creditor,
a financial advisor.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.890
Once they can read,
all bets are off.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.680
They're looking at
newspaper headlines.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.420
They're looking at your bills.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.360
They worry.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.160
They see stuff.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.640
They snoop.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.940
Did you go after the tax
returns in the basement?

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.200
That was just me?

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.550
That was just me.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.596
I got my hands on the tax
returns when I was 13 or 14.

00:18:12.596 --> 00:18:14.470
Just because I saw them
there, and I thought,

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.844
that would be
useful information.

00:18:15.844 --> 00:18:18.850
But I had no way to
contextualize that.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.060
So they're going to look.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.710
They're going to ask.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.710
And this is a pretty good
all purpose response--

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:25.530
why do you ask?

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.530
Because quite often,
they've overheard something

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.700
or, they've seen something
that's made them curious.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.850
And quite often, what
they really want to know

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.554
is about that, and not
what your net worth is.

00:18:34.554 --> 00:18:36.595
And it turns out that the
why do you ask response

00:18:36.595 --> 00:18:38.280
is useful in other ways, too.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:44.520
So when I talk about this,
I think of my friend Kristi.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.100
Lives in the West Village,
but grew up elsewhere.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.720
Her father is a nice
Southern gentleman.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.430
Comes to visit
sometimes, although he

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.744
thinks that New York is
the root of all evil.

00:18:55.744 --> 00:18:57.660
So they're sitting in
the living room one day,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.216
and Kristi's son walks in, pulls
himself up to his full height,

00:19:02.216 --> 00:19:03.716
he addresses them,
and he says, when

00:19:03.716 --> 00:19:06.110
are we going to start having
some more sex around here?

00:19:10.026 --> 00:19:11.900
So as far as I know,
Kristie had never really

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.804
had the sex conversation
with her own father.

00:19:15.804 --> 00:19:17.470
She certainly hadn't
had it with her son

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.499
yet, because he was like seven.

00:19:19.499 --> 00:19:21.790
And so she had to figure out
in the moment what to say,

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.880
and she didn't have the
why do you ask trick up

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.260
her sleeve at that point.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.470
So she delivers an abbreviated
version of the birds

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.900
and the bees with her
father as an audience.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.615
And days later,
only days later does

00:19:34.615 --> 00:19:36.990
she realize what was actually
going on in that moment.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.620
She finally got to
the bottom of it.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.880
It turns out Gus had
stolen a couple of minutes

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.320
in front of a
Family Guy episode,

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.390
and what he realized was
that if you say the word

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.030
sex enough times, the
laugh track explodes.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.530
So it wasn't that
Gus wanted to have

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.800
sex with his mother, or
his grandfather, or anyone.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.095
He just wanted to create
some entertainment.

00:19:59.095 --> 00:20:01.094
And if only she
had asked why, she

00:20:01.094 --> 00:20:03.260
could have gotten to the
bottom of it in that moment

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.860
without having the sex
talk with a seven-year-old.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.630
So why do you ask-- it's a
really great tool to have.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.810
So we know that kids
should learn about money.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.120
Money is for practice.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.710
It is a great teaching tool.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.780
I see it as being in the
same category as books,

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.480
as musical instruments,
as art supplies.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.450
I know we grownups
connect it with commerce,

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:31.440
but I really think
it's for learning.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.130
If you give kids allowance, it's
good to ask them to divide it

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.870
in three in this way.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.110
You can split it up
really any way you want.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.710
But the thing that I like about
this is that, first of all,

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.200
it offers a basic foundation
for grown up budgeting, not

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.520
that far off from what we do.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.900
If you're relatively
healthy financially,

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.120
you're spending maybe no
more than 75% or 80% of what

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.990
you make.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.920
Hopefully you're
saving 10%, 15%,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.690
maybe more if you're looking at
college education down the pike

00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.920
and you can afford to.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.985
And you're giving
away what you can.

00:21:01.985 --> 00:21:04.110
Maybe there's some giving
pledgers in the audience.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.651
I won't ask you to
call yourself out.

00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:08.000
But some folks with
significant net worths

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.780
have decided to pledge,
literally on a dotted line,

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.920
to give away 50% of their net
worth over their lifetime.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.960
Maybe you're a Mormon
and you tithe 10%.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.500
If you're like most
Americans, you give away 2.5%

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.206
roughly on average each year.

00:21:21.206 --> 00:21:23.080
But hopefully, you're
able to give something.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.510
But this is a beginning
grown up budget for kids.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.550
But I also like the
fact that the jars

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.540
are a stand in for those values
and virtues and character

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.350
traits that we were
talking about before.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:37.780
So spend is modesty, it's
thrift, it's prudence

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.180
and prudent financial
decision making.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.180
But it's not necessarily
about being cheap.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.750
I'm actually a big believer
in spending lavishly on things

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.290
that bring you the most joy.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.640
So for me, it's live music.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.890
I'm a big customer of StubHub.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.319
I'm willing to
pay more if I need

00:21:56.319 --> 00:21:57.860
to for a better
experience, because I

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.350
know it will be memorable.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.260
Same thing is true
for food for me.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.210
That's something else
that's really important.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.090
But then there are
other things-- clothing,

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:11.640
alcohol, transportation-- I
don't spend on that stuff.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.620
And you probably
have your own list.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.650
And you should help
your kids figure out

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.890
what's on their list, the things
the bring them the most joy.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.750
It turns out all of
the best happiness

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.840
research shows us
now-- I mean literally,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.990
definitively now, every study
shows this-- that doing things

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:30.820
trumps having things,
that experiences

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.450
are better than stuff.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.320
The earliest that we can start
teaching our kids about that,

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.620
the better.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.330
So that's spend.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.960
Save is about patience
and delayed gratification,

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.290
which helps grownups when
they're saving for retirement

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.850
or college or something
else, especially

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:49.000
in a world that now
conspires against waiting

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.900
in so many ways.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.870
All of you guys are
old enough to remember

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.060
going to Blockbuster and not
being able to get the movie.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.370
That's just not part of
anybody's life anymore.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:59.890
Neither are television
commercials,

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.050
unless it's a live sports
event or the Oscars.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.800
It's just not something
we have to do.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:10.260
Many kids don't have to share a
bathroom in the suburbs at all.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.890
Things have changed.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.070
And giving is about generosity,
and also about gravity.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.270
So I often get a lot of
questions about chores.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.300
I think kids should
do a ton of chores,

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.130
so many that you need a
chore chart like the ones

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.300
that I found in Mormon
households filled

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.920
with children all over Utah.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.289
This is one that I saw.

00:23:31.289 --> 00:23:32.830
I went there
deliberately to see what

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.980
life was like in houses
that have four or five

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.550
or 8 or 12 children around just
to see at its most intense what

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:42.460
the chore charts are like.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.490
I actually think that kids
should do chores for free,

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.160
the same way that grownups do.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.699
If you're looking for
leverage over your kids

00:23:49.699 --> 00:23:52.240
and you're tempted to take away
their allowance if they don't

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.360
do their chores,
consider the possibility

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.321
that they may value some
of their experiences, some

00:23:57.321 --> 00:23:59.570
of the things that they love
to do, way more than they

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.010
value the money.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.710
You could take away
their screen time.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.680
You could take away
the Wi-Fi password.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.160
You could take
away their ability

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.220
to go to soccer practice.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.070
There's a lot of things you
can take that are probably more

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.510
valuable to them than money.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.250
So this is what a
chore chart looks

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:20.560
like at its most extreme--
color-coded goals,

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.390
homemade bottle cap magnets,
tracking all the things that

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.760
need to be done each day.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.040
The kids get points according
to how engaged they are.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.400
There's a weekly schedule
that changes on a daily basis.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.930
And the chores are
incredibly intense.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.230
I still don't know
what an entry bench is.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:40.240
I definitely don't have one
in my Brooklyn apartment.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.920
But out in Utah, they've got
to be dusted every single day.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.040
The mud rooms get washed,
the doors, both sides,

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.570
the light switches.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.136
This family was so
intense that they

00:24:51.136 --> 00:24:53.510
had decided at a certain point
that the activity in front

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.320
of the sink in the kitchen
had just become too extreme,

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.670
and so they installed an
industrial water fountain right

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.410
next to the mud room so that all
of the water container filling

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.230
in the kids' drinking could
be moved someplace out

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.520
of the kitchen.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.030
This family had a lot going
on, and they had figured

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.450
out a system for all of it.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:16.081
And all those chores got done.

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:18.330
Another thing about allowance
that's useful for kids--

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.650
and really, it's a useful way
of thinking for grownups, too.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.670
It's changed the way I
think about spending.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.753
It's starting to talk to
them about the difference

00:25:25.753 --> 00:25:27.230
between wants and needs.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.230
So I use rubber rain boot,
Wellies, to illustrate this.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.580
But you could really do
it with sports equipment,

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.590
or athletic shoes, or
underwear or outerwear,

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:37.340
anything you want.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.530
And in fact, I encourage you
to do with every category

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.779
of spending in your household.

00:25:40.779 --> 00:25:43.320
But this is how we do
it with rain boots.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.096
So is anybody wearing
hunter boots today?

00:25:46.096 --> 00:25:47.720
So nobody is going
to be annoyed at me.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.960
I actually don't have a
problem with luxury products

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.460
in general.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.670
But these Hunter boots on
teenage girls and younger,

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.390
it kept coming up again and
again in my reporting that

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:00.150
became a thing in my
head-- luxury rain boots,

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.570
generally girls wearing them,
although sometimes boys.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.960
They cost $70 or $80 or $90
or $100 for the kids version.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.200
It's a lot.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.880
But still-- kids
need rain boots.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.350
You can get the $20
version at Payless

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.740
or buy them used on eBay.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.710
You can get the
really expensive boot

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.950
over on the right side of
the want need continuum.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.670
I encourage parents to
draw a vertical line

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:24.180
in between the crosses of the
continuum that basically says

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.850
to kids, this is what
we are willing to pay

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.020
for in this category.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.866
My family often draws what
we call the Lands' End Line.

00:26:32.866 --> 00:26:34.240
Because I grew up
in the Midwest,

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.130
I'm a big consumer of Land's
End, a long time customer.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.450
I think their products are
high quality, great customer

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.390
service, nice return policy.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.450
You get to talk to those ladies
in Wisconsin on the phone.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.700
Those ladies are so nice.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.830
So what we say to
our daughter is,

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.260
we'll pay for the Lands'
End version of this.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.550
With the rain boots,
it's $40, $45.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.150
If you want something more
expensive, it's on you.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.630
So you're going to pay the
difference between $40 and $45

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.066
and whatever it
is that you want.

00:27:01.066 --> 00:27:02.940
And you can draw that
line anywhere you want.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.150
No judgments.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.511
Your family may be a $4
a pair underwear family.

00:27:07.511 --> 00:27:09.510
Because really, why do
you need underwear that's

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.040
more expensive than that?

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.270
But it may be a
$200, $300 outer wear

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.380
family, because you go skiing,
or because your kids walk

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.100
to school in the elements.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.170
And so the coat is
important, and you're

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.600
willing to spend more for that.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.535
Whatever it is, the
only wrong answer

00:27:24.535 --> 00:27:26.940
is the one that you don't
explain to your kids.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.560
Because otherwise,
how else are they

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.869
supposed to know why and how
you're making the decisions

00:27:31.869 --> 00:27:32.660
that you're making?

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.940
So I mentioned to you that
this came up again and again.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.410
One of the very first talks
I gave on this topic, a mom

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.850
in the front row raised
her hand and said

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.210
to me, my son stumped me
recently, my 10-year-old son.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.930
He wanted to know
why it was that we

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.860
kept refusing to buy
him a carnivorous plant

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.220
terrarium given that
we were willing to pay

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:59.570
for his 12-year-old
sister's Hunter boots.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.110
And the room broke up laughing.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.220
And I thought about
it for half second.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.840
And then I realized that
that 10-year-old boy

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.650
had seized on something that
the mother didn't really

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.570
understand at all, which
was that these things are

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.710
two different categories, two
different want need continuums.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.820
What he was talking about, his
carnivorous plant terrarium,

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.620
what he was talking about
was a tool for learning.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.740
So if your family
is lucky enough

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.570
to have enough money that
you pay for most tools

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.700
for learning-- most books,
most instruments, most

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.160
educational toys--
then you should

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.080
pay for the carnivorous
plant terrarium,

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.300
because that's botany, and
plant science, and hydrology,

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.430
and insects.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.530
And he wanted to take
care of the stuff

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:47.440
and learn things from it,
and that's good stuff.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.770
But his sister, his sister
just wanted a luxury product.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.310
It was definitely
a need, way far

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.890
off the need end
of the spectrum,

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:56.700
and not a want at all.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.760
So I said to her, the
answer here is simple.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.094
You should definitely buy the
Venus fly traps for the kids.

00:29:02.094 --> 00:29:04.260
But we made an agreement
that after a certain point,

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.481
he should have to pay
for all the flies.

00:29:07.481 --> 00:29:08.730
And that was the deal she cut.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.970
So I put this all
down in my book.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.210
I thought I had it
all figured out.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:18.300
And then I was at my alma
mater, our alma mater,

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.880
a couple of weeks ago
talking about Hunter boots

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.620
and all of the
rest of this stuff.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.386
And I got home a
couple hours later.

00:29:25.386 --> 00:29:26.760
There was a Facebook
thread going

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.220
among my classmates, who had
all come out to hear me speak.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.470
And my poor classmate
Collin had do

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.630
admit, or decided to
admit to the rest of us,

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.760
that on the way
home from the talk,

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.990
his wife had pulled those
out of a shopping back.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:43.790
Literally that day,
she had gone out

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:48.140
and bought their
two-year-old Hunter boots.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.690
So I thought I was
in big trouble.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.994
And then Colin thought
he was in big trouble.

00:29:51.994 --> 00:29:53.160
People were asking about it.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.910
And he said, no, no,
you don't understand.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.020
He said, my wife got
the boots on sale,

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.930
so they were to the left
of the Lands' End Line.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.200
So they win.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.640
Buying on sale is a
really good thing.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.850
So we were looking at
the gift jar before.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.130
Kids turn out to be
hard-wired for generosity.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.010
This is a drawing that was made
by a six-year-old in Queens who

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.110
had a lot of questions
about Occupy Wall Street.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.214
She had asked her
parents what it meant.

00:30:22.214 --> 00:30:23.630
She couldn't really
read the signs

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.370
or understand what
they were about.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.786
Her parents did a really good
job of explaining it to her.

00:30:27.786 --> 00:30:29.580
They said, well,
there are people

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.990
in New York City who have a lot
of money and a lot of property,

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.040
and they're really
lucky that they do.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.956
And there are people in
New York City who have

00:30:36.956 --> 00:30:38.210
a lot less and who struggle.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.920
And what the signs are
about is a conversation

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.120
that we're having in
New York right now about

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.980
whether that's fair, that
many people have more

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.390
and many people have less.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.680
And if it isn't fair, what
should we do to fix it?

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.610
So she took all that in.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:56.249
She sat down at her art table,
and she drew a share machine.

00:30:56.249 --> 00:30:57.665
So the way the
share machine works

00:30:57.665 --> 00:31:00.922
is you dump a bunch of
gold into the pink funnel,

00:31:00.922 --> 00:31:02.380
and the gold goes
into the machine,

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.030
and it regurgitates the gold
into red coins and blue coins,

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.159
and those red and blue
coins get mixed up

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:09.700
in the belly of the
machine, and then

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.100
they get spat out of the
phallic elephant tusk,

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.380
and they go out into the
community where the coins get

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.060
spread around for
everyone to share.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.730
So she completely grasped
the idea of redistribution

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:23.510
and why she thought
it was important.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:25.630
And she thought it
was a good idea.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.580
Kids like sharing.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.680
Most kids, at least.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.920
So I spotted this not
long ago on the wall

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:41.150
of my daughter's hippie
Quaker school in Brooklyn.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:44.651
I was impressed that they had
put it up in the first place.

00:31:44.651 --> 00:31:46.900
But then, of course, I had
to get to the bottom of it.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.100
And being a professional busy
body, I took a picture of it,

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.180
and I sent it to
the kids' parents.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.840
And I said, what's
going on here?

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.150
And they said, we don't know.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.500
So I just left it at that.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.916
But then a week
or two later, they

00:32:00.916 --> 00:32:03.340
wrote me back and they said,
Ron, we figured it out.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.900
We were cleaning up the books on
the boys' floor in his bedroom.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.290
This boy was in kindergarten
at the time, I think,

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.950
so they were just
learning to write.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:15.200
And they said we figured
out where this came from,

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.734
because he was reading a book
about-- can anybody guess what

00:32:18.734 --> 00:32:20.870
it was about?

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.130
He was reading a book
about the Boston Tea Party.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.369
So his problem
wasn't with taxes.

00:32:26.369 --> 00:32:27.910
His problem wasn't
with higher taxes.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:32.460
He just didn't want to pay
higher taxes to the British.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.480
So it turns out that he, too,
was hard wired for sharing.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.630
So you can have these
conversations with your kids.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.080
This is a conversation that
we had with our daughter

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.336
about how we divide
our charitable giving.

00:32:43.336 --> 00:32:44.960
We said, all right,
Talia-- we're going

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.390
to put 100 beans on the table.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.980
Each one represents $1.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.810
And for every $100 we give away,
this is how we divide it up.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.427
So $17 goes to curing
river blindness, which

00:32:55.427 --> 00:32:56.885
is a devastating
disease, and there

00:32:56.885 --> 00:33:00.600
are charities that can literally
save a life for every $122

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.520
that you give.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.780
So we think it's
important to save lives.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.070
We do that.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.320
We give money to the
educational institutions

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.390
that's supported me with
scholarship money when

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.430
I didn't have enough.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:16.010
Our mother is 35-year
and counting survivor

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:17.680
of premenopausal breast cancer.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.840
We support breast
cancer organizations.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.580
On my wife's side, there's a
bunch of Holocaust survivors,

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.950
so we keep tabs on the
elderly Jews in our community,

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:28.270
and we give money to the
American Jewish World Service,

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.560
and Public Radio, and
homeless children,

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.710
and many other things.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:36.680
So we said to our daughter,
does this look OK to you?

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.010
Are there any piles
that are missing?

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:44.007
And if so, what do you
think we should do about it?

00:33:44.007 --> 00:33:46.090
So we started on this with
her when she was eight.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.298
But you can have this
conversation with 12-year-olds.

00:33:48.298 --> 00:33:49.910
You should have it
with 16-year-olds.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.470
It just gets more and
more complex and nuanced.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:54.050
And she looked at
it, and she said,

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.700
I think it's great
that we help students

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:01.820
at schools who are like
Daddy, who didn't have enough,

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.960
and now, because of
the money that we give,

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.484
they can go to school the
same way that Daddy did.

00:34:06.484 --> 00:34:08.150
But the thing that I
love doing the most

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:11.170
is going to summer camp,
going to sleep away camp,

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:14.270
and I'd like to give money
for a scholarship for people

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.960
who don't have enough
money to go there.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.156
So that had not occurred to us.

00:34:19.156 --> 00:34:20.989
We didn't even know if
such a thing existed.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.822
But we checked it out,
and sure enough, they

00:34:22.822 --> 00:34:24.270
did have a scholarship fund.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.770
So we gave her three beans.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.100
We said, you can move the
beans from any pile you want.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.181
You decide where you think we
should take the beans from.

00:34:31.181 --> 00:34:32.389
Because it means a trade-off.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:34.820
It means that organization
won't get as much,

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.969
but the kids who want
to go to your camp will.

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:39.570
And so you have to decide
where they come from.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.690
And so she chose, and
we added three beans

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:43.982
to the Eisner Scholarship Fund.

00:34:43.982 --> 00:34:45.398
And now each and
every year, we're

00:34:45.398 --> 00:34:47.110
going to give her a
couple more beans.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.850
So that as she gets
older and smarter,

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.409
is able to think about these
things in a more nuanced way,

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:56.720
she will be able to have ever
more influence on our family's

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.220
giving.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.991
Because why shouldn't she?

00:34:58.991 --> 00:35:00.240
She's part of the family, too.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.627
So it's only a short step
from generosity to gratitude.

00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:09.960
If you're lucky enough to be
able to throw the rope back

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.760
for others, it means that
you are truly fortunate,

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.350
and it's good to remind
yourself of that once in awhile.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.790
If you are a person of
faith or a family of faith,

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.610
maybe you say grace each night.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.010
Or maybe the idea of grace
makes you feel uncomfortable.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.660
That's fine.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.210
There are plenty of forms of
godless grace that you can say,

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:30.820
family gratitude rituals
that you can develop.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.530
They don't feel
like grace at all.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.130
Toasting is my favorite one.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.940
Kids love to give toast.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.680
They love the noise, they love
the liquid sloshing around,

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.940
they love the rowdiness.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.690
And there are really
no rules to toasting.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.481
The only rule is that
everybody gets a turn

00:35:43.481 --> 00:35:46.450
to raise their glass to
someone or something awesome

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.830
from that day.

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.840
And even if you've had
the worst possible day,

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.600
there's almost always
something awesome.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.460
And once you start doing
this daily gratitude ritual,

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.090
whether it's you alone as an
adult, which I encourage--

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.490
it's made me a happier
person, because I do it--

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:04.292
or as a family, whenever
you manage to sit down,

00:36:04.292 --> 00:36:06.250
it helps to take at least
some of the attention

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:10.100
away from the things that you
want, or that you yearn for,

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.496
that you can't have, or
that you don't have yet,

00:36:12.496 --> 00:36:13.870
and brings the
focus really where

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.030
it belongs-- on the
things that you already

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:19.350
have, on the luck,
and the good fortune,

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:22.000
and the great things
about you and your family

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.487
and your community
and the people in it.

00:36:24.487 --> 00:36:25.570
I encourage you to try it.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:28.600
It's powerful stuff.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:34.170
So people often worry or wonder
when I give these talks about

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:37.449
kids, and working, and
how much they should work,

00:36:37.449 --> 00:36:39.990
and whether we're not teaching
them a work ethic if we're not

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.323
paying them for their allowance.

00:36:41.323 --> 00:36:43.980
I actually think kids
should work plenty.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:47.040
Work has gone out of style
in the United States.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.030
The percentage of
teenagers who are working

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:53.657
has gone down like 50% in
just the last 15 years.

00:36:53.657 --> 00:36:55.240
There are a bunch
of reasons for this.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:59.620
All of the labor laws that we
have that avoid that situation

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.542
are perfectly appropriate.

00:37:01.542 --> 00:37:03.250
And there are other
macroeconomic reasons

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.010
why this has happened.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:05.968
But mostly, I think it's
because of the college

00:37:05.968 --> 00:37:07.524
admissions industrial complex.

00:37:07.524 --> 00:37:09.940
There's a sense out there that
college admissions officers

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.510
devalue work, and
that they care more

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:16.000
about the time you spent
in the after school coding

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.880
club, or your time
on the soccer team,

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.330
or your time staring
for the school play.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:21.420
It's actually not true.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.836
I've reported it out with the
college admissions officers.

00:37:23.836 --> 00:37:26.620
They only wish more kids
would do more paid work,

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.410
and would write passionately
about it in their essays.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.160
Because all they
see is drama club

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.430
and coding club and
student athletes now,

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:39.050
and they are bored to tears by
all these overly packaged kids.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:42.710
Work, it turns out, is something
that kids are hard-wired to do.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.200
They yearn to
display confidence.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.310
Every time I turned
around in the early stages

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:49.900
of my reporting, I was hearing
from families, particularly

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.970
suburban families,
where kids were

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:55.250
involved in all sorts of
intense recycling rituals.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.817
The kids just really wanted
to gather the cans and bottles

00:37:57.817 --> 00:37:59.400
and be responsible
for turning them in

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.960
and get the money
that way, because that

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.160
was something they could do.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.409
It was right in front of them.

00:38:03.409 --> 00:38:05.190
It was a helpful task
around the house,

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.410
and they could make money at it.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.780
I was so interested in
this and fascinated by it

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.370
that I followed the Clark
family to the scrap yard one day

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.680
in downtown San
Jose, California.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.450
And these girls walk right in.

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.250
They know all the
cashiers by name.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:21.620
And they go to the clear bottle
collection container, and then

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.810
the green bottle, and
then the brown bottle,

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:27.310
and then the aluminum cans,
and then the plastic bottles,

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:29.420
and they stop everywhere
along the way.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.362
Literally glass shards flying.

00:38:31.362 --> 00:38:32.820
There's so much
noise in this place

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.862
that they give you ear plugs.

00:38:34.862 --> 00:38:36.570
And the girls just
walk through, and then

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:40.350
they walk out with $75 each,
and they go to the credit union.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.560
Kids like doing this stuff.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.630
And they're capable of a lot.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.860
I spent a bunch time
with farm families

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:49.600
just to remind myself of
what five-year-olds can do.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.660
We tend not to think
much of five-year-olds.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.980
But in fact,
five-year-old Zebadiah,

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.500
the youngest of eight boys on
a dairy farm in Northern Utah--

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.100
1,800 head of cattle--
Zebadiah starts

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.360
working at the age of five
when they pick them up,

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.050
and they put him on the
tractor, and he drives it.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.290
They put it in gear.

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:11.547
Zeb's job is to make sure
the tractor stays straight.

00:39:11.547 --> 00:39:13.380
And the seven-year-old
and the nine-year-old

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.260
follow behind him, and
they take the bottles,

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.634
and they put them
in the calf pen

00:39:16.634 --> 00:39:17.936
so the calf have milk to drink.

00:39:17.936 --> 00:39:20.060
And the bottles have been
filled by the 11-year-old

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.170
and the 13-year-old
brother with the milk

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:25.560
that the 15-year-old and
the 17-year-old brother

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.630
got from the milk machines that
they hooked up to the cows.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.230
And this all gets
done between 5:00

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.540
in the morning and
7:00 in the morning

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.248
before the boys go to
school, and then it

00:39:33.248 --> 00:39:35.040
gets done again after
school, and then

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.920
it gets done again
on the weekends.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.410
They take Sundays off.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.810
Five-year-olds can do a lot.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.310
Every five-year-old in the
Smith family gets a gun.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.670
The gun is part of their job.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:45.470
They know how to use it.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:46.761
They know how to use it safely.

00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:50.070
Not once did Zeb point
the weapon at me.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:51.910
Zeb's job is to
scare the birds away.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:53.400
The birds are a nuisance.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.470
They spread disease.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.950
They harass the cows.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:57.970
And the birds now
know when crew cut

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:02.110
Zeb raises his weapon that
it is time to scatter.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:04.741
And that is Zeb's job.

00:40:04.741 --> 00:40:05.990
We're in a technology company.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:09.654
I wanted to talk just for
a minute or two about this.

00:40:09.654 --> 00:40:11.570
If you're going to give
your kid a smartphone,

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.980
definitely give them
your version one iPhone

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.820
with a wireless carrier
that doesn't exist anymore.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:22.550
But seriously, smartphones
for kids, they are a want.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.870
They are not a need.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.176
Kids need voice service.

00:40:25.176 --> 00:40:26.800
They need texting
ability, because it's

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.170
how people communicate.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.530
I do not think internet
access on the go

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:34.990
with a data plan is
something that children need.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.450
And so if they want
it, that's great,

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.089
but they should pay
for it themselves.

00:40:40.089 --> 00:40:41.130
Let them make trade-offs.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:42.986
Let them decide just
how much it's worth,

00:40:42.986 --> 00:40:44.360
or whether they're
probably going

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.150
to be just fine
with whatever access

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.780
they have on their
school machines

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.946
and whatever access they
have on your home machines.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.630
So for the kids who do have
cell phones in Manhattan,

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.894
I've heard from all
sorts of parents--

00:41:01.894 --> 00:41:03.310
this is true in
the Bay Area, too,

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.485
and also in LA--
so many parents who

00:41:05.485 --> 00:41:07.420
have said, if I see
another Instagram

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.500
photo of a child
on a private jet,

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.770
I'm going to throw the phone
off the Empire State Building.

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.320
This happens.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:19.050
Instagram I think, is an
engine of envy for these kids.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:21.480
They don't realize that
everybody-- or most people,

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.900
at least-- are
using social media

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.830
to put their best
selves forward,

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:29.270
that it's a catalog of awesome.

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:32.290
Look at my awesome family,
and my awesome turkey,

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.781
and my awesome vacation, and
me having an awesome time

00:41:34.781 --> 00:41:37.030
at a party that you're not
invited to with the friends

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.769
that you thought were
your close friends.

00:41:38.769 --> 00:41:40.310
And these kids are
literally supposed

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.490
to press their noses up
against the iPad glass

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:46.560
and like it, hit the
thumbs up button.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.967
I think this is way more
pernicious than any form

00:41:49.967 --> 00:41:51.800
of commercial television,
and it's something

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.470
worth keeping a close eye on.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:55.480
Yet another reason not
to let them walk around

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.870
with social media access.

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:59.321
And that's not to say
that we should ban it.

00:41:59.321 --> 00:42:00.820
But we should look
over the shoulder

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:02.236
when they're using
it the same way

00:42:02.236 --> 00:42:05.690
that we would if they
were watching TV.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.120
I want to talk for just a
brief minute about college.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.170
One of the biggest reasons I
did this book in the first place

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:13.240
was because we had gotten
to a point in America

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.520
without anyone ever
really acknowledging it

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.270
where 16 and 17 and 18-year-olds
are making six figure

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.450
decisions, sometimes
completely on their own,

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.460
often with the help of
parents who don't really

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.970
understand the size
and the numbers

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.029
and aren't doing the math.

00:42:27.029 --> 00:42:29.070
If you're not getting any
financial aid-- and who

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.860
knows when the kids are younger
whether you will or not,

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.430
so you have to plan for
this-- to go to Binghamton

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:40.340
or Stonybrook or
New Paltz now-- it's

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.090
$100,000 to walk in the door,
to pay for room and board,

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.760
to pay for four or five years.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.394
$100,000 for most flagship
state universities.

00:42:49.394 --> 00:42:51.810
If your kid is going to go to
some kind of private college

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:54.270
and you don't know about
the financial aid situation,

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.510
or if they'll get this
merit aid, which is really

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.910
just a form of
discounting, that's

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:03.330
going to be $250,000 in
today's dollars per child.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:06.000
Let alone for those of us who
have a couple little people,

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.010
or little people on the way,
who may be looking at half

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:10.912
a million dollars per child.

00:43:10.912 --> 00:43:12.370
It's an incredible
amount of money.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:13.809
The kids need to be ready.

00:43:13.809 --> 00:43:15.600
And one of the biggest
problems with what's

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.880
going on with college
today is that we literally

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:22.480
have no data on which to make
our purchasing decisions.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.530
It's the most important
decision, arguably,

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:27.060
of these kids' entire lives.

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.310
They're making it
at 16 or 17, and we

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:33.250
have no data on salary
outcomes and choice of majors.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:36.100
We have no data on what
they are actually learning

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.640
and how much smarter
they've gotten,

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.420
how much bigger their brains
have gotten in four years.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.670
We have no data on how
they've develop personally

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.734
in terms of just fine
tuning their personality,

00:43:44.734 --> 00:43:46.400
whether they're
happier, whether they're

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.710
more capable of
general problem solving

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:50.810
in their personal lives.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.300
We have no data on
who they're meeting,

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.820
on the quality of
the relationships,

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.040
on the networking opportunities,
on whether these are ties

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.660
that they are forming as
undergraduates that bind.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.600
We know absolutely nothing.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.580
It is a national disgrace
that our educational system

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:12.320
costs people 10x more than
the next cheapest educational

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.900
higher educational systems
in the developed world.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.950
It's insane.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.360
And yet, this is the system
that we have inherited.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.030
This is the system that we
are preparing our kids for.

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.080
They need to be ready to figure
out how to reckon with it,

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.490
how to begin to come to terms
with not just the value,

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:33.536
but their values as they
relate to assessing the value.

00:44:33.536 --> 00:44:35.910
Because the real problem with
the way these big decisions

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:38.450
are made now is that so many
of them are based on snobbery.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.870
People come to the
conclusion that private

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.369
is better than
public, or that small

00:44:44.369 --> 00:44:46.650
is better than big,
or that more expensive

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:51.070
has to be better than less
expensive, that the dorms

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:56.080
with the lazy river
rafts, outdoor pools--

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.880
this actually goes on
in many universities,

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.210
and not just the most expensive
ones-- that those have

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:04.200
to be better than the ones
that don't have the swimming

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.340
pools and the new dorms.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:11.270
And this is how many kids
are making the decision now.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.150
It's the wrong way
to make the decision.

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:15.960
It's the wrong way to make
a really big decision.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.130
But it's understandable.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.720
Because at the end
of the day, so much

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.240
of these money decisions
are tied up in emotions.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.170
And we're used to talking
to kids about feelings,

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:29.950
about honoring their feelings,
about soothing their hurt

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:34.690
feelings, talking to them
about their raw, embarrassing

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:36.730
emotions.

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:38.550
And that, we've gotten good at.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.800
We honor their feelings.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.990
We pay close attention to them.

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:44.980
To my mind, their
questions about money

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.430
are just as important.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:49.450
And one of keys to
raising decent kids

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:52.900
and to making sure they're happy
is understanding that equation

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.470
and honoring their
curiosity about money just

00:45:55.470 --> 00:46:00.420
as much as we honor their
raw, important emotions, too.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.056
Thank you.

00:46:02.056 --> 00:46:04.446
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:12.130
As you may have guessed,
I have other acts

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:16.420
of long form journalism I
intend to commit in this area.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.300
If you sign up here,
you'll hear from me

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.780
every so often about some of
the things that I'm doing.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.200
And I'll be asking
for help, too,

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.550
as I begin to gather some
string on further projects.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.102
So if you want to sign
up, I'd be grateful.

00:46:27.102 --> 00:46:29.310
All I need is your first
name and your email address,

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:32.189
and I won't bug you more
than every month or two.

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:33.730
And I'm happy to
answer any questions

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:35.680
or stick around and sign
books or whatever, although I

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.846
know some of you have to go.

00:46:36.846 --> 00:46:38.060
So go if you need to.

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:38.560
Anybody?

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.195
AUDIENCE: How
likely do you think

00:46:44.195 --> 00:46:46.400
it is that the
college system will

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:50.111
exist in its current
form in about 15 years?

00:46:50.111 --> 00:46:51.860
RON LIEBER: I think
it's extremely likely,

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:55.580
because snobbery.

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.789
These brands are going
to continue to matter,

00:46:58.789 --> 00:47:00.330
and I think they're
going to continue

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:02.050
to matter to a lot of people.

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:04.030
And parents who,
for better or worse,

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:07.090
aspire to great
things for their kids

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.460
are just not to
be able to resist.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:13.980
A, the data that just shows that
people who go to college out

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.450
earn people who don't--
no matter where they go--

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:19.300
out earn people who don't buy
like zillions of dollars over

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.220
their lifetime.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.150
The numbers are
just off the charts.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:25.190
So kids will keep going.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:28.890
And parents who want to wear
the better-than-new sweatshirt

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:30.780
and put the sticker
on their car are

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:34.210
going to have a really hard
time tacking against that

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:39.250
to send their kid
a MOOC or to have

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:42.885
them do a certificate
for this trade

00:47:42.885 --> 00:47:44.500
or that trade or that skill.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.020
Even if it's taking
the 18-year-old who's

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.370
obsessed with developing
apps and putting them

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:56.880
straight into a hardcore coding
class for 12 or 18 months.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.460
For some kids, that may be,
in fact, the best thing.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.790
But it takes a lot of guts
to do something really,

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:03.900
really different.

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.300
18 years ago or
something, I wrote a book

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.410
about taking gap
years from college

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:12.520
and how that is so
clearly a better way

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.975
to approach higher education,
i.e., starting at 19 and not

00:48:15.975 --> 00:48:19.450
at 18 when you're still trying
to fine tune your personality

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:21.520
and you're out of the
house for the first time.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.161
And even to this day,
it's not mainstream,

00:48:24.161 --> 00:48:26.410
even though that's how the
rest of the developed world

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:27.150
does things.

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.010
Kids don't go to college at 18.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.250
They do military
service, or they

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.750
take some sort of a gap year.

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:35.220
It still hasn't
hit the mainstream.

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.260
So even if we do come
up with a better way

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.500
to do this, a
cheaper way, I just

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.390
think it's going to take a
long time for it to set in.

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:45.480
And I get that there are other
changes in the world, changes

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.660
that this company has
brought to the world that

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:53.640
have been way more quick than
what I'm predicting will happen

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:54.690
with higher education.

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.930
But I just don't see these
institutions crumbling anytime

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:02.310
soon, particularly the
top 50 or 100 or 150

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:04.670
that many parents just
can't help but aspire

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:06.250
to for their children.

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.920
And also, we should keep in mind
that the kids play a role here,

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:09.420
too.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.250
They bat their eyes
at us and they say,

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.954
but this is what I really want.

00:49:12.954 --> 00:49:14.370
And it's like, are
we really going

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:17.320
to, in this really
important moment,

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.870
deny them the thing that they
most want for their next four

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:24.250
years, even though we think they
may need something different?

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:25.950
It will be very,
very difficult, I

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:30.640
think, for many of us to say
no and do something else.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.620
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:34.385
I really love the idea of
engaging honestly and directly

00:49:34.385 --> 00:49:36.260
with kids about the
numbers that are actually

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.970
involved in terms of the
family salaries and the family

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:41.270
expenses.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:43.880
But how do you talk to kids
about that in a truthful way

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:47.424
without having to be overwhelmed
by the difference in magnitude

00:49:47.424 --> 00:49:49.715
between the numbers that are
going on in a family level

00:49:49.715 --> 00:49:52.390
and what's going on at their
individual allowance or savings

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.940
level?

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.880
Why should they have
to sweat and slave

00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:00.270
to put away $10, $20 to buy this
toy when Mommy and Daddy are

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.900
making so much more
money and spending

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.390
so much money on vacations.

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:06.789
Oh, this is how much it costs
for us to go to Florida.

00:50:06.789 --> 00:50:07.330
That's silly.

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:09.371
Why don't we just tack a
tiny little bit more on,

00:50:09.371 --> 00:50:10.505
and we can all get Barbies.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.800
RON LIEBER: Much
depends on what you

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.980
want to make them
responsible for and when

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.180
you want to introduce
them to those big numbers.

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:22.790
So I believe in doing
this really gradually.

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:24.599
And I do think you
should be transparent,

00:50:24.599 --> 00:50:26.390
but I don't think you
should be transparent

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:28.340
until they are ready,
until they have the math

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:31.120
skills, until they have
the context, until they

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.967
have the experience of
doing it themselves.

00:50:32.967 --> 00:50:35.300
AUDIENCE: So until they're
making those kind of salaries

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.640
you're saying?

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.890
RON LIEBER: No.

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:42.400
Until they're able to reckon
with numbers that large.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.580
So if you think about
it on a continuum--

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:48.940
you start at age six
or seven, and you're

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:53.550
going along with the allowance,
and it's $5, $6, $8 a week.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:55.150
Maybe you increase it over time.

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:57.070
Maybe the time they're
9 or 10 and they've

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:59.360
been doing it for a while,
you sit down with them

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.380
and say, you know what?

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.963
A, we're not going
to pay for anything

00:51:01.963 --> 00:51:05.760
you want anymore, only at the
holidays and on your birthday.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.100
And anything you want, you're
going to have to pay for.

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.660
And we're going to increase
your allowance by 100%.

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.660
But you're only increasing
it to the point where

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.280
they can get a few of
the things that they want

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.113
and not so much that
they don't have to make

00:51:16.113 --> 00:51:18.400
a lot of really hard choices.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.050
And then, slowly,
you introduce them

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:24.200
to bigger numbers-- the
grocery bill, maybe the rent,

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.962
or the mortgage, all
the household expenses.

00:51:26.962 --> 00:51:29.170
In the meantime in the
background, they're in school,

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.960
and they're now using four-
and five- and six-digit numbers

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.700
in math class.

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.500
So they're learning
more about that.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.291
They're getting used
to the bigger numbers.

00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:38.480
And you're saying
to them, look, this

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.072
is part of our family's reality.

00:51:40.072 --> 00:51:41.530
There are these
three-digit numbers

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:45.090
and these four-digit checks,
or electronic payments that we

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:46.780
have to make each month.

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:48.330
And so you may
think that we have

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:50.720
a lot, because there are
all these big numbers

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.630
floating around.

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:54.640
But in fact, this is what
we need to spend in order

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.240
to have the life that we have.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.960
And it turns out that
there's not a lot left over

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.192
at the end of the month.

00:52:00.192 --> 00:52:01.900
And we're going to
tell you what that is.

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:03.831
But first, you need
to understand--

00:52:03.831 --> 00:52:05.330
before we get to
the bigger numbers,

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.520
you need to understand
what we're spending.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.639
And that takes years for
them to learn all that.

00:52:09.639 --> 00:52:11.930
Because if you did it all at
once, they would be bored.

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:12.720
So you look for your moments.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.844
You look for your openings.

00:52:13.844 --> 00:52:16.290
You could spend a year
just walking the aisles

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:18.400
at Whole Foods or Fairway.

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.300
Every single stop
in the grocery aisle

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.684
is an intense lesson
in wants and needs.

00:52:23.684 --> 00:52:26.100
You've got environmental impact,
and you've got nutrition,

00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:27.650
and you've got social
responsibility,

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:29.275
and you've got whatever
your budget is,

00:52:29.275 --> 00:52:31.450
and maybe you've
got some coupons.

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:33.560
All this stuff-- each
of those decisions

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:38.072
is its own kind of microcosm
of awesome trade-offs.

00:52:38.072 --> 00:52:40.530
So you could spend a whole year
in the grocery store alone.

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:43.760
So then eventually,
13 or 14, by then,

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.300
they've probably googled you.

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.290
They've googled your address.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:49.970
Maybe they've gone
to salary.com.

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:52.530
Seriously, there are kids
who do this at 10 or 11.

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:56.600
They've put software developer,
senior software developer,

00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.210
lead software developer-- they
look at your business card,

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:01.251
they take that term, they
put it into salary.com,

00:53:01.251 --> 00:53:02.700
and they kind of figure it out.

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:03.830
AUDIENCE: So kind of
like the sex talk--

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.205
wait until they googled it
already, and you can avoid it.

00:53:06.205 --> 00:53:08.280
RON LIEBER: Well, that's right.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.740
They're figuring this out.

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.510
They're getting the Zillow
estimate on your apartment.

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:14.214
So they're starting to know.

00:53:14.214 --> 00:53:15.880
So at that point,
you're like, OK, look,

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.310
we really do want to share
this information with you.

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:19.551
In fact, you need it.

00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:21.800
It's important for you to
know what it is that we have

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.370
and what it is that we make
that allows us to live and do

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:26.260
wherever we live
and whatever we do.

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.170
But we're not going
to give it to you

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.294
yet, because you have to
prove that you can keep it

00:53:29.294 --> 00:53:30.442
to yourself.

00:53:30.442 --> 00:53:32.900
And we're going to check to
make sure that you are treating

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.385
your friends'
information privately,

00:53:34.385 --> 00:53:35.940
and we're going to watch
you carefully to see

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.610
if you're getting
conflicts there.

00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:39.259
We're going to watch
with your siblings

00:53:39.259 --> 00:53:41.550
if you have them to see if
you're reading their diaries

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:45.880
or tattling on them
when they're not

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.730
doing something that's dangerous
or worth tattling about.

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:50.400
We're going to
keep an eye on how

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.730
you deal with other
information, private information

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:53.880
that the family gives you.

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.970
And then we're going
to sit you down

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:58.150
and say, OK, we're going
to tell you all of it now.

00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:59.410
You're 16, you're 17.

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:01.300
10 years have gone by.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:01.990
You are ready.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:06.810
But if you tell anyone,
it will be a sign

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:10.052
that we shouldn't trust you,
because you're not as mature

00:54:10.052 --> 00:54:11.010
as we thought you were.

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:12.890
So this is a test.

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:15.520
And by the way, if
you do tell people,

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.350
it's not really going to
matter so much to them.

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:20.220
Because maybe they
have a little more,

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.636
and maybe they
have a little less.

00:54:21.636 --> 00:54:24.160
But they're just not going
to be all that interested.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:27.370
And if it turns that you're
like the zillionaire next door,

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:29.390
and nobody knows it, and
you tell your kids that

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:30.973
and they blab about
that, then they're

00:54:30.973 --> 00:54:34.200
going to sound like jerks,
because their bragging.

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.180
So no kid wants to
flunk the jerk test.

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.330
No kid wants to flunk
the maturity test.

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:40.420
And the kid wants to
use all this information

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.870
in an appropriate way by
the time they're that old.

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.020
And they want your respect.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:46.460
And so by then,
and only then, are

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.560
they ready to get all
of that information.

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.893
AUDIENCE: And that helps lead
into the picking a college

00:54:50.893 --> 00:54:52.100
major conversation as well.

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:54.137
If you want to have
these same things,

00:54:54.137 --> 00:54:56.470
you need to make long-term
financial planning decisions.

00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:57.178
RON LIEBER: Yeah.

00:54:57.178 --> 00:54:59.720
Because most parents
think, well, gosh, they

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:01.380
worry, how on Earth
is my kid going

00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.050
to be able to
reproduce what I've

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:05.420
been able to create for them?

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.830
Because I didn't have a big
pile of student loan debt,

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:09.580
and the price of
college was different,

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:11.190
and I was lucky enough
to get hired at Google

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:12.870
and work here or go
work for a startup

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:15.610
before or after or in
between or whatever.

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:18.080
But it turns out that there
are all sorts of kids who don't

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.320
want what their parents have.

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.650
Maybe they want to be artists,
or public school teachers,

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:27.920
or start a small business that
doesn't involve technology.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.130
Maybe they want to be
artisans or mechanics.

00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:32.200
Or who knows?

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.430
And so they may well
say to themselves,

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:39.220
OK, well, if it took $220,000
in household income for us

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:44.770
to have 2 and 1/2 a bedroom,
one bath apartment a mile

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:49.410
from the Googleplex in New York,
maybe I can get by on $50,000

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:51.714
a year if I lived in Bushwick.

00:55:51.714 --> 00:55:52.880
And I'll make that decision.

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:53.421
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:53.421 --> 00:55:55.129
Thanks.

00:55:55.129 --> 00:55:56.670
PRESENTER: And just
time for one more

00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:58.630
question, and then
we'll stick around.

00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.768
RON LIEBER: OK.

00:55:58.768 --> 00:55:59.500
I'm happy to hang
around, though,

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.820
if you want to do a one-on-one.

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.320
Hi.

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:01.640
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.140
Thanks.

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.530
This has been hugely valuable.

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:04.770
RON LIEBER: Thank you.

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:07.710
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering--
in our household,

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:09.250
we have two little kids.

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:10.750
The older one is 4
and 1/2, so we're

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:14.190
starting to teach the values
of wants versus needs, mostly

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:16.620
around the topic of
tutus at this point.

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:24.430
But the issue is the influx
of stuff from family members

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:26.450
outside of our immediate family.

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:30.000
And we're trying to teach
that goods are exhaustible.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.686
That if you finish your
book of 1,000 stickers,

00:56:33.686 --> 00:56:34.810
that's the end of the book.

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:38.700
But then we get a shipment from
the grandparents and the aunts,

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:39.900
and et cetera.

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.605
So how do you manage
those factors outside

00:56:42.605 --> 00:56:43.612
of your control?

00:56:43.612 --> 00:56:44.320
RON LIEBER: Sure.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.740
So on a very basic
level, you control access

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.780
to the box cutter.

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:52.150
So when the packages come,
you can open them out of view.

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:54.170
You can open them after bedtime.

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:57.270
You can put them away
for as long as you want.

00:56:57.270 --> 00:57:02.860
If the grandparents give you a
problem with that, well, tough.

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.380
Because you're in charge.

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:07.750
Now, the bigger issue
with grandparents

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:12.200
is that they're a
menace generally.

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:17.810
They exist to subvert every
last one of our rules.

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:20.030
My brother and I happen
to share a mother who

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:23.300
sent a black leather
miniskirt to our daughter

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.310
when she was five.

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:28.090
That went back to the store.

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:30.230
So they love pushing
the boundaries.

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:32.170
They take joy in it, in fact.

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:34.450
It gives them glee.

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:39.730
And so look, I would say-- I
literally had a sample chapter

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:43.310
title in my book proposal that
said grandparents are a menace.

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:45.750
But in fact, if they're not a
part of your day-to-day life

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:47.300
or your week-to-week
life, if they're not

00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:49.216
your primary caregiver
when you're not around,

00:57:49.216 --> 00:57:50.680
say, or they don't
live with you,

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.388
then I think you can
let some of that go.

00:57:52.388 --> 00:57:53.870
Although by all
means, parcel out

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:57.520
the packages to whenever the
stickers are about to be gone,

00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.457
or they have been gone
for a little while.

00:57:59.457 --> 00:58:01.290
It's good that kids
love their grandparents,

00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:03.373
that they want to spend
time with the grandparents

00:58:03.373 --> 00:58:06.030
so that we can have
time to ourselves.

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:08.770
But you're also asking
a bigger question

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:11.550
there, which is that if you're
lucky enough to have more

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:15.620
than you need, you
can, in fact, replenish

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:20.561
the stuff as it goes away, and
they need not want or yearn.

00:58:20.561 --> 00:58:22.830
But you should make them anyway.

00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:24.940
Because patience is good.

00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:26.730
Yearning is good.

00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:28.480
You can even set a
benchmark for yourself.

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.070
I talk about this in
the book a little bit.

00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:33.730
Some parents say, OK,
well, I think on average,

00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:40.720
I want my kid to be in the
30th percentile of stuff,

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:45.192
or I want for every 10 kids
that my child is closest

00:58:45.192 --> 00:58:47.650
to, their 10 closest friends,
I always want my child to be,

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:50.440
on average, the seventh kid
to get whatever the kids are

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:52.750
excited about-- so
the seventh Rainbow

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:54.870
Loo, set, the seventh
set of Hunter boots,

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:59.420
the seventh a Death
Star LEGO, whatever.

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.220
Because then they wait.

00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:02.684
And it's good for them to wait.

00:59:02.684 --> 00:59:04.850
And quite often, by the
time the fourth or the fifth

00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:07.244
or the sixth kid has
gotten something, the first

00:59:07.244 --> 00:59:09.660
and the second and the third
kid are bored with that thing

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:11.368
and are onto something
else, and your kid

00:59:11.368 --> 00:59:13.560
doesn't even need to get it.

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.586
But again, it's good
for them to wait.

00:59:15.586 --> 00:59:16.710
It's good for them to save.

00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:19.880
It's good for them to pay
for things themselves.

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.480
And it requires some
resistance on your part,

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.480
but I think it's doable.

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.313
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:59:24.313 --> 00:59:25.090
Thanks.

00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:26.250
RON LIEBER: Thank you.

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:29.000
[APPLAUSE]
