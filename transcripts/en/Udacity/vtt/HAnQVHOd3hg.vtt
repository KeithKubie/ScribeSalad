00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.910
Overcoming rejections from investors
is something all entrepreneurs do.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.460
Google, LinkedIn, all those
founders got rejected dozens and

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.200
dozens of times before they
got their first investment.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.270
So if you get rejected, good news!

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.010
You're part of a great
group of entrepreneurs, and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.070
it's actually part of the process.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.840
I think the key is to
learn from each rejection.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.100
Why were you rejected?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.970
Maybe you didn't approach the right
investors in the first place.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.430
Maybe your pitch was too long or
not clear enough.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.290
Try to get that feedback from
the investor as to how to improve it and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.730
improve your chances of raising
funding with other investors.
