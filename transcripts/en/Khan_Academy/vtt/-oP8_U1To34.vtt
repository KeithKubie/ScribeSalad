00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:01.911
- [Voiceover] "Click on
the graph below to draw

00:00:01.911 --> 00:00:03.801
"a right triangle with right angle

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:06.121
"at x equals eight, y equals six,

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:09.128
"and hypotenuse extending
from zero comma 14

00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:11.751
"to negative 10 comma negative 12."

00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:14.027
Well, looks like they've
given us the three vertices

00:00:14.027 --> 00:00:16.105
of the triangle so we
could just plot them.

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:17.985
So let's just, it says,
"Click to add vertices."

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:18.728
So let's do that.

00:00:18.728 --> 00:00:20.145
We have one at eight comma six,

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:24.036
x equals eight, y is equal to six.

00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:26.879
Then we have one at zero comma 14.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:30.433
So x equals zero, y is equal to 14

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:31.919
and it drew the line there.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.473
And then we go from that point

00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:37.267
to negative 10 comma negative 12.

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:38.931
Negative 10, wrong side,

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.940
x is negative 10,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.467
y is negative 12.

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.292
So we go to that point right over there

00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:47.196
and then we can just
connect everything back

00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:48.775
by going to our original point

00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:49.530
and there we have it.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.773
It even drew the nice right
angle right over there.

00:00:51.773 --> 00:00:52.269
There we have it.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:53.627
We have our right triangle.

00:00:53.627 --> 00:00:55.298
We'd really just have to plot the points

00:00:55.298 --> 00:00:56.457
in order actually.

00:00:56.457 --> 00:00:57.644
Any order would have worked

00:00:57.644 --> 00:00:59.605
because there's only three points here.

00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:01.922
So yeah, that was it.
