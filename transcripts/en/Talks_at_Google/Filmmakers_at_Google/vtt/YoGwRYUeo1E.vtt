&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: I'm the producer of the
movie and thank you all for coming. We're

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.270
thrilled to be here at Google. The movie business
is a tough business, so when you make a small

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.820
movie you want lots of people to see it. And
the fact that we came here to Google, that's

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.140
been fantastic and we're thrilled to have
you here as an audience.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.270
I am lucky to be partners in this movie with
a guy who you can all see in a second who

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.130
is literally a Hollywood legend. He created
the show "Everybody Loves Raymond," which

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:41.020
I'm sure many of you have seen, and now he
is moving into film. And he is a talent behind

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.500
the camera and in front of the camera.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.790
He's funny, as you've seen. And it's very
unusual to have him coming out and doing Q&amp;As.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.300
So, without any further ado, I love to introduce
Phil Rosenthal, who's the director and star

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.460
of the movie, "Exporting Raymond."

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.460
[applause]

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.930
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Do I come now? Is now good?
Now good to come? Hi guys. Thanks John. What's

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.970
this? This is the new Google microphone?

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.970
[laughter]

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.460
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: You can sit or stand.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.440
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Do you put it in your body?

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.700
[laughter]

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.150
Hello everybody. Thanks for coming to the
film. Did you show the film?

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.480
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.720
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: All right. Very nice. How's--.
I'm here for you. I'll answer any questions

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.370
that you need know. I'm very technically minded,
so I know a lot of you aren't.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.540
[laughter]

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.600
But I can help you with any--. You know what?
I'm good at like relationship problems.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.150
[laughter]

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.150
So if any of you, you know, in that department,
I can help you. I can't really help you with

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.720
the computer things. [chuckles] But the other
things, the softer things, that I can help

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.720
with.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.850
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: Why don't you start by
talking about just the fact that it's a documentary,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.670
which is very different than what you've been
doing?

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.360
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: It is a documentary.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.360
[laughter]

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.170
I guess the way it came about was the head
of Sony called me in his office and he told

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.840
me that Sony invented the sitcom in Russia.
It didn't exist until they brought The Nanny,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.540
over, I think you saw that part, and that
became a big hit.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.680
And he said, "How would you like to go over
there and just observe how we work with these

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.379
people and then come back and write a fictional
feature film about a creator of a show who

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.650
goes to Russia to have his show translated?"
And I said, "Well if the situation exists,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.120
these people really exist, why not just bring
a camera crew over and film what would really

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.169
happen?"

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:41.499
And he said, "I love that idea. Would you
go do your show over there and not only make

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:46.590
the movie, but be in the movie?" So, you have
to, you know--. I love every part of the business.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.489
I started as an actor and became a writer,
then a director, then a producer.

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.730
And so I love every aspect of the business
except the business. That's the bad part,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.999
but their all the other stuff I love. So,
this was too good an opportunity to pass up

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.760
until I got there.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.420
[laughter]

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.420
Yeah.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.420
[laughter]

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.420
[cell phone rings]

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.420
Hello.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.840
[laughter]

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.870
That's Google's secret code thing?

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.870
[laughter]

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.379
[Imitates gangster voice] Assassinate him
now.

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.379
[laughter]

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.299
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: Now, naturally we'd love
to, if you have any questions, but we can

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.349
certainly talk about some of the things in
the movie, like your parents.

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:39.319
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Again my parents. No. I,
they're very special people. They are kind

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.939
of the stars. Most people see them as the
stars of the movie. They'd steal the movie

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:51.449
I think. They're inimitable. You had a question
right here. Are we doing microphone passing?

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:52.449
All right. Here we go.

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:59.250
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: It seems from the
movie at least, that you're an expert, an

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.010
evangelist of the family. I mean, you sort
of know what an American family is. Or even

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.339
universally, what truths are of families all
over the world.

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:18.100
What do you think is holding true and what's
gonna change in the future? I mean, if you're

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.100
getting into film and--

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.100
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Yeah.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.410
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: I imagine that
you're gonna continue with what you're an

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.130
expert in--. Continue like movies, shows about
the truths of being a family. Are those gonna

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.130
change, or what's gonna hold?

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.910
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Do you mean that, or do
I think families will change?

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.980
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Sure. What, what,
I mean--.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.780
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Families have changed already.
Like, there's already a difference between

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.570
Everybody Loves Raymond and Modern Family,
right? That which is like a fantastic representation

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.910
of what a family is today and they do it great.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:54.350
And they found a way to make it a modern family.
I believe that a family is anywhere people

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.540
are forced to live together. [laughter] Like,
you guys really do, in my little time that

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.851
I've had here already, you kinda have this
Google family. I mean, you're sitting in a

00:05:05.851 --> 00:05:06.851
room with people.

00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:12.660
I know it's a huge organization, but do you
feel like you know each other? I'm just curious.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.440
Or are most of you like, this is the first
time you've seen a lot of people? Yes? It

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440
is?

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440
[laughter]

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.690
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: The work in this
office is pretty good, so I do think we have

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.390
this sense of Googliness just from that. Maybe.
I don't know.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.390
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Just from what?

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.720
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Just from this
idea of Googliness, meaning we have a sense

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.720
of--.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.720
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Is that what you call it?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.720
[laughter]

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.140
That's so queer.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.220
[laughter]

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.150
Just so, I gotta tell you 'cause we're on
the same wavelength on at least one thing.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.300
When I was making the television show and
you're bringing people together who have never

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.580
worked together before, even though they're
in the same business and they understand the

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.580
business of TV the way you understand the
business of what you do, how do you make people

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.900
feel like a family, strangers?

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:04.490
And I found out what it is. It's food. I swear
to God. That is essential. And just walking

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.580
around here and saying, "Oh, yeah. Eat whatever
you want." And there's 35 other places where

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.240
you can eat whatever you want, any time you
want. And I'm like, "I wanna live here."

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.880
[laughter]

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.300
And I love everyone. If you have let's say
on a movie shoot, or TV shoot, and you just

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.840
put out crap for the people to eat, like potato
chips. You know, just junk food. Jelly beans.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.880
Stuff like this. First of all, it doesn't
keep them alive the way you want them to be.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.560
But they grab it just because they're hungry
and/or bored and go back to their jobs without

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.690
really communicating. But if you do what I
did, which is once in a while, here comes

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:50.110
some cinnamon rolls from Chicago, here comes
some pastrami and deli from New York and that

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.750
stuff is on the table, then you go over and
you've never met him before and you go over

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.750
and you eat.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.010
Oh, my God. They say, "Oh, my God. Did you
try this?" And they say, "Yeah." And right

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.480
away we're talking and it's about something
nice. Food connects us all in the most elemental

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:13.830
way and your people here who thought of this
idea of making the food great and ubiquitous

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:19.810
and all the time and as much you want, I mean
first of all, nobody here is 300-pounds either.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.810
[laughter]

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:27.480
Which is surprising because I think--. First
thing I would do, when I first came to Hollywood,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.960
I had been a starving actor, literally. And
the only, when you're working in the writer's

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.280
room, the only sunshine coming in that room,
and you're there all day, is the menu.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.090
[laughter]

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.530
So, you mean I can get an appetizer and an
entrée? Yes. And dessert? Yes. Anything I

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:49.419
want? Yes. Every day? Yes. I gained 30 pounds,
right away. Right away. But I felt taken care

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:54.220
of the way your mom takes care of you. That's
what food does. So welcome to my talk about

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.220
you and food.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.220
[laughter]

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.220
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I had a question
myself.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.220
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Please.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.940
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I think in industry
terms Raymond and shows like that are called

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:06.260
three-camera shows. Or is it four camera?

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.810
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Now it's four-camera. It
did start up. You know who invented the three-camera

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:16.010
sitcom that we know? Do you know? It was Desi
Arnaz when they made I Love Lucy. That was

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:21.250
the first time they had used multiple cameras
to film a show.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.480
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: And the second
part is supposedly, I've read that shows like

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.440
30 Rock and The Office and Parks and Recreation
are called one-camera shows, somebody walking

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.840
around with a camera.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.900
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Yes.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:33.979
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: What's your feeling
about the difference between those two formats?

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:38.079
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Well, obviously the 30 Rock
shows and The Office, those are made like

00:08:38.079 --> 00:08:44.019
movies. So, you're watching a film. Our show,
and the shows that came before us and the

00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:52.850
ones that are on now, these are four-camera
shows that are rehearsed, written, rehearsed,

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.050
and presented as a play in front of an audience.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:01.610
And it's this perfect in-between film and
theater because you get the theatrical experience,

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:09.899
right? Written, rehearsed all week, presented
to real laughing people, hopefully, who come

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:17.490
on Friday nights to watch the taping. This
then is preserved and tweaked and edited like

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.490
a movie.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:23.279
So it's the, to me, it's always been the best
of both worlds. You get to have the pliability

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:30.509
and yet the permanence of film of your theatrical
event. Right? So, I love it. I don't see why

00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:35.300
it fell out of favor. I really don't. I think
apparently this season, when you start watching

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.850
TV this season, you're gonna see more of them.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:43.040
Just everything is cyclical. It comes back
around. But listen, there's great single-camera

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.029
shows, too. My favorite one right now is Louie.
You watch Louie? You guys know that show?

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:49.209
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Yeah.

00:09:49.209 --> 00:09:52.129
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Isn't it great? Amazing
show, right? So I love that.

00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:54.759
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Louie C.K.

00:09:54.759 --> 00:10:00.050
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Yeah. He's awesome. But
there's no--. You know, I can't say one form

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.399
is better than the other. There's good and
bad everything.

00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:08.170
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: I wanna just go back to
families for a second. I mean this, Everybody

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:15.749
Loves Raymond is in 148 countries, currently
subtitled or dubbed. And so the idea of family

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:22.510
is appealing globally. But this new local
language, culturally-adjusted development

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:28.519
of television shows is kind of a new concept
and when Phil went over to help the Russians

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:36.029
try to translate this for their audience,
that's something that is taken hold and is

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:38.360
now the trend in entertainment.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:44.589
And really, maybe commenting on family, confronting
family internationally, culturally adjusting

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:47.070
the impressions of family is something that's
interesting.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:52.899
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: It turns out that they were
the toughest ones to get to come on board.

00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:57.369
Now that it's a hit in Russia, the way they
do it is just like the way they did it with

00:10:57.369 --> 00:11:02.990
The Nanny, because Russia's like the biggest
foreign territory. All the other foreign territories

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.750
follow suit. So Poland really did call. They
really are doing the show. I'm not going.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.750
[laughter]

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:19.829
But they're doing the show. Then Israel, Egypt,
India, England, Argentina, all these places

00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:25.819
are now lining up to do this. The Netherlands
are already doing it. This actually may become,

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:30.650
Sony's telling me, it probably will become
the most produced show in the world.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.769
[laughter]

00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:39.360
I'm shocked. But then again, I have to say,
"Why not?" It is, as I've maintained, about

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.369
a relatable thing. Not that it's so fantastic
or the best show ever, I'm not saying that.

00:11:44.369 --> 00:11:52.410
I'm saying it seems to be relatable because
it's about stuff that doesn't change,family.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.110
So they seem to have that everywhere.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.019
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: I just saw a clip. Phil
sent me clips from Poland and from Egypt.

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:00.019
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Yes.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:05.529
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: The Egyptian version is
hilarious. It's subtitled in English and you

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:11.540
don't know what to expect, but honestly, it's--.
The items in the show might change because

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:17.119
of where it is, but the dynamic between husband
and wife and mother-in-law and father-in-law

00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:21.509
is the same everywhere and it is absolutely
hilarious.

00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:24.339
Who'd have thought?

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:32.369
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: I have a couple
questions. One was that actor that you didn't

00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:33.959
get, you wanted him to, Evgeny something?

00:12:33.959 --> 00:12:35.329
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Evgeny Miller. Great actor.

00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:41.550
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Yeah. Did you ever
hear later he regretted [chuckles] that he

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.179
wasn't allowed to--?

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.899
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: He shot himself.

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:46.899
[laughter]

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:55.059
Look at this. This is they're sense of humor.
No, I, look--. The theatre master owns that

00:12:55.059 --> 00:13:01.679
guy, right? He owns every actor that in--.
That's true. In Russia, even the tiny theater

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:07.990
masters from the tiny theaters--not real little
theater masters [laughter]--from little theaters,

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.929
they tell you once you sign up they run your
career.

00:13:12.929 --> 00:13:21.410
Now, the Moscow Art Theater, I mean this guy,
he is God. I mean, to these people he is God.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.019
It just so happens God likes the singing fish
on the wall.

00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:26.179
[laughter]

00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:33.199
But he tells him what--. Once you sign up,
that's it. And he, obviously he has to let

00:13:33.199 --> 00:13:39.240
some actors out to do film and TV work. Otherwise,
there would be no film and TV work. This guy

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:45.759
though, he was saving for himself, for his,
maybe he was young and maybe he didn't--.

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:49.029
He didn’t' even tell him, the actor didn't
tell the guy that he went in on the audition

00:13:49.029 --> 00:13:56.110
'cause he was so afraid. If it comes out later
that I got it, then I'll worry about it then.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:02.930
And it did. And he said, "No. Absolutely not."
So I'm sorry. I really, I mean you felt my

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.179
frustration.
[audience chuckles]

00:14:04.179 --> 00:14:06.720
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: The other question
was after it took off there today, have you

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.050
considered a live audience for part of it?

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:16.569
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: They did reconsider it and
decided it's cheaper to do it their way. [laughs]

00:14:16.569 --> 00:14:20.209
The excuse they gave me was we would have
to get chairs.

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:21.209
[laughter]

00:14:21.209 --> 00:14:25.350
Here's what you have to know. In America,
it's a million, two million dollars per half

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:30.769
hour. And then, God forbid, you become successful
and the actors want even more money, so they

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:31.769
become--.

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:36.869
I think by the time we were done shooting
it was like four million an episode. There,

00:14:36.869 --> 00:14:42.329
all in, I mean, pre-production, post-production,
food, everything, editing--eighty thousand

00:14:42.329 --> 00:14:47.059
dollars an episode. And I have to say, it
looks it.

00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:51.040
[laughter]

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.249
You know, it looks like we took one camera
and shot in your basement, because that's

00:14:55.249 --> 00:15:03.160
pretty much what they did. [laughter] So that's
the way it looks. And by the way, it plays.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.239
It's not like it doesn't play.

00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:10.699
So they film it every other day, an episode,
because all they're doing is taking our scripts,

00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:14.199
filming them every other day like a soap opera
because that's what they know in the half

00:15:14.199 --> 00:15:20.559
hour format. Then they're on every night Monday
to Friday. So, they're gonna burn through

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:22.610
nine years of my show in a year and a half.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.620
Good luck. Then they have to write their own.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.620
[laughter]

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.620
Good luck. Yeah.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.620
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: I have a question.
Hello.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.620
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Hello.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:36.769
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: First, thanks for
bringing the movie. It was a lot of fun. I

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:40.269
know you probably cut it in a way to make
it mysterious what happens to your driver.

00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:41.269
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Yes.

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:45.579
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: But you have to
know what happened to the guy, don't you?

00:15:45.579 --> 00:15:46.579
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: I don't.

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:47.579
[laughter]

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:48.579
It's a Russian mystery.

00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:51.559
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: I think I can clarify.
There are like, sanatoriums outside of the

00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:52.559
big cities.

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:53.559
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Are you from Russia?

00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:54.559
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Yes.

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:55.559
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Great.

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:56.559
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: My grandmother
loves those. She disappeared for two weeks

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:58.369
and you know where she went.

00:15:58.369 --> 00:16:04.670
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: This is what I learned,
that it's both. He went on vacation to a place

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.951
where they do the tests. Is that right?

00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:08.000
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Yeah.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.579
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: And that was a joke that
we made. Maybe in Russia, twelve days of tests

00:16:12.579 --> 00:16:15.250
is a vacation. It is!

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.589
[laughter]

00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:22.519
It is, right? You can go to a place that's
both. I drove three hours outside of Moscow.

00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:25.379
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: It's actually for
older people to do this, not young.

00:16:25.379 --> 00:16:28.200
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: He had something wrong.
Here's the other thing that they told me.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.920
Tell me if this is true. I'm so glad you're
from Russia. First of all, did you like the

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.920
movie?

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.920
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: A lot. It was awesome.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.550
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Did it seem like, did it
seem familiar to you, these people, these

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.550
characters?

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.209
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Actually, I visited
Moscow for the first time after 17 years.

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:42.889
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Well it's changed very much.

00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:47.660
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: I went last summer.
I had kind of a distant experience. Not quite

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.629
sure what to make of it.

00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:50.959
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Great. Great.

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:55.600
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: The costume designer
was the best character.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600
[laughter]

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.390
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: By the way--

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.629
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: We certainly didn't
have those 17 years ago.

00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:04.839
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: You say, well, here's my
first meeting. Everything is in real-time.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:08.620
Nothing has been manipulated. You say edited
the movie to make it mysterious. I didn't

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:12.310
do one thing. I didn't change anything. I
didn't manipulate anything.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.030
Yes, I understand certain rules of comedy
so if somebody says something funny, that's

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:21.589
probably a good place to get out of the scene.
I had 200 hours. I couldn’t show everything.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:26.390
So I wanted to tell my story. But, for example,
that first meeting with the costume lady.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.300
I'm there and I just explained I just think
it should be relatable. And here this lady,

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.510
dressed the way she is, she raised her hand,
"I think the show should be used to teach

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.000
the population about high fashion."

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.480
[laughter]

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:45.820
So I think, "Wow. That's unusual. The costume
lady gets to say what she thinks the show

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:52.770
should be." That's not like how we do it here.
I'll play. Let's listen. Maybe there's something.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:59.090
And I listened and I, "Oh, she's obviously
crazy." [laughter] So I think this is just

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:04.211
how it is in Russia. But, you saw that there
were ten months of when I went away and I

00:18:04.211 --> 00:18:08.910
came back 'cause they shut down production
in Russia for ten months. Come back. Now I

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.790
have a new costume lady.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:19.230
Perfectly normal. Fine. It wasn't "Russians."
It was "this lady." I happen to get lucky

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.900
enough. [laughter] And I really do consider
myself lucky because you wanna populate your

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:30.900
film with funny characters, right? Just a
gift. Just a gift. And talking about my parents,

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.900
that's a gift.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.790
I had no idea they would be so funny. People
ask me, "How did you get the Russians to behave

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:41.270
this way?" And I didn't. "Why would they behave
this way on camera?" I don't know why, but

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.600
look at my parents. You go to their house
where they've lived for 40 years.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.400
You come in, I don't know if you've been filmed
before, but here it is. They take a wire and

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.320
they put it up the front of the inside of
my mother's blouse. Well, she's not used to

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.790
this kind of attention. And they clip a thing
to her backside, and my father, too. "I have

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.700
to wear this on my ass," he says.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.860
And two guys with big cameras and lights and
another guy with a boom microphone in their

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.730
kitchen. Within five minutes, they're fighting
as if nobody's there.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:10.910
[laughter]

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:18.310
So this is, I guess, how we get documentaries,
how we get reality shows made. People forget

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.210
that the camera's on after a very short amount
of time.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.412
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: Or, when you called back
on Skype and you didn't even know if they

00:19:25.412 --> 00:19:26.412
would answer.

00:19:26.412 --> 00:19:29.800
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Well, now you're talking
about documentaries, you're talking about

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.240
luck. You have to have luck. We all have to
have luck in every aspect of our lives, but

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:38.680
no more so in the documentary where you're
turning on the camera and you don't wanna

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:44.910
manipulate it and you don't wanna falsify
something, you are reliant on the luck.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:50.430
So who knew when they just came up organically
at the dinner with the beautiful family about

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.650
Skype, who knew first of all, think of all
the things that have to happen for that to

00:19:54.650 --> 00:20:00.760
work. They have to be awake, from New York
from Moscow. They have to know how to turn

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.460
the computer on and this is already a big
deal.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:11.550
They have to know how to work Skype. You saw
they barely got it. And then the beauty of

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:16.131
the comedic, first just my mom's looking like
this--

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:17.131
[laughter]

00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:20.450
and then that they would start fighting again
that something would go wrong and they would

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:25.950
fight, creating something that you would write
if you could, a comedic call-back to their

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.910
relationship from the beginning.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:34.360
And it happened in the real time that you
see in the movie. We didn't take it from another

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:41.240
time in my story. It really happened towards
the end of my visit where it happens in the

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.410
movie, when I'm sick of the Russians. I don't
wanna talk to them anymore. I don't even want

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:49.050
to go to this house. And then this beautiful
thing happens. I'm very lucky. That's the

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.870
point. Luck, luck, luck. You had more to say.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:58.741
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Speaking of how
things changed, it's not strictly true that

00:20:58.741 --> 00:21:02.120
sitcoms are new in Russia. I remember in the
early 90s there were sitcoms, but speaking

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.120
of reality TV, the reality is what changed.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.800
'Cause I remember very vividly I'd seen in
one of those early sitcoms, there was a guy

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:15.690
bringing back what he thinks is a VCR in a
box from like, the black market. And he opens

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.130
it up and there's brakes in it.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.600
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: That's funny.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.600
[laughter]

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:29.120
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Well, no. I mean,
stuff like this happens to people and it's

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.120
devastating, right?

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.120
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Because he spent the--

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.120
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: So, there were
no laughs in that show.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.120
[laughter]

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.870
So maybe that's the change, right? People
can afford to laugh sometimes.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:43.020
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: The Raymond show, the Kostya
show, it's now called The Voronins. Have you

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:47.270
heard of it? Have any of your family back
there heard of it? It's the most popular sitcom

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:51.700
on the air there now. By the way, Sony, very
nice.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.540
They wanted to send me--. "I know you're into
what happens in the news." So a few months

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.320
ago they said, "How would you like to go to
Cairo?"

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.190
[laughter]

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:06.630
In the middle of all that. "What are you talking
about?" "They wanna do the show. You should

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:11.910
go and help them." "Now? You see what's happening?"
They didn't care.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.910
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: You should talk about maybe
some of the things that didn't show up in

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.840
the movie that your--.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:24.320
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: I talked to Eldar off camera.
I said to him, "You know Eldar, I really do

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.820
feel safe with you. I'm really glad you're
my security." And he said, "Mr. Rosenthal,

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.480
I have to tell you. Sony did not go for the
gun package."

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:47.530
[laughter]

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:51.380
So not only do you feel a little less safe,
you feel bad that they don't even think you're

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:59.590
worth a gun package. So, go to Cairo. Why
don't you send me to Afghanistan next?

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:00.830
[laughter]

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:08.120
Yeah. Yeah. I can tell you one more thing
that I left out 'cause--. [chuckles] No one

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:13.710
will see this. You leave things out also because
you don't want them to be taken the wrong

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:18.730
way. So, when I met that head of comedy, and
he really did insult me at that dinner by

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.980
saying I'm not funny, the show's not funny.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.510
And that's fun to say at the beginning of
a dinner and now I have to sit through the

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:28.540
whole dinner with this guy. And you see they
interview me after the dinner, "What did you

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:34.440
think?" And I did say on camera, I said, "We
meet the head of comedy. It doesn't really

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.930
look like head of comedy."

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.460
I did go on to say, and I cut this 'cause
I didn't want it to be taken the wrong way.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.590
"He looks like something out of Schindler's
List and not the list part."

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:48.910
[laughter]

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.360
'Cause you know that could be taken the wrong
way.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.360
[laughter]

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.690
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: It's like a classic
Russian --.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.850
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: You can't write that guy,
right? You can't write that.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.220
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: It's the eyebrows?

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.510
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Again, luck, luck. And they
really did bring him from the world of laser

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.510
beams.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.970
[laughter]

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:13.920
By the way, you meet just as many heads of
comedy in America. This is not the disparaged

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:20.651
Russians at all. I met the most humorless
people in my life are heads of comedy.

00:24:20.651 --> 00:24:21.651
[laughter]

00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:25.820
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: We can take one more question.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:31.402
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: You said that people
usually forget right away that they are on

00:24:31.402 --> 00:24:32.402
camera.

00:24:32.402 --> 00:24:33.402
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Are you from Russia, too?

00:24:33.402 --> 00:24:34.690
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Yes I am. And these
two guys are, too.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.670
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Really. And you liked the
movie OK?

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:37.670
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Absolutely.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.280
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Because I have to tell you,
Sony is very worried. Sony is very worried

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.720
where they're not gonna show the movie in
Russia because they're worried what if Putin

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.880
sees this movie and takes all their products
off the shelves in Russia.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.880
[laughter]

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.200
I said, "If Putin sees this movie, I'm giving
you an award for marketing."

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.200
[laughter]

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.200
If you can get it to him.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.830
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: He said we were invited
to the Moscow Film Festival.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.510
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: That's true. But we can't
go.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.040
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: What?

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.040
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Fear.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.040
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: Not letting us go.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.040
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Yes.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.040
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: Yes.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.110
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: So, you said that
people usually forget that they are on camera.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.110
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Yes.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.520
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Even you? Is that
what you said?

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.520
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Yes.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.930
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: When you were doing
were you keeping in mind that everything that

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.430
you're actually saying is being filmed by
the people?

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:20.000
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: That's a great question.
I guess somewhere in the back of your head

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.890
you have to know this, but I don't think I'm
that good an actor to have faked what you

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:27.000
saw.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.690
These were real reactions because I really
was shocked. Once in a while if somebody tells

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:38.640
me that for fun he plays musical instruments
made out of enema bags--

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.750
[laughter]

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:49.510
I can't believe my ears and so turn to the
only people with me to say, "Did you get that?"

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:50.510
[laughter]

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:55.221
But it has to be that big to take you out
of the moment. "All right. Did you hear what

00:25:55.221 --> 00:26:00.050
I just heard? Is that right?" Or, when the
singing fish starts and he's like, "Ah, pretty

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:05.590
funny, huh?" You have to look at the camera
and say, "He thinks it's funny."

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.710
[laughter]

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.460
But that's the only time and here's what I
did. I took two cameras with me. Most of the

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.480
time when you make a documentary, it's one
camera and they would film you talking to

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.180
me and then they tell you to wait while they
went around behind you and did the reverse

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:27.080
angle, meaning "now film my fake reaction
to you talking," and then edit it together.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.310
I didn't wanna do that for two reasons. I
didn't wanna fake anything. That's the first

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.990
reason. The second reason is I wanted everything
covered so I wouldn't have to think about

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:39.602
it. So if I have two cameras shooting everything
and I think the movie wants to be before I

00:26:39.602 --> 00:26:43.800
even go, I'm thinking, "I think the movie
wants to be how I react to them and how they

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800
react to me."

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:51.130
And that seems to be the culture clash at
the center of the film. So, if we film always

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:56.170
me and always them, we have it. And I don't
have to worry. So once that decision is done,

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:59.940
I don't have to think about it until editing,
putting the movie together.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:05.931
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Also, do people
understand that they will look not the way

00:27:05.931 --> 00:27:13.380
they want to be scene? And how do you get
them to be, to actually be shown this way?

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.960
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Look at my parents.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.960
[laughter]

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:24.680
It's the same. In other words, they have no
trouble fighting in front of the camera. "Max,

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:30.190
you don't know what you're doing." She'll
say that on camera. And now she sees and she

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:36.080
goes like this, but they don't stop and think
about it at the time. Maybe I shouldn't have

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.780
just said those things about Sony because
I'm being filmed. But I did.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.780
[laughter]

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.480
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: And one of the technical,
and one of the technical answers is that everyone

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.131
signs a release before you start filming.

00:27:48.131 --> 00:27:52.120
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Before we start filming!
Yes. In one case--. I think there was one

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:57.140
case where I talked to a couple on the street.
She says, "Don't talk to him with your mouth

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.830
full." We didn’t know what we would get
from them.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.490
We didn't think they would kill each other
on the street, but then somebody has to go

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:11.130
and it took a very long time to get those
two people to sign a release because they're

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:14.950
real Russians. And they think they're signing
something that puts them in jail for the rest

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:15.950
of their lives.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:16.950
[laughter]

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.330
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Is the release
something you need for the US or--?

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.700
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: International. It's international.
We need it for everywhere.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.180
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: There's separate laws,
but you need it, you need fundamentally you

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.350
need a release for anyone that appears in
the movie.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:34.240
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: And the release basically
says, "We can use this any way we want, any

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.640
time we want, anywhere we want."

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.300
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: You signed our
release, right?

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.300
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Nope.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.600
[laughter]

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.020
I learned something before I Googled.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:48.270
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: A warm welcome for John
and Phil for having given us a good entertainment.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.060
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: Thank you. Thank you.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.060
[applause]

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.100
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: Thanks for coming.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.100
&gt;&gt;Phil Rosenthal: This was fun.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:54.690
&gt;&gt;John Woldenberg: This was.
