Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I am Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today is inheritance. What you can move on to the next generation and what you can't. Now the Sweden story from our last segment, us both feel a little strange. Yeah. Because while you might have a lot of influence, you know, genetically speaking over your kids and their kids, you don't seem to have a lot of control. So we're going to leave you with a story from our producer, Pat Walters, about one woman's radicle even troubling attempt to regain that control all they come on in again, a few months ago, pat made his way down to North Carolina to a small suburb outside of Charlotte to visit this family. Me and mom is the one I'd come to see. She and I snuck away from the children into our office. Right. This is nice and quiet. Um, well I guess, um, I was thinking we could just start at the beginning.

Speaker 1:          00:54          What year was it? Where were you? Oh, okay. Um, 1989. So this is Barbara, Barbara Harris. I'm the founder and director of project prevention. And in 1989 when the story we're telling now started, she was living in California, in Orange County, and I was a waitress. I worked for IOP for over 30 years and she was a mom to six sons. She and her husband. Really Harris. What did he do for a living? Surgical technician. Six boys is a lot of boys, but at that point, just two of the six boys were living at home, Brian and Rodney, and they were seven and eight at the time. And Barbara found herself returning to a thought she'd kind of always had. She started to wish again that she could have a daughter. Yeah. And by this point, she's 37 years old and I knew the only way I was going to get a daughter was if I went and became a foster parent and asked for one

Speaker 2:          01:46          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:46          So she did. She filled out the forms, went through all the training that we had to do and first day fingerprinted and had a background check done

Speaker 2:          01:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:56          and then they waited for the call. I already knew that if I ever got a little girl, I was going to name her destiny.

Speaker 2:          02:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:04          and um, that summer it was, um, July they got the call, I had asked for a newborn. So when the social worker called me, she said, I have this cute little baby girl for you, but she's eight months old. Is that too old? And I said, no, no, that's okay. She said, well, she's just beautiful. And she has lips that like a baby doll. That's what I remember her saying. So Barbara and her son got in the car and drove across town to the foster home where destiny had been living for the past eight months since birth. We went to the foster home and went in. The lady knew why we were there and destiny was in the other room, might sleeping or something, I'm not sure. So we talked to her for a little while and at a certain point, the social worker pulls out a stack of papers with a child.

Speaker 1:          02:49          They give you a whole folder full of information and tells you all about them. And she told Barbara, there's something you need to know about this baby. And she is born and tested positive for PCP, crack and heroin. And um, doctors would later explained to Barbara that Destiny's mom had been addicted to drugs while she was pregnant. And the psychologist who gave destiny her first checkup told Barbara that she was delayed and she was always going to be delayed because of her prenatal neglect. Did that scare you at all as like, I mean, that would seems like a thing that would be kind of frightening. No, it didn't scare me because she says as soon as she saw destiny and sat her in my lap with her little dress on and her little curly hair, she just knew this is my daughter. A couple of days later I had already bonded with her so much. It was as if I gave birth to her. Honestly, I think it never seemed, yeah,

Speaker 3:          03:44          like she was anything but my real mom, if that makes sense.

Speaker 4:          03:48          This of course is destiny. She's 22 now and she's never even met her birth mom. No, I knew, Barbara says they've reached out to her many times, but they never heard back. And Dessie says she doesn't really care. I mean at all.

Speaker 3:          04:02          I got these jeans from somewhere, but I kinda feel like she was a surrogate. Like she carried me for my real mom. That's how I've always looked at it. You know, my mom needed a girl and she got one. It's just, that's just how I've always been.

Speaker 4:          04:20          And even though they look basically nothing alike, I mean, for one thing, barber's white and Destiny's black, they both say that they actually often forget that they're not biologically related. They told me a bunch of these stories. One of them involving, well,

Speaker 3:          04:36          yes. So I don't have the biggest boobies in the world. You can't see that on the radio. But Hey, it's a fact of life. And destiny says, one day she and her mom were in the car and her mom said, she said, I don't know. You know, maybe. I mean, maybe they'll grow picker like minor, bigger and you know, and then she goes, oh wait, I didn't give birth to you. That doesn't matter. Nevermind. You're stuck with small boobies. Okay. Now I just had to accept it,

Speaker 4:          05:05          but we're getting ahead of ourselves here because given that really sets the story in motion, the set of events happened a few months after Barbara had brought destiny home when they got another call from the social worker saying that same mother, Destiny's birth mother had given birth to another child.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Yeah. The social worker called and told me the mother had given birth birth. Mother's name was actually the same as me. So Barbara Really? Yeah, she has the same name as me. So she'd tell me Barbara had had another baby and a boy did we want it. So I went to the hospital and picked him up.

Speaker 4:          05:40          And you picked him up right from the hospital? Yeah. And as soon as she got there to pick him up, she could tell that something was wrong. He wasn't little happy baby because when a woman uses heroin while she's pregnant, the fetus gets hooked on it too. Two for Isaiah being born with like just cut off

Speaker 1:          05:58          and he was going to withdraw light bothered him. Noise bothered him as it beat it out. This is Smitty again, projectile vomiting because he couldn't hold formula down. He'd fall asleep and just wake up screaming and he was just [inaudible], you know, most babies, Ocala peaceful. He was never a really peaceful and day after day, literally for months, Isaiah would sleep and he would scream. That was it. It was just, no baby should have to come into the world like that. And nobody has a right to do that to a baby. But a year later, the social worker called again saying the mother had given birth to a baby girl. Did we want her? This is the same birth mother. Yeah. And again, Barbara, thanks. Come on. But if this little girl is here, she should be with her brother and sister and so she should be with me. And I called my husband again at work and said, they want to know if we want to take the baby and he's a barber. I'm not buying a school bus because we had already had to upgrade from a car to a van from a condo to a home. And so I said, okay, well this'll be the last one. We'll just get one more. But a year later, no, she gets another call, another little boy. That's how we ended up with four of them. These are four kids from the same birth mother?

Speaker 4:          07:12          Yeah. Wow. So by now it's 1994 and Barbara is thinking, I just don't get it. You know, like how did this happen? How was this woman allowed right

Speaker 3:          07:22          to walk into the hospital and drop off a damaged baby and just walk away with no consequences over and over again. How dare you do this? The way she sought the state, the federal government, somebody should say, you're not doing this. You're not leaving this hospital unless you have longterm birth control. Barbara tried to get a law passed requiring just that, but it failed and when I found out the bill didn't pass, I just thought, I have to come up with something else. I have to be creative. And she says, one day this idea just came to her. She was thinking, everybody's motivated by money.

Speaker 4:          07:54          So

Speaker 1:          07:55          can I offer these women money to use birth control? In other words, could I pay women who have drug problems to stop having babies? I decided to have a press conference in my front yard to announce what I was doing and my naive mind, I didn't have a clue what a big deal this was. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          08:16          the story exploded. Barbara Harris, his solution is simpler than anything else out there. Instantly she's offering $200 $100 200 bucks. It's 300 down to any drug addicted woman who will agree to have no more babies and I'm going to go out into the streets and offer addicted women money to use birth control. This could mean sterilization. It could mean getting an IUD

Speaker 4:          08:36          if she gives the woman a choice. If you've already had a kid, you can be sterilized and if you haven't, you can choose to have an IUD or an implant put in which will last for several years late. And when you say they can choose to be sterilized, do you mean permanent? Yeah, permanent like tubes tied.

Speaker 5:          08:52          Sounds bizarre, but it's a solution here. It says her program, children requiring a caring community or crack crack and prevent thousands of unwanted births to drug addicted women. I'd like to everybody to meet please. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          09:04          Barbara Harris, please welcome Brian.

Speaker 4:          09:07          As Barbara made the rounds on the daytime talk shows the reaction was split right down the middle and the one hand, she says immediately check started arriving. This is 25. This is 50 from all over the country. This is 750 and 200 all over the political spectrum from Hollywood, lefties to social conservatives

Speaker 5:          09:25          together pledge more than $150,000 to her

Speaker 4:          09:28          program. And that number, by the way, has grown a lot. That 1 million. Uh, yeah. Over the past five years. If you look at our tax return. Wow. But along with the support came attacks, particularly as drug addicted women began to sign up. Barbara Harris says she's,

Speaker 5:          09:45          I convinced more than a dozen women, 14 women, 25 women have accepted her offer to be sterilized in return for money.

Speaker 4:          09:51          Right away. People accused her of targeting women at their weakest moment and enabling their drug abuse. You know what they're going to go do with that money. You get them $200 each, but they can spend on crack if that's their choice, but the babies don't have a choice. Barbara started finding herself on panels with women who'd use drugs during their pregnancies and that's when things would start to get out of control. They should all be sterilized.

Speaker 6:          10:14          Sterilize, like you said, were like you said when you ran your advice and like she is, I didn't say I'm God. She asked my opinion. Okay, this lady right here is still taking drugs and try and be pregnant again.

Speaker 4:          10:28          First hear about this. What goes through your mind? I think I was really horrified and terrified. That's Lynn Paltrow. I'm executive director and founder of national advocates for pregnant women. Lynn has become one of Barbara's fiercest critics and full disclosure, she's Robert Sister's partner. Well, her, her explanation is that these women are having in her terms, litters of damage, babies and society forever will be responsible for them. She said letters in this magazine Article Barbara Even said, quote, we don't allow dogs to breed. We spay them. We knew drew them.

Speaker 1:          11:06          Yeah. I'm not saying that these women are dogs, but they're not acting anymore responsible than a dog in heat.

Speaker 4:          11:11          Are there people whose drug use is so out of control? They can't parent. Yes, but creating an assumption that there is a class of people who don't deserve to procreate, who aren't worthy. Appropriating the human race leads you down a path that is is we should have great concern about that path is basically called eugenics. Well, I named Hitler thought that if you were Jewish that you had given up

Speaker 1:          11:35          the right to be mother and he sterilized people as well. Well, I just want to eliminate drug addicted babies from being born. I mean, I don't think that puts me in the same category as Hitler. What's the worst thing you've been called by one of your critics? Probably Racist.

Speaker 4:          11:49          I'm married to a black man, so that was just funny to me. And according to Barbara, the majority of the women she pays are white. Do you think like Badass Barbara about some of the things that she'd said? Because to be totally honest, they kind of turned my stomach. I, I like you. I get the sense that like you have, there's a lot of warmth in you. You're obviously a great mom, but that feels cold to me.

Speaker 1:          12:16          I was just pissed I where they identify children now, babies I had seen and all the people that have called me and tell me about their babies that were damaged. I had everybody's abuse on my back and I didn't care how he said it or how we did it. Just don't have any more children because at that point I didn't really know any of them so I didn't see them as people. I just saw them as child abusers might be a mixture, but she says she doesn't feel that way anymore. After I've gotten to know so many other women, Barbara has this drawer in your desk and Ms. Harrison staffer filled with dozens of letters from women that she's paid. I want to thank you for your support and kindness as always. She said, thank you so much for the gift. I bought my son an excavator track, remote control and some summer outfits. This is from 2000 to whom it may concern. I have been doing very good. I just got got to see them, my eight year old son and I'm so proud and I have four years clean and I anyways, God bless you sincerely, Jennifer [inaudible],

Speaker 4:          13:19          have you ever had someone call or write you and say that they regret their decision? No, I've only had somebody call and say they regret that they didn't stay on birth control, which I find kind of hard to believe. But then again, I must've read at least a hundred news articles as I was reporting this story and I didn't find a single case of someone saying that they regretted what they'd done. How many women have you paid?

Speaker 6:          13:53          We have paid,

Speaker 1:          13:56          um, 4,266

Speaker 4:          13:59          that's a lot of people. That's a lot of people. Yeah. She actually emailed me afterwards and adjusted that number down a couple. A hundred and so in the end, I mean, where do you come down on this? Right. I ended up finding myself really conflicted about it. The, the, the like I agree with Lynn that this program does perpetuate a stereotype.

Speaker 1:          14:20          Tell me what your image of a drug using pregnant woman is. Who are they?

Speaker 4:          14:24          It'd be wrong to assume the women Barbara talks about on TV.

Speaker 1:          14:27          It means women don't just have one and two babies. They have six seven, eight, 10 14 yeah.

Speaker 4:          14:32          All these women who have so many babies and never tried to seek drug treatment, it would be wrong to think that they represent all women who use drugs while they're pregnant.

Speaker 1:          14:38          The women who I've worked with who've had a history of drug problems aren't like the examples that she gives. These are women who love their children, who sought help

Speaker 4:          14:49          and she says oftentimes the women who want help a really hard time finding it and Barbara is not offering that. She's not offering treatment, not offering counseling. And there are programs that do that. But I said this to Linde, despite all the things that troubled me about Barbara's program, I feel like what she's trying to do is to stop it. To stop a kid from getting born into a childhood that's gonna suck. The fact that

Speaker 3:          15:17          that you're motivated by a, a really beautiful, important, um, value that we want healthy kids doesn't mean the mechanism you're using is going to end up helping those

Speaker 4:          15:27          kids. Because the truth is you have no idea how these kids are gonna turn out. Yeah. Like nobody's arguing that women should do drugs when they're pregnant. That is a bad way to start a kid's life. But that's just the beginning of the kid's life. So much can happen after that. Once you, you, and for me, this whole story really shifted, right? You at USC, when they started spending some time with destiny, Barbara is 22 year old daughter. You know, as you can see, I like to talk, even though Destiny's mom was doing all sorts of drugs during her pregnancy and the doctor's told Barbara that destiny was going to be mentally and physically delayed, not feeling the way I'm supposed to. She just isn't. Could you just tell us like what you are doing now? You're finishing college,

Speaker 3:          16:17          right? Yes. I'm almost done. I'm graduating in December and right now I'm student teaching, so that's fun. But

Speaker 4:          16:25          the moment I really felt like whoa was when we started talking about the little baby that we

Speaker 3:          16:31          carrying in the background of everything. That's my little girl. She's 20 months old. She'll be two in January. And so her name is Kalia and she's a complete nut. I don't know where she gets that from. Oh hell yeah. She keeps me busy. Were you planning to have clear? Nope. She was an apes kid. She was totally new schedule. We'll just be honest. We just didn't think I, I just didn't think, you know, you know, they say it only takes one time while Yep. That is so true. One time and a month later. So yeah, it's embarrassing. But I believe everything happens for a reason. And I think that no, I didn't plan on it, but I wouldn't take her back for anything because she made me better. I want her to be able to look back on her life one day. Maybe when she's getting interviewed, I dunno. And be able to say that, yes, my mom was there for me 100% without a doubt and I'm going to have straight A's and I'm making it work and I'm going to graduate with honors and one day I'm going to be able to tell her, look, I did this. You can do this. Like push yourself and you got it. That's really, I mean you're just,

Speaker 4:          17:50          you're saying a lot of things that are really impressive

Speaker 3:          17:52          to her. Like I matter, like I make a difference to her.

Speaker 4:          18:00          Okay. All right. We can stop. So we did stop and I packed up my stuff. It's pretty much done. And Barbara and destiny walked me out to my carb. Kalia came to, they had a little basketball for her. Oh madness here. And at a certain point I noticed like over my shoulder, Barbara is crouched down and she's got her phone out and she's taking a picture of this just perfect little scene and you could get a here already, you're going to kick it and do it. I just felt like I was in one of those moments that like, look, I'm gonna contains everything that's good about us as people. You can do it, buddy, you're watching this. I couldn't help but think that Destiny's very existence is probably the most interesting argument against what Barbara is doing. I can it back because if Barbara had gotten to Destiny's birth mom, destiny CLIA this moment, none of it would exist. Yeah, and I told destiny I was thinking about this and asked her about it.

Speaker 3:          19:19          My situation turned out positive. I mean as far as you know, positives can go like I think I hit the Jackpot. A lot of times that's not the case and you just had to have to weigh it. Like is it worth it? Like I could've turned out like some of the other kids.

Speaker 4:          19:39          Destiny says before she was born, her mom had four other girls. These were kids that didn't end up with Barbara. Yeah. Three of them ended up in other foster homes and seem to have done pretty well. But one of them,

Speaker 3:          19:50          okay, well one of them don't really know what happened to her. She's somewhere, but it's not good. From what we've heard

Speaker 4:          19:59          last they heard she was living on the streets in La

Speaker 3:          20:02          and that could've very easily have been one of us. Yeah. I mean, yes I might get a great family but I might not.

Speaker 4:          20:12          And the question that was stuck in my head right then was like, if you could choose between being born knowing that your life might end up like that and not like it is now or not been born at all, what would you have done?

Speaker 3:          20:28          Um, not been born at all. I wouldn't want to put it up to chance because what kind of life is that?

Speaker 4:          20:38          You mean that I didn't mean that.

Speaker 3:          20:40          Yeah, I'll check the side. I know I've been joking a lot in this interview, but I mean I, with all that I am,

Speaker 4:          20:50          let's see. She wants to see it.

Speaker 6:          20:55          Okay.

Speaker 4:          20:57          Add the back together. What's she saying there? Taylor swift's never came back. She say never ever. No baby. Be careful just saying. Okay. Do you want to say bye?

Speaker 6:          21:13          Hi. Okay. Bye. Say Bye.

Speaker 4:          21:17          Aw, you blew him a kiss. That was nice. Okay. That was

Speaker 6:          21:24          okay. Still

Speaker 4:          21:31          remind me this destiny has, uh, what three brothers and sisters that also were raised with her? Two brothers and one sister. What happened to them? Isaiah is in college and Taylor and Brandon W I met them at Barbara's house and they, they seemed to be, uh, to be fine. And what about the four kids that weren't raised with Barbara? Do you know anything about the other, the other four? I just a little there. There were four girls and Barbara and destiny told me that a few years ago they found three of them and they all either were in college or had finished college. So then the one that's in trouble, it's just one of one, two, one of eight. Yeah, one of eight. So I guess you could say to yourself, seven out of eight of these kids did it. Right. [inaudible] that's interesting. I mean, that's, that's a different kind of arts, but it's, yeah.
