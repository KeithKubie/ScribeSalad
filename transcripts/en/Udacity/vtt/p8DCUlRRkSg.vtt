00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.030
Well this line seems to go
uphill as does this one.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.490
As I read from left to right,
it goes up.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.530
But this one as I go from left
to right goes down as does,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.760
as does this light blue one.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.280
So those are negative slopes.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.220
Now let's see how we can calculate
the value of a negative slope.
