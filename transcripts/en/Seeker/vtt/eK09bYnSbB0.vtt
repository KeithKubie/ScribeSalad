00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.140
It takes forever to build a new thing.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.889
Like that road you’re always driving on?

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.439
How long has that thing been under construction?

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:06.439
Right?

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:07.439
I empathize.

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.910
Now, imagine doing that one ATOM at a time.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.120
We here at Seeker get all excited over metamaterials
because they can do so much that natural materials

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.120
can’t do like have incredible strength or
tunable conductivity.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.540
They can have such amazing properties because
we can design and build them atom by atom,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.540
making crystal superlattices.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.360
The key to building these structures are artificial
atoms.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.250
Admittedly, the name is a bit misleading,
because they’re not atoms we somehow built

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.410
proton by proton.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.450
Rather, they’re extremely tiny crystals
made of anywhere from 100 to 10,000 atoms.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.790
They’re still so small they experience quantum
effects, which gives them special properties

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.970
depending on their how big they are, how they're
shaped, and what they're made of.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.630
For example spherical artificial atoms called
quantum dots glow different colors depending

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.730
on their size.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.579
A 2 nm quantum dot gives off blue light when
excited, while a 6 nm dot glows red, even

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.760
when both dots are made of the same material.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.049
Superlattices can be built using artificial
atoms (again, synthetic crystals) in place

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.569
of regular atoms so the structure can be really
fine tuned, but it was always thought the

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:13.399
process had to be a slow one.

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.179
Until, in 2016, researchers found out that
by turning up the heat they could make superlattices

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.240
in seconds instead of days.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.010
The discovery was made quite by accident,
when researchers decided they wanted to watch

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.159
the crystals grow in real time.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.759
So they put windows on their reaction chamber
and shined an x-ray inside.

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.290
They expected to see the beam come back all
scattered, indicating the atoms were still

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.600
arranging themselves.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.069
Suffice it to say, that’s not what they
saw.

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.639
The researchers believe that their discovery
can be applied to a wide range of materials,

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:42.890
like metals, semiconductors, and more.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.209
This could be revolutionary in the field of
metamaterials, allowing us to make these special

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.060
substances at speeds exponentially faster
than was previously thought possible.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.590
Researchers are still trying to account for
why the crystals grow so fast, but you can

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.360
account for your finances much more easily

lattices are created, watch Trace’s video

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.450
here.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.030
When the researchers made their accidental
discovery, they texted their advisor saying,

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.069
“So, something weird is happening.”

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.370
I guess that’s today’s equivalent of Eureka.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.480
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next
time on Seeker.
