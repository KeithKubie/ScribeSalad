00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.550
We need to figure out what
99.061 divided by 100 is.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:17.210
So we are figuring out what
99.061 divided by 100.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.150
So in this situation,
our divisor is

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.260
already a whole number.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.200
So we don't have to do any of
that multiplying by 10 or 100

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.570
to move the decimal
over to the right.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.060
It's already a whole number,
so we're ready to divide.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.130
But the first thing we want to
do in this, just to make sure

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.850
we don't make any mistakes, is
make sure we put the decimal

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.580
in the right place.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.720
So the decimal is going to
sit right over here.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.600
This is where it was sitting
before, so this is where it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.480
will sit in our quotient.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.310
And now we are ready
to divide.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.780
So the first thing we want
to say is, well,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.770
does 100 go into 9?

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.560
Well, no it doesn't.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.890
So does 100 go into 99?

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.090
No, it doesn't.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.190
And if we want, we could put a
zero here, or we could just

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.670
keep going.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.030
We'll add the 0 at the end.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.210
So 100 doesn't go into 9,
it doesn't go into 99.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.520
Does 100 go into 990?

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.280
Sure!

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.220
It'll go nine times.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.310
It goes into 990 nine times.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.060
So that's why we put the 9 above
the 0, because we had to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.730
get all the way to the 0 for the
100 to be divisible into

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.560
the number.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.610
100 goes into 990 nine times.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.050
9 times 100 is 900.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.020
And then we can subtract.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.080
So 990 minus 900 is 90.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.520
We can do that in our heads.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.690
You can say, 0 minus 0 is 0.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.460
9 minus 0 is 9.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.040
These guys cancel out.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.840
Now we can bring down this 6.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.580
100 goes into 906 nine times.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.440
9 times 100 is 900, and
then we can subtract.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.780
906 minus 900 is
going to be 6.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.675
And then we bring down the 1.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.240
100 goes into 61.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.730
It doesn't!

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.135
It goes into it zero times.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.210
0 times 100 is 0.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.920
And then when you subtract, you
have a remainder of 61.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.340
Now, you might be tempted to
say, OK, it goes into it--

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.670
well, we could always put a
leading 0 here-- 0.990 times

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.490
with a remainder of 61.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.940
First of all, that's
not right.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.890
The remainder isn't 61, because
we're now to the right

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.960
of the decimal point.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.880
But in general, whenever you're
dividing to decimals,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.140
you want to keep dividing.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.910
You don't want to
have remainder.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.160
And the best way to keep
dividing is to remember that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.680
this has as many trailing zeroes
on it as you want.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.320
They're not really changing
the number.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.340
So we can throw a bunch of
zeroes to the right of here,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.710
as many as we need.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.700
So let's throw a
zero right now.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.950
Bring it down.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.750
100 goes into 610 six times.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.860
6 times 100 is 600.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.460
And then we subtract.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.060
610 minus 600 is 10.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.350
We don't want to have a
remainder, so we keep going.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.190
So let's throw another zero
here and bring it down.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.940
So we have another zero there.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.400
100 goes into 100 exactly
one time.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.210
1 times 100 is 100.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.670
And then now when you
subtract, we have no

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.000
remainder, and we
are satisfied.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.840
And we're done.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.140
And sometimes you're going to
see that you're going to have

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.100
to keep doing it, and you're
going to start having repeated

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.910
numbers up here, and strange
things up here.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.720
And there's other ways
we'll deal with that.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.030
But in this circumstance, you
just want to keep going.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.050
You want to keep going until
you have no remainder.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:51.820
So our final answer is
99.061 divided by

00:03:51.820 --> 00:04:00.650
100 is equal to 0.99061.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.770
And I just put a leading
zero here.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.680
Sometimes it makes it easier
to read, and you make sure

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.970
people understand that there's
a decimal there.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.890
It just makes it less
prone to errors.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.840
And we are done.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.080
And just to make the point,
this actually makes sense.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.690
99 is a little bit less than
100, so 99 divided by 100 is

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.620
going to be a little
bit less than 1.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.590
And this number is a little
bit less than 1.
