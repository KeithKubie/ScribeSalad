00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.190
Alright, Sara, I made some CSS changes, how can I,

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.650
what's the best way to see what they look like?

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.306
&gt;&gt; Alright, so if we just open up the

00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:12.550
HTML file, so this is in the, the main directory.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.140
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.949
&gt;&gt; This index.html file is what we were looking at earlier, so we

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.210
just going to open that up, it will open up in your default browser.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.930
&gt;&gt; Alright, but this is the game we made.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.170
&gt;&gt; And now we have our images instead of the numbers.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.420
&gt;&gt; And, this is, this game is actually much harder

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.125
when there's images.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.830
&gt;&gt; because you don't know what's next.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know what numbers I'm doing, I just

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.895
know that I want the faces and so these are just

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:34.512
U.S. presidents. It's the first thing that came to mind, but

00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:37.270
I mean, there's tons of cool things you can do and the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.520
way I did this, was I went into the CSS file.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.420
So we're in main.css and I went to all these places,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.270
where it's talking about the actual tile properties. So, what is

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.030
the two tile look like, the four tile, and so on? And

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.630
I sort of just overrode the background,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.490
I think this was referring to some color.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.323
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the original background was for

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.137
each of these a different color instead of.

00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:00.541
&gt;&gt; Instead of an image.

00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:04.400
&gt;&gt; Instead of an image. So, we actually, if

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.230
we were doing this for real, we'd probably want to remove

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.910
all those, all those backgrounds. I think Andy wanted

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.210
to be able to revert back if you wanted to.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.370
&gt;&gt; I'm still not comfortable with versing control. I know you can just

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.890
do that on the fly but I kind of like doing this, I'm sorry.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.302
But yeah so, I have, I made this folder called Tile Sets, Presidents and then

00:01:22.302 --> 00:01:27.627
I just called the different images two, four, et cetera. And this dot,dot slash?

00:01:27.627 --> 00:01:30.020
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. So, what's going on here if I'm, tell me

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.860
if I'm thinking about this right. Index.HTML lives somewhere in my computer.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.440
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Yeah, inside this 2048 directory.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.470
&gt;&gt; Okay, and so the dot dot means go back up

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.924
a directory. Yeah, because this, this style file that we're in is

00:01:41.924 --> 00:01:42.843
under Style.

00:01:42.843 --> 00:01:44.242
&gt;&gt; So it's going back to the directory.

00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:45.117
&gt;&gt; So, we go back up 2048.

00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:46.976
&gt;&gt; And then it found.

00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:50.700
&gt;&gt; And then go to the tile-sets directory which is just under 2048.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.400
&gt;&gt; Okay, and if you open that, that's where

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.510
you get our presidents and you have all those files.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.725
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:55.725 --> 00:02:00.735
&gt;&gt; Cool, now what are you going to do? I don't know.

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:01.597
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know an answer.

00:02:01.597 --> 00:02:02.970
&gt;&gt; Let's keep playing around.
