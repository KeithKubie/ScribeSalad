00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:32.610
The fire hydrant that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.190
we know today traces its origins back to fire
plugs.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.620
Water mains that transported fresh water in
a city or town used to be made of hollowed

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.180
out logs buried beneath the streets.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.039
Whenever there was a fire and firefighters
needed water, they dug up the cobblestone

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.900
street and drilled a hole into the wooden
pipe.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.640
After they extinguished the fire, the firefighters
put a plug in the hole—called a “fire

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.970
plug”—before reburying the water main.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.649
The plug could then be removed and the same
hole used if another fire occurred in the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.329
area, saving the drilling time.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.590
One problem with fire plugs, however, was
that digging for them and moving cobblestones

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.930
took up valuable firefighting time that should
have been spent putting out a fire.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.240
In addition, the plugs and holes in the water
main were only located in areas where fires

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.350
had already occurred.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.190
So firefighters needed to drill new holes
into the water main if they arrived at a fire

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.732
in a neighborhood that hadn’t yet experience
a fire.

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:27.050
The introduction of cast-iron water mains
that were much more difficult to drill on

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.271
the fly resulted in a solution to the problem.

00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:30.271
As the cast-iron water mains slowly replaced
the hollowed out logs and the fire plugs,

00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:34.990
taps were extended from the water main to
above the street level and worked like faucets

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.670
for firefighters to hook up their hoses.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.110
These taps were also placed at regular intervals
along the street.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.830
Firefighters now had easy access to a reliable
source of water and in predictable locations.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.350
In 1801, Frederick Graff, Sr. is generally
credited with inventing the fire hydrant that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.060
resembles the fire hydrants we know today.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.120
Known as the “post” or “pillar” design,
these hydrants gave firefighters access to

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.700
the water through a hose/faucet outlet.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.100
They also had a valve on the top of the hydrant.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.630
The design allowed water to flow into the
hydrant at all times, a type of hydrant that

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.210
would later be known as a “wet-barrel”
hydrant because it always had water flowing

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.210
into it.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.460
Wet barrel fire hydrants like Graff’s still
exist today, though their design means that

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.370
they are only used in warmer climates.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.810
Areas subject to the ground freezing in winter
use dry-barrel hydrants.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.760
Unlike wet barrel hydrants which allow water
into the hydrant at all times, the dry-barrel

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.450
hydrant does not.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.510
While there are variations on the design,
in general, the dry-barrel hydrant connects

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.190
with a water main buried beneath the frost
line, the depth to which the ground typically

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.750
freezes in the winter.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.470
This connection includes a pair of valves,
the main valve and the drain valve.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.780
When opened, the main valve sends water into
the fire hydrant and the drain valve is automatically

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.780
closed.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.110
The drain valve automatically opens when the
main valve is shut.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.210
It then allows the water to drain out of the
hydrant and back into the water main without

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.540
allowing any water back in, so that the hydrant
isn’t full of water which would freeze during

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.230
cold winter temperatures.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.569
While the design of dry-barrel fire hydrants
make them unlikely to freeze during winter,

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.480
they can still fail.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.380
Either the main valve or the drain valve might
stop working if they are not maintained properly

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.270
or need to be replaced due to old age.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.100
Other times, a dry-barrel hydrant may freeze
because an unusually cold winter could move

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.260
the frost line deeper in the ground and cause
problems with the water main, potentially

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.240
damaging the valves in the process.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.410
This is why during the winter, you will often
see crews out testing the hydrants to make

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.510
sure there aren’t any freezing problems.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.290
After using a dry-barrel hydrant, firefighters
will also often notify the appropriate utility

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.370
company to let them know, so that if they
so choose they can come out and make sure

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.160
the hydrant drained properly.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.070
According to the Director of Distribution
at the South Bend, Indiana Water Department,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:17.630
how they 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.039
the check is as follows:
