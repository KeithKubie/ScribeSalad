00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.300
As far as we know, Earth is the only place
in our solar system

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.900
where humans can survive without a spacesuit.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.060
So if we ventured outside the cushy confines
of our home,

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.780
how long would we live on the other planets?

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.080
Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is
actually not the hottest of the bunch,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.180
but it does have the most extreme variation of
temperatures.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.310
Scientists once believed Mercury was tidally
locked - meaning only one side of the planet

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.100
faced the Sun which explains why one side
is so hot while the other is so cold.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.550
But Mercury does rotate, just incredibly slow.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.180
At its current rotational velocity, it takes
about 176 Earth days to experience

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840
one Mercurian day-night cycle.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.820
But you wouldn’t make it to the next day
because you would die in about two minutes

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.720
due to freezing or burning up.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.360
Mercury’s neighbor, Venus, is often thought
of as Earth’s twin sister because of the

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.060
planets’ similar size and composition.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.860
But, the grass isn’t greener on the other
side because well there is no grass at all.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.760
The planet’s atmosphere, composed mainly
of thick carbon dioxide, traps the Sun’s

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.520
heat causing scorching surface temperatures
higher than 470 degrees Celsius.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.560
The excess amount of CO2 molecules scatter
the Sun’s light, staining the sky a reddish orange.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.679
You better take in that unusual view real
fast because it’s the last thing you’ll

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.860
see since Venus will vaporize you in less
than one second.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.439
Mars is the hottest contender for humanity’s
future home, and living there will literally

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.299
take your breath away.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.929
Despite its flaming red color, Mars is not
hot.

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:55.340
The average annual temperature is minus 60
degrees celsius with a low of minus 153 degrees.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.279
The Red Planet’s barely there air will have
you begging for a breath, and silicate dust

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.779
will begin to cloud your lungs.

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:07.819
Within about two minutes Mars’s low atmospheric
pressure will cause your organs to rupture

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.640
resulting in a quick but painful death.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.520
Jupiter is nice to look at but if you touch
it, you'll die.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.920
As far as we know, the gas giant has no surface,
so your body will descend through cloud-like

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.840
layers of mostly hydrogen and helium.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.640
As you fall deeper, temperature and pressure
will rise.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.960
But you won’t feel anything because the pressure killed you less than one second after arriving on the planet.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.000
Saturn is another work of universal art.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.200
Driving across those rings would be like Rainbow
Road in real life.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.600
Except not at all because Saturn’s rings
aren’t solid.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.660
They’re made up of billions of particles
that range in size

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.200
and are almost entirely water ice.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.420
And you likely won’t find solid ground on
the planet itself.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.980
Like Jupiter, the gassy composition of Saturn
would swallow your lifeless body faster than

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.060
the tick of a clock.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.820
Uranus and Neptune don’t offer any hope
of survival either.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.200
And you’d likely die of boredom on the way there,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.780
considering the billions of kilometers of travel anyway.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.760
The ice giants are made up of mostly swirling
fluids, but they get their blue hues from

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.620
methane gas in their atmospheres, which would cause you to suffocate.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.740
On top of the toxic gas, the extreme temperatures
on both planets

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.880
would contribute to a nearly instant death.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.140
We are pretty lucky to live on Earth.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.060
Our planet’s proximity to the Sun enables
water to exist in liquid form, regulates temperatures

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.560
and provides energy for photosynthesis.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.540
Earth’s atmosphere has a perfect mix of
gases that allow us to breath and the planet’s

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.620
relatively stable magnetic field keeps solar
storms from frying us to a crisp.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.340
So, be thankful for our planet and treat her
well, because no one wants to spend their

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.340
entire life in a spacesuit.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.400
Space Crafts takes you through the depths
of the cosmos, explaining bizarre astronomical

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.980
phenomena and crazy plans for future exploration.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.320

the quest for finding the mysterious Planet Nine.
