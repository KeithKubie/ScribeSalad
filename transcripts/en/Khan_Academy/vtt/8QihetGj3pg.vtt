00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.970
So I have two
2-dimensional vectors

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.970
right over here,
vector a and vector b.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.575
And what I want to think
about is how can we define

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.950
or what would be
a reasonable way

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.137
to define the sum of
vector a plus vector b?

00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:16.970
Well, one thing that
might jump at your mind

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.160
is, look, well, each of
these are two dimensional.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.410
They both have two components.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.220
Why don't we just add the
corresponding components?

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.610
So for the sum, why don't
we make the first component

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.130
of the sum just a sum of
the first two components

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.110
of these two vectors.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.090
So why don't we just make
it 6 plus negative 4?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.660
Well, 6 plus negative
4 is equal to 2.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.010
And why don't we just
make the second component

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.350
the sum of the two
second components?

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.360
So negative 2 plus 4
is also equal to 2.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.540
So we start with two
2-dimensional vectors.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.560
You add them together,
you get another two

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.600
2-dimensional vectors.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.630
If you think about it in terms
of real coordinates bases,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.040
both of these are
members of R2--

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.040
I'll write this down here just
so we get used to the notation.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:14.032
So vector a and vector b
are both members of R2,

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.490
which is just
another way of saying

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.980
that these are both two tuples.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.100
They are both two-dimensional
vectors right over here.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.720
Now, this might make sense just
looking at how we represented

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.340
it, but how does
this actually make

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.150
visual or conceptual sense?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.310
And to do that, let's
actually plot these vectors.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.100
Let's try to represent
these vectors in some way.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.880
Let's try to visualize them.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.550
So vector a, we could
visualize, this tells us

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.640
how far this vector
moves in each

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.070
of these directions--
horizontal direction

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.020
and vertical direction.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.860
So if we put the,
I guess you could

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.050
say the tail of the vector
at the origin-- remember,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.720
we don't have to put
the tail at the origin,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.261
but that might make it a little
bit easier for us to draw it.

00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:53.940
We'll go 6 in the
horizontal direction.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.420
And then negative
2 in the vertical.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.980
So negative 2.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.050
So vector a could
look like this.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.139
Vector a looks like that.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.050
And once again,
the important thing

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.750
is the magnitude
and the direction.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.970
The magnitude is represented
by the length of this vector.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.740
And the direction
is the direction

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.030
that it is pointed in.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.810
And also just to emphasize,
I could have drawn vector a

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.280
like that or I could
have put it over here.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.210
These are all
equivalent vectors.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.850
These are all equal to vector a.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.450
All I really care about is the
magnitude and the direction.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.100
So with that in mind,
let's also draw vector b.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.750
Vector b in the horizontal
direction goes negative 4-- 1,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.170
2, 3, 4, and in the vertical
direction goes 4-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.560
So its tail if we
start at the origin,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.050
if its tail is at
the origin, its head

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.105
would be at negative 4, 4.

00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:03.110
So let me draw that
just like that.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.260
So that right over
here is vector b.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.150
And once again, vector b
we could draw it like that

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.240
or we could draw it-- let me
copy and let me paste it--

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.710
so this would also be
another way to draw vector b.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.350
Once again, what I
really care about

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.540
is its magnitude
and its direction.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.900
All of these green vectors
have the same magnitude.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.650
They all have the same
length and they all

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.520
have the same direction.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.660
So how does the way that
I drew vector a and b

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.440
gel with what its sum is?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.730
So let me draw
its sum like this.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.920
Let me draw its sum
in this blue color.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.610
So the sum based on this
definition we just used,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.060
the vector addition
would be 2, 2.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.100
So 2, 2.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.600
So it would look
something like this.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.650
So how does this make
sense that the sum,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.250
that this purple vector
plus this green vector

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.464
is somehow going to be
equal to this blue vector?

00:04:02.464 --> 00:04:03.880
I encourage you
to pause the video

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.300
and think about if
that even makes sense.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.600
Well, one way to think about
it is this first purple vector,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.290
it shifts us this much.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.621
It takes us from this
point to that point.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.870
And so if we were to add it,
let's start at this point

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.990
and put the green
vector's tail right there

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.270
and see where it
ends up putting us.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.320
So the green vector, we
already have a version.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.450
So once again, we
start the origin.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.240
Vector a takes us there.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.480
Now, let's start over
there with the green vector

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.460
and see where green
vector takes us.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.720
And this makes sense.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.440
Vector a plus vector b.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.210
Put the tail of vector b
at the head of vector a.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.260
So if you were to
start at the origin,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.190
vector a takes you
there then if you

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.520
add on what vector b takes you,
it takes you right over there.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.210
So relative to the
origin, how much did you--

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.830
I guess you could say-- shift?

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.420
And once again,
vectors don't only

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.435
apply to things
like displacement.

00:04:56.435 --> 00:04:57.345
It can apply to velocity.

00:04:57.345 --> 00:04:58.920
It can apply to
actual acceleration.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.350
It can apply to a
whole series of things,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.500
but when you
visualize it this way,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.890
you see that it does
make complete sense.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.360
This blue vector,
the sum of the two,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.745
is what results where
you start with vector a.

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:15.130
At that point right over there,
vector a takes you there,

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.960
then you take vector b's
tail, start over there

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.140
and it takes you to
the tip of the sum.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.570
Now, one question you
might be having is well,

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.900
vector a plus vector
b is this, but what

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.510
is vector b plus vector a?

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.540
Does this still work?

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.200
Well, based on the
definition we had

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.010
where you add the
corresponding components,

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.509
you're still going to
get the same sum vector.

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:40.800
So it should come out the same.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.720
So this will just be
negative 4 plus 6 is 2.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.430
4 plus negative 2 is 2.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.420
But does that make visual sense?

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.836
So if we start with vector b.

00:05:49.836 --> 00:05:51.460
So let's say you
start right over here.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.480
Vector b takes you
right over there.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.943
And then if you were
to go there and you

00:05:56.943 --> 00:05:59.960
were to start with vector
a-- so let's do that.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.760
So actually, let me make this
a little bit-- actually, let me

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.240
start with a new vector b.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.230
So let's say that that's our
vector b right over there.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.066
And then-- actually,
let me give this

00:06:13.066 --> 00:06:15.230
a place where I'll have
some space to work with.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.450
So let's say that's my
vector b right over there.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.320
And then let me get a
copy of the vector a.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.832
That's a good one.

00:06:23.832 --> 00:06:26.630
So copy and let me paste it.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.170
So I could put vector a's
tail at the tip of vector b,

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.590
and then it'll take
me right over there.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:42.680
So if I start right over
here, vector b takes me there.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.750
And now I'm adding to that
vector a, which starting here

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.080
will take me there.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.520
And so from my original starting
position, I have gone this far.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.860
Now, what is this vector?

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.360
Well, this is exactly
the vector 2, 2.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.860
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.630
this vector shifts you 2 in
the horizontal direction and 2

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.410
in the vertical direction.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.920
So either way, you're going
to get the same result,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.770
and that should, hopefully,
make visual or conceptual sense

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.460
as well.
