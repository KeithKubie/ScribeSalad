00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.380
A lot of people watching this channel might want to have a career in computing and you work in industry

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.649
So I thought kind of we could just maybe have a chat about what it's like

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.409
From your point of view what you're looking for from people

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.700
And what you know what people should be thinking about when the you know what a period is

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.619
Thank you. That's a great question. I mean I hire about ten people a year a lot of them go into

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.160
What I would call a jason sees to computing so for example. I've got a team. That's working on sensing in the life sciences and

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.189
The Big Data is hitting everything right?

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.679
So if you're a data scientist which most computer scientists have some inclination towards at these days

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.209
And it is a huge premium you will have those kinds of fields as well open to you

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.279
Just so people know right you know the organization you are at for us

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.739
I'll try to be concise, but I'm in Hp labs

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.279
and I'm in the position where I direct a large group of people around the world in everything from mechatronics and robotics to

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.390
3D printing software

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.949
To what we call security printing the security printing also ties in a lot to the internet of things if you use that cliche

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.969
Being able to interrogate a physical object whether it's a label packaging 3D printed object manufactured object

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.989
And then be able to get useful information to yourself off of that and so

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.819
The software folks that I'm looking for involved in everything from analytics Big Data

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.360
to algorithms being able to add to the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.360
Sort of signal and image processing that I believe it - with sensing so a broad set of skills in there

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.659
We do also need people can roll up the sleeves and make this stuff leggy

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.049
Right so because it's really nice to talk about these algorithms

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.059
but I've got to put them on a mobile phone in the end and

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.059
So I do need people who are good with you know everything from Xamarin to you know the follows on to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.930
Droid and Ios programming pretty much everything right now has a

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.229
processor somehow involved in it and the ability for you to code at the level below just the

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.828
UI you know the Ui based software is going to help you in

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.759
Terms of hiring what we're looking for obviously our people who have a very can-do attitude who have experience across both

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:11.009
Web technology and non web technology right? It's better not to edge and halt yourself and just focus on algorithms, or just focus on web

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.590
Generally speaking because I'm in a research

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.360
Lab we will tend to hire people who are better at the algorithm side and at writing those types of things

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.628
but we do have webby type things as well because any

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.599
Technology now is going to go live it's going to go mobile

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.559
It's going to go on the cloud and so we're looking for people who have had experience

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.629
Along the lines of what I saw here last year when I went through with the I think it was a third-year

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.489
Competition and with the third-year competition you saw a lot of students kind of rolling up the sleeves

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.739
Bringing different technologies to bear and saying oh yeah, we need a webby aspect to that because that's going to make it

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.970
Demonstrable at the Fair

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.819
But it also has to do something useful and so I think you see this real combination people always talk about

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.279
You know older Coders like myself who grew up writing you know ones and zeros literally at the start

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.909
to folks now who know how to exercise an apI for the web

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.149
people people on the website say boy

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.250
I wish those old guys would just do something interesting and the old guys say I wish those young guys would just do something that

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.348
Meant something right, but it's actually there's a real good commonality between there

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.619
And I think what we're seeing is that because so much technology now is

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.239
Intimately tied to needing good software to be written for it

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.529
You really need both of those and so people who have that ability to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.319
You know do something with raspBerry Pi or Arduino something where you're kind of really getting your hands dirty and looking at

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.919
sort of the older Style programming languages whether it's C C++

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.910
even Java

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.879
To people who are much more webby

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:45.268
You know building out websites using Jason or something else if they'll people have both of those things or even python

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.619
I really like python because I think it gets people's hands dirty, but at the same time

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.139
they're able to percolate up from that so that's what we're looking for and of course being in research if you're good at R if

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.239
You're good at Matlab if you go to some of the open source types of approaches we're looking for that as well

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.269
those are just a starting point though, so

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.549
What we're really looking for and particularly in a research lab is we're looking for character

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.239
right so I I

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.448
Get to be pulled in I've got much more technical people in the various areas on my team of course than I am

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.698
But we pull people in and I try to ask them off-the-cuff questions to see how to handle them

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.659
So one guy, and it was surprising. I said, what's the worst thing you ever did that you didn't report?

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.100
You know to Eh&amp;s so environmental health and safety and I didn't expect an answer, but he actually gave me one and so yeah

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.100
we had this radiation leak and

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.230
Covered it up and got all the material put away and all that and I'm like wow this is kind of disturbing

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.240
But the way he handled it

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.530
He said it wasn't the big deal, and it would have shut down the lab and it was you know, so it was tritium

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.649
Or something that was actually relatively easy to clean up in the end

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.679
We ended up offering the guy a job and hiring him

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.760
but if this is astonishing

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.830
Admission and so I'm looking for people like that because even though the story could have been potentially embarrassing him at first

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.830
I was like do I have to call the hMS

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.260
It was he had hindsight the guy was very honest with me

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.770
and he told me what he did and why he did it and that he took responsibility for

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.419
Cleaning up the situation and not getting the lab closed down for a year, so you have to kind of learn

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.030
off-the-Cuff questions really help

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.460
asking people that kind of shakes them out and you find out a lot that way if you get somebody kind of off the

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.809
Normal mark for things they'll end up telling you something they've done. That was very

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.020
Fascinating that won't show up on the resume because they might have been embarrassed about it

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.789
And so that's one of the things that I definitely look for in a software person somebody who's done something that

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.470
Had nothing to do with their classes

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.480
And they did it because of their love for what software can do as we all recognize that now?

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.989
We're going we're in a real transition right now in the world

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.500
We're going from a world where open-source software has become de rigueur and people know how to go out and get software that can do

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.999
Certain tasks we know which type of software we can actually use we've watched the you know the evolution from hadoop to spark etcetera

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.540
things change over time but it's more and more open source for the

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.009
Sort of Pedestrian things that we need to do to exist in a cloud-based mobile world

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.739
That's about to happen to hardware and so you look at Nottingham University of Nottingham here

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.790
There's some fascinating work being done and added of manufacturing and new forms of manufacturing

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:25.390
I have teams that work on that the majority of the people that are on my teams working in 3D printing are software people and

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:33.249
It's because 3d printing if you're doing additive manufacturing and you're looking at merging masks customized with Mass production

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.919
Parts, so all the mass production parts are the same

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.570
Somebody's parts merge onto that in the end. You know it's that's easy enough to do

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.899
We're just going to snap those parts together like a lego set not that easy

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.670
How do you actually produce those parts? How do you track them? How do you validate them? How do you forensically?

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.100
Analyze them all of that takes

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.770
very strong algorithmic

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.339
Expertise it takes somebody who can actually put together the software in a modular fashion

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.580
And somebody who's smart enough to figure out?

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:06.339
I need to go look at what a manufacturing line looks like and see what they're they're addressing and so for me I

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.520
See a lot of this going on where people say yeah 3D printing

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.210
It's going to replace manufacturing no, it's not going to replace manufacturing

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.210
It's going to augment it if you look at what manufacturing is now

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.469
people have the largest capital assets most companies have if

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.960
Their manufacturing company is what they have in a manufacturing line. They've got robotics. They've got

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.779
You know very fast production line that assume the same product is going through multiple times

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.760
It's the old assembly line mentality and so everything has been streamlined optimized

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.249
Overproduced so that I can get as many parts through here as possible because I make more money if I do

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.099
That now goes away, and you say well, what do I do?

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:52.539
With you know let's say I've got a 30 year capital asset that I'm losing money off of if I get rid of it in

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.549
The next you know 10 20 30 years so that's a big part of what's going on is how we can merge?

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:03.400
What we're doing with additive manufacturing with existing manufacturing lines. It's not going to happen with hand-waving

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.489
It's going to happen with software and so that's a good example people

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:13.090
Who've actually addressed that that's one specific area look at healthcare for another one if we want to draw in other areas

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:19.570
So I've got teams working on what are called surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy sensors and what that basically is is these tiny little?

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.960
Nano fingers that when they collapse on an analyte

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.570
There's an enhancing effect by the materials that we use gold tips ETC and very small

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:33.369
You know just a few hundred nanometers in length for these fingers when an analyte or a simpson?

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.859
single chemical gets trapped inside of here

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:41.799
I
Hit it with a laser light and the raman scattering that I get off of that is enhanced up to 10 to the 12 times

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.679
So up to a million million times

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:50.109
enhancement of the signal that I would normally get off of that analyte because of the architecture I put around that as

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.260
We start looking at that and you can see imagine the future

00:08:53.260 --> 00:09:00.039
I've got some kind of a smart rag or a smart plastic surface that I just take rub across this table

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.679
Take it out and sense everything that was on the table right so it's going to make forensic analysis

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:11.169
Extremely fast and as you can see down the road that might include things like polymerase chain reaction or PCR

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:17.829
Which means that I can get automatic dna sequencing or rNa sequencing off of what I picked up if it's proteinaceous?

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:23.469
So there's a lot of different things that I can do with that technology all of that is software

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:31.359
Bioinformatics is what makes me be able to analyze the dnA in the rna all the normal signal processing that I would normally do for

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:37.059
Audio you know, so you're an audio expert. You know about that. You've got one key signal processing that's going on

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:44.049
I've got imaging which is 2d signal processing that comes on there, so I'm looking for those types of things when I bring in a

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.729
Candidate for hire, and I'm looking for somebody who's got of strength in one area and then

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:55.599
Breadth across the area and so people talk about this this is I'm pologize again to the non states people

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.500
This is States jargon. We look for a

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:03.489
T-Shaped software engineer which means somebody who's got a lot of Breadth in this direction and can go deep in one area for research

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:09.459
I'm looking for a comb shaped person, so once somebody has got that Breadth, but they can go deep in several areas now. They'll be

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.170
typically from my lab

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.579
They'll be a master or phd so we know they go deep in one area because they had to get that dissertation

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.620
Approved and they've got smart people like the professors here nodding him walking them through that

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:25.029
But I'm looking for somebody who also took it and went deep in another area so for example

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:27.639
somebody may be very interested in

00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:32.589
Electrical engineering and because of their thesis they had to do one thing let's say working on you know

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.949
The sayers that I talked about the surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.089
But because they were interested in signal processing they spent the rest of their time

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:45.189
Doing music and so they figured out how to build you know analog and digital circuits to do

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.730
Electronic music or something like that if I see something like that

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.209
then I know this person really is interested in that they're not just doing it because

00:10:52.459 --> 00:10:57.969
It was a convenient path to a degree or a degree that they thought they'd have a you know livelihood in

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.899
And so we're really looking for that, and I try to throw students not you know with that

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.220
that being said I'm

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.790
One person and the other people on my interview team are going to be looking for those specific skills to make sure that they can't

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.040
Sneak away with that and so for me

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:19.209
I will typically cover the few areas that I'm qualified to look at Perhaps imaging perhaps or statistics or analytics

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:25.660
But other people on my team will be taking them very deep into what's under the hood in terms of a cloud deployment

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.130
They said they did right or what's under the hood for some type of an intelligent system that they?

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.599
Supposedly designed and in most cases you'll find out the student will admit very quickly

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:41.469
Oh, I actually relied on Bob or Susie or whoever to actually do some of that work

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:45.910
And they think that's they're afraid to bring that up in an interview as far as interviews go

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.130
That's that's when we know we've hit goal, right?

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.870
because we want people who can admit they need somebody else to get a big project on if

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.940
It's somebody who actually did the whole project by themselves hmM might not be that good of a project, right?

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:02.919
But if it's something where they worked with a bunch of other smart people, and that's what I've been lucky at in life

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:08.050
I've worked always with a lot of people smarter than me and the project that I'm working with you dig into the

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.180
Expertise they have in you're like wow

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.950
Thank you now. I don't have to sweat the details

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.660
I need to understand what you did

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.350
But I don't have to do the details and so we're looking for people who can admit?

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.089
They've actually worked with people and at least an area of their project who are better than them

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.040
And you're going to have to do that in life

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:29.019
we all know that and the farther you go in this field the smarter the people around you are you know unless you're

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.760
unfortunate that's if you're fortunate

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.619
And so you learn to tap into those people and make a bigger project counter that so you look at anything?

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.839
That's big you want to get into industry you've got to be on a big project that you've worked with a lot of other

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.989
Intelligent people on you can acknowledge them very well

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.070
And you can understand what they did without having to be an expert in that and so again

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.809
It's that Comme chez person you've got to know how to fill in those voids that you don't go deep in if you can do

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.409
That you're going to interview quite well at least for a research done

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.650
you mentioned about

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:03.490
Excelling in questions to catch people not necessarily all but just just to see what makes them tick and it was the way they might

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.030
mess that up

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:09.130
I mean, I'm assuming you want them to tell the truth of these you know you know not looking for big cover-Ups and stuff, so

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.839
Yeah, that's a great question and it is hard for somebody to hide and I think that's why people are honest when you give them

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:19.309
The you know kind of off-the-cuff question if some of them off-guard I'm looking for character

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.650
And so one of the things you can definitely do

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:27.620
To blow an interview is show that you don't have character, and so if I ask a question like that, and I say

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:32.570
What's the worst thing that ever happened and it becomes kind of a humblebrag where the person's like oh the worst thing

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.809
I ever did was I didn't catch that my colleague was cheating fast enough

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.489
That's not a good answer, right so so I'm not looking for those kind of humble bags

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.589
As I'm the one I mentioned before where a colleague had an incident and he cleaned it up and took responsibility

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.379
For its cleanup was shocking at first

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.539
But then I realized he had character because he knew how to follow through on that and so if somebody says oh well the worst

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.220
Thing that ever happened to me was something my colleague

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.570
Did or something this person did or the project failed because the people?

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.330
I was working with in follow through on it may well be true

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:07.339
That's probably not something you want to bring up in an interview in an interview you really want to focus on the way you

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.130
handled Adversity and brought that to a

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.839
decent conclusion

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:16.519
And we all run into adversity and by the way when some of the interviews and they tell me they work with a jerk

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.850
They're usually telling the truth

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:18.830
That's a tough one

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.330
And so if you see that they really were working with a jerk you try to see if they can find a way to steer

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:29.239
that into a positive because we have to do that we all work with jerks and life we might even be jerks occasionally and

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.680
you know we don't mean to be but we are and

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.260
So the way in which somebody is going to work with us when we are having a bad day like that

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.669
Or the way in which we work with somebody when they're clearly having an off day or life time is

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:46.459
Is really important and so we want to do is see that that person can actually handle that and move forward positively?

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.640
So if I don't see that in response to a question like that

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:55.309
That's one way of blowing it another way of blowing an interview would be for somebody to just be focusing on

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:57.529
What I would call the quantitative

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.860
Aspects of what they've done

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:05.120
They're really focused on the number of things they've done number of publications number of you know grants that they've got number of awards

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.789
They've won those types of things those are important

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.020
But if the person doesn't then go a level deeper and tell me what it was that

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:17.959
They did to get those awards or what they felt the award was about or who else should have shared in that award

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.859
That's another way to kind of blow an interview because you're going to be working with a team

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.710
You're be working with a bunch of people if we've done our jobs right hiring

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:31.499
They're going to be just as smart as you or on average right in the meet in the mean and so

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.379
it's a weird thing, but if you're actually in an interview

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:39.869
And you're spending too much time talking about yourself and not the people around you you're actually insulting the person interviewing you

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:44.070
You're not insulting the people you work with and this is a tricky one to

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.910
describe but I think if you stick with me here, you'll get it if you're

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:53.430
Acting like the interviewer like you're the best thing that's ever happened to their company you may well be right

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.480
You might be the best in that area

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.690
But you're also insulting them because you're implying the people they've already got working there or even the interviewer

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.570
Themselves because again you'll have technical interviewers are

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.400
Not as good as you so it's a it's a tricky one the balance you do want to come across positive

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.330
You want to show that you have that talent?

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.830
But you don't want to insult the person interviewing you or insult worse yet

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:19.830
The team that you haven't met and so I think that's a tricky one there you have to it's a delicate balance between humility

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:26.879
Proper humility and also being very self confident and so I'm looking for somebody who can be self confident

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.340
But not have to do it at the expense of others and so one of the ways of doing that in an interview is

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.180
obviously looking for

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.180
Ways to positively contribute

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.880
So if somebody tells me they've got a talent for this

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.530
They're like well the reason why I did that was my grandma needed something that would helped her stand up

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.919
And I realized that grandma did not have really good

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.640
Leg Muscles anymore and so what I had to do was going to be something that actually

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:56.099
Augmented her since some people could physically move around where somebody else said my grandma still have stolen muscles

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.900
But she has problem with her motor

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.310
You know her motor neurons

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:04.829
And so if I was able to stimulate those I could do that so it's an example from you know bionics or bio

00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:09.809
You know some type of bio assist that would be a good example of it somebody who said oh, yeah

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.329
And by the way, I got an award for that

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:16.499
But that wasn't the reason I went into it right and so those are the types of things, so if you've got

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.270
applications for what you've done

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.240
That's a far better way to talk about it

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:27.420
Then in terms of the recognition you got from Society whether you won a scholarship or you won an award. Yes

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:32.070
We look at those yes, those matter, but they don't matter as much in an interview. We're looking at that

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.070
That's what got you to the interview

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.220
And so that's an important point to make

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.720
when we do interviews

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.130
they will depend on the location if we do an interview for

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.299
Example in the Bay area and San Francisco Bay area in the states will have a thousand

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:50.669
Candidates for a position and so if we're interviewing you you're already one in

00:17:50.889 --> 00:17:56.039
100 or one and two hundred or one and four hundred whatever it ends up being because of the number we hire in

00:17:56.769 --> 00:17:58.559
We're pretty confident

00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:03.239
You've got a good resume right and so the interview really goes beyond that resume or you wouldn't be there

00:18:03.309 --> 00:18:05.130
Even in Colorado, which is the state?

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:10.589
I live in if we put out a position that has any interest to the software community

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.419
We'll have a hundred to 200 applicants and these are top people. I mean we get applicants who are like

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:21.239
Oh, I finished first in China this year on this particular software challenge Like China

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.579
That's there's a few people in that country

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.299
I think a lot of people come into an interview and one of the reasons

00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:31.138
They fail some of what I was talking about before the humblebrag the giving proper attribution

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:38.459
Realigning what they were doing with an application is they forgot that we've already looked at hundreds of resumes

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.019
And we already like you right

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:46.319
So we're looking for something in the interview that wasn't in the resume so it's not just here's my resume job done

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:53.130
You meet me and then you know whether aside you basically said I resumes kind of like the headlines exactly now

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.019
Let's find out what this guy. Oh, this girl is like

00:18:55.019 --> 00:18:55.320
Yeah

00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.689
That's a great point and the thing to keep in mind is now you're competing against the best of the best of the best

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:07.649
Right so we've gone through those thousand resumes those thousand resumes presumably were qualified people from a much larger pool

00:19:07.649 --> 00:19:12.899
And now we're interviewing three or four of you for the final job. If somebody's not local to you

00:19:12.899 --> 00:19:14.740
How do you approach that if you have?

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.460
applicants

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:20.639
internationally or is it that they need to get to you or have that work just out in chess because we have also got a

00:19:20.639 --> 00:19:22.269
Global audience here, so

00:19:22.269 --> 00:19:25.529
Absolutely, well we do try to do a three-stage screening

00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:29.879
And so we'll go through all the resumes and of course we want people from all over the world

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.880
There's you know there's brilliance everywhere

00:19:32.169 --> 00:19:38.249
We'll do a phone screen to find out you know who the best of the best are and that will prevent them from having to

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:40.510
Travel or anything else

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:47.980
Some people are allowed to be distributed remotely, so I have a person, Indiana of a person in in Seattle

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.559
and a person in Chennai, India

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:56.770
You know then so these these are really good folks we've decided they can be there because they can successfully work from

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:03.130
You know from the remote spot most people will come into the bay area or Bristol Bristol uk here or Fort Collins

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:07.929
Colorado and work, and so will typically do is if they've got past in the phone screening

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.109
They got on to stage three which is the last stage before hire

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.740
We will pay for them to fly out to where we're going to do the interview

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.980
Typically the Bay area because that's where the bulk of our

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:23.739
Research effort is but it'll also be bristol uk or four columns depending on where we're going to bring them in to hire and so

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.200
We will hire

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:33.849
Internationally, but tend to ask them to relocate to one of our global offices and so it's really up to the person do they want

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:40.449
To make that move from let's say Malaysia to a let's say a china office in Shanghai do they want to make the move from?

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.919
We get some brilliant person who's let's say from Egypt we don't have a research operation

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:50.170
There are they willing to move from egypt to say Bristol uk so that's up to the person

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:55.210
But we do we do definitely encourage people from all over the world to come in because it's it's good for us

00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:00.189
I mean a big part of what I've worked on the last three or four years in the quantitative standpoint for

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:06.219
Data analytics is looking at the impact of diversity on creativity, and it's huge so we know that

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.439
I mean, we know that the more diverse

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:13.900
Type of employee that we bring in the better overall products. We're going to get

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:25.620
Is much more powerful than for example two craters which were the state-of-the-art when I did my master's thesis because I was working on

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.909
Impedance tomography back then and I was killing the Craig computer

00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:34.259
I had to actually chase students out with add music at 3 in the morning, so I could add two cray to myself

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:40.709
Nowadays you do that. I've got more power on my iphone than I ever had with your credit computer
