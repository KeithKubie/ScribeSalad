Vsauce.
Michael here with good news. Today we've got

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.640
two Leanback experiences, where we pull together great

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.950
videos from people all over YouTube.
The first, here on Vsauce with me,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.940
is roughly gonna be about complexity.
But over on Vsauce2

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.080
Kevin has put together an exhibition of fantastic

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.840
street art.
To begin, all you have to do is click the link

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.939
at the very top of this video's
description. And to start Kevin's Leanback

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.269
go over to Vsauce2.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.410
Click the link whenever you're ready,
but in the meantime,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.530
let me show you this.
It was submitted by a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.680
fan named Aaron and it shows the cast of
The Key of Awesome.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.820
But wait, who's this hot body with great cleavage?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.280
You guessed it, the bearded nun.
Aaron, this is gonna be

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.260
on my refrigerator for the rest of my life.
Thank you.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.470
Are you guys still there?

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.000
Seriously?
Because you should start the Leanback.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.190
Click the link at the top of this video.
I'll see you on the other side.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.210
And as always,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.490
thanks for watching.
