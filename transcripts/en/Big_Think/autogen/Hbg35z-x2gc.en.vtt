00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.129
so the big issues I guess would be the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139
so the big issues I guess would be the
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.490
so the big issues I guess would be the
things that might affect our ability to

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500
things that might affect our ability to
 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.680
things that might affect our ability to
survive as a species on the planet that

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690
survive as a species on the planet that
 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.630
survive as a species on the planet that
I think most people religious and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640
I think most people religious and
 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.529
I think most people religious and
non-religious would agree that that

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539
non-religious would agree that that
 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.359
non-religious would agree that that
would be a very bad thing and so the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
would be a very bad thing and so the
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.150
would be a very bad thing and so the
sort of things that could affect that is

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160
sort of things that could affect that is
 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.960
sort of things that could affect that is
some sort of pandemic overpopulation and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
some sort of pandemic overpopulation and
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.930
some sort of pandemic overpopulation and
pollution or getting hit by a meteor so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
pollution or getting hit by a meteor so
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.280
pollution or getting hit by a meteor so
to some extent we need to we may need to

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290
to some extent we need to we may need to
 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.990
to some extent we need to we may need to
do things like lemonade poverty just so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
do things like lemonade poverty just so
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.750
do things like lemonade poverty just so
we have less burden so we can go forward

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
we have less burden so we can go forward
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.639
we have less burden so we can go forward
with our science and engineering enough

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649
with our science and engineering enough
 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.319
with our science and engineering enough
so that we can get some of us off the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
so that we can get some of us off the
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.410
so that we can get some of us off the
planet so when the meteor hits we will

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
planet so when the meteor hits we will
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.439
planet so when the meteor hits we will
still survive so in a way you have to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449
still survive so in a way you have to
 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.080
still survive so in a way you have to
think in this very interconnected

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090
think in this very interconnected
 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.779
think in this very interconnected
far-reaching way in order to decide what

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
far-reaching way in order to decide what
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.090
far-reaching way in order to decide what
the priorities are and at least some of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
the priorities are and at least some of
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.470
the priorities are and at least some of
the priorities must be to get us to a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480
the priorities must be to get us to a
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.380
the priorities must be to get us to a
point where it's not such a luxury to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
point where it's not such a luxury to
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.789
point where it's not such a luxury to
have science and engineering that's

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
have science and engineering that's
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.260
have science and engineering that's
capable of getting us to another

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
capable of getting us to another
 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.350
capable of getting us to another
habitable planet or for that matter

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
habitable planet or for that matter
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.899
habitable planet or for that matter
constructing a habitable biosphere

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909
constructing a habitable biosphere
 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.469
constructing a habitable biosphere
that's non planetary many steps between

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
that's non planetary many steps between
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.050
that's non planetary many steps between
there I mean personal genomics and being

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
there I mean personal genomics and being
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.570
there I mean personal genomics and being
able to monitor our environmental

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580
able to monitor our environmental
 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.310
able to monitor our environmental
microorganisms and so forth could be a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
microorganisms and so forth could be a
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440
microorganisms and so forth could be a
huge step in towards the reducing

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
huge step in towards the reducing
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.289
huge step in towards the reducing
poverty and increasing education so that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
poverty and increasing education so that
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.120
poverty and increasing education so that
then we can do things that involve

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
then we can do things that involve
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.530
then we can do things that involve
physics again

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540
 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.600
