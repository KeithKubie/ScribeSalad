Jersey some of my classmates and i were

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099
Jersey some of my classmates and i were
 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.500
Jersey some of my classmates and i were
wondering if you could please explain

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510
wondering if you could please explain
 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.839
wondering if you could please explain
the relationship between the position

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849
the relationship between the position
 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.820
the relationship between the position
velocity and acceleration function and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
velocity and acceleration function and
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.289
velocity and acceleration function and
how it was discovered that by

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299
how it was discovered that by
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.790
how it was discovered that by
differentiating the position function

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800
differentiating the position function
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.609
differentiating the position function
the velocity acceleration functions can

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
the velocity acceleration functions can
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.000
the velocity acceleration functions can
be found thank you very
