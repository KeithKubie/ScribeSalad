TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.853
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:08.580
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.337
The Google Brain
team's long-term goal

00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:12.420
is to create more intelligent
software and systems

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.910
that improve people's
lives, which they pursue

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.730
through both pure and
applied research in a variety

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.990
of different domains.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.570
On "The Developer Show,"
we've shared a bunch of links

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.250
to their work over
the last year.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.797
But there's so much more.

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:26.880
Take a look at this post
linked in the description

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.800
below for a review
of the progress

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.080
the team has made in
2016 and some of what

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.170
may be in store for 2017.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.610
The Chrome Media
Team has created

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.680
Draco, an open-source
compression library

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.210
to improve the storage and
transmission of 3D graphics.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.320
With it, applications
using 3D graphics

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.960
can be significantly
smaller without compromising

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.220
visual fidelity.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.110
For examples and a
link to the GitHub,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.820
head on over to the post.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.130
We recently simplified
and improved the Merchant

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.630
experience for those
of you who have

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.030
paid apps, in-app
purchases, or subscriptions.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.420
These include moving Order
Management to the Google Play

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.294
Developer Console, adding
some improved features,

00:01:03.294 --> 00:01:05.710
and making Payments Settings
accessible from the Developer

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.090
Console in addition to
payments.google.com.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.360
For all of the details,
check out the post.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.130
Google Cloud Key
Management Service

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.740
is now available in beta
in select countries.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.530
With Cloud KMS, you can manage
symmetric encryption keys

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.870
in a cloud-hosted
solution, whether they're

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.680
used to protect data stored
in GCP or another environment.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.290
For more on how this fits
into the Google Cloud Platform

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.850
encryption continuum and
links to get started,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.520
check out the post.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.070
If you're in San Francisco next
month for the RSA conference,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.250
stop by our SF office for a
series of 20 security talks

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.310
just up the street
from the conference.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.840
The schedule of
talks is on the post.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.670
And now for some API updates.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.250
We recently introduced
Business Location Insights

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.530
into Google My Business
API to make it easier

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.450
for you to programmatically
access location

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.875
insights such as total number
of searches, views, and actions

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:57.000
that let you track and
analyze where and how people

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.120
are finding your
business on Google.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.890
We've made the
coursework endpoints

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.184
in the Classroom API more robust
with additional management

00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:07.350
capabilities, enabling your
app to create and update

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.229
questions, modify and
delete coursework, and add

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.930
Drive items and YouTube videos
to coursework and student

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.690
submissions.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.170
For more details on what you
can build with coursework,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.380
head on over to the post
for a cool video and links.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.260
Oh, and for you AdWords
users, remember to transition

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.842
to expanded text ads
before January 31st, 2017.

00:02:25.842 --> 00:02:27.300
You may want to
start with the best

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.990
practices and other docs linked
on the post in the description

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.050
