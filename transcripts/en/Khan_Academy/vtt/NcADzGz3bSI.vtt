00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.590
It never hurts to get a lot of
practice, so in this video I'm

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.660
just going to do a bunch more
of essentially, what we call

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.550
long division problems.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:17.050
And so if you have
4 goes into 2,292.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.290
And I don't know exactly why
they call it long division,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.590
and we saw this in the
last video a little bit.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.430
I didn't call it long division
then, but I think the reason

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.250
why is it takes you a long
time or it takes a long

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.890
piece of your paper.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.240
As you go along, you kind of
have this thing, this long tail

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.280
that develops on the problem.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.740
So all of those are, at least,
reasons in my head why

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.060
it's called long division.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.690
But we saw in the last video
there's a way to tackle any

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.510
division problem while just
knowing your multiplication

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.820
tables up to maybe 10
times 10 or 12 times 12.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.230
But just as a bit of review,
this is the same thing

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.000
as 2,292 divided by 4.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.930
And it's actually the same
thing, and you probably haven't

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.640
seen this notation before,
as 2,292 divided by 4.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.970
This, this, and this are
all equivalent statements

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.790
on some level.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.930
And you could say, hey Sal,
that looks like a fraction

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.050
in case you have seen
fractions already.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.560
And that is exactly what it is.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.060
It is a fraction.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.650
But anyway, I'll just focus on
this format and in future

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.880
videos we'll think about other
ways to represent division.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.470
So let's do this problem.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.220
So 4 goes into 2
how many times?

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.600
It goes into 2 no times,
so let's move on to-- let

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.330
me just switch colors.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.270
So let's move on to the 22.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.110
4 goes into 22 how many times?

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.390
Let's see.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.140
4 times 5 is equal to 20.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.600
4 times 6 is equal to 24.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.440
So 6 is too much.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.410
So 4 goes into 22 five times.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.070
5 times 4 is 20.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.000
There's going to be a
little bit of a leftover.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.850
And then we subtract
22 minus 20.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.720
Well that's just 2.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.730
And then you bring down this 9.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.370
And you saw in the last video
exactly what this means.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.000
When you wrote this 5 up
here-- notice we wrote

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.880
in the 100's place.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.590
So this is really a 500.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.220
But in this video I'm just
going to focus more on the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.880
process, and you can think more
about what it actually means

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.660
in terms of where I'm
writing the numbers.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.830
But I think the process
is going to be crystal

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.790
clear hopefully, by
the end of this video.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.040
So we brought down the 9.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.980
4 goes into 29 how many times?

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.390
It goes into at
least six times.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.750
What's 4 times 7?

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.840
4 times 7 is 28.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.610
So it goes into it at
least seven times.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.770
What's 4 times 8?

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.770
4 times 8 is 32, so it can't go
into it eight times so it's

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.220
going to go into it seven.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.410
4 goes into 29
nine seven times.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.710
7 times 4 is 28.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.930
29 minus 28 to get our
remainder for this step

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.380
in the problem is 1.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.535
And now we're going to
bring down this 2.

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:03.770
We're going to bring it
down and you get a 12.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.760
4 goes into 12?

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.180
That's easy.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.680
4 times 3 is 12.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.080
4 goes into 12 three times.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.400
3 times 4 is 12.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.360
12 minus 12 is 0.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.740
We have no remainder.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.400
So 4 goes into 2,292
exactly 573 times.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.510
So this 2,292 divided by 4
we can say is equal to 573.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.250
Or we could say that this thing
right here is equal to 573.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.680
Let's do a couple of more.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.090
Let's do a few more problems.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.970
So I'll do that red color.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:50.820
Let's say we had 7
going into 6,475.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.100
Maybe it's called long division
because you write it nice and

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.360
long up here and you
have this line.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.610
I don't know.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.170
There's multiple reasons why it
could be called long division.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.770
So you say 7 goes
into 6 zero times.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.670
So we need to keep
moving forward.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.060
So then we go to 64.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.170
7 goes into 64 how many times?

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.050
Let's see.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.300
7 times 7 is?

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.800
Well, that's way too small.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.070
Let me think about
it a little bit.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.620
Well 7 times 9 is 63.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.400
That's pretty close.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.360
And then 6 times 10 is
going to be too big.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.090
7 times 10 is 70.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.000
So that's too big.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.820
So 7 goes into 64 nine times.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.700
9 times 7 is 63.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.050
64 minus 63 to get our
remainder of this stage 1.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.240
Bring down the 7.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.120
7 goes into 17 how many times?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.240
Well, 7 times 2 is 14.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.010
And then 7 times 3 is 21.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.600
So 3 is too big.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.500
So 7 goes into 17 two times.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.350
2 times 7 is 14.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.620
17 minus 14 is 3.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.856
And now we bring down the 5.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.350
And 7 goes into 35?

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.820
That's in our 7 multiplication
tables, five times.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.920
5 times 7 is 35.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.370
And there you go.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.990
So the remainder is zero.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.130
So all the examples I did
so far had no remainders.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.240
Let's do one that maybe
might have a remainder.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.950
And to ensure it has a
remainder I'll just

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.870
make up the problem.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.310
It's much easier to make
problems that have remainders

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.520
than the ones that
don't have remainders.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:38.090
So let's say I want to divide 3
into-- I'm going to divide it

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:47.630
into, let's say 1,735,092.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.490
This will be a nice,
beastly problem.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.950
So if we can do this we
can handle everything.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.220
So it's 1,735,092.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.570
That's what we're
dividing 3 into.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.530
And actually, I'm not sure if
this will have a remainder.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.290
In the future video I'll show
you how to figure out whether

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.270
something is divisible by 3.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.160
Actually, we can
do it right now.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.790
We can just add up
all these digits.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.930
1 plus 7 is 8.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.180
8 plus 3 is 11.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.680
11 5 five is 16.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.250
16 plus 9 is 25.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.200
25 plus 2 is 27.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.670
So actually, this number
is divisible by 3.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.420
So if you add up all of
the digits, you get 27.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.540
And then you can add up those
digits-- 2 plus 7 is 9.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.130
So that is divisible by 9.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.070
That's a trick that
only works for 3.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.900
So this number actually
is divisible by 3.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.990
So let me change it a
little bit, so it's

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.270
not divisible by 3.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.860
Let me make this into a 1.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.000
Now this number will
not be divisible by 3.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.530
I definitely want a
number where I'll end

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.340
up with a remainder.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.100
Just so you see what
it looks like.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.580
So let's do this one.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.030
3 goes into 1 zero times.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.900
So we can just move forward.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.000
You could write a 0 here and
multiply that out, but that

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.070
just makes it a little
bit messy in my head.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.400
So we just move
one to the right.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.890
3 goes into 17 how many times?

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.060
Well, 3 times 5 is equal to 15.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.930
And 3 times 6 is equal to
18 and that's too big.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.020
So 3 goes into 17 right
here five times.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.580
5 times 3 is 15.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.020
And we subtract.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.020
17 minus 15 is 2.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.420
And now we bring down this 3.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.480
3 goes into 23 how many times?

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.750
Well, 3 times 7 is equal to 21.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.350
And 3 times 8 is too big.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.020
That's equal to 24.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.090
So 3 goes into 23 seven times.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.860
7 times 3 is 21.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.910
Then we subtract.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.750
23 minus 21 is 2.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.420
Now we bring down
the next number.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.580
We bring down the 5.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.360
I think you can appreciate why
it's called long division now.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.060
We bring down this 5.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.040
3 goes into 25 how many times?

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.270
Well, 3 times 8 gets you pretty
close and 3 times 9 is too big.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.240
So it goes into it eight times.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.175
8 times 3 is 24.

00:08:10.175 --> 00:08:12.220
I'm going to run out of space.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.180
You subtract, you get 1.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.820
25 minus 24 is 1.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.116
Now we can bring down this 0.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.260
And you get 3 goes into
10 how many times?

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:25.850
That's easy.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:26.950
It goes into it three times.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.020
3 times 3 is 9.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.090
That's about as close
to 10 as we can get.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.880
3 times 3 is 9.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.930
10 minus 9, I'm going to
have to scroll up and

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.160
down here a little bit.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.850
10 minus 9 is 1, and then we
can bring down the next number.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.430
I'm running out of colors.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.760
I can bring down that 9.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.600
3 goes into 19 how many times?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.890
Well, 6 is about as
close as we can get.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.830
That gets us to 18.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.400
3 goes into 19 six times.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.410
6 times 3-- let me scroll down.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.540
6 times 3 is 18.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.570
19 minus 18-- we subtract
it up here too.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.370
19 minus 18 is 1 and
then we're almost done.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.130
I can revert back to the pink.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.920
We bring down this
1 right there.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.840
3 goes into 11 how many times?

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.680
Well, that's three times
because 3 times 4 is too big.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.180
3 times 4 is 12, so
that's too big.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.900
So it goes into it three times.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.270
So 3 goes into 11 three times.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.190
3 times 3 is 9.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.600
And then we subtract
and we get a 2.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.910
And there's nothing
left to bring down.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.500
When we look up here there's
nothing left to bring

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.750
down, so we're done.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.450
So we're left with the
remainder of 2 after doing

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.420
this entire problem.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:46.190
So the answer, 3 goes into
1,735,091-- it goes into

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:52.950
it 578,363 remainder 2.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.190
And that remainder 2 was what
we got all the way down there.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.740
So hopefully you now appreciate
and you can tackle pretty

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.150
much any division problem.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.740
And you also, through this
exercise, can appreciate why

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.110
it's called long division.
