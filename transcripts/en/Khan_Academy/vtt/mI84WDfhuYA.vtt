00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.360
We're asked to arrange the
following measurements in order

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.904
from smallest to largest.

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:07.320
And we have the measurements,
and they're different units.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.060
This is in decameters,
then we have meters,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.580
then we have millimeters,
then we have centimeters.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.070
So the way I would
tackle this is

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.320
I would try to convert them
all to the same units, maybe

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.940
meters, and then compare
them all in terms of meters.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.620
So let's do that.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.220
So this is just a screenshot of
that exact same screen we just

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.110
saw there.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.020
And so let's just convert
each of these into meters.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.710
So the first one we have right
over here is one decameter.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.260
So we have to remind ourselves
what deca even means.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.456
Well, deca is
equal to 10 meters.

00:00:46.456 --> 00:00:48.080
And actually, let me
add more of these,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.810
just so that we know all
the different prefixes

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.410
we could have.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.690
So you have deca.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.150
You have hecto,
which would be 100.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.070
You have kilo, which
would be 1,000.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.370
And then, of course,
you just have meters,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.230
and you'd have no prefix there.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.040
That would just
be equal 1 if you

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.260
have no prefix in
front of the meters.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.190
And then if you have
a tenth of a meter,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.570
that is decimeter,
so this is 1/10.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.550
Then you have centi,
which is 1/100.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.256
And then you have milli,
which is equal to 1/1,000.

00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:30.130
So let's use this
information right over here

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.640
to figure out how many
meters each of these are.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.730
So one decameter-- we
just saw deca means 10.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.870
That's 1 times 10 meters.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.900
So this is going to
be equal to 10 meters.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.340
So this right over
here is 10 meters.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.860
This is already
written in meters.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980
This is 13 meters.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:06.710
Then we have 15,000 millimeters,
but milli means 1/1,000,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.710
So it's 15,000 times
1/1,000 of a meter.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.099
So each millimeter is
1/1,000 of a meter.

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.390
You could view this as instead
of writing a milli here,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.030
I wrote 1/1,000.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.190
So 15,000 times 1/1,000, that's
just going to give me 15.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.610
So this is going
to be 15 meters.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.950
So this is 15 meters.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.590
Another way of thinking
about it is, look,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.230
1,000 millimeters
is equal to a meter.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.480
So let's divide this
into groups of 1,000.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.000
Well, this is literally
15 groups of 1,000.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.120
This is 15 groups of
1,000 millimeters,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.350
so that's going to be 15 meters.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.150
And then, finally, we
have 1,900 centimeters.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.820
So 1,900, instead
of writing centi,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.940
I'm going to write
1/100 of a meter.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.705
Well, 1,900 times
1 over 100 is 19,

00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:09.190
so this is equal to 19 meters.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.150
Another way of
thinking about it is,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.620
this is 19 groups
of 100 centimeters,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.395
and 100 centimeters
is equal to a meter.

00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:22.870
This is 19 meters
right over here.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.390
So let's go back to
the actual problem.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.150
So let's remind ourselves.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.690
This right over here,
this is 10 meters.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.520
This is 13 meters, so 10, 13.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.040
This right over
here was 15 meters,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.709
and this right over
here was 19 meters.

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.250
So actually, the order that they
already gave it to us in, we

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.870
could obviously swap things
around if we wanted to.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.620
But the order that
they already gave it to

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.220
was the order from
smallest to largest.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.330
This is 10 meters, 13 meters,
15 meters, and 19 meters.
