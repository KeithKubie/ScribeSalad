00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:00.620
Hey.

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.720
I wanted to give you guys a few
tips on how you can become

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.370
more of a console power-user.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.310
If you are not familiar
with console.log, this

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.110
video is not for you.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.940
All right.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.480
First we're going to
get right into it.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.530
You'll notice that I'm here
inside of jsFiddle.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.220
It's just listing out exactly
what I'm going to be talking

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.450
about right now.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.580
And, well, we do have a
little bit of script.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.610
Over here, we've got a little
Ajax request that's going to

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.735
fire off whenever I
click on the page.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:26.760
So we're going to fire that
Ajax request, and when it

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.800
comes back, we're going to
create a text area, add that

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.780
to the DOM, and then set the
value of the text area to be

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.390
whatever came back from
the Ajax request.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.830
Now, I'm going to do that here,
and I click, and then

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.010
text areas come in.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.206
That's good.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:44.590
But sometimes you'll be doing
this, and you'll expect this

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.590
to show up in the console.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.060
And by default, it
doesn't show up

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.710
in the Chrome DevTools.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.980
You can right click and
turn on XHR logging.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.400
And so now, when I have that on,
all those XHRs are logged

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.140
to the console, and I can go
over to Network and figure out

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.300
exactly the details
of those requests.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.400
Now you might have noticed,
Preserve Log is here.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.379
This is brand new.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.340
So on page refreshes, your
console can stay preserved,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.980
which is pretty cool.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.770
So I'm going to go ahead and--

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.840
I think I'll keep this on.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.550
And I'm going to show
you console.time.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.660
So I type console.time up
here, and we're going

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.720
to give it a name.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.540
And I need to say
when it ends.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.490
And so console.time and timeEnd
is just a nice way for

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.570
you to kind of measure how
long something takes.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.500
Now, you could do it yourself
with the data object, but we

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.990
have a little hook for it.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.890
So I'm going to click, and so
now we have an idea of how

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.772
long it takes from the
start of the Ajax to

00:01:41.772 --> 00:01:42.490
the end of the Ajax.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.880
It's pretty cool.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.290
Console.dir is an
interesting one.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.250
And to do it, I'm going
to dir out the text

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.410
area that I've created.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.270
And I want to show that in
comparison to console.log.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.440
So we'll both log and
dir that out.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.810
I'll run that, and
now I'll click.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.130
So here we have--

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.570
this is the log view, and this
is more of like the tree-level

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.230
view, and console.dir gives you
more of the DOM-level view

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.170
of an object.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.020
So sometimes you kind
of want that.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.460
Now, I'm going to take this app
and blow this up into the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.160
full-screen view.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.720
And I will point out that if
you're actually typing in the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.140
console, you could type
console.dir and do that right

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.560
inside the console, but you
can have a nice little

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.800
convenience function, so you
can just type dir directly,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.440
and that works as well.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.860
So there's a few other
methods that are

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.530
available inside the console.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.220
So one of them is Inspect,
and so this is cool.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.520
So I have this text area, and I
want to actually go see that

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.720
in the Elements tab.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.950
And I can just type inspect.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.050
We hop right over to Elements,
and it's already selected.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.210
Now similarly, I might have
an element that--

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm seeing an element, so I
actually want to access it in

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.920
the script.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.450
So I access it right here.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.900
I click on that, and I'm going
to bring up Console with the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.330
Escape key.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.600
And $0.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.050
And so that just is
a reference to

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.070
whatever was selected.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.830
And so this just works normally,
so I can kind of do

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.990
whatever I want with it.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.720
Another one, and this
is fun, is $$.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.480
And so this is also known as
the bling bling function.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.000
Bling bling is pretty cool.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.270
So this is just a peek into
the DevTool source.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.870
It's just a wraparound query
selector all, and so I can

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.650
just pass a selector to it and
see what matches on the page.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.950
So here, I have two text areas
on the page, and so that's

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.180
what it returns.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.350
It's easy as that.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.700
Now, monitorEvents.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.460
I'm going to show monitorEvents
to you.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.430
And it does what it says
on the [? TIM. ?]

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.480
And monitorEvents.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.130
And I'm going to pass at one
of these text areas.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.080
And there we go.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.150
Now, it's this text
area, here.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.490
OK, cool.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.010
So all the MouseEvents--

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.360
you see mousemove, click,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.430
KeyboardEvents, scroll events--

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.410
I get to see all the events
that are firing on this

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.300
object, which gives you a lot
insight into what's going on.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.930
Now, there is another way to do
this, in that I can do the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.970
same thing, and I can pass at
a second primer of either

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.959
mouse or key.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.560
And now, with key, I only
get the keyboard events.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.800
No scroll, no mouse events.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.120
So that's pretty cool.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.880
Next, I want to show you
keys and values.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.520
So keys gives you the names of
the keys [? in the ?] object,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.130
all the properties
and the methods.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.680
So I'm just going to
pass the document--

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.420
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.490
document.head, document.node
type.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.920
There's a lot of
stuff on there.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.790
Similarly, values gives me
back all the values.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.760
There's a lot of different kinds
of values, a bunch of

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.111
functions, stuff like that.

00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:02.510
I'm going to go back to keys for
a second, and there's some

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.780
pretty cool stuff in here-- a
web visibility state, some

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.450
interesting stuff.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.530
And I'd love to dig into
this a little bit more.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.855
So I could copy-paste this,
but it's little awkward.

00:05:11.855 --> 00:05:14.230
The easier way is just to call
the copy method that's built

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.500
right into the console.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.580
This copies it to your clipboard
immediately.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.550
So I can go over to my text
editor, paste it, and do

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.500
whatever I need to do to it.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.760
Oops.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.215
No, no.

00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:31.760
There we go.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.190
That's what I wanted.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.090
All right, cool.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.850
Now, I just want to show two
pretty cool techniques coming

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.210
from some other browsers.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.465
First I'm going to head
over to Opera.

00:05:44.465 --> 00:05:46.220
This is opera.next.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.210
And we have up HTML5 Rocks, and
sometimes you just want

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.710
jQuery to work with.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.980
On this page, we actually
don't have jQuery.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.250
On Opera, I can type double
slash, and call jQuery as a

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.720
function, and it just
loads in jQuery.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.780
It's like the jQuery
[? a.size ?]

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.740
bookmarklet.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.760
And now I can use jQuery
to my heart's content.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.530
That's pretty cool.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.970
Pretty cool feature in Opera.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.400
Switch over to Firefox Aurora.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.500
And here we have a page
that has an iframe.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.780
All right?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.560
I'm going to open
up this iframe.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.190
Look at the DOM view, and
you'll see the iframe.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.880
Inside of that is a script,
and inside of

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.700
that script is a secret.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.760
So this is a common thing.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.840
You'll have a script inside.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.610
You'll want to understand what's
going on inside that

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.710
script, but of course, your
console is operating inside

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.050
the context of the outside
frame, right?

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.465
And so, I'm asking what
the secret is, and

00:06:36.465 --> 00:06:37.650
it's not out here.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.920
It's inside there.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.220
So in Firebug, you can
type "cd." And

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.810
cd changes the context.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.320
And so, I'm actually going to
go and select that frame.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.520
There's that frame.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.030
And now I need to pass the
window object, so I'm going to

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.080
pass that content window, and
it looks about right.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.890
And, cool.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.120
So we actually just changed the
context of what Firebug is

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.340
looking at, and now I can type
secret, get my answer.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.880
So I'm querying the Javascript
that's going on inside of

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.330
here, and to return back to the
outer context, I just do

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.000
cd(top), and I'm back
where I started.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.940
That's about it.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.530
All right, so I would definitely
recommend checking

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.890
out the DevTools website, where
there's a bunch more

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.490
docs on all this stuff, if
you're interested in digging

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.450
and learning more.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.700
All right, thanks.
