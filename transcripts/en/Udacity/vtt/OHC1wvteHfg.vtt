00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So this first one is actually false.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We don't know that the shortest tour for the input graph has length 1056.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That's the smallest one that we happen to have found,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but if we ran the algorithm numerous more times,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
then we might find a smaller one,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the only thing we know for certain is that

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the minimal vertex cover is at least 618

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because of our factor 2 approximation.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We also don't know that the random algorithm is likely a factor 3 approximation,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
again because we would need to run it

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
many, many more times to really be certain of that.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now we have found a tour that is at most

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
1.71 times as long as the optimal one

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
because we found a tour of length 1056,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and we know that the optimal one is at least 618,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
which is 1.71.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now we have not found a tour that is at most

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
1.43 times as long as the optimal one,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and if we plug that into our previous equation and we solve it for X,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
then we would get X equals 1.43 times 618,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
which is about 883,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which we didn't find a tour of 883.

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So that is not true.
