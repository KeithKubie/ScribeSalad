00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.540
We're on problem 73.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.760
How much did a certain
telephone call cost?

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.050
All right.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.430
Well, we know nothing so far.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.400
Statement one.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.360
The call lasted 53 minutes.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.060
Well, unless they tell us how
much it costs per minute, that

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.690
still doesn't tell us how
much the call costs.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.990
Statement two tells us the cost
for the first 3 minutes

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.476
was 5 times the cost for
each additional minute.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.030
But that still doesn't
help us.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.370
The cost for the first 3 minutes
might have been $0.05

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.680
a minute, and then we might
have been $0.01 a

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.890
minute after that.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.343
Or it could have been $0.10 a
minute, and then-- or let me

00:00:54.343 --> 00:00:56.810
make it a multiple of 3-- $0.12
a minute, and then $0.04

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.800
after that.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.440
Both of these satisfy
that statement.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.110
And actually, if I have to be
honest, this statement is

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.080
slightly ambiguous.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.480
Because they're saying the cost
for the first 3 minutes.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.890
Do they mean that the total cost
for the first 3 minutes

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.830
was 5 times each additional
minute?

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.750
Or was it the cost per minute
of the first 3 minutes was 5

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.800
times additional minutes?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.450
Well, either way, both
statements combined don't help

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.550
us, because we're not able to
figure out the cost per

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.840
minute, so that we could
apply it to this.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.500
So they are both useless.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.460
74.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.840
In a certain office, 50% of the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.430
employees are college graduates.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.440
So let's say 50% college.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.690
I'll call it C.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.450
Or I could say 50% of the
employees are college

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.310
graduate, right?

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.120
60% of the employees are
over 40 years old.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.930
So it says 60% of the employees
equal, we'll call it

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.750
O for over 40.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.890
I don't know where this
is going, I'm

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.190
just making up numbers.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.310
And it said if 30% of those over
40 have Master's degrees,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.500
how many of the employees over
40 have Master's degrees?

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.030
OK.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:30.280
So 30% of the over 40 have
Master's degrees.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.510
I don't know, I'm just trying
to make up some notation.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.060
How many of the employees over
40 have Master's degrees?

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.280
So we're actually trying to
come up with this number.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.370
So if we knew how many employees
over 40 there were,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.270
we would be set, because we'd
just multiply 30% times that.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.450
If we knew how many employees
there were, we would be all

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.560
set, because we could figure
out the number over 40 and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.030
then multiply 30 times that.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.130
So let's see what
they give us.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.270
Statement one.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.120
Exactly 100 of the employees
are college graduates.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.650
So essentially, C is equal
to 100, right?

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.180
And they told us
that 50% of the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.880
employees are college graduates.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.240
So that means how many total
employees are there?

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.850
That means that there
are 200 employees.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.250
100 is 50% of 200.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.210
So that told us there
are 200 employees.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.230
If there are 200 employees,
how many

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.790
employees over 40 are there?

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.660
Well, that's O, right?

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.620
O for over 40.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.830
Well, that's just 60% of 200.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.300
That's 120.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.690
And then how many over 40
with Master's degrees?

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.940
Let's that OMD.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.510
How many of these are there?

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.080
Over 40 with Master's degrees.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.180
Well, that's 30% of over 40, so
that's 30%-- this is an O--

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.000
this is 30% of this, which is
equal to-- so over 40 with

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.320
Master's degrees
is equal to 36.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.390
And we would be done.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.780
So statement one alone
is sufficient.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.950
I should call it over
40 instead of a 0.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.030
Don't want to get confused.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.710
Over 40 with Mater's degrees.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.210
So statement two.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.850
Of the employees 40 years
old or less, 25%

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.740
have Master's degrees.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.279
So that doesn't tell us
anything, really.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.640
It doesn't tell us how many
employees there are over 40,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.270
which was one of the things that
we realized we have to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.650
figure out.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.060
It doesn't help us figure out
how many total employees there

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.190
are, so we really can't
do this type of logic.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.795
So it seems fairly useless.

00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:37.330
So yeah, employees 40
years old or less.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.400
25% of-- no.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.900
This is a useless piece
of information.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.630
So the answer is--
what is that?

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.270
I always forget.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.630
A.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.180
Statement alone is sufficient
and statement 2 is useless.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.810
75.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:01.010
They ask is rst equal to 1?

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:08.160
Statement one tells us that
rs is equal to 1.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.080
This by itself doesn't
help us, right?

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.430
If rs is equal to 1, the only
way that this whole thing is

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.280
going to be equal to 1 is
if t is also equal 1.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.390
But we don't know that, so-- I
mean, t could be equal to 10.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.660
So statement one alone
doesn't help us.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:29.350
Statement two tells us,
st is equal to 1.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.710
Well, I can show that even
if we have both of these

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.870
statements, that we still
can't prove this.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.060
For example, I can come up with
a scenario that meets

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.570
both statements where
this is true.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.490
Because I can say what if r is
equal to 1, s is equal to 1,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.680
and t is equal to 1?

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.560
Then we can make both of
these statements true.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.840
So then, definitely,
rst is equal to 1.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.870
But let me see if I can
construct something where this

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.720
doesn't hold up.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.020
So what if r is equal to 6.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.800
s is equal to 1/6, and
then t is equal to 6.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.940
So then r times s would still
be equal to 1, right?

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.970
s times t would still
be equal to 1.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.930
But what is rst now?

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.570
It's 6 times 1/6, times 6,
which is equal to 6.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.790
So I can satisfy both of these,
but still end up not

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.210
knowing whether it equals 1
or something different.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.950
I just picked this
arbitrarily.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.280
You can actually kind of pick
an arbitrary number here and

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.920
set this up.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.920
So anyway, this is E.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.730
I think that's E, right?

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.620
Both statements combined
are useless.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.910
Right.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.040
They're not sufficient.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.290
Next problem.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.465
Turn the page.

00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:50.740
It's problem 76.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.500
And they've drawn a
nice pie chart for

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.320
us, which I'll reproduce.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.130
76.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.150
Total expenses for the 5
divisions of company h.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.660
Let me draw this pie chart.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.330
OK.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.990
And then they have a bunch
of-- let's see, how

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.830
many pies are there?

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.510
There are 5 pies.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.090
I'll try to draw it the
way they do it.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.340
So that's one.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.600
Two.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.010
Three.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.302
And they have one more.

00:07:28.302 --> 00:07:28.790
There we go.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.910
So that looks pretty close
to what they've drawn.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:40.300
And then they write, this
is Q, R, S, T, and P.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.210
O is the center.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.330
They call this angle, x.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.750
Fair enough.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.040
So this is the total expenses
for the 5 divisions.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.320
So each of these are divisions
for company h.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.680
76.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.580
The figure above represents a
circle graph of company h's

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.120
totally expenses broken down
by the expenses for each of

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.780
it's 5 divisions.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.150
If O is the center of the
circle-- fair enough, so this

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.880
is the center, although I didn't
draw it quite at the

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.690
center-- if O is the center of
the circle, and if company h's

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.120
total expenses are $5.4 million,
what are the expenses

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.160
for division R?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.080
So the whole thing
is $5.4 million.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.860
So the whole pie is
$5.4 million.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.350
And we need to figure out
what R is equal to.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.380
So the whole expenses
are 360 degrees.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.350
So whatever fraction x is of 360
degrees, that's going to

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.880
be the fraction that R is
of the total expenses.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.659
So let's see if they
give us that.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.520
If we can figure out
what angle x is.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.520
One, x is equal to 94.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.049
Well, we're done.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:49.810
Because x over the total degrees
in the circle-- so 94

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.420
over 360 degrees-- that's
going to be equal to the

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.800
expenses of division R
divided by the total

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.400
expenses, $5.4 million.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.390
And this is a trivial
equation to solve.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.350
So one alone is sufficient.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.110
Let's see what they give us
for statement number two.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.150
The total expenses for divisions
S and T are twice as

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.100
much as the expenses
for division R.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:23.230
So they're saying that this
right here is twice as much as

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.850
what we're trying
to figure out.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.740
It's this right here.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.250
Well, that doesn't help us much,
because P and Q could be

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.330
arbitrarily small or large.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.380
These two combined could be $2
and this could be $1, right?

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.140
In which case, P and Q
are the bulk of the

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.510
expenses for the company.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.980
Or maybe these two are
$4 and R is $2,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.980
which are all possible.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.200
And these would represent the
rest of the-- whatever.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.570
It gets you to $5.4 million.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.580
So statement two is useless.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.270
So statement one alone is
sufficient and statement two

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.940
does us no good.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.110
And I'm out of time.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.920
I'll see you in the
next video.
