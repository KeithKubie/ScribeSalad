so I thought oh this is a really good
 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.770
so I thought oh this is a really good
match and I happen to have ten robots in

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780
match and I happen to have ten robots in
 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.310
match and I happen to have ten robots in
my closet as I always do and I said I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320
my closet as I always do and I said I
 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.640
my closet as I always do and I said I
can be there next week and so I went in

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650
can be there next week and so I went in
 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.410
can be there next week and so I went in
and learned a little more about the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420
and learned a little more about the
 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.469
and learned a little more about the
organization and then never left that's

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479
organization and then never left that's
 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.170
organization and then never left that's
awesome was the having the 10 robots in

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180
awesome was the having the 10 robots in
 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.469

things of that nature so it's all over

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160
things of that nature so it's all over
 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.260
things of that nature so it's all over
the place that's working with people

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270
the place that's working with people
 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.810

it's working alone it's really fun it

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820
it's working alone it's really fun it
 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.430
it's working alone it's really fun it
sounds like the perfect combination for

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440
sounds like the perfect combination for
 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.229
sounds like the perfect combination for
someone whose interests vary quite a bit

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239
someone whose interests vary quite a bit
 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.310
someone whose interests vary quite a bit
as well yeah I think yeah so that sounds

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320
as well yeah I think yeah so that sounds
 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.420
as well yeah I think yeah so that sounds
that's awesome

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430
that's awesome
 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.460
that's awesome
for those who might be interested in

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470
for those who might be interested in
 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.650
for those who might be interested in
pursuing a similar path can you tell us

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660
pursuing a similar path can you tell us
 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.690
pursuing a similar path can you tell us
a bit about your background and how you

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700
a bit about your background and how you
 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.440
a bit about your background and how you
got to where you are today yeah so I

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
got to where you are today yeah so I
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.690
got to where you are today yeah so I
started as a typical computer science

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700
started as a typical computer science
 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.150
started as a typical computer science
major I knew I wanted to major in

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160
major I knew I wanted to major in
 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.770
major I knew I wanted to major in
computer science I was lucky enough to

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780
computer science I was lucky enough to
 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.600
computer science I was lucky enough to
be exposed to computer science in high

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610
be exposed to computer science in high
 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.150
be exposed to computer science in high
school I'm fortunate enough that an

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160
school I'm fortunate enough that an
 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.270
school I'm fortunate enough that an
advisor talked to me about it I had

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280
advisor talked to me about it I had
 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.920
advisor talked to me about it I had
never really thought of teaching as a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930
never really thought of teaching as a
 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.160
never really thought of teaching as a
career but while I was in college I

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170
career but while I was in college I
 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.860
career but while I was in college I
loved being a teaching assistant it was

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870
loved being a teaching assistant it was
 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.080
loved being a teaching assistant it was
like my favorite thing I worked on a

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090
like my favorite thing I worked on a
 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.670
like my favorite thing I worked on a
fellowship where I actually worked with

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680
fellowship where I actually worked with
 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.199
fellowship where I actually worked with
Bryn Mawr professors on that scribbler

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209
Bryn Mawr professors on that scribbler
 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.199
Bryn Mawr professors on that scribbler
project that I described and when I got

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209
project that I described and when I got
 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.060
project that I described and when I got
into my later years of college I started

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070
into my later years of college I started
 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.590
into my later years of college I started
teaching middle schoolers and I found

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600
teaching middle schoolers and I found
 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.270
teaching middle schoolers and I found
that all of my extracurricular

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
that all of my extracurricular
 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.670
that all of my extracurricular
activities were centered around teaching

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680
activities were centered around teaching
 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.130
activities were centered around teaching
or advertising computer science which

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140
or advertising computer science which
 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.990
or advertising computer science which
probably should have been a sure sign

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000
probably should have been a sure sign
 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.990
probably should have been a sure sign
that I should do that uh but when I

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000
that I should do that uh but when I
 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.759
that I should do that uh but when I
graduated I went to MIT which was

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769
graduated I went to MIT which was
 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.710
graduated I went to MIT which was
phenomenal and a great experience but I

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720
phenomenal and a great experience but I
 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.650
phenomenal and a great experience but I
found myself yearning to be doing more

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660
found myself yearning to be doing more
 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.870
found myself yearning to be doing more
interaction with people and to be

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880
interaction with people and to be
 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.730
interaction with people and to be
helping more in a people in a more

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740
helping more in a people in a more
 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.720
helping more in a people in a more
direct way mom and

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730
direct way mom and
 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.090
direct way mom and
so that's when I found out about girls

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100
so that's when I found out about girls
 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.890
so that's when I found out about girls
code it kind of dawned on me like oh

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900
code it kind of dawned on me like oh
 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.510
code it kind of dawned on me like oh
maybe you should try doing this for a

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520
maybe you should try doing this for a
 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.090
maybe you should try doing this for a
living you really like it and I think

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100
living you really like it and I think
 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.320
living you really like it and I think
it's something that not a lot of

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330
it's something that not a lot of
 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.030
it's something that not a lot of
computer science majors consider while

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040
computer science majors consider while
 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.370
computer science majors consider while
they're in college definitely not it's

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380
they're in college definitely not it's
 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.930
they're in college definitely not it's
it's not a career that I had ever heard

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940
it's not a career that I had ever heard
 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.830
it's not a career that I had ever heard
about and it it sounds almost kind of

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840
about and it it sounds almost kind of
 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.110
about and it it sounds almost kind of
similar to what what I do in developer

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120
similar to what what I do in developer
 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.810
similar to what what I do in developer
relations as well helping people learn

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820
relations as well helping people learn
 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.110
relations as well helping people learn
new technologies so what kind of what

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120
new technologies so what kind of what
 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.090
new technologies so what kind of what
kind of role did science and math play

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100
kind of role did science and math play
 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.220
kind of role did science and math play
in your early life do you think that you

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230
in your early life do you think that you
 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.460
in your early life do you think that you
were uniquely situated to go into

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470
were uniquely situated to go into
 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.240
were uniquely situated to go into
computer science once you're exposed um

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250
computer science once you're exposed um
 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.330
computer science once you're exposed um
in some ways yes and in some ways

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340
in some ways yes and in some ways
 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.780
in some ways yes and in some ways
absolutely not

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790
absolutely not
 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.890
absolutely not
people thought I probably would have

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900
people thought I probably would have
 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.080
people thought I probably would have
been a train wreck so I'll start with

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090
been a train wreck so I'll start with
 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.650
been a train wreck so I'll start with
the yes I played tons of video games as

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660
the yes I played tons of video games as
 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.960
the yes I played tons of video games as
a kid which is sometimes a telltale sign

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970
a kid which is sometimes a telltale sign
 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.450
a kid which is sometimes a telltale sign
that that you might enjoy making a video

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460
that that you might enjoy making a video
 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.060
that that you might enjoy making a video
game or making technology I was kind of

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070
game or making technology I was kind of
 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.480
game or making technology I was kind of
kid that built websites for fun I loved

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490
kid that built websites for fun I loved
 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.230
kid that built websites for fun I loved
Photoshop but simultaneously at the same

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240
Photoshop but simultaneously at the same
 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.280
Photoshop but simultaneously at the same
time I was flunking biology and getting

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290
time I was flunking biology and getting
 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.910
time I was flunking biology and getting
fees and math I begged to get out of

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920
fees and math I begged to get out of
 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.890
fees and math I begged to get out of
math actually but I wasn't allowed to

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900
math actually but I wasn't allowed to
 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.480
math actually but I wasn't allowed to
take computer science at first because

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490
take computer science at first because
 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.630
take computer science at first because
of my poor math grades oh wow yeah yeah

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640
of my poor math grades oh wow yeah yeah
 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.720
of my poor math grades oh wow yeah yeah
and so I think a lot of people would

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730
and so I think a lot of people would
 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.430
and so I think a lot of people would
have said you know maybe she could be a

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440
have said you know maybe she could be a
 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.380
have said you know maybe she could be a
graphic designer or web designer but I

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390
graphic designer or web designer but I
 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.820
graphic designer or web designer but I
don't think a lot of people would have

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830
don't think a lot of people would have
 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.320
don't think a lot of people would have
said that I'd be a good computer

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330
said that I'd be a good computer
 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.410
said that I'd be a good computer
scientist and so finally when my advisor

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420
scientist and so finally when my advisor
 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.140
scientist and so finally when my advisor
in high school took over he took over

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150
in high school took over he took over
 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.550
in high school took over he took over
the computer science department and

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560
the computer science department and
 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.370
the computer science department and
opened it up to more kinds of students I

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380
opened it up to more kinds of students I
 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.730
opened it up to more kinds of students I
was lucky enough to try it and magically

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740
was lucky enough to try it and magically
 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.110
was lucky enough to try it and magically
I was very good at it

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120
I was very good at it
 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.810
I was very good at it
and my other grades improved too all the

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820
and my other grades improved too all the
 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.060
and my other grades improved too all the
typical signs of what a student is

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070
typical signs of what a student is
 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.770
typical signs of what a student is
excelling you know it's sort of excel

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780
excelling you know it's sort of excel
 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.810
excelling you know it's sort of excel
across the board um and I just never

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820
across the board um and I just never
 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.080
across the board um and I just never
stopped that that's that's an amazing

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090
stopped that that's that's an amazing
 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.920
stopped that that's that's an amazing
story what would you say to other young

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930
story what would you say to other young
 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.320
story what would you say to other young
adults who maybe think that math isn't

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330
adults who maybe think that math isn't
 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.870
adults who maybe think that math isn't
really their strong suit but the the

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880
really their strong suit but the the
 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.530
really their strong suit but the the
idea behind creation and making that you

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540
idea behind creation and making that you
 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.570
idea behind creation and making that you
oftentimes see in computer science and

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580
oftentimes see in computer science and
 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.910
oftentimes see in computer science and
technology still appeals to them what

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920
technology still appeals to them what
 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.560
technology still appeals to them what
how would you how would you guide to

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570
how would you how would you guide to
 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.070
how would you how would you guide to
them

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080

yeah I think I mean there's first of all

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780
yeah I think I mean there's first of all
 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.589
yeah I think I mean there's first of all
the initial fear of feeling like you are

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599
the initial fear of feeling like you are
 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.899
the initial fear of feeling like you are
not one of those people or it's not for

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909
not one of those people or it's not for
 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:47.969
not one of those people or it's not for
you and I would say if you're the kind

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979
you and I would say if you're the kind
 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.219
you and I would say if you're the kind
of person who enjoyed any art form

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:50.229
of person who enjoyed any art form
 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:54.119
of person who enjoyed any art form
creation with your hands with words with

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:54.129
creation with your hands with words with
 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:55.830
creation with your hands with words with
performance I would say at least

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840
performance I would say at least
 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.710
performance I would say at least
consider it and look at it from the

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720
consider it and look at it from the
 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.800
consider it and look at it from the
perspective of building a world what

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810
perspective of building a world what
 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.659
perspective of building a world what
kind of world do you want to build is it

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:03.669
kind of world do you want to build is it
 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:05.399
kind of world do you want to build is it
a video game world is it an app world

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409
a video game world is it an app world
 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:07.020
a video game world is it an app world
and that can make it a lot more

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030
and that can make it a lot more
 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.110
and that can make it a lot more
appealing and at girls who code we start

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120
appealing and at girls who code we start
 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.089
appealing and at girls who code we start
our first week entirely building video

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:12.099
our first week entirely building video
 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.779
our first week entirely building video
games so to keep kids engaged and they

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:15.789
games so to keep kids engaged and they
 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:17.279
games so to keep kids engaged and they
they come out pretty complicated and

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:17.289
they come out pretty complicated and
 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:20.490
they come out pretty complicated and
pretty fun um as far as directly

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500
pretty fun um as far as directly
 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.920
pretty fun um as far as directly
actually going out and learning computer

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930
actually going out and learning computer
 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.770
actually going out and learning computer
science I think you have to get a little

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780
science I think you have to get a little
 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.730
science I think you have to get a little
creative in where you look for resources

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740
creative in where you look for resources
 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.920
creative in where you look for resources
because it can be taught a little dry

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930
because it can be taught a little dry
 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.619
because it can be taught a little dry
dry leaf um and I think that's why

00:07:34.619 --> 00:07:34.629
dry leaf um and I think that's why
 

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:35.999
dry leaf um and I think that's why
people get turned off because they're

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:36.009
people get turned off because they're
 

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:38.040
people get turned off because they're
not doing a full week-long of video

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.050
not doing a full week-long of video
 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.689
not doing a full week-long of video
games since their first assignment so I

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:39.699
games since their first assignment so I
 

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:41.430
games since their first assignment so I
actually would recommend looking for a

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440
actually would recommend looking for a
 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.379
actually would recommend looking for a
game development course or an app

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:43.389
game development course or an app
 

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:44.969
game development course or an app
development courses and those are

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:44.979
development courses and those are
 

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:46.950
development courses and those are
probably a good place to start rather

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960
probably a good place to start rather
 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.779
probably a good place to start rather
than straight up computer science I

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:48.789
than straight up computer science I
 

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:50.309
than straight up computer science I
think it might be more engaging way to

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319
think it might be more engaging way to
 

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:52.950
think it might be more engaging way to
learn gotcha and you actually had the

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960
learn gotcha and you actually had the
 

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.809
learn gotcha and you actually had the
the benefit of working with robots in

00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:54.819
the benefit of working with robots in
 

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:57.269
the benefit of working with robots in
some of the intro classes for computer

00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:57.279
some of the intro classes for computer
 

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:59.339
some of the intro classes for computer
science as well would you recommend that

00:07:59.339 --> 00:07:59.349
science as well would you recommend that
 

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:01.529
science as well would you recommend that

girls who code aspect of of your role
 

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.189
girls who code aspect of of your role
here what makes the curriculum of girls

00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:44.199
here what makes the curriculum of girls
 

00:08:44.199 --> 00:08:46.079
here what makes the curriculum of girls
who code different than a traditional CS

00:08:46.079 --> 00:08:46.089

education you touched a little bit on

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:47.860
education you touched a little bit on
 

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.590
education you touched a little bit on
this yeah

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600
this yeah
 

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.559
this yeah
there are two ways to look at it there's

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:52.569
there are two ways to look at it there's
 

00:08:52.569 --> 00:08:54.780
there are two ways to look at it there's
the actual content that we teach and

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:54.790
the actual content that we teach and
 

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.360
the actual content that we teach and
then there's the process by which we

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:57.370
then there's the process by which we
 

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.430
then there's the process by which we
deliver that content in terms of the

00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440
deliver that content in terms of the
 

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.530
deliver that content in terms of the
actual content that we teach it's very

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:01.540
actual content that we teach it's very
 

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.269
actual content that we teach it's very
similar to like the first two semester

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279
similar to like the first two semester
 

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:05.100
similar to like the first two semester
of college level computer science and

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.110
of college level computer science and
 

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.930
of college level computer science and
who said everything is done through a

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:06.940
who said everything is done through a
 

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.990

layout another layer and each week that

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000
layout another layer and each week that
 

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.910
layout another layer and each week that
layer changes so the first week the

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920
layer changes so the first week the
 

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.920
layer changes so the first week the
layer is video games the second week

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:13.930

appealing to anyone who has an interest
in any of those layers so if you're the

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:33.220
in any of those layers so if you're the
 

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.620

medicine or mobile applications you can
 

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:39.930
medicine or mobile applications you can
find how computer science can be

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:39.940

I think without that layer it can get

00:09:59.610 --> 00:09:59.620
I think without that layer it can get
 

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.889
I think without that layer it can get
dry and and it's important to have that

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:01.899
dry and and it's important to have that
 

00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:05.819
dry and and it's important to have that
on the other side you I think a lot of

00:10:05.819 --> 00:10:05.829
on the other side you I think a lot of
 

00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:08.569
on the other side you I think a lot of
computer science education right now is

00:10:08.569 --> 00:10:08.579
computer science education right now is
 

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:10.949
computer science education right now is
sort of like the way we learned math

00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959
sort of like the way we learned math
 

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:12.600
sort of like the way we learned math
like 50 years ago

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:12.610

have a set curriculum in terms of today
you're gonna learn about operators or

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:28.750
you're gonna learn about operators or
 

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.710
you're gonna learn about operators or
today you're gonna learn about boolean

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:31.720

our projects and the projects are
 

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.449
our projects and the projects are
designed to find those topics but the

00:10:39.449 --> 00:10:39.459
designed to find those topics but the
 

00:10:39.459 --> 00:10:41.160

girls will encounter them on their own

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.170
girls will encounter them on their own
 

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.840
girls will encounter them on their own
and actually look things up and learn

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:42.850
and actually look things up and learn
 

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.790
and actually look things up and learn
about them based on their own initiative

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800
about them based on their own initiative
 

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.689
about them based on their own initiative
which makes it a lot more fun you go out

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:48.699
which makes it a lot more fun you go out
 

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:50.280
which makes it a lot more fun you go out
to learn something because need it to

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:50.290
to learn something because need it to
 

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.199
to learn something because need it to
make that video game work it's a lot

00:10:52.199 --> 00:10:52.209
make that video game work it's a lot
 

00:10:52.209 --> 00:10:54.660
make that video game work it's a lot
more interesting than learning operators

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:54.670
more interesting than learning operators
 

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.220
more interesting than learning operators
for the sake of learning operators so

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:56.230
for the sake of learning operators so
 

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.340
for the sake of learning operators so
it's exploratory and experimental and

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:58.350
it's exploratory and experimental and
 

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.929
it's exploratory and experimental and
project-based the layers definitely

00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:00.939
