00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the kitchen where today

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.400
We are going to be boiling two different liquids to see what happens to them

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.600
I really don't know what's going to happen especially with the milk

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.000
I've seen the result of boiling down some soda it turns into this black

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.960
Goopy sludge that is mostly melted sugar with whatever other additives are inside some coca-cola, but milk

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.710
I don't know

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.210
I know there is condensed milk

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.990
And I don't know if that's just the same thing as boiling out some of the water

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.750
If there's anything added to that or taken away from it

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.500
and I'm also curious if boiling milk down until it's more of a

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.299
Sludge or even something dry and hard is part of the steps moving toward

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:41.600
Extracting the lactose from the milk. Lactose is one of the ingredients that we use when we make our

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.860
Homemade smoke powder and so I think it would be interesting if we can move toward getting all of those ingredients

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.579
From their original sources rather than just buying them from a chemical company

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.549
Let's take both of these liquids pour them into the pot

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.539
Throw them on the stove and see what happens if we boil away all of the water

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.239
Mmm, warm Cola, delicious

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.030
They say not to drink out of the carton, but no one else is gonna drink out of this, so it's only my germs

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.240
Both of these have

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.150
quite a bit of liquid in them and it's gonna take a long time for them to really heat up all the way so let's

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.039
give these, I don't know probably 15 minutes and start getting hot the plan is, once they both get to a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.290
rolling boil I will turn the heat down to something more of a simmer because I don't want either of them to boil over and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.899
I don't want either of them to burn as the liquid evaporates

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.569
Despite wanting to prevent any boil-overs by lowering the temperature

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.709
the milk still decided to expand in volume quite a bit and

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.739
Just boiled right over the sides of the pot. The soda really seems to be evaporating a lot faster than the milk

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.750
I'm not sure if the difference is just caused by the amount of heat or the different amount of surface area in the two different

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.229
Pots but the soda level has dropped considerably while the level of the milk seems like it's only gone down a little bit so far

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.289
The milk really likes to develop a skin on the top if it's not constantly being stirred

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.200
I don't know if that prevents it from losing any moisture at all, but it is interesting to watch it happen

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.540
There's also quite a buildup of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.160
Milk residue on the side of the pot that it's heating up in... gross.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.739
Our coca-cola has started to cook to a point that it can no longer really be described as coca-cola

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.119
Just a couple of minutes ago if I pass the spatula through it

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.700
You are able to see the white bottom of this pot

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.339
Now when I try and pass the spatula through it it seems that it's been stained dark brown or black

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.329
whatever this substance is it's very foamy and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.899
Lightweight and smells very little like coca-cola. I leaned over the pot and some of the steam got in my eyes

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.709
And that was very uncomfortable. Might be smoke more than steam at this point

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.389
I don't know if there's any liquid left in here burnt sienna colour paint almost

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.090
That looks like tar

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.539
Gross, hope this pot isn't ruined forever. It's a nice pot. Well here is what happens with our coca-cola

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.720
It is burned it is black

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.500
It is

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.799
Disgusting. it does not smell like coca-cola

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.619
The steam or smoke or whatever it is that's rising off of it is very painful if it gets in your eyes

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.029
Barely liquid. It's interesting how it keeps bubbling, like I flatten it down and just kind of

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.980
Re-inflates itself and I don't know where that's coming from I really don't think there's any carbon dioxide

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.620
left in this from the carbonation of the soda

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.849
But something keeps making it kind of inflate back up as it stays hot

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.309
I've I've run out of space to stretch. This is going over three feet

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.780
Maybe about four feet going from the pot up to the spatula which is touching the ceiling

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.119
As these cool off they get more brittle there you go. There's your there's your coca-cola right there. Just shards of crystalline

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.200
something

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.259
All right, let's see what this tastes like

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.589
That's just pure burned burned. It's just carbon. Ah oh that's bad

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.809
Don't eat that guys don't don't boil coca-cola down until it's a burn disgusting mess and then eat it

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.870
You'll regret it

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.410
Our milk is still boiling away on the stove because it has a tendency to boil over if the heat is really high

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.820
We've had to keep it on much lower heat, so it is taking quite a while to evaporate

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.990
our milk has now been boiling for quite a while several hours in fact and it's gotten to a point where the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.569
consistency and color have definitely changed

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.040
some of the color

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.349
Maybe because at times this has started to burn and we're getting a little bit of burned milk color in here

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.490
There's also a few little chunks of what I think have been the milk has it

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.069
Dehydrated on the side of the pot and then fell into the mixture if I scrape the spatula along the bottom

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.550
You can see what looks like

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.550
Just this weird

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.130
series of bubbles formed and

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.009
Anyone who has trypophobia is probably just gonna hate to look at that because it looks gross. I'll be honest

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.240
It's just really nasty looking. It smells bad. It doesn't smell like milk at all

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.749
It just it's just an indistinct something is burning smell

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.670
And I don't know if it's curdled or if that's just the bits that formed a skin on the top

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.679
And then I kept mixing them in and now there's not enough liquid for it to re-dissolve back in there

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.800
It's a lot thicker on the bottom than I thought it was too

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.800
I thought it was just like a super thin layer, but pretty thick

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.550
Layer and the bottom of it is just black already

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.739
I may someday want to try a different approach to this and instead of boiling off the water from the milk

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.950
just putting it in a dehydrator and letting that run for a day or

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.270
Several days until we've had all of the moisture leave the milk

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.700
But without the danger of burning or scalding it as we do so it's a sauce territory now

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.840
We've left

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.869
The drink category in and now deep into sauces and not good sauces either

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.180
I don't really want to but I feel like I have a duty to taste this stuff

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.460
Normally, I love milk. I'm not eager about this at all

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.220
(Mmm. Uh-uh.) I don't know how to describe that taste it doesn't taste like milk

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.120
It's not as pure burned flavor as the completely burned up coca-cola

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.089
Well, there's a little bit of the cheese flavor to it not like a lot

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.190
But a little bit of something it tastes kind of like cheese

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.749
But then mixed with burn not like the good kind of burnt cheese where you like fry it

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.389
And it gets a little bit crispy and that's really good. That's not this at this point. I'm probably gonna call this

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.619
I don't really want to keep going or I think I'll just do nothing but fill the kitchen with smoke

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:10.000
And it's gonna smell even worse that was milk. That was half a gallon of milk. I started out today wondering

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.389
What would happen if we boiled away all of the water in some coca-cola and some milk and the result for both of them is

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:17.259
very different

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:22.479
But they are both pretty gross it turns out drinks need to have their liquid in them

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:29.049
The coca-cola turned into a dark bubbly syrup, and then by pulling it out as it was kind of burning

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:36.460
We got these long fibrous strands that just sort of shatter into dust and then the milk turned into this

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:43.359
Orangey Brownish looking disgusting goop that I wouldn't really know how to describe that it's just like

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:52.899
Like if you blended up some meat and vegetables together, maybe just looks kind of like a vomit I guess hey, that's Pleasant

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:56.619
