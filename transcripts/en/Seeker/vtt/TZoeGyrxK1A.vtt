00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.650
As I get older it seems my well meaning aunts
always ask, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA HAVE A BABY?

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.960
You’re not gonna be young forever!

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.249
Well Aunt Gayle, I might not be young forever
but there is a way I could keep my eggs young

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:15.169
for quite some time.

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.700
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.850
Over 30 years ago doctors successfully grew
an embryo from a frozen egg.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.230
Back then it was considered experimental and
used for women who might undergo chemotherapy

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.080
or other medical procedures that might harm
their eggs.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.570
These women could freeze their eggs and use
them at a later date.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.930
Now it seems to be all the rage.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.530
Women delay pregnancy for all sorts of reasons,
like focusing on school or career or waiting

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.150
to settle down with someone.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.489
But they still worry about fertility, so now
the egg freezing trend is taking off.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.920
One egg freezing company hosted a cocktail
party in New York to advertize their business,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.630
and big tech companies like Apple gives its
employees up to 20,000 dollars towards egg

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.050
freezing as a health benefit.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.900
While it’s growing more common, it’s still
really expensive.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.309
It can take about $10,000 just to freeze your
eggs, then a few hundred bucks a year to store

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.200
them and a couple more thousand to thaw them
and undergo in vitro fertilization treatments.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.090
So it still remains a treatment for the wealthy.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.070
But besides the cost it’s a pretty intensive
process.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.320
It’s not like they just pluck out your eggs
and put them in a freezer.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.320
Nope.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.070
You have to take hormones for a few weeks
to stimulate the ovaries to release a few

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.070
eggs.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.660
Which can leave you feeling bloated and a
little off.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.799
You get regular check ups to see how the eggs
are coming along, then the procedure to remove

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.240
the eggs sounds not all that nice.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.970
It’s kind of like drawing blood.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.170
A needle has to pierce your vaginal wall and
reach the ovarian follicles and retrieve the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.170
egg.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.620
Okay Ouch.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.140
Once the eggs are removed they’re cooled
to sub zero temps and stored.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.280
But the freezing process does a bit of damage.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.470
It makes the shells harden, which can make
fertilization tricky.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.590
But using a technique similar to IVF, sperm
can be directly inserted into an egg, bypassing

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.590
the hardened shell.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.030
But since this whole thing is kind of new,
no one really knows how long eggs are good

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.030
for.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.540
Although, one clinic successfully used seven
year old eggs.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.790
The procedure can’t boast a high success
rate.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.800
According to the American Society for Reproductive
medicine one egg has a 2-12% chance that it

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.500
will develop into a fetus.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.980
So doctors recommend freezing a few eggs,
some women freeze a dozen or so for later

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.980
use.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.980
So with all the high cost and low chances,
why do people do it?

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.390
Freezing your eggs is a kind of pause on fertility.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.350
Women are born with all the eggs they’ll
ever have.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.040
They don’t produce them throughout their
lives like men produce sperm.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.049
So you use ‘em or you lose ‘em.

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.920
According to the American Society for Reproductive
medicine, women are most fertile in their

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.920
20s.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.650
Fertility declines gradually through the twenties
and thirties, but the decline picks up speed

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.650
as women enter their late thirties.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.540
As a woman ages she loses eggs through ovulation
or through a process called Atresia which

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.010
is the gradual loss of egg containing follicles.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.590
Even the eggs that remain degrade over time
and the risk of birth defects increases.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.980
By the time a woman is in her 40s only 10%
of her eggs are good and the chance of successfully

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.910
fertilization drops to below 5%.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.930
With chances this low, it’s no wonder women
hedge their bets by freezing their younger,

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.930
healthier eggs.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.019
While this might seem like a ladies only issue,
gentlemen, you shouldn’t wait to have kids

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.019
either!

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:21.269
Check out this video here to find out why.

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.450
Would you ever freeze your eggs?

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.110
