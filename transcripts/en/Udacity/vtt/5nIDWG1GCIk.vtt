00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In order to solve this problem, we're going to have to relate this new force.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The force of gravity within the earth's surface to a force we're more familiar with.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This Hooke's Law Force, the force exerted by a spring.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We know that with springs, the period is equal to

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
2π times the square root of the mass over the spring constant K.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But in this problem, we don't have a spring constant and we don't have a value for K,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but you'll know that by comparing our two equations here,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we can actually find something in this equation that looks a lot like K.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In this equation, the role of K is played by g&lt;i&gt;m/re.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We can call this new collection of constants Kg where Kg stands for our new "spring constant"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
with respect to this gravitational force, so now we can rewrite our equation

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
for the force of gravity within the earth as F equals Kg times the radius.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And now this equation looks exactly like this equation

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we can tell what the value of K in this equation for period should be.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We should just use our Kg value.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Okay, so now | can use this value of Kg gm/re as the value of K in my period equation like so,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and quite pleasantly, the mass terms here cancel, and this gives me this final equation

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
for the period of a person oscillating through the center of the earth,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that the period is equal to 2π&lt;i&gt;√g/re.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And I know all the values here and plugging it all those numbers,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I find that the period of this oscillation is equal to 83.8 minutes.

00:01:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you are able to get this value, congratulations!
