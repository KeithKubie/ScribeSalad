&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:22.590
[ Pause ]

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.890
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Hello, everyone.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.980
I'm Tomoko Steen at
the Science Technology

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.650
and the Business Division here
at The Library of Congress.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.890
Today's speaker, we have a
prominent speaker, and this is part

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.290
of the celebration of Asian
Pacific American Heritage Month.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.460 position:56%
So the co-sponsorship is Library of
Congress Asian American Association.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.750
I'm also Vice President
for that organization,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.810
and this works very well.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.250 position:56%
A wonderful speaker, Asian American,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.970
and a top speaker,
also in the Physics.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.940
Today's speaker, Dr. Gong Ping
Yeh, am I pronouncing it okay?

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.910
Is a world-renowned high energy
Physicist, which his lecture today,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.860
World Energy Transformation,
Asia and Beyond,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.450
will talk about sustainable energy
and improving energy efficiencies.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.540
So Dr. Yeh has been a high energy
Physicist at the Fermi National Lab

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.450
and he has been there since 1985,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.580
so he has been doing a very
prominent research there,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.620
as well as he's a member
of the Academia Sinica.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.450
And he's running around the
world explaining his research,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.950
while doing the research
at the same time.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.110
I'm not sure how he manages it.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.460
He has done Undergraduate Degree
at MIT and also a Master's Degree

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.830
at the Caltech and
also a Ph.D. at MIT

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.190
under Nobel Laureate
Gerald Friedman.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.130
Dr. Friedman is really a pioneering
American Physicist, as well.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:31.130
And we are lucky to have Dr. Yeh,
possible future Nobel Laureate,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.130 position:56%
and it's going to be an interesting
talk, beyond his physics background,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.390
energy, so he covers biofuel
to solar energy to wind,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.660
a variety of the energy,
and he is going to talk

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.570
about how we solve
this energy crisis.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.510
So, without further ado, please
join me in welcoming Dr. Yeh.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.590
[ Applause ]

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.330
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Good morning,
and thank you for the great honor

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.320
and special privilege of
sharing with you today one

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.590
of our greatest moments
in the human history.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:32.130 position:56%
We are transforming the world energy
to sustainable energy forever,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.820
so this is really a special
moment of human history.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.650
The 21st Century is the
Century of sustainable energy.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.800
It's the greatest human challenge

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.990
and the greatest human
opportunity and endeavor.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.810
The world energy consumption
is 15,000 gigawatts

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.950
or 15,000 billion watts,
giga means billion.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.230 position:56%
That's because we have seven billion
people on earth, on our blue planet,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:32.280
and - wait a minute, this is
not working all of a sudden.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.880
The forward isn't working.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.800
&gt;&gt; The space bar?

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.220
&gt;&gt; Let me go back.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:53.210
Okay, so because of
this 15,000 gigawatts,

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.810
that means we burn 10 billion
tons of carbon every year.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.920
The seven billion people burn 10
billion tons of carbon every year.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.220
What does that mean?

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.470
It means one million tons
every single hour of carbon

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.140
or equivalently four million
tons of CO2 every single hour.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.660
Now that was simple arithmetic.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.820
Now detailed scientific
studies show the same result,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.450
its 10 billion tons every year or
1.1 million tons every single hour.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:43.560 position:56%
This is the cube of 100 meters on
each side, and that's a million tons

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.380
of carbon, okay, a million
tons of coal or a million tons

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.740
of oil, a million tons of water.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:59.850
Now 100 meters is the length of a
football field plus an end zone.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:07.360
So imagine the length of a football
field plus an end zone long,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.260
the length of a football field plus
an end zone wide, and the length

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.870
of a football field plus an
end zone deep of oil or coal

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.400
and we burn that every single hour.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.730
In one hour humans will have burned
another million tons of carbon.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:36.580
The carbon comes from coal
and oil, gas and other things.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.240
And at this moment China is
responsible for 27%, US 15%.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.360
Okay, so to solve the world
energy challenge we also have

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.140
to solve the energy challenges
in China and India and the US

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.830
and every country worldwide.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:04.010
The green Pope actually is
Pope Benedict, and he approved

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:10.280
and have installed in the
Vatican City solar panels

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.570
on one of the buildings.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.830
And Pope Francis says we need to
care for our common home, okay?

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:28.400
So our Pope leaders are saying we
really need to solve this problem.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:36.180 position:56%
And recently the agreement in Paris
says every country should reduce CO2

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:46.530 position:56%
emissions, that's the promise, every
country should reduce CO2 emissions.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:53.920
The renewable energy percentage,
EU has a goal of 20% by 2020.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:02.510
Well, by 2015 they already achieved
15%, this is EU, so that's good.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:07.810
And the US is about 10%.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.460
So that's what we should
do, at least have 20%

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:17.920
from renewable energies by 2020
and then we can do 50% by 2050,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.360
so in this way we will solve
the world energy challenge.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.470
So what we should do is as much
renewable energies as possible,

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.020
wind, solar, biofuels,
ocean, they're all good

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.510
and improve energy
efficiencies, also important.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.610
For anybody or any country that
wants to use nuclear power,

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.340
nuclear power needs
fundamental changes.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:57.460
Energy fuels development, so
where it's dark means they have no

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.740
electricity, where it's
developed there is electricity

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.390
and so lit up at night.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.370
So 1.3 billion people on
earth have no electricity,

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:14.680
so about 600 million people in
Africa and 500, 600 million people

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.080
in Southeast Asia have
no electricity.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:27.400
If we help them get electricity
we will completely help the world,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.200
help Africa and Southeast
Asia and we help the world.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:36.320
And the good news is we can do
this in the next 10, 20 years.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.570
We will do this in
the next 10, 20 years.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.920
This is the IEA Study
that shows about half

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.210
of Africa have no electricity.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:52.060
It's a challenge, but it's
also a great moment for Africa.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.730
We will do this in
the next 10, 20 years.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:06.870
Cofean [Assumed Spelling] also
says in the Africa Progress Report

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:13.770
that by providing electricity we
will help Africa and the world.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:22.890
The United Nations and the World
Bank also strongly say that we need

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:29.430
to provide sustainable energy to
everybody on earth by 2030 or so.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.600
We want to thank the US
Government, the President,

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:40.880
the Congress for recently
having passed this Electrify

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.330
Africa Project.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:50.080
It will help 50 million people
in Africa have electricity

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.260
for the first time, in
the next five years.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:58.310
It's wonderful, thanks
to our Government.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:07.060
The IEA says by 2035, in
the next 20 years or so,

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:12.730
the world really should spend about
$2 trillion per year on new energy.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.620
Now with new technology
we can reduce this number,

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:20.130
so don't be scared
by the $2 trillion.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.880
However, if anybody who
just wants to make money,

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.440
that means it's the
greatest opportunity,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.520
right, $2 trillion per year.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.560
Actually, the world now in the
last few years we have been able

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:38.360
to invest about $300 billion
every year on new energy,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.490
renewable energy actually, okay?

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.110
So it's a great business
opportunity, as well.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:52.520
China invested about $100
billion, US about $50 billion,

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.430
India $5 billion, okay
- India $10 billion,

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.810
sorry, and Africa $5 billion.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.940
It also means jobs.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:07.140
In 2014 there were 7.7 million
jobs related to renewable energies.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:12.420
In the US alone was 724,000 jobs.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:18.660
Even Saudi Arabia says by 2050 only
about 15% of their energy will be

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.210
from fossil and it's new fossil

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.430
because the known ones
will have been used up,

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.410
it'll be new fossil,
15% of the energy.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:36.050
The rest, 85% comes from some kind
of nuclear and solar and wind.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.110
This is Saudi Arabia.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.710
Now just last month
Saudi Arabia announced,

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:52.080
the King announced a new Saudi
vision 2030 and they want to

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.930
and they need to transform
Saudi Arabia economy away

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.670
from dependence on oil.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:06.960 position:56%
The International Renewable Energy
Agency Headquarters is in Abu Dhabi.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.310
Now that's very interesting.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.120
The International Renewable
Energy Agency Headquarters

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.550
in the oil country.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:22.890
Okay, according to IRENA the world
renewable energy capacity now is

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.950
about 2,000 gigawatts.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:32.450 position:56%
Of the 15,000 that we consume,
2,000 now is from renewable energies

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.280
or at least the capacity is.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.650
So hydro is most of it, but
wind and solar are coming up.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:46.580
And last year alone the world
installed 35 gigawatts of hydro

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.230
and 63 gigawatts of
wind and 47 gigawatts

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.040
of solar in one year alone.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.780
That's probably equivalent
to electricity

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.420
from 50 new nuclear power plants.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.480
So from the renewables now
every year we can add equivalent

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.640
to 50 new nuclear reactors
of electricity.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:19.710 position:56%
So the world wind power capacity now
is 430 gigawatts, and we can add 50,

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.670
60 gigawatts per year easily, okay?

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.580
So last year the world
added 63 gigawatts.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.700
And China alone added 32 gigawatts,

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.090 position:56%
about half of the world's wind power
was added last year was in China.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:43.650
Some other countries could
add a lot more, much more.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:50.530
The US did pretty well, so
the US added 8.6 gigawatts.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:58.210
This is the total, in
China, total wind power

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:03.380
in China is 145 gigawatts,
and in the US 75 gigawatts.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.760
So this is the distribution.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:14.370
So China, Asia is doing well,
but it's mostly in China.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.500 position:56%
The rest of Asia could do much more.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.770
And the US is doing well.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:28.250
Solar energy, if we cover
1% of the world's land

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:34.570
with solar panels it could provide
30,000 gigawatts, twice the amount

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:41.850
of energy consumed by humans, okay?

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:47.520
So this is in Japan, and
when I fly between Tokyo

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.260
and Taipei I see this outside.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.520
This was built in one year,
70 megawatts by one company

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.830
in one year, can build this.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.910
Actually, many stadiums in
the world, including the US,

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.910
have solar panels on
top, and this one is

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:11.010
in Taiwan it's powered
10% by solar panels.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:16.710
And when the stadium is not being
used the electricity can be used,

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.110
put onto the grid.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:26.740
Sports stadium are a good place
to put solar panels, okay?

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:32.540
So the solar power is
expected to grow quickly

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.690
in the next five years
in many countries.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:43.680
By 2020 the world should have
about 400 gigawatts of solar panel.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:51.570
So China is adding a lot of solar
panels, so is the US, Japan, India.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:58.100
Actually, an easier way
is just solar hot water,

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:03.190
and even in Minnesota
they have solar hot water

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:08.570
in the downtown St. Paul, okay?

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.210
The easiest way to use solar
energy is just solar hot water,

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.700
it's more efficient,
it's about 50% efficient.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:23.340
So the world has 400 gigawatts
of solar thermal heating.

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:33.320
China alone in 2015 added
14.9 gigawatts of hydro,

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.910
32 gigawatts of wind,
18 gigawatts of solar.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:43.500
So actually China is now the world
leader of renewable energies.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.040
Unfortunately, China also added
six gigawatts of nuclear power

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.080
and 71 gigawatts of coal.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.180
We need to change that.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:06.830
Japan, Prime Minister Koizumi, put
into law, it's called Cool Biz.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.930
So when you go to Japan June

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.450
to September you don't
have to wear a suit.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.840
So they raised the
temperature a little bit,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:22.240
just by that alone they saved
electricity 1% in Japan.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:31.220 position:56%
Now after March 11th the 54
reactors is reduced, were shut down,

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.970
and now only two are operating.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:41.500
And Cool Biz became Super Cool Biz,
now from May until October 31st

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:47.600
when you go to Japan you don't
have to wear a suit by law, okay?

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.500
Now also in the last three years
Japan added 27 gigawatts of solar

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:59.680
and then Japan is in the process
of electricity deregulation,

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.950
so that's great, the open market
instead of just monopolies.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:11.370
And Japan has tremendous, has good
wind power potential, as well.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:16.630
Japan should be able to add
tens of gigawatts wind power.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.400
For example, Japan, South Korea

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:26.330
and Taiwan all have tremendous
offshore wind power potential,

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.160
and these countries should
use offshore wind power

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.520
as soon as possible.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:38.930
Taiwan, the people of Taiwan
just elected a new President

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:43.290
and new Congress, it
actually is the Green Party.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.560
So Taiwan, starting May 20th,

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:54.270
is going to greatly change its
energy policies, that's great.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:20:04.340
South Korea also has a national
statement policy to achieve 11%

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:11.950
by 2035 of energy coming
from renewables.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.020
We should be able to do better
than this, with new technology

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:23.150
and some thinking we should
be able to do better than 11%.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.600
Even in Southeast Asia
there have been discussion

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:33.580
of towards low carbon
by 2050 in Asia Pacific.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:39.920
Now IEA Study announced last year,
they said if we just do business

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.890
as usual this is what
it's going to look like.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:49.030
So although the renewables
is increasing gas,

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:56.850
oil and coal increased even more,
but this is business as usual

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.380
and I don't - I'm sure that we're
not going to be doing business

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.770
as usual, so this will be changed.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:10.690
For example, Southeast
Asia also has lots of sun,

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.610
especially in the dry season.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.010
They should just be
using solar, okay?

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.250
So for all of you that are from
Southeast Asia please tell them

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:29.290
to use solar and there
are other things.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:33.070
For example, the Pacific
Island nations,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.730
until recently they only had
a small amount of renewables,

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.560
but because they heard about, hey,
wait a minute, the solar power is

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:46.700
so good now, so they are
completely changing to renewables,

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.210
all the Pacific Island countries.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:55.520
In Hawaii, Hawaii says they're
going to have 100% of their energy

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:02.000
from renewables by
2045 or 70% by 2030.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.990
Until a few years ago 98% of
Hawaii's energy was imported oil,

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.840
okay, so Hawaii is
completely changing.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.330
It's wonderful, it's
going to be clean Hawaii.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.950
And Okinawa and Hawaii
are very close,

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.900
they have a very close
relationship, and recently thanks

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:26.750
to Ambassador Caroline Kennedy
the agreement between Hawaii

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:33.610
and Okinawa is extended,
so that's great.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:40.610
Most people know for lighting
we should just switch to LEDs

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.630
because LEDs are at least
five times more efficient

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:49.240
than incandescent lights, so we
should all change to LEDs as much

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:55.000
as possible, saves
electricity and it's brighter.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.080
And our Administration,
our leaders push

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:05.210
for doubling the fuel efficiency
of cars and that's great,

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.090
the more we do the better.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:17.250
In the US there are 764 companies
or governments or organizations

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:23.030 position:56%
that are already 100% powered by
renewable energies, including Intel,

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:29.530
Microsoft, Apple, City of Dallas
and the City of Washington,

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:39.350
D.C. And the NHL, the NHL has
the 100% renewable energy credit.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.970
And Carnegie-Mellon
University, for example.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:46.260
See, so if you want
to do it you can,

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.370
you can have your electricity
100% from renewables now.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:24:01.350
Maybe The Library of Congress
can be 100% powered by it, okay?

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:07.470
So US added 75 gigawatts
of wind power last year.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:10.500
We can easily do this again.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:15.780
Oh, sorry, the total
is 75 gigawatts.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.430
The Midwest has tremendous
wind power potentials,

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:24.710
and this is the wind capacity.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:29.700
Actually, Texas has 17 gigawatts
in wind power, Texas is the leader

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:35.060
of wind power in the US as
far as the amount installed.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:42.900
But Iowa, the small State, actually
has the most wind power per capita.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:49.670
So 31% of Iowa's electricity last
year came from wind power, okay?

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:58.770
But the US, even including
Iowa, we have only installed 1%

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:05.310
of our potential, so wind power
in the US can be much more.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.610
We probably could be,

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:12.510
the US probably could be
powered by wind power alone.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:18.820 position:56%
The former Secretary of the Interior
says the wind power off the East

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.190
Coast offshore could
replace most of the coal

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.980
that we use, just the
offshore alone.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:33.880
Now when we talk about renewable
energies there's always a question

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.190
about the electricity storage.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.950
Well, there's several ways, for
example, you can use battery

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:43.260
or you could use renewable
energy to make hydrogen,

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.670
or you can use pump hydro, you pump
up the water into a higher level

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:51.750
and then when you need it
you use the water, okay?

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:55.430
So, for example, this is just
using battery in the Ohio,

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:58.570
it's 40 megawatts, it's doable.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:03.170
You can store electricity
if you wanted.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:08.740
So Tesla is spending,
investing $5 billion

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:13.940
into this new giga factory
to make batteries, okay?

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.580
By doing so the more the
world produces batteries,

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.880
the lower the price will become.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:26.660
So this is the projection,
right now it's more expensive,

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:31.020
but the more we use it the lower
the price it will be, okay?

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.950
So batteries is one
of the solutions.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.580
Another one is to use wind or
solar power to make hydrogen,

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.930
so the National Renewable
Energy Lab is studying this,

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.660
but actually it's already
done in Germany.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.250
This is using wind
power to make hydrogen,

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:53.970
and then you can use hydrogen
whichever way you want it.

00:26:53.970 --> 00:27:00.740
The US has also tremendous
solar power potential.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:07.340
Again, this is downtown
Minnesota, convention center on top

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.100
of convention - actually, on top

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.230
of convention centers is a
great places for solar panels.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:19.370
So Orlando Convention Center also
has megawatts of solar power.

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:25.320 position:56%
Or airports, even airports are great
places for putting solar panels.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.320
The US Military is
actually the leader

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:36.750
of renewable energies
in the US, okay?

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:44.000
It's better to use solar panels
than deliver fuel, for example.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Actually, US Military also has
this net zero policy for US bases,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.650 position:56%
the US Military would like US
Military bases to be independent of,

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.060
to be energy independent.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.590
So we all know that the
solar panels have been coming

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:09.790
down in price dramatically
every year.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:16.030
So in the last year the new
installations of energy in the US,

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:25.080 position:56%
39% is actually wind power and
about 29% was gas and 29% was solar.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.460
Last year the new energy added was

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:35.240
about one-third each
wind, solar and gas.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.880
No other sources.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:47.490
Okay, so this is the
US solar installations.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.170
Because the price is going
down, so you see the quick rise

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:55.190
of solar power in the US,
also, but it's a quick rise

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.820
of solar power worldwide,
actually, okay,

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.300
because the price keep coming down.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:07.440
And this is the ranking
of solar power by state.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.750
California is by far the leader,

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:14.040
about half of the US solar
power is now in California.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.190
Amazingly, North Carolina

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:20.610
and Massachusetts are
also among the top.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.010
Now the Sunshine State,

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:28.320
if the Sunshine State used more
solar power they can save billions

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:35.280
every year, and also New Mexico.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.190
Another great place
to put solar panels

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:46.280
and the solar charging is
just parking lots, okay?

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:51.110
All parking lots pretty much
are a potential great places

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:55.350
for installing solar power
and electrical charging.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:30:04.620
And some viewers even
provide free solar charging.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:11.820
Now FedEx, UPS, DHL all have
electric trucks for delivery.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:20.800
US Postal Service seems
to be a great place,

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:28.910
great to have the US
Postal trucks electric,

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.710
they could be powered
by the sun or the wind.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:38.230
They don't go very far every day,
okay, so it's easy to charge them.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:43.360
So US Postal trucks should
all be electric, I think.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.760
Also, school buses, they don't
go very far either every day,

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.250
so most of them are
just sitting around

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.870
and travel a short
distance every day.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.470
Perfect for using electric.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:03.580
Actually, all transportation
could be electric, buses,

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:08.630
boats, golf carts, ideal.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:14.800 position:56%
The US has already more than 30,000
charging stations and there are apps

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.660 position:56%
on the internet, web, you can find
out where the charging stations are.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.270
And actually I think smart cars
should have them on the board,

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.940
on the dashboard, and
it'll just tell you, hey,

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:30.210
you are 20% remaining
electricity, you should turn right

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.190
and go and get charged up.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:38.300 position:56%
So electrically charging up electric
cars is also not a problem now.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:43.670
in Estonia, for example, they have
a couple hundred fast charging

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:48.980
stations, so you can just charge
it up and it's 100% renewable,

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.630
90% of it just from the wind, okay?

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:58.380
And this has happened in many
countries, also, the Netherlands

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.460
and Germany even where there's
not really much sun actually,

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.870
but they have a lot of solar power.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:08.460 position:56%
For example, a small startup company

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:13.720
in Chicago is starting 3,000
solar charging stations in Jordon

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.560
and are exporting to
other countries.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:23.970
Now there's another thing
called supercapacitors,

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.570
and it works like lightning.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:30.010
If we want to charge
the electric vehicles,

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.480
you wanted to charge
them fast, right?

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.820
You don't want it to take too long.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.900
So you want some fast
way of charging it.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:44.650 position:56%
Well, capacitors charge and
discharge very fast, like lightning,

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.020 position:56%
but you need large areas to do this,

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:53.050
so they use [inaudible]
material to have huge surface.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:58.420
So a small amount, a gram

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:03.760
of [inaudible] material has the
surface of a football field.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:10.860
So then you're going to
have electric buses charged

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.310
up at one bus station in 30
seconds and enough electricity

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:18.840
to go another couple bus stops.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.250
So it goes to one, and the
next bus stop it gets charged

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.760
up again in 30 seconds.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.930
It goes to another stop and gets
charged up again in 30 seconds.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:33.380
So you can charge your buses
this way, as well, all electric.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.720
And Korea is making
progress in this.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:43.500
And also there are some electric
buses in Italy and other countries.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:49.670 position:56%
Biofuels, there's wood pellets,
some countries use it and it's good,

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:56.500
at least close to carbon neutral,
so it's also fast growing.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:00.370
Ethanol and biodiesel
are also growing.

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:07.600 position:56%
And recently, just recently in the
last years, now you can make ethanol

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.820
from cellulosic ethanol
from grass or corn stover.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:16.230
So you don't have to
make it from food,

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:21.900 position:56%
you don't want to make it from food.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:30.540
In fact, United Airlines and others
have already started using bio jet

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:37.680
fuel, okay, and this has been
tested by Boeing, Airbus, Military.

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:43.540
So in the future when we need more
jet fuel we can use bio jet fuel.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.810
For hydro, hydro is actually
good if you do it right.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.190
It don't hurt the environment,

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:53.830
but then you can provide
constant electricity.

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.450
So hydro is actually
good if you do it right.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:01.370
So the world is also building
hydro and its good, for example,

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:05.750
for Africa, as well,
and South America.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:12.990
This one shows the cost of
electricity, 2010 and 2014.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:17.310
You see that the prices is coming
down even between 2010 and 2014,

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:22.580
and wind power, hydro, geo,

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:29.090
bio they're already the
level or cheaper than coal.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:40.220
The lowest price electricity in
the US now is actually wind power.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.070
So the percentage of world
electricity about 22% is

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:51.810 position:56%
from renewables now of which about
4% of the world's electricity now is

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:55.880
from wind and only about
1% is from the solar,

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.970 position:56%
but it's growing, those are growing.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:06.990 position:56%
There's also ocean energy in various
forms, in waves, currents, okay?

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:12.230
So remember the energy is
proportional to the density,

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:18.410
and the water density is
about 800 times air density,

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:29.080 position:56%
so even a small turbine in the water
can provide you lots of it actually.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:35.900
Regarding nuclear power, we all
know about the nuclear crisis,

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:40.310
there are about 400
reactors in the world

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:51.750
and they provide 336 gigawatts,
which is about 10.8% or 11%

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.540
of the world's electricity.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.230
So the 400 reactors in the
world provide about 11%

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.860
of the world's electricity.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:04.260
That means the 400 reactors

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.910
in the world provide 2.6%
of the world's energy.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:16.050
So all the reactors in the world
reduce carbon emissions by 2.6%.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:24.020
If we turn them all off the carbon
emissions will go up by 2.6%.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.980
This shows the startup
and the shutdown

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:31.100
of nuclear reactors in the world.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.870
The average age of all reactors
in the world is 29 years

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:39.060
and the average age of the
99 reactors in the US is 35.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.020
They are designed for 40 years.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:50.010
So it is expected that the number
of reactors in the world will go

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.560
down in the next 10, 20 years.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.360
In the next 10 years about
100 will be decommissioned.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.230
In the next 20 years about
200 will be decommissioned.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.460
The single place that's
increasing the number

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.540
of nuclear reactors is China.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:15.260
So nuclear power has five
fundamental challenges - safety,

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.350
nuclear waste, weapons
proliferation,

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:22.500
the cost, and sustainability.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:29.050
As I said earlier, the world
should use as much renewable energy

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:33.830
as is possible, but the
nuclear power if anybody wants

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:38.600
to use it it has to be changed.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.430
This is a molten salt reactor,

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.780
it was done in the
Oak Ridge National Lab

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.190
in the '60s, actually also '50s.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:54.400
It uses liquid instead of solid
fuel, so you can drain a liquid

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.670
if anything happens or you can
just put a small amount of liquid

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:02.320
in there at a time, so
you reduce the probability

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.870
of nuclear problem, safety problem.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:11.840 position:56%
And also if you use thorium, thorium
doesn't do anything by itself,

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:15.140
you have to give it neutrons
for the process to go.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:21.130
To use thorium for energy you
have to provide the neutrons.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:26.340
You can stop the neutrons and then
the process will stop so it's safe.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:32.700 position:56%
If we want to use more nuclear power
we have to make sure it's 100% safe.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:38.510
There's a study in Japan that shows

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:41.950
that if Fukushima were
using thorium instead

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:46.900
of uranium there would have been
no other problems except some heat

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.220
to get rid of.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.640
You wouldn't have the
radiation problem,

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:57.770 position:56%
you wouldn't have the explosion, you
wouldn't have any of these problems.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:03.280
Also, because it's LM90
instead of 92, okay,

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.720
it's more difficult to make bombs.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.520
You could still do it, but it's
more difficult to make bombs

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.450
and if you make bombs with it
it would be more detectable

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:15.170
because there will be
some uranium 232 there

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:22.770
and it will give you signals, that
people are trying to make bombs.

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:30.080
And because it's LM90 the nuclear
waste amount will be 10,000 times

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:34.630
smaller, so instead of 10 times you
get a kilogram, and the half-life

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:37.850
of that is about hundreds
of years instead of millions

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:40.830
or hundreds of thousands of years.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:45.140
So you also have much less
manageable nuclear waste problem

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.420
just by doing, just by
switching to thorium.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:55.440
So, of course, it's also
a form of nuclear energy,

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:01.500
so a handful of it has the same
energy as 230 train cars of coal.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:06.240
A small amount of thorium
can provide the same energy

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.480
as 230 train cars of coal.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:15.150
So it has lots of energy.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:23.910
And the world can already have
six million, seven million tons

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:28.400
of thorium at the very low price,
so there's a tremendous amount

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.560
of thorium available worldwide.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.790
So if we switch to thorium we
can provide the world energy

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:43.770
for thousands of years safely
and very little nuclear waste

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:47.570 position:56%
and less problem of nuclear weapons.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.360
Now so China wants
this and they know

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.760 position:56%
that they need technical assistance,
so they actually asked the US

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.580
to help, so the US is
actually partnering with China

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:05.140
on this molten salt and
thorium energy technologies.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:10.640
India says, hey, we have lots
of thorium, we should switch

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.830
to thorium power, as well.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.480
So actually India already
has designed,

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.770 position:56%
completed design of thorium reactor.

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:26.710
And actually in the US there
are a whole bunch of companies

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.780
that are doing development

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:34.560
for molten salt reactors
and thorium energy.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:42.370
So UK a few months ago announced
they are investing 250 million

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:46.540
pounds over the next five
years to develop advanced

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.230
or a new type of reactor.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:58.160
In the US the DoE also in the last
few months announced the US is also

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.020
investing into two companies

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:05.490
to develop this new reactor
in the next few years.

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:14.890 position:56%
In fact, the US DoE also established
a new department or agency

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:19.840
to help bring about this
new technology faster.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.230
Yes?

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:26.250
&gt;&gt; On your previous slide
it mentions pebble bed.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:27.550
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.580
&gt;&gt; Is that different
compared to molten salt?

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:37.830
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: It's a different
form, it's pebbles, it's different

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:44.540
from - the question is is pebble
bed different from the molten salt?

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.840
Yes, it is.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.820
The molten salt is liquid and
the pebble bed is little pebbles,

00:43:49.820 --> 00:44:01.920 position:56%
but it's some uranium and then some
thorium together, blanket, and okay?

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:10.770
Now thorium, okay, the neutron
cross sections or the probability

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:15.660
of thorium doing something
varies according to the energy

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.870
of the neutrons that are given.

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:21.790
Most reactors operate in
the lower energy region

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:24.520
and this is what it is, okay?

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:29.060
The nuclear reactors operate at
this lower energy region, actually.

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:34.770
But if you go to a higher energy
then you can actually break apart,

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:38.240
called fission, real fission,
break apart the nucleus.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:44.230
Actually, it's typical
of all heavy elements.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:48.660
In the lower energy region
the reactors operate in here,

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:54.240
but for thorium and
the 238 if you go

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.130
to higher energies you can
do the complete fission,

00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:58.480
break up the nucleus.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.580
Now this may sound a
little complicated,

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.410
but I'll explain it to
you, it's very easy.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:09.790
So Europe has a project to
say let's use an accelerator

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:16.130
to produce the neutrons and to have
thorium energy or other things.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:22.920
Well, in fact, the Oak Ridge
National Lab already has an

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.620
accelerator, that's pretty good.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.140
We need to make it more
intense, but it's pretty good.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:34.970
And Oak Ridge has been using
this accelerator for some time.

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:41.210
Europe is building a new
accelerator as we speak right now.

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:45.750
So this is their schedule.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:50.160
It will be done in
the next few years.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:03.580
And China also has a plan to
build accelerator driven system,

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.500
and India also.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.670
And Russia says, hey, we have an
old accelerator, we can convert it.

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:16.820
So you see several
countries want to do this.

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:27.650
In fact, in the US the DoE
sponsored and there's a statement,

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:33.590
accelerators for America's future,
accelerators can shrink tumors,

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:38.360
produce clean energy and
reduce nuclear waste.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:47.180
Now in the US we actually invented
using protons or heavy ions

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:52.430
to treat tumors, also
neutron therapy, okay?

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:58.710
This was built by Fermilab
and this was at Fermilab.

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:00.680
So this is neutron
therapy, for example,

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:05.130
tumors and you just shoot neutrons
at it and destroy the nucleus

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:09.250
of the tumor cells and
you cure the person.

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:11.830
Okay, this is a large tumor
here, these is a hand,

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:17.220
so there's a huge tumor and
you just shoot neutrons at it,

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.410
two minutes a day,
three times a week

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.900
and four weeks later
you cure the person.

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:29.200
So it's neutron therapy, use
neutrons to break up the nucleus.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:37.430
Well, neutron therapy can
solve the nuclear problem.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:40.970
We use the nuclear reactors,
these are the wastes,

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:42.940
the high level nuclear waste.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.080
And if you don't treat it,

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:51.400
if you just bury it underground
it can last for millions of years.

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:59.450
This will be the radiation
for a million years

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:04.300
if you just bury it underground,
if you don't actually treat it.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.780
Even the former Energy
Secretary, Steven Chu,

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:13.790
said nobody has really solved
the nuclear waste problem.

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:17.730
Well, we actually could do it.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:23.320
Now this I showed you earlier, that
if you have MeV neutrons or 10,

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:29.460
20 MeV neutrons you can break up
the nucleus of heavy elements.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:37.270
The ordinary reactors operate in
this range, but there's a type

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:42.370
of reactor that's been talked
about and being developed,

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:45.520
it's called fast reactors,
they operate in this range.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:49.180
But if you use the accelerator

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:53.930
to provide the neutrons it's
even higher, so it's even better,

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:56.240
and you can absolutely control it,

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.200
you can turn it off
anytime you want.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.970
So absolute safety.

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:06.480 position:56%
So there have been US studies, also,

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.670
that says you can transmit
nuclear waste.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:15.770
These are fission products, you
can actually break them apart.

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:18.670
And this is just using
the fast reactors.

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:24.040
If you use the accelerator
system it'll be even better.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.860
In Japan they have studied this.

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.860
See, again, using the accelerator,
and this is nuclear waste,

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:34.620
they can use nuclear waste as
fuel to produce electricity,

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:38.310
at the same time destroy
the nuclear waste.

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:42.190
So Japan estimates they need
about four of these systems

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:44.240
because they have 40 reactors now.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:51.570 position:56%
And you can shorten the half-life of
nuclear waste from millions of years

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:57.750
to thousand or hundred or even
15 years if you use the neutrons

00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:00.640
to break up the nuclear waste.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:08.240
The European study also says
if you use the accelerator,

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.390
provide fast neutrons, you can
reduce the amount of nuclear waste

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:17.260
and you can shorten the
half-life of the nuclear waste.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.280
So because of development

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.490
in the accelerators now we
can have this accelerator,

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:26.820
we can build it now.

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.380
It's available, if we just build
these accelerators we can take care

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.020
of these problems.

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:36.410
The technology we have now.

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:47.730
Okay, so we can and we will
solve the world energy challenge

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:51.210
through renewable energies
as much as possible,

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:55.830
improve energy efficiencies, and if
anybody wants or any country wants

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:57.660
to use nuclear power we need

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:02.460
to change nuclear power
fundamentally, totally.

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:09.720 position:56%
By doing this we can have 20% of the
world energy coming from renewables

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:16.400
by 2020, 30% by 2030, and
more than 50% by 2050.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:25.730
We will transform the world
energy in the next decades.

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:27.530
Thank you very much.

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:33.980
[ Applause ]

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.430
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Any questions?

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:37.730
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes?

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:41.930
&gt;&gt; Is the concept of
energy from fusion,

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:44.380
is that considered a dead end then?

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:48.180
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: So the question
is is the concept of fusion

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:53.630 position:56%
as energy is it - what's the status?

00:51:53.630 --> 00:52:01.780
Well, the experts of fusion says
it's probably 50 years away.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.490
So we can't wait that long.

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:10.180
We will solve the world
energy challenges by then.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.480
Yes?

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.020
&gt;&gt; What about hydrogen?

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.570
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: What
about hydrogen?

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:21.660
The hydrogen, we've been talking
about that, as well, for decades,

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:27.940
and the thing is to deploy it,
well, you need hydrogen stations,

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.550
you need hundreds of thousands
of these hydrogen stations.

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:32.850
So it's coming along.

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:37.050
Japan, especially, has been
promoting hydrogen, but it's going

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:41.200
to take decades when it comes.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.500
It's one of the forms.

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.890
I showed you earlier that we can
use wind power and solar power

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:48.800
to produce hydrogen, then
that's absolutely clean.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.580
If you just get the hydrogen

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:53.810
from natural gas it's not
all that clean, right?

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:59.550
You're still using natural gas, but
you could do that using solar power

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:01.160 position:56%
and wind power to make the hydrogen.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:05.060
So it's coming, but it will
be one of the solutions.

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.360
Yes?

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:11.580
&gt;&gt; I want to say that sometimes
we go to the beach by Ocean City

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:14.320 position:56%
and so along the highway this summer

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.850
for the first time I
saw a solar installation

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:22.460
that I think is maybe 40 or
60 acres, and to think of that

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.880
in Maryland was just a
different thing for me.

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.180
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.810
&gt;&gt; Thinking of Arizona
and California,

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:34.460
but to see that in Maryland
it really was a real thing

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.460
that was happening,
it was different.

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:38.760
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.060
Thank you.

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:42.950 position:56%
So your statement was that it's nice

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:45.940
to see solar panels
even in Maryland.

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:47.240
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.540
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:54.590
Now when I showed that even
Washington, D.C., we use -

00:53:54.590 --> 00:54:01.940
the Government of Washington,
D.C. use a lot of wind power.

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.370
And solar power, actually
the entire,

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:09.160
almost the entire US has good
potentials for solar power, okay?

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:14.270
So in the list that I showed you
Massachusetts uses more solar power

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:17.330
than Florida.

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:22.860
So really we need to get
Florida to use solar power.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:26.240
It can save Florida billions
of dollars every year,

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:33.320
instead of buying coal or
buying oil, other energies,

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:38.640 position:56%
Florida can save billions of
dollars by switching to solar power.

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.820
Any other questions?

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.900
Yes?

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.170
&gt;&gt; In your presentation
you discussed briefly

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:52.370
about how you might be able to take
care of energy needs in Africa.

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:53.670
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:54.970
&gt;&gt; Within 10, 15 years.

00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:56.270
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

00:54:56.270 --> 00:55:01.190
&gt;&gt; Now similar issues are also
relevant in South Asia ...

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:02.490
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:05.000
&gt;&gt; ... where high proportions
of families rely

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.970
on solid fuel, like cooking.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.270
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:12.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; They're looking at populations
that rely on solid fuel for cooking.

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:14.500
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:21.270
&gt;&gt; And they're dying to get moved
to clean energy, but it's easier

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:23.950
for to take care of
their energy needs.

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:25.610
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:29.530
&gt;&gt; Can you say a little
more about your thought

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:32.420
on how you might be able
to take care of Africa,

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.010
as well as in South Asia?

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.310
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Okay.

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:37.610
&gt;&gt; The needs are for
solid fuel for cooking.

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:39.170
I'm looking at women's -

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:42.920
the resources that women
have to put together.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.220
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.520
Thank you.

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.820
Thank you.

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:54.250
So the question and comment is
we can potentially help Africa

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.940
and Southeast Asia ...

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.240
&gt;&gt; South Asia.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.540
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: ...

00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:02.060
South Asia move to renewable
energy, especially solar,

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:04.550
in the next 10, 20 years.

00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:09.760
So how best to do this, right?

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:16.480
Yes, so as I said earlier, that
the Africa and Southeast Asia

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.490
about 600 million people in
Africa and about 500 million,

00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:23.660
600 million people in Asia
and India have no electricity

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:27.380
and they burn solid fuels.

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:32.600
So what we need to do is to let
people know, let the Government

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:37.920
and the people in South Asia and
Africa - Africa has so much sun,

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:45.380
okay, or the countries, those
central Asia countries also,

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:48.740
so many countries in the
world, including South Asia,

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:51.610
they have so much solar
power potential.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:56.030 position:56%
And it's probably because they don't
know about it or they don't know how

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:59.460
to finance it, that's
slowing them down.

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:05.250
So there are different models
to finance this, you know.

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:11.540
Solar City is a great example,
in the US, when people say, oh,

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:16.170 position:56%
solar panels are too expensive, they
say, oh, you don't have to buy it,

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:19.680 position:56%
just lease it, let me just put solar
panels on top of your roof, okay?

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:23.350
And then 10 years from
now it is yours,

00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:27.110
and you pay electricity
lower than what you pay now.

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:35.170 position:56%
We'll put solar panels on top of
your roof, you pay electricity lower

00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:38.770
than what you pay now, and then 10
years from now the system is yours.

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:41.280
You get your electricity for free.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:46.010
So we need to explain to
people the different models

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.050
in adding renewables.

00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:54.440
Most people in the world don't know
and even the Governments don't know

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:57.030
and they don't know how
to do it or they don't -

00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:01.810
sometimes they need some
help, also, but we can do it,

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:04.500
we can do it in the
next 10, 20 years.

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Any more questions?

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:07.800
I have one question.

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.100
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes?

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.580
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Could you
tell me the differences

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:15.020
between an accelerator,
small nuclear reactor

00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:16.790
and the big nuclear reactor?

00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:19.070
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Okay,
so for the small ones

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:20.740
if you want just 50 megawatts

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.870
or 100 megawatts you don't
need an accelerator to do that,

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:26.810
you don't want that because
an accelerator costs some.

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:32.530
So for small ones just
through molten salt

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:36.070
or switching to thorium, okay?

00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:41.640
There you need to reprocess to
get the neutrons to continue.

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:46.060
So for those small ones
you need the reprocessing.

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:50.260
For the accelerator one you
don't need the reprocessing,

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:53.290
you now have the neutrons
anytime you want

00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:55.570
so you don't need the
reprocessing, okay?

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:58.280
So that's the beauty
of the accelerators,

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.740
but for the accelerators
it's better for large scale,

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:03.490
like the gigawatts scale.

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:07.470
So for the large reactors, large
system, use the accelerators,

00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:09.680
but for small ones
all over the place,

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:15.610 position:56%
all over the world use molten salt
thorium, you still have a little bit

00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:21.310
of waste, you need reprocessing
to get the neutrons, that's all.

00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:22.990
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Price?

00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:26.540
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: You want
me to give you a cost?

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:29.810
Okay, is this recorded?

00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:35.410
[laughter] Okay, now because you're
now doing a much safer system,

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:38.850
an absolutely safe system,

00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:43.630
so you don't need five different
layers of safety protections.

00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:49.110
So the cost is actually lower
than your nuclear reactors now.

00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:53.400
So the average cost of a gigawatts
reactor now in the world is

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:56.700
about $5 billion, $6 billion.

00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:01.580
If you change to the new system
maybe $2 billion, $3 billion.

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.590
You actually lower the cost.

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:05.890
Yes?

01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:07.740
&gt;&gt; Just to clarify, are you saying

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:12.830
that the thorium reactor has less
stringent [inaudible] requirements?

01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.130
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes.

01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:15.430
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:16.730
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes, it's safe.

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:18.950
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to
make sure I understood.

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:22.130
&gt;&gt; Gong Ping Yeh: Yes, it's
safe and it's less waste,

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:26.470
so you don't need all those
extra five layers of protection

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:30.140
that are even not good enough.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:35.720
Yes, that's what I'm
saying, it's safe.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:42.210
And for nuclear power we need
to solve those five challenges -

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:47.970
safety, nuclear waste, weapons,
cost and sustainability.

01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:52.530
We want to be able to use it for
thousands of years, not 100 years.

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:54.280
Okay. Thank you.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:01:02.520
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: I'd
like to thank Dr. Yeh,

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.510
could we have a hand
of applause for him?

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:11.040
[ Applause ]

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.130
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
