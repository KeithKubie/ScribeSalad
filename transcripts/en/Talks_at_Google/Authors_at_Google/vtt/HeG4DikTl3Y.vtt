[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.390
ROBERT QUINN: A couple of
weeks ago I was in Barcelona.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.455
And we were just finishing a
week in training executives

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:19.310
in leadership.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.970
And I was having
dinner with a man who

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.806
was in charge of the week.

00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:25.820
He's an interesting character.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.468
He's a psychiatrist who is
deeply wedded to science.

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:36.552
He also has a PhD in theology.

00:00:36.552 --> 00:00:40.110
He spends about half of
his time with professionals

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.510
trying to make them
more effective leaders.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.130
He spends the other half of
his time in villages and towns

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.318
helping very
ordinary people make

00:00:50.318 --> 00:00:53.500
better sense of their lives.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.560
I was listening to him
tell some of his stories,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.530
and I said, Alberto, what
is your life purpose?

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.900
Without a moment's
hesitation, he

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.435
said the sanctification of work.

00:01:07.435 --> 00:01:09.760
I said, what does that mean?

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.790
He said, making work sacred.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.710
What does that mean?

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.880
And he paused for a second.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.125
And he said, when you help
people make their work sacred,

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:26.812
they come alive in every
area of their life.

00:01:26.812 --> 00:01:28.453
Whoa.

00:01:28.453 --> 00:01:30.340
That was pretty interesting.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.900
It's a very striking thing to
see a man of such commitment

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.741
to science and to
theology and to service

00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:46.170
come to a conclusion like that.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.890
About 2006, I left the
university for three years,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.896
and I went and ran
an organization.

00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:04.490
At the university, we have a set
of [INAUDIBLE] organizations,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.776
which is a new
field of study where

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:10.310
we asked what is an
individual like at their best?

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.960
What is a group
like at their best?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.500
What is an organization
like at their best?

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.160
Not what they're like
normally, but in the way out

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.435
far side of that normal
curve [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:27.340
And that creates an entirely
different way to see the world.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.130
I left with the
commitment that I

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.430
was going to build
an organization based

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.562
on the principles
of science that we

00:02:34.562 --> 00:02:38.150
knew from this new field.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.690
Those three years were one of
the most meaningful periods

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.300
of my life.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.260
When I got back, my
friend came to see me.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.450
He's a world-class economist.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.602
And he began to question me.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.560
I thought it would go
for two or three minutes.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.210
It went on for two hours.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.370
He wanted to know everything.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.160
Then he went away for a few
minutes and he came back.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.610
And he said, what you just
told me defies economics.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.150
It turns economics upside down.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.270
We have to write a paper.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.990
So I said, OK.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.810
I'm open to that.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.060
We started working on a paper.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.660
The paper's all in Greek.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.790
It's all mathematical.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.000
It's a simulation
of an organization.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.510
Now, along the way, he
decided to educate me.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.890
And he said, I'm going to
explain to you why this

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.730
turns economics upside down.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.250
It has to do with the
principal-agent problem.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.040
He said at the heart
of microeconomics

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.710
is the principal-agent problem.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.800
So I turned to him, an
employee, and I said,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.290
I'm going to give you $100.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.810
You work for me for 10 hours.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.780
We shake hands.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.690
We have a contract.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.480
As long as I'm there to watch
him, he keeps the contract.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.240
The moment I turn
my back on him,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.610
he underperforms the contract.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.000
And that's the very
heart of microeconomics--

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.840
principal-agent problem.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.390
Well, we built the simulation.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.490
We created a normal
organization.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.580
And then we introduced
something new.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.260
The new variable
was higher purpose.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.140
The moment we introduced
higher purpose

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.870
into the model, the entire
organization transformed.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.140
The employee, or
the agent, became

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:38.770
a principal, became an owner,
became intrinsically motivated.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.295
My friend was really excited.

00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:41.820
He said, this is incredible.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.310
We've got to go interview CEOs
of high-purpose companies.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.530
Now, to me, it seemed
to sort of make sense

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.090
that that would happen.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.490
But when we went out
and did the interviews,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.190
then I got surprised.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.150
As we interviewed these CEOs,
the shocking discovery to me

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.540
was that most of them,
the majority of them,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.180
when they became
CEO, they did not

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.700
believe in purpose,
people, or culture.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.974
They had come up through
economic, managerial training.

00:05:22.974 --> 00:05:24.640
And they didn't believe
in those things.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.800
Every one of them got
there through some kind

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.375
of personal crisis.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.700
They had to
rediscover the world,

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:41.740
and they had to bring purpose
into their mental set.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.490
When they did that, and
they brought higher purpose

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.440
to the people in
the organization,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.860
things changed, just
like our simulation.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.605
And we learned a great
deal from those folks.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.880
And I wanted to
share with you what

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.260
science says about
that notion of having

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.830
a purpose-driven life.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.300
I have a colleague over the
public health school who just

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.410
published a book last year.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.440
And in it there's
a literature review

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.540
on the health effects of
having a purpose-driven life.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.160
The list is interesting.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.150
This is what it says.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.980
If you have a
purpose-driven life,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.650
it adds years to your life.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.710
You live longer.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.600
It reduces the likelihood
of a heart attack or stroke.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.240
It cuts the risk of Alzheimer's.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.366
It helps you relax during the
day and sleep better at night.

00:06:46.366 --> 00:06:50.740
It doubles the chance of staying
drug-free or alcohol-free

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.660
after treatment.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.570
Increases your good cholesterol.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.270
Gives you better sex.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.090
Gives you more friends.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.840
Gives you more meaning,
engagement, life satisfaction,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.710
and happiness.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.360
Now, when I look at
that list of findings,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.000
the only thing that I'm
left to conclude is you

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.850
and I are designed to be
purpose-seeking mechanisms.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.160
When we're not, when we
live in our comfort zone,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.420
we live a life of survival.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.310
We know statistically, 70%
of the global workforce

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.800
is disengaged at work.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.660
That's an astounding number.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:53.920
51% of the management workforce
is disengaged at work.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.450
That's the management workforce.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.982
What does that say
about our organizations?

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:03.440
You know, when we
talk about living

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.020
a life of quiet
desperation, there

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.840
are legions of people
out there surviving.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.910
When you clarify
your highest purpose,

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.770
you are basically discovering
what your contribution

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.480
is to this planet.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.460
Given your gifts, your
skills, your abilities,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.110
what is your contribution?

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.880
What's your life mission?

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.960
Why are you on the planet?

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.799
When you answer that
question, everything changes.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.000
The research says when you give
up self-interested goals, where

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.490
most of us are most
of the time, and you

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.360
take on contributive goals,
you function differently.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.860
The biology changes.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.510
The thought process changes.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.220
Learning accelerates.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.230
You grow more.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.870
Whenever we look at
high-performing people

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:04.940
over long term, we find this
notion of higher purpose.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.960
I was invited with some
colleagues to go to Ohio

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.320
and study public schoolteachers.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.130
Now, in a business school,
you could be shot for that.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.910
Why would I go study
public schoolteachers?

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:25.250
Because I had access to the
top 1% of the teachers in Ohio.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.700
These are the teachers
that walk on water.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.980
Students go in their
class in September,

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.110
they come out in
June way out here.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.580
Now, two to three times as much
learning in their classroom,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.935
objectively measured.

00:09:42.935 --> 00:09:46.340
Now, you can't work twice
as hard as a normal teacher,

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.680
because they work hard.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.540
So what are these people doing?

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.970
The reason I went
to study them is I

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.730
knew before I ever went
down there that they

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.280
weren't schoolteachers.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.250
And I just told you they
were schoolteachers.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.760
They work in schools.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.890
If they're not
schoolteachers, what are they?

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.070
Let me get a response from you.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.330
What would you think about if
you think about that puzzle.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.230
What would you know about these
people before you ever went?

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.549
AUDIENCE: They're
purpose-driven.

00:10:18.549 --> 00:10:20.090
ROBERT QUINN: They're
purpose-driven,

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.756
that's for sure.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.900
These people are
transformational leaders.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.520
They would die if
you call them that.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.880
They would say, I'm
a schoolteacher.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.660
But they are transforming the
culture of their classroom.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.780
Their classroom as a
positive organization.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.150
They don't work for money.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.400
They have a calling.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.560
Their purpose is not to teach
English or math or history.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.090
Their purpose is to create
the love of learning.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.980
If I have this little
kid in my classroom,

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.730
and I create the love
of learning in this kid,

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.820
I've empowered
this kid for life.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.542
If he's a minority, if he's
disadvantaged in some way

00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:11.000
and his life path's
going this way,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.750
but I create that
love of learning,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.760
he gets the capacity to change
all that, to take himself

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.780
beyond what's expected.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.600
Everything about these
people was different.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.710
What I love about that
story is they're not CEOs.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.720
They're not kings,
prime ministers.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.280
What are they?

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.970
People working in
the public school.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.800
If I asked you who left
the most positive legacy

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.280
in your life, name
that person, you

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.470
might say, oh, that's my mother.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:54.290
Or, oh, my third-grade teacher,
or my coach, or my first boss.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.750
You would name somebody.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.080
If we did an in-depth
analysis of your relationship

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.740
with that person,
we would find out

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.270
that that ordinary
person in your life who

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.890
left this positive legacy had
a transformational influence

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.420
on you.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.400
It was the most
positive influence

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.540
you've ever experienced.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.600
All around us, there are
people who live like this.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.280
We don't see them because we
wear conventional glasses.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.120
Economics says he's
self-interested.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.370
Resources are scarce.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.640
Conflict is inevitable.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.170
Now, all those things are
true, most of the time.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.140
That's why the
social sciences work.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.840
What the social
sciences don't look at

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.820
is the end of the curve.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.190
They don't look at excellence.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.520
They look at central tendency.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.880
And whenever we look at people
at the end of the curve,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.130
we find a different model.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:02.990
And one key element is purpose.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.200
Now, how does that happen?

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.210
Let me share two
stories with you.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.200
Story number one,
we're interviewing

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.520
one of those schoolteachers.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.890
She's sharing stuff, and it's
a really exciting interview.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.620
I'm writing stuff down.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.860
And then she tells a story.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.780
She says the first year
I taught was heaven.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.350
The second year I
taught was hell.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.530
I had five boys
that second year,

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.120
and they were in incorrigible.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.030
And there was one kid in
particular, he was impossible.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.770
One day, this kid's in the
doorway of the classroom,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.970
and he's kicking and moving
his arms and making noises.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.580
And I lost it.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.620
She said, I'm ashamed
to say these words.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.100
But I walked towards that
kid with the intention

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.380
of kicking him.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.360
Thank heavens he
got up and ran away.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.506
I kept walking.

00:14:04.506 --> 00:14:05.880
I went to the
principal's office.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.590
I said, this is it.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.960
It's him or me.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.690
And the principal
took the kid out.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.510
She said, I felt terrible.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.330
So I went to two my colleagues
and poured my heart out.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:24.190
And they said to me, you are
not the key to every door.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.220
And as she said those
words, she burst

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.470
into tears in the interview.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.480
And we waited a long time.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.050
And then she looked up
and said, I hated that.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.820
And I said, hated what?

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.840
She said those words.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.840
You can't be the
key to every door.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:46.300
She said, so I decided to
become the key to every door.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:51.330
She said, instead of pushing
disruptive kids away,

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.740
I began to seek them out.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.320
I began to bring
them into my world.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.570
I read every book I could find.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:58.590
I kept notes.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.850
I ran experiments.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.310
I kept notes on the experiments.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.250
And then she kind of
pulled herself up and said,

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.350
today, I am the
key to every door.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.277
When there's a disruptive,
troubled kid in the school,

00:15:12.277 --> 00:15:13.860
they said, give her
to Miss So-and-so.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.630
She seems to know
what to do with them.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.400
That's a profoundly
important story.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.740
It's a story of
transformative learning.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.240
When I have a higher purpose, I
find the energy and the courage

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.680
to go outside my comfort zone
and to learn in a deep way.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.270
And I break some code.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.360
The code could be
about any part of life.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.870
And then I can do things
other people can't do.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.070
Now, the second story
is a lot closer to home

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.280
and I think a very helpful one.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.440
I once had a daughter.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.450
She was single.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.480
She was living in
Washington, DC.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.284
And she had reached that
point in life where she said--

00:16:04.284 --> 00:16:06.105
you know, she
wasn't married yet,

00:16:06.105 --> 00:16:09.790
and she said the only man
left at my age are pigs.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.670
There's not a good
man left on the Earth.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.895
And then she found one,
and she got really excited.

00:16:14.895 --> 00:16:16.530
The relationship grew.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.280
And then one day,
our phone rang.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.830
She's talking to her mother.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.210
And I know what's going on.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.066
This guy just dumped her.

00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:25.210
She's all upset.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.500
Her mother-- now, this daughter
is the first-born child.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.610
Many first-born children
share a common characteristic.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.470
If they're miserable, they
want you to be miserable, too.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.769
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:44.560
And she said, I'm coming
home this weekend.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.040
I thought, oh, no.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.320
Her mother hangs up and
says, you're the father.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.570
You go to the
airport, pick her up.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.610
So the next day,
I go pick her up.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:58.720
She gets in the car, and she
doesn't say hello, how are you.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.630
She says, that no-good,
dirty da-da-da.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.599
Five minutes later,
she takes a breath.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.190
And I said, are you
problem-solving or

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.750
purpose-finding?

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.670
She didn't even hear me.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.800
So we go through that
about four times.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.759
We're finally pulling
in the driveway.

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:14.800
She takes another breath.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.520
I say it again.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.616
She says, what are
you talking about?

00:17:18.616 --> 00:17:20.829
And I said, well, I wrote
that thing to your brother

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:22.930
about the difference
between purpose-finding and

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.220
problem-solving.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.230
I sent you a copy.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.415
And she said, this
is the real world.

00:17:30.415 --> 00:17:32.540
I said, well, I think it
applies to the real world.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.910
By then, we're in the house.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.110
I pull out a sheet of
paper out of my file.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.340
And it says "Robert
Quinn Life Statement."

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:40.989
So I take it.

00:17:40.989 --> 00:17:41.780
I handed it to her.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.060
She rips it out of my hand.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.770
She looks at it.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.690
And then she grows quiet.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:52.820
And she looks up and says, when
you feel bad, you read this?

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.230
I said, no.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.040
When I feel bad, I rewrite it.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.770
It's been rewritten
hundreds of times.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.830
She said, yeah, I can hardly
understand some of this stuff.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.620
I said, yeah, it's written
to a customized audience,

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.720
one person.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.330
Then the first miracle happened.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.480
She said, do you think I
could write one of these?

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.950
I said, I'm sure you can.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.529
She went in the bedroom.

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:19.820
For a day-and-a-half, she
worked on her life statement.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:24.060
The miracle was, I did not
have to suffer during that day

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.720
and a half, right?

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.890
She got on the plane.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.610
She flew home to DC.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.670
A couple of days pass.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:32.775
I get an email.

00:18:32.775 --> 00:18:35.240
She says, he called me.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.310
Oh, this will be interesting.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.000
And she says, so I
wrote him this letter.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.040
And I'm reading this
letter that she's attached.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.140
It's incredibly
vulnerable, open, honest.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.890
And I'm thinking, wow,
this is impressive.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.580
And then at the bottom
it says, "And my roommate

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.480
said I can't give this to him."

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.860
Now, that's an
interesting thing.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.790
Let's freeze all the insensitive
males in the room for now.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.190
I just want to hear
just in the females.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:11.135
Why can't we give this
letter to this guy?

00:19:11.135 --> 00:19:13.470
AUDIENCE: He's crazy.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:14.989
ROBERT QUINN:
Because he's crazy?

00:19:14.989 --> 00:19:16.530
Anybody who dumped
me would be crazy.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.520
That would be true.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.266
Why else?

00:19:20.266 --> 00:19:22.182
AUDIENCE: They think
it'll make you look weak.

00:19:22.182 --> 00:19:23.620
ROBERT QUINN: Yes!

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.940
Of course.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.910
I'm vulnerable, I tell
him how I really feel.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.360
You know, dating's a
marketplace, right?

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.220
It's a transaction.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.540
You don't tell some guy that
dumped you here's how you feel.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.840
And then she said,
what my roommates

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:48.560
don't understand is that what
he thinks doesn't matter.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.620
Whoa, wait a minute.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.060
A few days ago, what he thought
caused her life to shatter.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.770
Now she's saying what he
thinks doesn't matter.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.080
What is she saying?

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.250
She's saying this
is who I really am.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.960
Didn't know this a while ago.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.350
Now I know it.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.370
It doesn't matter what
other people think.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:16.720
You see, when you
clarify your purpose,

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.610
you take back your
external locus of control

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.630
where you worry about
what other people think,

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.640
and you take an internal locus.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.870
You don't become insensitive.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.707
You don't become rebellious.

00:20:27.707 --> 00:20:28.540
You become centered.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.280
You become powerful.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.860
Now, here's the
interesting thing

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.040
in the sequel to that story.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:45.740
In the next few months,
she began to be promoted.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.025
Her career turned.

00:20:51.025 --> 00:20:51.525
Why?

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.370
This was a dating breakup.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.990
Why is her career taking off?

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:08.870
Because when you find
purpose and meaning in what

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:13.640
you're doing in one
area of your life,

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.230
it grows in every area of life
because you are one person.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.430
That company had a woman coming
in with the same dresses on,

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:27.260
body looked the same, but
it wasn't the same employee.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.740
This was a woman now, full of
leadership for the first time.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.280
She had a higher
purpose, and she

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.814
was willing to take
initiative that normally she

00:21:41.814 --> 00:21:42.980
wouldn't be willing to take.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.720
That's leadership.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.470
Companies desperately need it.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.620
Cultures suppress it.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.600
We're afraid to take
leadership in organizations.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.280
We're afraid to tell the truth.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:03.300
When someone has that
meaning and that integrity,

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.455
things start to change.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.840
That's different
than management.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:19.200
My message to you today
is that every one of you

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.530
is filled with
talents and gifts.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.390
You've been shaped by life.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.150
You've had bad experiences
and good experiences.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.570
And both the bad experiences
and the good experiences

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:34.060
are there to teach you
something about you.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.790
And if you look very
carefully at those,

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.860
you can determine
what your purpose is.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.150
I'll close with a puzzle.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.660
I have a friend who is
a world-renowned sports

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.270
psychologist.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.330
One day, he challenged me.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.040
He said, here's a story.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.040
Here's a woman who smokes.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:06.200
So you tell her there's a link
between tobacco and cancer.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.734
If you keep smoking,
you're going to die.

00:23:09.734 --> 00:23:10.900
Absolutely doesn't faze her.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.470
She keeps smoking.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.472
So you buy her a patch.

00:23:15.472 --> 00:23:16.680
She wears it for a few weeks.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.070
She's still smoking.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.710
So you send her to
a therapy group.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.590
She comes out of
the therapy group.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.360
She's still smoking.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.160
He said, now, give
me three words

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.165
you can say to this woman, and
she'll put down her cigarette.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.230
I had no idea.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.100
This puzzle was too much for me.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.265
Anybody have an answer?

00:23:41.265 --> 00:23:45.755
"You are pregnant."

00:23:48.814 --> 00:23:50.230
Now think about
that for a second.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.920
Absolutely knows she
can't stop smoking.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.532
Three words, "you are pregnant."

00:23:59.532 --> 00:24:00.490
What does she have now?

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.462
AUDIENCE: A purpose.

00:24:01.462 --> 00:24:06.840
ROBERT QUINN: A purpose
that's bigger than she is.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.850
The interesting thing
about that story

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:13.740
is it says we are full of
resources we don't know about.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.920
They're already in there.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.070
We don't believe it.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:26.130
But when we suddenly find
a contributive purpose,

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.750
those resources
come to the surface.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.120
We begin to change.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.900
In fact, we
instantaneously begin

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.765
to change when we
embrace a purpose.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.490
I believe every
person in this room

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.510
can clarify the
purpose of their life

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.240
and that the moment
you do, this will

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:57.100
start happening not just at
work, but in every aspect

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.200
of your life.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.670
My hope is that every
one of you learns

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.646
to become the key to every
door in whatever aspect of life

00:25:07.646 --> 00:25:08.270
you're working.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.090
And with that, I
thank you very much.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.690
Thank you.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:18.040
[APPLAUSE]
