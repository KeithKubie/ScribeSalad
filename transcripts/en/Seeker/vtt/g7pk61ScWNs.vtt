00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.100
When life gives scientists lemons, they look
at those lemons and say, “how can we use

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.670
this to test general relativity?”

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.480
Hi everyone, Julian here for DNews. I know
we’ve been doing it for a while now, but

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.520
launching stuff into space is still pretty
tricky. You’ve got to get a giant rocket

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.590
on a launchpad without it exploding. You’ve
got to start it up without it exploding. You’ve

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.180
got to send it into space. Without it exploding.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.720
But assuming the payload still stays intact,
sometimes the rocket puts it in the wrong

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.430
place. that’s what happened in August of
2014 with a Russian Soyuz-Fregat rocket carrying

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.710
two of the European Space Agency’s Galileo
satellites. The rocket worked flawlessly most

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.930
of the way up there, and then in the last
stage it pointed in the wrong direction and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.239
shot them off at an orbit that made them useless
for their intended purpose. Ah, so close.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.480
Of course we’re talking close by space standards.
Which is just another way of saying the orbits

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.370
were really far off. They were supposed to
be in circular orbits a constant 23,222 km

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.129
(14429 miles) away from the earth. Instead
they were set on elliptical orbits, twice

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.330
a day they were 2,000 km (1242 miles) too
high, and twice a day they were 10,000 km

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.830
(6213 miles) too low.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.520
The Galileo program is going to be fine. The
plan is to launch 30 satellites to use them

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.830
for global positioning, and really 24 of them
are needed for the system to be fully operational,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.729
while the remaining 6 are there for backup.
So two of them whizzing about in the wrong

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.619
place is a minor setback, rather than a dealbreaker.

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.619
But, heck, while they’re up there, we may
as well do something with them. They’ve

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.860
still got fully functioning atomic clocks
onboard, so what experiments could you do

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.740
with a spacecraft traveling in an elliptical
orbit around a massive object while carrying

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.159
a super-accurate clock?

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.799
If you said test time dilation, you must watch
this show a lot. Hi mom!

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.939
Yes as you’re probably aware, according
to Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity,

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.049
near massive objects, time moves slower. GPS
satellites already have to constantly adjust

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.130
their atomic clocks back slightly because
of their distance from the Earth. And yes,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.950
according to special relativity their speed
also means that their clocks should run a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.549
little slower, but the overall effect is the
super accurate clocks in space are a little

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.799
fast on the order of microseconds.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.610
The wayward Galileo satellites have had some
course corrections because they have thrusters

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.599
and a bit of hydrazine fuel. Now their orbits
change by 8,500 km (5,281 miles) twice a day

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.090
instead of 12,000, but that’s still a difference
greater than the radius of the Earth (6,371

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.900
km) and then some. So what that means is compared
to our atomic clocks down here, the misplaced

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.800
Galileo clocks with run a little faster, then
a lot faster, then a little faster, then a

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.900
lot faster as they gets closer and farther
away from this massive hunk. I mean the earth,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.280
not me.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.129
Using those differences, we’ll be able to
check Einstein’s math. Sure we did it once

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.750
before with an atomic clock in 1976 that hitched
a ride 10,000 km into space, but that experiment

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.680
only lasted a few hours. We can pull data
from these satellites for over a year and

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.040
be four times more accurate than before. We’ll
be able to test the math vs the measurements

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.310
to an accuracy of 0.004%. And we’ll be able
to do it thanks to a mistake that we turned

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.709
into a happy little accident.

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.470
And I’ve got more good news, everybody!

So I glossed over how GPS satellites work,
and though I’d love to ramble all about

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.400
them, Trace’s clock was a little faster
than mine and he beat me to it. Check out

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.860
the amazing science behind knowing where on
Earth you are right here.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:33.159
Have you 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.349
ever turned an almost fail into an epic win?
