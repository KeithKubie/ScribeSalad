00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:04.604
(upbeat music)

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:06.773 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We're here with
James Davis and this is

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:10.010 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Group] Celebrity
Fashion Surgery

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.844
- Hello

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.345 line:0%
- Hey guys

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.547 line:0%
- This is like a wound and not
really like an ICU situation

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:15.815
- What would you do?

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.050
- Well I mean I'm
loving this camo,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.119
there's so much I love
about this street style.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.221
But the gray shoes James,

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.123 align:start size:84% position:16%
you didn't have better
sneakers to wear?

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.026
- Ah, these shoes are
like the top Jordans

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.494
that came out this year.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.629 align:start size:88% position:13%
- They might be Jordans,
but they're gray.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.031
- Is it a gray overkill?

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.966
- I would give yourself
a pop of color on that.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.269 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Always wear one item
to plug your show.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.537
- And what's that TV show?

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.005
- Hood Adjacent
with James Davis.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.074 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Bling around your
neck, bling on your ears,

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.209
where's the bling
on your fingers?

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.378 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I haven't met that
special someone.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:46.613
- Are you looking?

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.114
- Are you looking, James?

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.482 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I mean I was looking,
but I'm not looking to like

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.985 align:start size:84% position:16%
focus on like one
thing at this juncture

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.486
in my journey romantically.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.121
- It's okay, I'll do
an open relationship.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.322
- Fern, relax.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.857
- I'm sorry.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.659
- I think it's only fair that
we've critiqued your outfit,

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.127
why don't you give us a go?

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.029
- I love magenta.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:06.699
You look like lipstick
wrapped in saran wrap.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.201
- I'll take that
as a compliment.

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.936 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Oh your shoes are
fresh, what size are you?

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:11.438
- I'm a size 10 James.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.540 align:start size:94% position:6%
- In the 'hood when anyone
asks what your size is,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.974
you say my size.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:18.244 align:start position:0%
'Cause if your size was my
size, I might want to take 'em.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.312
So I'm gonna do this again.

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:20.947
What size are your shoes?

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:22.949
- They're my size James.

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:25.518
- Oh respect, well
you can have 'em.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:28.988
- I would drop the bottom of
his jacket a little bit lower.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.325
It's almost crop toppish right
here, it stops very suddenly.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.326
Everything else is great.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:35.829
You're like an A-, a 92%.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.466
- And I'm at 971

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.835
(bleep)

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.336
that was my phone number.

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:44.637
- And I'm at 2

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.439
(bleep)

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.874 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Enough of that,
that's enough of that.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.743
I've never been given an
A- before, in my life.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.680 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I would like to say, what
is your shoe size James?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.282
- (laughs loudly) my size homie.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.284
(upbeat music)
