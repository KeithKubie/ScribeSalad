it's not it's we're very critical of
 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.690
it's not it's we're very critical of
each other's work and so but there's a

notion that economics is very is to be

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
notion that economics is very is to be

notion that economics is very is to be
taken very seriously and it's to be

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
taken very seriously and it's to be
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.950
taken very seriously and it's to be
addressing important problems it's

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
addressing important problems it's
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.050
addressing important problems it's
supposed to be you know rigorous and at

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060
supposed to be you know rigorous and at
 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.170
supposed to be you know rigorous and at
the same time now relevant that

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
the same time now relevant that
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.460
the same time now relevant that
intensity i think has been very

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
intensity i think has been very
 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.140
intensity i think has been very
important for that environment denis and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
important for that environment denis and
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.929
important for that environment denis and
it kind of has kind of dominates lots of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
it kind of has kind of dominates lots of
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.179
it kind of has kind of dominates lots of
interactions and i think it's really

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189
interactions and i think it's really
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.470
interactions and i think it's really
been part of that the reason I Chicago

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480
been part of that the reason I Chicago
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060
been part of that the reason I Chicago
as an economics department or that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
as an economics department or that
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.350
as an economics department or that
economic community has been so

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
economic community has been so
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.490
economic community has been so
productive also its economics as a feel

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
productive also its economics as a feel
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.160
productive also its economics as a feel
that it it advances and as it advances

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
that it it advances and as it advances
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.950
that it it advances and as it advances
that necessarily gets more specialized

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960
that necessarily gets more specialized
 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.990
that necessarily gets more specialized
Chicago has been very good at resisting

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
Chicago has been very good at resisting
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.060
Chicago has been very good at resisting
too much specialization there's lots of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
too much specialization there's lots of
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.650
too much specialization there's lots of
interaction across areas and the like

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
interaction across areas and the like
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.350
interaction across areas and the like
that I think can really be important for

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
that I think can really be important for
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.079
that I think can really be important for
a creative research
