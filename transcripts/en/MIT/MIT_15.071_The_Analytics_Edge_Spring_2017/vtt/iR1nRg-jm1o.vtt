00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.140
In this video, we're
going to look at scales.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.260
This first plot shows
the average height

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.980
of a 21-year-old
male in centimeters.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.300
The x-axis is time, starting
in 1871, and ending in 1975.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.270
Each person
represents the height,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.320
at a different point in time,
and the points are evenly

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.530
spaced in time, so
the x-axis is OK.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.820
The y-axis ranges from just
under 160 to 180 centimeters,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.030
which isn't inherently bad,
but does overstate the change.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.210
The real problem is the bars.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.590
If it was accurate,
we would only

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.940
really see the heads of
the men, but instead we

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.770
see their whole bodies, making
it seem as if people have not

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.320
only doubled in height, but
they've also double in width.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.590
This next plot also
has issues with scale.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.850
The total range of
the plot is 8% to 10%,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.360
although all the numbers fall
in the range of 8.6% to 9.2%.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.490
If we plotted the y-axis
on a 0% to 10% scale,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.520
the conclusion would be
that nothing is really

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.520
changing at all.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.190
The last point in the chart
is at the wrong height,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.810
and the size of the markers
makes the relative locations

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.860
hard to distinguish.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.770
Also notice that the gap between
9.0% and the 8.9% markers

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.820
on the far left side, and
the 8.9% and 8.8% markers,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.789
have a different gap.

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.550
This plot shows the relative
breakdown of teachers

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.430
by race in a certain
teaching program.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.560
The Caucasian bar is truncated,
which is a risky choice,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.759
but could be appropriate
in some situations.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.620
A much bigger problem is that
the scale of each blue bar

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.500
is entirely different.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.450
For example, the Native
American bar is about a third

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.770
of the length of the
African American bar,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.680
but there are more than 10
times as many African Americans

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.170
in this program as
Native Americans.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.860
In fact, visually, this plot
is completely meaningless.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.960
The only useful thing
about it is the numbers.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.750
But even there, there
is a bit of confusion,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.020
as Native Americans are
given to one decimal place,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.470
but the others are rounded.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.820
Which when combined with
the confusing scales,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.800
casts doubt on the
correctness of the numbers.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.300
Here is a before and
after of the same data.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.930
On the left, we see
the US military expense

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.530
in the right axis, and troop
count on the left axis.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.890
Both the line and bar
plots are individually OK,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.280
but the combination
is misleading.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.390
Because you have mixed two
units, dollars and people,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.060
there is a false
impression of some sort

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.850
of crossover point in
1995 that does not exist.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.650
On the right is the same data
presented in a different way.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.430
We now have troops
on the x-axis,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.710
and dollars on the y-axis.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.740
The line moves through
time now, allowing

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.990
us to see when moments of change
occurred, such as decreases

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.510
in troop count, through the
90s, at the end of the Cold War,

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.690
the increase in
spending of the 2000s,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.850
and the recent decreases
in military spending.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.500
The final visualization
I want to show you today

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.280
is all about the different
types of household.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280
The US Census
Bureau periodically

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.900
determines how many households
are comprised, for example,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.560
of married couples with
and without children,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.320
people living alone, and so on.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.730
First of all, I'm not saying
this is a bad visualization.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.280
In fact, if we are interested
in the relative share

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.370
of each type of household
in a particular year,

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.620
it's actually pretty good.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.630
However, if what
we're interested in

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.940
is the rates of change
across the years,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.010
this is next to useless.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.790
The key problem is that the
x-axis is completely off.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.690
The gap between the first
two columns is 10 years,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.590
but the gap between
the last two columns

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.090
is only 2 years, meaning
that the rates are

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.150
hard to read from this.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.510
If we're not interested
in the rates of changes,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.920
but just want to compare two
years at a time, it's not bad,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.070
but it's not easy either.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.170
Try comparing 1970
married without children

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.100
to 2010 married
without children,

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.250
without looking at the numbers.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.100
Can you tell if it
has grown or shrunk?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.490
Finally, and more
generally, this chart

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.500
shows relative numbers.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.380
If you look at
absolute numbers, we

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.530
might find the total number of
couples married with children

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.560
is actually constant, but the
number of other households

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.350
has increased.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.140
We are now going
to change into R

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.350
to try plotting this
data as a line chart.
