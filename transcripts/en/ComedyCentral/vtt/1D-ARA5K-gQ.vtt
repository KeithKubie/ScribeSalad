CRAZY.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.851
I CANNOT STAND TO BE TICKLED.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.687
NOT EVEN FUN.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.388

&gt;&gt; HARLEY QUINN, MEDICINE WOMAN.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:01.929
&gt;&gt;CHRiS: YES, OH MY GOD, IT WAS
RIGHT THERE THE WHOLE TIME.

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:07.467

OILY TRADITION OF SEXUALLY

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.702
SUGGESTIVE TITLES, LIKE "LET'S
GET IT ON" AND "SEXUAL

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.771

WHY NOT JUST LEAVE IT IN THE
WHOLE TIME?

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:36.129
HERE'S A FUN FACT-- GINUWINE HAS
EIGHT KIDS HIMSELF.

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:40.801
SO MAYBE THE NEXT ONE SHOULD BE
CALLED "YANK IT OUT," OR "FINISH

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.137
IN HER HAIR FOR A CHANGE."

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.639

SUBTLE TITLE FOR AN R&amp;B SLOW JAM

YOURS, GIRL"

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:02.055
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: YES, ALL RIGHT, GOOD,
POINTS.

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:05.492
I FEEL LIKE THAT--
&gt;&gt; I JUST NEEDED TO SAY THE

FIRST PART.

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:08.195
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: THAT'S IF A DICK YOU
