just get better the neutrino has mass

00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:28.529
just get better the neutrino has mass
 

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:35.990
just get better the neutrino has mass
and is the biggest imp what is the

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000
and is the biggest imp what is the
 

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.370
and is the biggest imp what is the
biggest impact that this discovery has

and therefore their fundamental level is
 

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:08.510
and therefore their fundamental level is
very important when you do not know and

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520
very important when you do not know and
 

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:14.179
very important when you do not know and
whether they have its otherwise and how

to know how do you measure the mass and
how much is it Thank You Olga so what we

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220
how much is it Thank You Olga so what we
 

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.370
how much is it Thank You Olga so what we
know from the study of neutrino

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:16.380
know from the study of neutrino
 

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.529
know from the study of neutrino
oscillations is that neutrinos have mass

00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539
oscillations is that neutrinos have mass
 

00:27:18.539 --> 00:27:24.279
oscillations is that neutrinos have mass
or at least one of the three neutrino

00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:24.289
or at least one of the three neutrino
 

00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:27.830

flavours does have mass it's very hard

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840
flavours does have mass it's very hard
 

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.860
flavours does have mass it's very hard
to measure the mass itself and it's one

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:30.870
to measure the mass itself and it's one
 

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.259
to measure the mass itself and it's one
of these outstanding challenges that

00:27:33.259 --> 00:27:33.269
of these outstanding challenges that
 

00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:34.999
of these outstanding challenges that
professor McDonald has just been

00:27:34.999 --> 00:27:35.009
professor McDonald has just been
 

00:27:35.009 --> 00:27:37.129
professor McDonald has just been
describing we have been trying to

00:27:37.129 --> 00:27:37.139
describing we have been trying to
 

00:27:37.139 --> 00:27:42.799
describing we have been trying to
measure neutrino mass for more than 70

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:42.809
measure neutrino mass for more than 70
 

00:27:42.809 --> 00:27:45.440
measure neutrino mass for more than 70
years but the only thing we know is an

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:45.450
years but the only thing we know is an
 

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.330
years but the only thing we know is an
upper limit on the masses and the best

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:47.340
upper limit on the masses and the best
 

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.710
upper limit on the masses and the best
upper limit comes from cosmology it's of

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720
upper limit comes from cosmology it's of
 

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.549
upper limit comes from cosmology it's of
the order of 0.2 electron volts which is

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559
the order of 0.2 electron volts which is
 

00:27:55.559 --> 00:27:58.220
the order of 0.2 electron volts which is
more than a million times lighter than

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:58.230
more than a million times lighter than
 

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.680
more than a million times lighter than
the electron so that's the only thing I

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:00.690
the electron so that's the only thing I
 

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:03.200
the electron so that's the only thing I
can tell you then you Chino has a mass

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:03.210
can tell you then you Chino has a mass
 

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.180
can tell you then you Chino has a mass
and it's more than a million times

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:05.190
and it's more than a million times
 

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.999
and it's more than a million times
lighter than the election but exactly

00:28:07.999 --> 00:28:08.009
lighter than the election but exactly
 

00:28:08.009 --> 00:28:10.820
lighter than the election but exactly
how much the mass is is an outstanding

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:10.830
how much the mass is is an outstanding
 

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:18.139

not massless makes a difference it makes
 

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.020
not massless makes a difference it makes
a difference theoretically but it also

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:46.030
a difference theoretically but it also
 

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.910
a difference theoretically but it also
makes the difference to how our Sun

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:57.690
any more if it wouldn't be for neutrinos
supernovas would not be exploding the

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:57.700
supernovas would not be exploding the
 

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.260
supernovas would not be exploding the
way they explode the elements that we

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:01.270
way they explode the elements that we
 

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.140
way they explode the elements that we
are all made of would not exist so

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:04.150
are all made of would not exist so
 

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:07.260
are all made of would not exist so
neutrinos are very important but this is

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:07.270
neutrinos are very important but this is
 

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:09.110
neutrinos are very important but this is

what are neutrinos among these few

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:18.940
what are neutrinos among these few
 

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.120
what are neutrinos among these few

matter and we know them from radioactive

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:24.700

decays but what they really are and no

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:28.780
decays but what they really are and no
 

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.480
decays but what they really are and no
one knows no one has ever seen a

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:30.490
one knows no one has ever seen a
 

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.570
one knows no one has ever seen a
neutrino neutrinos have no electric

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:33.580
neutrino neutrinos have no electric
 

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.370
neutrino neutrinos have no electric
charge and we can only detect particles

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:35.380
charge and we can only detect particles
 

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.760
charge and we can only detect particles
which carry electric charge and so we

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:38.770
which carry electric charge and so we
 

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.560
which carry electric charge and so we
can only discover neutrinos when they

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:40.570
can only discover neutrinos when they
 

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.300
can only discover neutrinos when they
interact with something and produce

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:42.310
interact with something and produce
 

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.340
interact with something and produce
charged particles and this is how we

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:44.350
charged particles and this is how we
 

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.830
charged particles and this is how we
know that three kinds of neutrinos but

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840
know that three kinds of neutrinos but
 

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.140
know that three kinds of neutrinos but
no one has ever seen the neutrino itself

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:49.150
no one has ever seen the neutrino itself
 

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:52.890
no one has ever seen the neutrino itself
and the price is actually for discovery

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:52.900
and the price is actually for discovery
 

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.160
and the price is actually for discovery
of neutrinos oscillations that neutrinos

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:56.170
of neutrinos oscillations that neutrinos
 

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:59.089
of neutrinos oscillations that neutrinos
change identities also

00:33:59.089 --> 00:33:59.099
change identities also
 

00:33:59.099 --> 00:34:02.579
change identities also
what does it mean well it means that new

00:34:02.579 --> 00:34:02.589
what does it mean well it means that new
 

00:34:02.589 --> 00:34:06.599
what does it mean well it means that new
chinos it's very hard to say that the

00:34:06.599 --> 00:34:06.609
chinos it's very hard to say that the
 

00:34:06.609 --> 00:34:08.909
chinos it's very hard to say that the
new Treena changes identity because it

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919
new Treena changes identity because it
 

00:34:08.919 --> 00:34:10.499
new Treena changes identity because it
makes you think of the fact that you

00:34:10.499 --> 00:34:10.509
makes you think of the fact that you
 

00:34:10.509 --> 00:34:12.450
makes you think of the fact that you
know you have a neutrino sitting on the

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:12.460
know you have a neutrino sitting on the
 

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.999
know you have a neutrino sitting on the
table in front of you and over all of a

00:34:14.999 --> 00:34:15.009
table in front of you and over all of a
 

00:34:15.009 --> 00:34:16.859
table in front of you and over all of a
sudden they become something else

00:34:16.859 --> 00:34:16.869
sudden they become something else
 

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:19.859
sudden they become something else
so neutrinos do not change identity like

00:34:19.859 --> 00:34:19.869
so neutrinos do not change identity like
 

00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:22.559
so neutrinos do not change identity like
that they change identity while they

00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:22.569
that they change identity while they
 

00:34:22.569 --> 00:34:26.329
that they change identity while they
move through space when they do that you

00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.339
move through space when they do that you
 

00:34:26.339 --> 00:34:29.940
move through space when they do that you
can produce one kind of neutrino but

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:29.950
can produce one kind of neutrino but
 

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:31.980
can produce one kind of neutrino but
then if you try to detect it 100

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:31.990
then if you try to detect it 100
 

00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:34.589
then if you try to detect it 100
hundreds of kilometers further away you

00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:34.599
hundreds of kilometers further away you
 

00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:36.960
hundreds of kilometers further away you
discover that what you catch it's not

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:36.970
discover that what you catch it's not
 

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:38.519
discover that what you catch it's not
the same kind of neutrino but a

00:34:38.519 --> 00:34:38.529
the same kind of neutrino but a
 

00:34:38.529 --> 00:34:40.919
the same kind of neutrino but a
different kind Contino so something has

00:34:40.919 --> 00:34:40.929
different kind Contino so something has
 

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.289
different kind Contino so something has
happened on the way from the source to

00:34:43.289 --> 00:34:43.299
happened on the way from the source to
 

00:34:43.299 --> 00:34:45.779
happened on the way from the source to
the detector and this is what we call

00:34:45.779 --> 00:34:45.789
the detector and this is what we call
 

00:34:45.789 --> 00:34:48.779
the detector and this is what we call
neutrino oscillations and this has to do

00:34:48.779 --> 00:34:48.789
neutrino oscillations and this has to do
 

00:34:48.789 --> 00:34:51.960
neutrino oscillations and this has to do
with quantum mechanics and quantum

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:51.970
with quantum mechanics and quantum
 

00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:54.119
with quantum mechanics and quantum
mechanics I can see that you know as

00:34:54.119 --> 00:34:54.129

soon as you say quantum mechanics people

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200
soon as you say quantum mechanics people
 

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.069
soon as you say quantum mechanics people
get totally you know this is not for me

00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079
get totally you know this is not for me
 

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:01.259
get totally you know this is not for me
I don't want you know I'm not going to

00:35:01.259 --> 00:35:01.269
I don't want you know I'm not going to
 

00:35:01.269 --> 00:35:03.390
I don't want you know I'm not going to
understand it but in reality it's not

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400
understand it but in reality it's not
 

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.460

that difficult quantum mechanics

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:05.470
that difficult quantum mechanics
 

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:08.339
that difficult quantum mechanics
describes particles moving through space

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:08.349
describes particles moving through space
 

00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:11.759

like waves so if you think of waves in a

00:35:11.759 --> 00:35:11.769
like waves so if you think of waves in a
 

00:35:11.769 --> 00:35:15.870

pond like someone throwing two stones in

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880
pond like someone throwing two stones in
 

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.690
pond like someone throwing two stones in
a pond both stones will create waves and

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:18.700
a pond both stones will create waves and
 

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.779
a pond both stones will create waves and
these waves will interfere and likewise

00:35:21.779 --> 00:35:21.789
these waves will interfere and likewise

they overlap and this is what we

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400
they overlap and this is what we
 

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.329
they overlap and this is what we
discover in the form of solutions so we

00:35:33.329 --> 00:35:33.339
discover in the form of solutions so we

one of the three experimental groups
trying to make sense of the data they

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880
trying to make sense of the data they
 

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.250
trying to make sense of the data they
were getting so he was leading the

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:15.260
were getting so he was leading the
 

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.590
were getting so he was leading the
atmospheric neutrino group and trying to

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:18.600
atmospheric neutrino group and trying to
 

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.420
atmospheric neutrino group and trying to
investigate the properties of the

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:20.430
investigate the properties of the
 

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.730
investigate the properties of the
neutrinos so he was the intellectual

leader of this effort and both made
 

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.520
leader of this effort and both made
discoveries around the turn of this

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:28.530
discoveries around the turn of this
 

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:32.160
discoveries around the turn of this
millennium

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:32.170
 

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.890
you mentioned that neutrinos still are a

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:34.900
you mentioned that neutrinos still are a
 

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.450
you mentioned that neutrinos still are a
big puzzle so what's going on since then

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460
big puzzle so what's going on since then
 

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.160
big puzzle so what's going on since then
so since then we've discovered that

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:41.170
so since then we've discovered that
 

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:42.930
so since then we've discovered that
neutrinos are even more of a challenge

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:42.940
neutrinos are even more of a challenge
 

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.410
neutrinos are even more of a challenge
than we thought they were because okay

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:46.420
than we thought they were because okay
 

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.960
than we thought they were because okay
if neutrinos are massless we do not

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:48.970
if neutrinos are massless we do not
 

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:50.750
if neutrinos are massless we do not
understand it but at least the mass

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760
understand it but at least the mass
 

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.549
understand it but at least the mass
identical to zero is one of the

00:37:53.549 --> 00:37:53.559
identical to zero is one of the
 

00:37:53.559 --> 00:37:55.380
identical to zero is one of the
fundamental constants of the universe

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:55.390
fundamental constants of the universe
 

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.539
fundamental constants of the universe
and just describes the universe we live

00:37:57.539 --> 00:37:57.549
and just describes the universe we live
 

00:37:57.549 --> 00:38:00.180
and just describes the universe we live
in now we know that Muccino mass is not

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:00.190
in now we know that Muccino mass is not
 

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.970
in now we know that Muccino mass is not
zero so now the question becomes why is

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:02.980
zero so now the question becomes why is
 

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.720
zero so now the question becomes why is
it not zero and why is it so small so if

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:06.730
it not zero and why is it so small so if
 

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:08.940
it not zero and why is it so small so if
we if we physicists discover something

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:08.950
we if we physicists discover something
 

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.250
we if we physicists discover something
which is very small but actually not

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:11.260
which is very small but actually not
 

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.380
which is very small but actually not
equal to zero we get very excited

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:13.390
equal to zero we get very excited
 

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:15.480
equal to zero we get very excited
because there must be something which

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:15.490
because there must be something which
 

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:17.819
because there must be something which
makes this quantity is small but not

00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:17.829
makes this quantity is small but not
 

00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:19.740
makes this quantity is small but not
zero so there is a lot of experimental

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:19.750
zero so there is a lot of experimental
 

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.440
zero so there is a lot of experimental

we only know an upper limit we want to
 

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:30.870
we only know an upper limit we want to
know why the mass is so small and of

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880
know why the mass is so small and of
 

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.710

we want to know why neutrinos only

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:37.450
we want to know why neutrinos only
 

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:39.900
we want to know why neutrinos only
appear in a left-handed variety and not

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:39.910
appear in a left-handed variety and not
 

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.620
appear in a left-handed variety and not
in the right-handed variety they may be

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:43.630

millions of times larger than what the
Sun is capable of doing and what we can

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:45.700
Sun is capable of doing and what we can
 

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.190
Sun is capable of doing and what we can
do with our man-made terrestrial

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200
do with our man-made terrestrial
 

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.750
do with our man-made terrestrial
accelerators so once more there is a lot

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760
accelerators so once more there is a lot
 

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.000
accelerators so once more there is a lot
of experiments about neutrinos they are

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.010
of experiments about neutrinos they are
 

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:56.780
of experiments about neutrinos they are
going on why is it so important to know

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:56.790
going on why is it so important to know
 

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:58.000
going on why is it so important to know
just

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.010
just
 

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:04.660
just
neutrinos what they are well this is an

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:04.670
neutrinos what they are well this is an
 

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:09.280
neutrinos what they are well this is an
important question and this year's prize

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:09.290
important question and this year's prize
 

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:11.830
important question and this year's prize
is for fundamental physics definitely

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:11.840
is for fundamental physics definitely
 

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.370
is for fundamental physics definitely
now the use of fundamental physics for

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:15.380
now the use of fundamental physics for
 

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.560
now the use of fundamental physics for
society is something which I could

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:17.570
society is something which I could
 

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:21.480
society is something which I could
discuss at length but it's clear that

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:21.490
discuss at length but it's clear that
 

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:24.640
discuss at length but it's clear that
humans have this urge to learn more

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:24.650
humans have this urge to learn more
 

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:28.320
humans have this urge to learn more
about the universe that we live in and

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:28.330
about the universe that we live in and
 

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:30.460
about the universe that we live in and
fundamental science is one of the

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:30.470
fundamental science is one of the
 

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:35.320
fundamental science is one of the
pillars of modern society so I usually

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:35.330
pillars of modern society so I usually
 

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.840
pillars of modern society so I usually
say that if we didn't have this urge we

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:37.850
say that if we didn't have this urge we
 

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.150
say that if we didn't have this urge we
would still be living in caves and we

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160
would still be living in caves and we
 

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.609
would still be living in caves and we
would still be afraid of the lightning

00:41:42.609 --> 00:41:42.619
would still be afraid of the lightning
 

00:41:42.619 --> 00:41:45.849
would still be afraid of the lightning
but having learned what we have we have

00:41:45.849 --> 00:41:45.859
but having learned what we have we have
 

00:41:45.859 --> 00:41:48.490
but having learned what we have we have
built a modern society with computers

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:48.500
built a modern society with computers
 

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.990
built a modern society with computers
with GPS with cures for cancer all these

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000
with GPS with cures for cancer all these
 

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.150
with GPS with cures for cancer all these
things are phase of discoveries in

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.160
things are phase of discoveries in
 

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.820
things are phase of discoveries in
fundamental science Einstein didn't

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:57.830
fundamental science Einstein didn't
 

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.820
fundamental science Einstein didn't
develop the special relativity to give

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:00.830
develop the special relativity to give
 

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:05.020
develop the special relativity to give
us GPS but we have GPS and it's based a

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:05.030
us GPS but we have GPS and it's based a
 

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:06.580
us GPS but we have GPS and it's based a
lot of this special what are these

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:06.590
lot of this special what are these
 

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.520
lot of this special what are these
general theory of relativity we are

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:09.530
general theory of relativity we are
 

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.210
general theory of relativity we are
still curious yes thank you very much

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:12.220
still curious yes thank you very much
 

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:37.770
still curious yes thank you very much
