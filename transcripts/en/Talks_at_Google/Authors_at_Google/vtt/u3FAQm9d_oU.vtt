00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:05.009
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Hi.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.009
Welcome.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:07.629
I've invited my friend Justin Locke to
come speak.

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.500
I've heard him speak before and he's very
entertaining.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.830
He's an accomplished musician, composer, author,
and speaker.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.000
I
hope you'll enjoy.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
[Applause]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.270
&gt;&gt;Justin: Well, good morning, everybody.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.450
[Audience responds with "good morning"]

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.220
&gt;&gt;Justin: It's great to be here
at Google.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm quite honored to be here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Okay.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.820
This
book.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.020
Principles of Applied Stupidity.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.440
This book --
well, it's -- how can I describe this?

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.339
It's a collection
of unorthodox management techniques is the

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.739
best way I
describe this.

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:42.739
[clears throat].

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.359
Just to give you background on it.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.160
I grew
up on a farm out in the middle of nowhere

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.549
somewhere near
Toledo, Ohio.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.030
It wasn't actually the middle of nowhere.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.920
It
was magnetic nowhere.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.209
If someone says to you get lost
and they point, they're actually pointing

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:57.440
to my hometown.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.190
That's where I grew up.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.850
And I came to Boston with a very
cheap string bass and a how-to book and a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.850
one-way ticket.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.479
I got off at the Trailways bus station and
something of a

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.479
fairy tale occurred.

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.780
Two two years after this I found
myself playing the double bass, in the Boston

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.140
Pops, which is arguably the
most famous orchestra in the world.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.030
And that, by itself,
is a story which I tell in my first book,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.220
Real Men Don't
Rehearse.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.520
But something occurred, when I was in that
environment, that constantly bothered me.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.000
Which was this
question of why were certain conductors so

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.550
much more
famous and effective than others.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.140
There were some
conductors who would come out and virtually

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.200
with no work,
no effort, nothing came out of their mouth

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.710
and we in the
orchestra were just jumping up, cranked up

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.450
in our seats,
eager to play for these guys.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.640
And there'd be other
conductors who are highly skilled, very talented,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.640
very
good looking.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.710
They had everything you would want in a
conductor and we just couldn't get excited

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.710
about these
people at all.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.290
In fact, we actually kind of resented
them and got perfunctory with them.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.479
And I was always
curious as to why this was.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.700
And I spent an awful lot of
time analyzing this.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.819
And I'm going to -- well, I'm just
going to tell you a story about working with

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:10.840
one guy.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.950
You're
all too young to remember him.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.569
His name is Arthur
Fiedler.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.780
He conducted the Boston pops for about 50
years.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.760
And by any metric you care to name, he was
the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.749
most successful conductor in history.

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:26.140
I mean, if you put
Arthur Fiedler here, the closest guy is Leonard

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.319
Bernstein right
about here.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.349
It's astonishing what he did in terms of
recordings sold, tickets sold, fame, notoriety,

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.709
Guinness
Book of World Records for the biggest classical

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.150
music
concert ever.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.810
Now, they have this thing at Pops where
you can go.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.129
If you ever go to pops you don't go by
yourself.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.620
You will go with five or ten or 20 of or your
organization will buy 500 tickets.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.200
And sometimes there
will be nights where one organization will

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.680
buy every seat
in Symphony Hall.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.790
For example, one night there was an
orthodontist convention was in Boston and

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.719
every single
person in the hall was an orthodontist.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:09.140
And we proceeded
to play "Shadow of your Smile", "All I want

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.669
for Christmas
is my Two Front Teeth", followed by the "Theme

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:14.669
from Jaws".

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.459
[laughter]
It was all thematically appropriate for that

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.459
crowd.

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.510
Well, one night the American Guild of Organists
had an annual

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.440
convention in Boston and they bought every
single seat in Symphony Hall.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.291
That meant every single person in there
was an organist also, of course, organists

00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.739
in churches
are generally choir directors.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.639
And they got this guy,
you also won't remember this guy, his name

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.239
was E. Power
Biggs.

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.920
America actually -- if you can imagine an
organist

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.999
on American Idol winning it, that's how famous
this guy

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:42.999
was back in the 50s.

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.159
He was America's church organist.

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.260
And they wheeled him out for what turned out
to be his

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.529
last public performance.

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.909
He died like two months later.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.430
And you know, so we're going to play this
organ concerto.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.200
The bass part to the Hallelujah Chorus was
in my folder.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.799
And we just glossed over it in rehearsal.

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.059
No one said
anything about it.

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:04.059
Nobody mentioned it.

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:05.059
We didn't play
it.

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:07.409
I'd never played the Messiah before.

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.409
I didn't know it.

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.239
But when you're in Pops, you just do what
you're told.

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.549
So we get to the concert that night and I'm
just assuming

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.459
we're going to play this and the trumpets
are going to

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.790
play the vocal parts because I don't know
what's going

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.790
on.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.400
So we play the organ concerto and Fiedler
turns to the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.200
crowd and he says, "we have an encore for
you.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.420
We're
going to play the Hallelujah Chorus.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.070
And we want you to
be the chorus."

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.350
And there's this murmur in the crowd like
what's this what are you talking about.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.220
And Fiedler
turns around, he's a grouchy guy.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.410
And he says,
"c'mon, you all know it."

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.510
Well, of course, they're all
choir directors; they have to teach the parts

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.720
twice a year
so they have it all memorized.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.950
So try to get the
situation here.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.630
You've got Symphony Hall, arguably one
of the finest acoustic spaces in the entire

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.630
world.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.600
You've got E. Power Biggs, at the time, the
most famous organist in the world.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.730
You've got the
Boston Pops Orchestra, the most famous orchestra

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.730
in the world.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.510
Arthur Fiedler, definitely the most famous
conductor in the world.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.510
And 2000 professional singers
that have been drinking for the last hour

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.480
and a half.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.070
[laughter] So we start to play the Hallelujah
Chorus.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.690
And it's the seventh inning stretch of classical
music, if you've ever

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.910
had the dubious pleasure of sitting through
the entire

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.760
Messiah.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.780
And so, there's all this rumble of chairs
because it's tradition for everyone to stand

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.780
up.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.560
So all these 2000 people, they stand up.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.560
What is not tradition, is that
they started to sing.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.760
Oh boy, did they start to sing.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.860
Now 200 people is a big choir.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.950
We had 2000.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.970
And Symphony
Hall is designed to have sound over here splay

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.710
out into
this shoe box space.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.420
Every single seat was a 90 decibel
sound source.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.420
These people were just--.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.610
And when that
first hallelujah hit the stage, it was almost

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.340
like a shock
wave it was so loud.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.060
Knocked me off my stool.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.020
And we
got to the King of Kings.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.370
500 basses, 500 tenors -- tore
the roof off the joint.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.060
Now, I have this -- I've played like 3, 000
concerts in my professional career.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.770
And I have this list
of the top five most exciting musical moments

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.440
that I ever experienced on my list.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.930
That was on the top five.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.050
It was just so breathtakingly
wonderful.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.280
So, you know, this is kind of my -- this is
like my first week working with Arthur Fiedler.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.380
And it's a wonderful story and I
love sharing it.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.550
There's just one problem with this story.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.140
Just one.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.610
We did not rehearse it.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.590
Now, if you've talked
to any conductor, any conducting class, any

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.540
conducting
symposium, any conducting book, they will

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.190
all tell you
that rehearsing equals a better show.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.530
And if you
don't rehearse, it equals a worse show.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.140
And I can
understand if we had an okay performance or

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.460
kind of
muddled through it, it would have made sense

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.680
to me
since we didn't rehearse.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.300
But it wasn't just a good
performance, it was one of the greatest performances

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.420
of
my life.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.570
And there was no rehearsal.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.510
And this makes
absolutely no sense really, you know, in terms

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.750
of all my
reference that I learned in music school.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.060
So what do you
do with that.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.820
Well, for now, we're just going to pretend
that

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.480
it's a statistical outlier.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.730
We're just going to ignore
it.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.150
You know it was just one of those things.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.150
Call it a
phenomenon.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.250
Let's put it aside.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.600
Now, Arthur Fiedler -- we
have to talk about him for just a minute.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.130
This guy
without question, right?

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.310
By any -- again, any metric you
care to name -- the most famous, most successful

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.540
conductor of all time ever.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.340
Now, this guy grew up in the Back Bay, graduated
from

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.750
Boston Latin.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.400
There's nothing terribly exotic about
that.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.030
I'm sorry with all due regard to Boston Latin
High School.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.000
Or
back the Back Bay.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.050
Didn't graduate from college.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.800
Never
composed anything.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:39.180
He was an okay looking guy, but you
would not say he had sex appeal.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.540
Nothing -- you know, he
didn't have an interesting accent.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.350
He didn't have a lot
of syllables or exotic consonants in his name.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.020
His baton
technique kind of resembled someone chopping

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.020
salami.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.090
It
was kind of this circular motion.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.310
So there are all these
attributes that I just described to you, you

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.889
would think how is
it this guy is the most successful guy.

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:04.480
I work with
hundreds of conductors.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.960
I publish music.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.130
They have
masters degrees.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.130
They have talent.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.130
They compose.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.130
They
have nice cars.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.130
They have a rich wife.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.140
They have a good
tailor.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.510
Arthur had none of this and yet he was the
biggest star.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.870
Again, this is cognitive dissonance
happening here.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.870
Why is this?

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.870
How could this be?

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.389
Let me
tell you one more story.

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:26.550
There's a guy -- I'm sure
you've heard of this guy.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.960
Henry Mancini.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.030
He wrote Moon
River.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.880
If you don't know who this is, gee, I kinda
feel bad for you.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.889
He wrote Victor/Victoria.

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:36.400
Just one of the finest
musicians I ever worked with.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.270
And the first time I
worked with him he came into Symphony Hall.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.570
It was a
program of all his own music.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.320
We're doing all these
beautiful pieces.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.870
"Days of Wine and Roses".

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.870
"Two for
the Road".

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.230
And it's just really lovely.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.730
We get to the
Pink Panther in the rehearsal and he looks

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.860
at us and he
says, "you all know this, don't you?"

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.710
Well, who doesn't know "Pink Panther"?

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.410
Sure, we know "Pink Panther".

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.880
He said, "fine" and he
just turned the score over and we didn't rehearse

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.880
it.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.640
Now, we knew Pink Panther generally.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.210
We did not know
this arrangement of Pink Panther, at all.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.300
So, but you
can't, in a Pops rehearsal, the protocol doesn't

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.891
let you raise
your hand and say, "excuse me, I think we

00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:18.120
should rehearse
this."

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.890
You can't do that, because the conductor is
in

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.620
command and control.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.560
So we get to the concert that night
and we're going along and we get to the point

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.880
where
we're going to play Pink Panther.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.860
And I have to tell you
again 3, 000 concerts in my professional career.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.550
Never in
that entire time in 18 years have I ever seen

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:40.800
an
orchestra so completely keyed up, geared up,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.700
eager,
desperate to play a piece absolutely at the

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.890
highest level
of their capability.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.760
And it wasn't Mozart's 40th.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.040
It wasn't Mahler's 3rd.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.510
. It was the Pink Panther.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.040
And of course,
the audience could sense this intensity and

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.710
they get
completely drawn into it and hypnotized.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.930
And there's this
massive applause.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.340
So again, you've got this problem.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.589
He
didn't do it correctly.

00:10:05.589 --> 00:10:07.380
He didn't follow the proper
procedure.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.650
He didn't do what you're supposed to do.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.820
I
mean, did he forget?

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.820
Is he just dumb?

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.519
Why didn't he
rehearse?

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:14.380
And you'd think.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.210
Okay, you forgot to
rehearse.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.510
He should be punished with a barely adequate
performance.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.140
But this is also on the top five list and
there was no rehearsal.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.460
So this kind of thing grinds in
my mind.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.770
I'm going to offer up a possible solution
here

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.400
which is just a mathematical possibility.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.240
But I would
like you to consider the possibility that

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.300
maybe Arthur
wasn't so successful and those concerts weren't

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:43.320
so
wonderful -- not in spite of the lack of rehearsal

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.589
or not
in spite of the apparent incompetence-- but

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:48.480
because of it.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.400
Now, this is a big, big step here.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.090
But I think I can
explain how this works by telling you yet

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.040
another story.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.930
Years ago, the royal ballet of London, England
-- very,

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.710
very chichi ballet outfit-- comes to Boston
on an

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.210
international tour.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.900
And as is customary, they hired a freelance
orchestra to come and play in the pit.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.800
And I was the
principal bass player for this one week run

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.800
of this
thing.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.380
About 50 people in the pit of the Wang Center.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.640
So
conductor comes out and they have their own

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.930
conductor
with them of course.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.140
We do our first rehearsal and we
have lunch and we come back.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.601
And at the beginning of the
second rehearsal, this guy comes out and he

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:27.440
says
something very, very strange.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.390
He says -- he kind of looks
around like is the boss in earshot.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:36.610
And he says, I have
a terrible confession to make.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.490
Who doesn't love a
terrible confession?

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.740
So of course dead silence.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.010
Do
tell.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:47.490
And he says, "I'm tone deaf".

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.050
And we all just -- we
were so confused.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.280
We just burst out laughing that he would
say that.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.050
Then he says, "Oh, but if you play in the
wrong place,

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.470
I can hear that.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:57.890
I can tell if you're playing in the
wrong place.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.089
So don't play in the wrong place."

00:11:59.089 --> 00:12:01.160
Now,
there's a couple things happening here.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.400
First of all, he
pointed out to us in a very tactful way the

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.830
importance of
when you're playing for a ballet, the rhythm

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.620
is a whole
lot more important than prissy issues of playing

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.020
in tune
or out of tune or even wrong notes.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.070
Because the ballet
dancers have to have the beat.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:21.660
Musicians they tend to
meander off into these less important things.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.010
But
something else happened that was more interesting

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.530
than
that, is that, in that environment, where

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.380
you're coming in
and you've got a boss and sometimes you are

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.880
freelance or
whatever you're working for somebody.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.250
There's a default
of passive obedience.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.000
They're in charge.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.260
You want to
get hired again.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.260
You don't want to get fired.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.260
So what
do you do?

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.090
He's the boss, you come in and you do what
you're told.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.930
And this is the common mythology of
orchestras that orchestras are just these

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.600
extremely
obedient creatures that passively obey this

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.100
waving stick
around in the air.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.230
And actually that does happen to a
certain extent because why work harder than

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.760
you have to.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.890
Just play the notes and do what's required;
nothing wrong.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.940
But when someone is saying that they are completely
and

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.100
totally incompetent, it's very hard to be
passively

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.230
obedient to somebody who's saying, "I have
no idea what I'm

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.410
doing".

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.490
And at that point.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.780
We all knew it was a joke.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.510
But at the same time we went along with it.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.600
And I just,
at this point, I went to the other bass players

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.730
and the
principal second violinist.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.480
And I said okay, the poor guy --
he's tone deaf.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.990
We don't want him to lose his job.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.480
I
guess we're all going to have to step it up

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.520
and cover for
this guy.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.520
Why not?

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.529
We don't get the guy in trouble.

00:13:31.529 --> 00:13:35.040
So
now I'm dealing directly with my section and

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.940
the
principal second violinist about the time

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.149
and the rhythm
and I have gone from being passively obedient

00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:44.970
to being
very assertive, aggressive and all this kind

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.050
of
collective individual leadership that if the

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.910
oboe has the
solo, now they're in charge.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.520
And if the trumpets are
playing, now they're in charge.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.930
Now this conductor he's
just sitting back puffing on the cigarette

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.140
like every ten
minutes.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.490
He says oh, the dancers are up in the air
on

00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.490
bar 47.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.690
Could you hold that a little longer?

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:01.690
Oh yeah, fine.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.110
And
we just went back to doing our thing and being

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.970
totally
internally led like this.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:12.060
And we went from this passive
obedience mode to this highest level of performance

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.060
mode.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.960
And he did this not by being the standard
-- there's all

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.710
these books about how to be a great leader
and excellent

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.160
leader-- and this guy basically said he was
a total dope

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.020
and he got this result.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.800
And I kept having all of these
experiences of seeing this.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800
You know?

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.870
There's something
to this.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.050
There's something to this kind of thing.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:36.640
So I
guess -- I guess the next question is, "Justin,

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.100
if this
works so well about, if this is such a great

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.870
system, why
doesn't everybody do it?"

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.660
It's an excellent question.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.200
I'm going to introduce a new phrase to your
lexicon this

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.200
morning.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.160
I call it "classroom conditioning."

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.530
We spend
something like -- I don't know what the number

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.060
is -- but
it's at least 700 billion dollars a year putting

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.370
people
in classrooms.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.339
Now whether people learn or not or what
they're learning or what they're doing but

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:04.170
what does happen
and there are officers making sure that you

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.850
sit in a
classroom.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.370
And there are certain things that you learn
in a

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.500
classroom regardless of whether you're a good
student,

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.250
lousy student, interested good teacher, bad
teacher.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.350
One
of those is don't be late.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.400
Everybody knows not to be
late.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.270
Don't make mistakes.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.820
Follow proper procedure.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.070
And God forbid don't make so many mistakes
that you fail.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.640
That is just unbelievably bad.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.779
And it becomes almost
like a morality as opposed to just a rational

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:32.550
approach to
whether or not you're acquiring information.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.430
There's good things which is getting a perfect
score.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:40.200
And there's bad things which are
failing and not solving the problem.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.701
So in writing this
book what I wanted to do is say, "okay, let's

00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:46.779
take a look
at these things that in a classroom environment

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:50.649
and other
environments, of course, are classified as

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:51.950
taboo.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.980
And we use the
word "stupid" here because that is a shaming

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.980
statement.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.500
It's almost like a new curse word to call
something

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.500
stupid.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.630
That's bad; don't do that.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.250
I said, "well, what if
we took these things that are classified as

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:09.279
bad, always in
classroom culture, and applied them sparingly?"

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:11.640
I don't
mean running down the street raving like a

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.100
lunatic, but
just occasionally doing things wrong.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.120
Just occasionally
admitting to ignorance.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.720
Occasionally failing.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.090
What
would you get?

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.220
And suddenly the light went off and I
understood that what these conductors were

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.010
doing was exactly
that because and a light went off there's

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.470
something that
I call the hero reflex.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.230
If you're walking down the
street and you see Einstein up a tree, well

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.339
you're going
to assume he's smart guy; he can figure it

00:16:36.339 --> 00:16:39.640
out, he'll get
down and you'll just go on your merry way.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.050
If there's a
pathetic little kitten up a tree just mewing

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.790
with an IQ of 6,
you and the guy next to you that you never

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.800
talked to
before.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.400
You will call the things.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.779
Your problem solving
capability that you never thought you had,

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:55.040
will be engaged
to get that kitten down from the tree.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.020
And pretty soon
the whole town's there with the fire department,

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.020
why?

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.300
Because the
kitten was helpless.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.990
It's this hero reflex.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.959
And these
conductors -- every single great conductor

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:07.399
that I played
for-- understood this and engaged my hero

00:17:07.399 --> 00:17:09.030
reflex in
doing this.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.030
And that's why I wanted to explain this.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.530
So I want to tell you one last story if you
have any questions, that will be interesting

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.059
to see how
this works.

00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:22.829
One of the biggest principles of applied
stupidity that I just love is let other people

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:24.630
solve the
problem.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.240
We are conditioned in classrooms to solve
problems.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.090
If I gave you a Rubik's Cube in a classroom,
you

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.090
wouldn't be able to resist it.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.050
You would all start
solving it.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:36.880
If I gave you all tests, you would just
immediately start as the train leaves Baltimore

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.020
at 40 miles
an hour.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:44.200
And this is how you get rewards in a classroom
environment, is who solves the most problems

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.610
the most
accurately.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.630
Whoever does that the most.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.490
It's a constant
conditioning.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.650
So let me tell you this story.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.809
This isn't
about a conductor but it's about an interesting

00:17:53.809 --> 00:17:54.809
manager.

00:17:54.809 --> 00:17:57.950
I was the de facto choreographer in the Pops.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.920
We always
were fooling around, spinning basses in certain

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.940
encore
pieces.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.620
And it was never official.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.809
We were never
supposed to do it.

00:18:04.809 --> 00:18:07.150
That was part of the fun is that we weren't
supposed to do it.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.920
We just did it anyway to disrupt the
concert.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.240
So John Williams is conducting and we're going
to Japan for our first big international tour.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.809
Two weeks
in five star hotels in Tokyo.

00:18:18.809 --> 00:18:20.450
It was fun.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.040
And I was
really looking forward to this because I was

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.610
ready to
spin basses in Tokyo and just have fun on

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:26.610
this tour.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.240
So
I get to Tokyo; I'm in Suntory Hall or wherever

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.050
and I open up the folder
to see which piece I'm going to have everybody

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.120
spin the
bass in, right?

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.740
So I'm looking through the encores.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.840
Well,
there's no spin in this piece; you can't do

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.860
it in any old piece.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.340
It has to be musically
appropriate.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.290
Because it's choreography.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.270
Well, there's
no spin in that.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.820
No spin in that.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.670
All the pieces that
we spun basses in -- John Williams is a great

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.800
guy.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.800
Fabulous musician.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.920
One of my favorite conductors of all
time.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.760
Very quiet guy.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.480
He's very shy.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.480
It's amazing.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.660
His
music is so huge and yet, personally, he's

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.500
just the shyest,
quietest man.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.540
And it was very subtle but very clear.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.040
He
didn't want me spinning the basses on this

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.740
tour in Japan.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.730
That's how he let me know he just very carefully--.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:13.730
Because it's hard.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.350
You have
to work hard to remove all those encores.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.290
So I had some
sake and mourned the loss and moved on with

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.760
my life.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.760
What do I care?

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.309
I get paid the same money whether I spin the
basses or not so I'm having fun.

00:19:25.309 --> 00:19:28.870
Well, the third night of
the tour, I'm backstage at Suntory Hall minding

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.090
my own
business.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.400
And I'll euphemize; I'll call her Suzy.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.800
This
is a very powerful person in the Pops organization,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.190
one of
the top managers.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:43.549
I never had the temerity to look this
woman in the eye, much less talk to her.

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:46.220
And you know I
just don't want to get in trouble.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.210
But anyway I'm
standing there minding my own business.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.770
Let's call her
Suzy.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.990
Suzy walks up to me backstage and starts yelling
at me.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.990
She's upset.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.400
She says, "Justin, Justin I have to
talk to you right away."

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.770
My heart is just pounding I'm so
scared.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.000
"Yes, yes, yes, Miss Suzy."

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.490
"The basses aren't spinning.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.790
The basses aren't spinning.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.510
Why aren't you spinning?"

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.880
I
was so shocked that she would ask this question;

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.200
I didn't
know what to say.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.410
And she just keeps yelling, "the basses
aren't spinning.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.410
The tour's in trouble.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.790
The promoters
are upset because they thought we'd spin the

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:17.790
basses.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.131
They were expecting all this stuff to happen
and you're

00:20:19.131 --> 00:20:20.131
not doing it.

00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:21.131
What is wrong with you.

00:20:21.131 --> 00:20:22.210
The basses--".

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.700
And
she was like -- I couldn't even -- I couldn't

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.320
even make
out what she was saying half the time.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.780
And I was trying
to calm her down.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.880
I said, "you don't understand there's no music
for us to spin to."

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.650
She would not listen to it.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.420
And she
finally is just waving her arms and just walks

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.549
away in
this upset state.

00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:45.580
And there I am, backstage at Suntory Hall,
you know, fifth chair bass player.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.370
It's not my job
to do this.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:51.530
Suddenly it's my fault that the tour is in
trouble.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:52.610
So I'm scratching my head.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:53.730
Well, I grew up on
a farm.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.250
I'm a self-reliant young man.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.990
Let's see if I
can solve this problem.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.990
So I go back to the music and
I went through every single encore and sure

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:06.580
enough in "Seventy-Six Trombones" there was
a musically appropriate spot where we

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.150
can spin the basses.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:12.370
So, I get the basses together and
we have a little talk about it and I get the

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:16.340
percussion
section involved in a little extra punch and

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.740
we're doing
the concert and we're going along.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.290
Now, in Japan
audiences are very, very quiet.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.840
It's not like Symphony
Hall here in Boston where we have to tell

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.020
everybody to
shush and be quiet because they're talking

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.480
so loud at the
beginning of the concert.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.630
They sit there like Mount Rushmore.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.600
It's just absolutely stone quiet.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.850
And it's a
pops concert.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:37.620
They're supposed to be laughing and having
fun but

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.600
instead they're just sitting there, just stone-faced.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.740
So we
get to this spin spot.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.980
I don't know what's going to
happen, but I yell out ready and -- and seven

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.550
basses go
twirling wildly and the percussion section

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.410
does a little
siren thing and this audience which had been

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.919
sitting
there like an ice sculpture for an hour and

00:21:55.919 --> 00:21:59.660
45 minutes
goes ape.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.990
They jump up.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.530
They're screaming, pointing.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.700
It's all in Japanese.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.120
I have no idea what they're
saying.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.710
And I could see Suzy off stage with all the
promoters and sponsors and they're all "Hai,

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:11.710
Hai".

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.040
Everybody's kissy-faced like this and we're
playing the

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:19.590
last sixteen bars and John Williams -- the
John Williams-- is up

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:25.140
on the podium conducting away looking right
at me [laughter] with

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.260
this defeated look like "Justin, I can't fire
you because

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.460
they're having so much fun but what am I going
to do with

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.770
you" look on his face.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.910
[laughter] And we're great friends.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.090
He calls
me "Le Voce"; I call him "maestro".

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.210
It's our little thing.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.840
But anyway, I have a little sequence of questions
to ask

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.240
you here which is first of all -- who did
all the work of

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.240
solving the problem.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.660
Who did all the brilliant work and
all the hard work solving the problem?

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.340
I did.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:54.240
Who took
all the risk of the solution proffered not

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.240
working.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.679
I
did.

00:22:56.679 --> 00:22:59.520
Who took all the heat from management that
didn't

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.420
like the solution.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.550
I did.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:08.090
Who got all the credit for
the solution that I came up with?

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.920
Suzy did.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.179
She did not
solve the problem.

00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:16.429
And for years, I walked around
thinking I was so smart because how is this

00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:20.480
woman who has
no brains who can't solve a simple problem.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.020
How is it
that she's making all this money in this wonderful

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.630
position and here I am such a brilliant guy
and I'm getting nothin' and I got no job

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:27.630
security.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:28.630
I finally figured it out.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.370
It took me 20 years
to realize, she was a whole lot smarter than

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.370
me.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.919
She was
using a principle of applied stupidity.

00:23:34.919 --> 00:23:40.299
So, that's just
one angle I do in the book how to use failure

00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:41.299
for
wonderful effect.

00:23:41.299 --> 00:23:43.600
How to use mistakes for wonderful
effect.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.610
How to not follow proper procedure for wonderful
effect.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.160
There's all these -- there's ten basic and
25

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.160
more advanced.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.270
And just to sort of wind it up here.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.660
One
of the main principles in the book is what

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.980
I call --
well, it's number 5.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:04.220
Which is fear of looking stupid is an
enormous force.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.870
The fear of looking stupid, which is
really the fear of feeling vulnerable of being

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:09.870
embarrassed.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:15.309
It has nothing to do with IQ -- is
constantly used -- actually that fear is magnified

00:24:15.309 --> 00:24:18.170
constantly by all kinds of ads.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.450
We have smart money.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.710
We
have smart banking.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.120
We have smart cars.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.210
What does that
mean?

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.830
It's all about smart things -- that's a good
thing.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:27.830
You should get that.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.910
All your neighbors will
admire you because it's smart.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.530
But you can't really
put -- you can't codify anything specific

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:35.740
about that.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.720
Anything that's stupid -- that's just something
you

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.130
disapprove of.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.679
And so, there's this fear that's kind of
lurking out there.

00:24:42.679 --> 00:24:47.870
You know, for me, I learned a lot of
fear of failure even though I was an A student

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:48.870
in school.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:52.150
I was terribly afraid of getting an F. I was
terrified of it.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.960
And I'm having a lot of fun now being a speaker
now, being an

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960
author.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960
I just wanted to do this.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.530
And I could have
started 20 years ago because I certainly knew

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.890
how to
write and I certainly knew how to talk but

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.550
I was afraid
of failing at it.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.390
So I kept looking for ways to do it
without failing.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.840
I was in this failure avoidance mode.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.580
And I just kept, you know, kind of in this
state of not

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.580
really going anywhere.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.980
I wasn't failing but I certainly
wasn't succeeding and I finally just out of

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.940
desperation
or disgust, I'm just going to go and fail.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.370
And I
started printing books and I thought I would

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.559
have, you
know, all these self-published of boxes of

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:28.870
moldy books in
my garage and I keep selling out.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.220
10th printing of
these things.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.220
It's crazy.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.990
And I never thought I
would -- if I hadn't just gone and tried it

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.910
and made the
mistakes I never would have learned all these

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.000
things.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.371
So
I guess my mission in life, really, is to

00:25:42.371 --> 00:25:44.910
deal with not
about giving you a work around.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.419
You'll see there's no
Powerpoint here.

00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:47.500
There's no DVD.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.400
There's no workbook.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.419
There's no to do list.

00:25:50.419 --> 00:25:52.240
There's no 50 tips and tricks.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.030
I'm really kind of into a mental form of Toyota
lean

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.390
management.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.990
If you're afraid of something, if you're
afraid of failing, this is wasteful.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.990
If you're avoiding
failure, this is wasteful.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:05.960
This is not a efficient way
of getting to where you want to go.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.679
And I find that when
I deal with people as a coach or guru or speaker,

00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:13.299
I have
one goal and one goal only and that is to

00:26:13.299 --> 00:26:18.230
somehow remove
fear from people's thought processes because

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:22.230
there is so
much of it as a by-product of classroom conditioning

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.950
that
we don't really figure that in to what we're

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.280
getting out
of it as all these people who are now afraid

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.530
to try
anything new because of the fear that they've

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.570
acquired.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:34.030
So, I found that when I remove fear from someone
or

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:40.240
myself, what remains is consistently wonderful.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.540
It's
never expected and that's what these top conductors

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.540
did.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.140
They removed my fear of, "Oh, I might get
fired.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.590
Am I
going to get laughed at for presenting my

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:54.520
most intense,
emotional, vulnerable self to the audience?"

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.320
I'm afraid
of that for good reason.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.770
I don't want to be embarrassed.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:02.230
But the top conductors made it impossible
to do anything else but that.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.169
And all the also-rans did the exact opposite
of

00:27:04.169 --> 00:27:05.169
that.

00:27:05.169 --> 00:27:06.220
They made me very protective.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:13.160
And so, my one big
message for you today is, number 10 -- principle

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.270
number 10.

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.950
Embrace your inner idiot.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.880
And you can do this very
easily by using the principles of applied

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.410
stupidity.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.049
And
I want to thank Alex for inviting me over

00:27:23.049 --> 00:27:24.049
here today.

00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:25.240
It's
been really great to be here.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.980
Now, at this point
there's -- I'm going to try and use some principles

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:30.980
of
applied stupidity.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.650
I'm in an extremely vulnerable
position right now.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:37.210
I'm in a desperate state because if
I say are there any questions and no hands

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.670
go up, it's
going to look really bad.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.169
[laughter] So I'm hoping -- and this is
actually you can use a principle of applied

00:27:43.169 --> 00:27:44.169
stupidity
yourself.

00:27:44.169 --> 00:27:49.030
If one of you raises your hand and asks a
really dumb question, every one else in the

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:52.659
room is going to
say, "oh, I was too embarrassed to ask a question.

00:27:52.659 --> 00:27:56.460
But I
have such a better question than that."

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.169
So I'm hoping one
of you will just have the guts to ask a really

00:27:59.169 --> 00:28:01.330
awful
question and hopefully that will kick start

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.330
the rest of
it.

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:03.470
Do you have any questions for me today?

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:04.470
Yes, sir?

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:09.080
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I was wondering sometimes I wonder
about practice practice and

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.210
in many ways

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:11.630
&gt;&gt;Justin: Practice effects?

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.760
&gt;&gt;Male #1: people practicing too much.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.190
&gt;&gt;Justin: Oh, in music you mean.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.679
&gt;&gt;Male #1: In music and I think even in business.

00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:21.940
A lot of times I feel like
people perform better when they're taken out

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.490
of their
comfort zone because it kind of makes them

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:28.799
wake up, pay
attention, and be more alive and more focused

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:30.850
on what they're doing.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:32.900
&gt;&gt;Justin: That's absolutely true.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.340
I'll just repeat it for the
microphone people who practice too much.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.531
We have a
saying at Symphony Hall, which is "don't wear

00:28:39.531 --> 00:28:40.531
it out.

00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:41.600
Save it for the show".

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.730
First time I played with the Boston
Symphony, it was for Shostakovitch Tenth symphony.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.539
I had never heard it
seen it before.

00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:50.420
They called me at ten-fifteen for a ten o'clock
rehearsal.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.550
[chuckles] There I am trying to play this
piece.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.470
So I
came back between rehearsal and show and I'm

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:55.539
practicing.

00:28:55.539 --> 00:28:57.830
And the stage
manager poked his nose out the door and he

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.870
says, "don't
wear it out.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.320
Save it for the show."

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.580
I never forgot
that.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.650
I actually had a client, big company.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:07.650
Will remain
nameless.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:08.650
They have all these engineers.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:12.159
And I said to
the HR person, "what is your biggest problem?"

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:16.000
And they
said our biggest problem is the engineers

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.990
can't bear the
thought of making a mistake.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.710
So they spend three
times as much time doing stuff because they

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.539
can't bear
the thought of having an error and everyone

00:29:25.539 --> 00:29:27.910
else pointing
at them and saying "oh, you made a mistake".

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.720
And you're much better off doing--.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:34.751
Definitely in
the music world, in the amateur realm, people

00:29:34.751 --> 00:29:37.860
just rehearse
and rehearse and rehearse into the ground.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.370
And the
better conductors, Bernard Haitink is classic

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:42.370
for this.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.580
He lets
everybody go an hour early because everybody

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.010
likes that.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.130
They play better because they like him.

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.220
So yeah, I'm
just reinforcing.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.220
Absolutely.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.440
Yes, dear, back there.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:03.409
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I think that makes sense and
I feel, like, for a business person, usually

00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:04.409
that's true.

00:30:04.409 --> 00:30:06.130
But is it true with, like, for kids that,
you know, that are new at something.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.130
It's because you guys
are all skilled when you use the Boston orchestra

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.640
and stuff, that's,
like, a skilled group of people that have

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:15.150
already reached
a certain level that can get away with not

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:16.150
practicing.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.150
Do you know what I mean?

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:18.150
&gt;&gt;Justin: Yes, I understand your question.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.150
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Has to be reached before that
philosophy can be.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.150
&gt;&gt;Justin: Well, I'm always afraid someone's
going to ask that

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:21.150
question because it's a really good one.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.860
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Because I have kids and they
never want to practice

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:24.860
&gt;&gt;Justin: They never want
to practice of course.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:31.419
Well, I'll tell you what happened
to me was that -- I was 19-years-old and the

00:30:31.419 --> 00:30:34.280
phone rang
and Boston Pops was kind of desperate and

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:39.559
they hired me
and I was not really ready to play in a major

00:30:39.559 --> 00:30:40.559
orchestra.

00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:46.190
So I went in and they don't slow down for
you.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.190
They
just -- my first rehearsal of Beethoven's

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.960
Fifth with them was
"Da-da da-da; da-da-da-da.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.890
That's fine, see you tonight".

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:54.890
What?

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:55.890
Excuse
me?

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.790
But well, we hired you.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:58.929
You must know it.

00:30:58.929 --> 00:31:01.500
And
there's this constant expectation that, well,

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.559
you must know
this and they put you in a position where

00:31:03.559 --> 00:31:06.340
you're going to
be embarrassed tonight but we don't we're

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.669
assuming that
you can do this.

00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:08.669
We're trusting you.

00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:11.230
And when people --
I did an article on this called the Power

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.429
of Trust.

00:31:12.429 --> 00:31:16.340
When I guess when Leonard
Bernstein is conducting you, he's got this

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:21.970
aura of saying,
you know -- I'm sorry, your first name is?

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.660
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Gunther, Gunther
&gt;&gt;Justin: Oh, great.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.090
[laughs]
Couldn't be Dave or Bob.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:33.850
So, if I'm Leonard Bernstein, I'm gonna say
to you,

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.330
"look, you're the best bass player I've ever
seen and I

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.330
can't wait to hear you play tonight.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.890
But I have this power of
perception.

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:43.440
You're even better than you thought you were
and I'm so excited.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.610
I
hurt my arm so you're going to have to lead

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.610
it tonight.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:47.610
Good luck."

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.640
And they would constantly put you on the spot
of having

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.780
to do these things.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:57.940
Yes, it is a situation where these
are very accomplished people.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.159
But I played for Leonard
Bernstein when I was in high school.

00:32:00.159 --> 00:32:02.660
He came to a high
school thing at Tanglewood we did.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.039
And he treated us the same as he treated the
Boston Symphony.

00:32:06.039 --> 00:32:09.289
He just stood there and said, "boy, you
guys just sound fantastic".

00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:11.760
And when Leonard Bernstein
says that, you're just like, "well, we could

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.809
be more
fantastic.

00:32:12.809 --> 00:32:14.330
Hang on."

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.559
[laughter] It was not this thing, "oh, you
made a mistake; let's fix your mistake."

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:21.480
You can't really
fix mistakes to greatness.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.480
That never gets you there.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.840
There has to be this higher goal which now
the mistakes

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.860
become--.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.960
Just one day, I said I got tired of making
mistakes.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.460
I
did and I went home and I practiced eight

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:31.460
hours a day.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.820
I
was insane.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.340
I'd start at midnight and go till dawn.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.370
I
was crazy.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.370
Believe me.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.690
That's another story.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.299
I
practiced scales and arpeggios eight hours

00:32:40.299 --> 00:32:41.299
a day.

00:32:41.299 --> 00:32:43.740
At the
end of that, I knew where B flat was.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.580
I never had to
guess or pray.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.049
Again, I knew where B flat was; it just wasn't
a thing.

00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:50.150
But I
had to get that motivation going first.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.590
Without that,
you know then.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.190
If they don't really want to do it,
then you're swimming upstream.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.370
But that's an excellent
question.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.480
I hope I tried to address it.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.559
But you know it
depends on the dynamic of the group and the

00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:01.559
interests.

00:33:01.559 --> 00:33:07.490
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I shared a story where a manager
yells at a subordinate to get

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.490
something done.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:09.490
&gt;&gt;Justin: Yes

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.720
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Subordinate gets something done.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.240
What's
stupid about this about that.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.920
&gt;&gt;Justin: Well, let's see.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.320
What is stupid about that?

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.890
If
he's -- well, I'm not sure I understand your

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:20.890
question.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:21.890
You mean what is wrong with it?

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.540
&gt;&gt;Male #3: You're claiming that she's somehow
stupid.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:29.440
She may
not know how to do it, but does she have to?

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.540
She's in a
position where she manages.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.570
&gt;&gt;Justin: So often what would happen is we
would

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.960
managers in my world, you get people who,
if she had come to me and said, "Justin, we

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.160
have
this problem.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:46.070
And I have a solution for it and here's
the solution I want you to execute this tonight."

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.370
Since I
did not own that solution because I did not

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:49.570
come up with
myself.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:54.020
We have to do it with gusto otherwise it doesn't
work.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.010
That would have put me into passive obedience
mode

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.520
of executing Suzy's solution.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.580
Suzy said to do this.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.580
Okay.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.789
What's the bare minimum we have to do to make
Suzy

00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:05.300
not dissatisfied.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.340
And you always get up to just that level.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.710
that kind of thing as opposed to there's no
net.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.599
So now you have to really pay attention because
now it's

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:16.649
my solution and in that environment.

00:34:16.649 --> 00:34:19.950
It's kind of like
when you get on a plane and you decide you

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:22.550
want to get
the in-flight magazine and do the cross word

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:25.840
puzzle and
someone else has already done it.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.540
It's not rational to
be unhappy about this because the problem

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:29.700
has
been solved.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.300
But people like to solve problems.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:36.419
My
point is, my angle on this is, if you see

00:34:36.419 --> 00:34:40.050
a problem,
people like to solve problems.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:44.360
That's a preexisting
energy to tap into as opposed to just demanding

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.500
that they
solve the problem.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.280
Understand they want to solve the
problem.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.270
They're eager to solve it.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.429
Now they have a
chance to be a hero because you tried to solve

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:53.429
it and you
couldn't.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:54.429
Now they get to show off how smart they are.

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:57.770
These are little subtle mind games that you're
playing

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:00.300
here that's really the point of the idea that
you get

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.380
into this realm of doing that secretly.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.470
So that's the
best I can answer that question.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.690
I hope that was good
enough.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.140
More questions I hope?

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.140
One more?

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.140
Yes.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.140
Go
ahead.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.140
Sure.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.140
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Yeah, it's kind of a question,
but with background.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.900
So I have a question about the classroom conditioning
aspect that you're talking about.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.460
Is that like an actual
study or research because I'm asking because

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:23.839
I used to be
a teacher and I was the big focus of mine

00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:27.190
to fail in
front of my students because I always thought

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:28.370
it was
difficult as a student myself to feel comfortable

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:29.370
about
failing.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:30.370
So every day in New York City you have to
have

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:34.310
like a "do now" and we would do an activity.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:37.700
It's an
activity you do in front of the classroom.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.700
And I would
do something in my head called "what went

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.740
wrong and why". and I would
make a mistake and students had to figure

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.660
out what
I did wrong.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.800
They would actually have to acknowledge that
I

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.800
did something wrong.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.800
If they didn't catch it, we would
go over it.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.010
So I wanted to know because this is actually
a popular thing that a lot of teachers do

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.010
now.

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.540
When did
you do this research for this?

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.650
&gt;&gt;Justin: I just came up with this last week
[laughter] I'm

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:58.720
sorry.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.060
I love to say that I had a mound of research
but

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.060
I don't.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.800
It's just kind of built up between -- I have
a

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.980
different perspective on things because first
of all I'm

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:10.980
an anachronism.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.190
I grew up on a farm.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:15.260
Most people are not
farm boys anymore because we don't have farms

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.260
anymore.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.820
And the other is I then grew up in a musical
environment

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.359
on Symphony Hall which is really a 300-year-old
culture

00:36:23.359 --> 00:36:26.020
which is very different from what kind of
happened around

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.500
the beginning of the industrial revolution
where

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.770
classrooms were created with these compartmentalized,
here's an English teacher, here's a math teacher,

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:38.070
here's a science teacher as opposed to tutors
or apprenticeships were kind of the norm before

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:44.690
that because we had a specific population
issues I just had a really bad time in school

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.250
even though I was a top student.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:49.400
It traumatized me in a lot of ways.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.359
I'm very sensitive to this in other people.

00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:55.089
So I was approaching this, not a researcher
but as an artist.

00:36:55.089 --> 00:36:56.540
So if it's incorrect, well, sorry.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.130
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I agree with the overarching

00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:59.840
theme; I was just curious.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.690
I do think that is a big problem, obviously.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.020
&gt;&gt;Justin: Well, thank-you.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.020
I'm always glad to hear that.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.510
I'm always worried someone's going to call
me out and show me to be a total idiot.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.500
What do you want, it's a book about stupidity.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.730
[laughter] You always have that safety zone.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.840
Yeah, I think this isn't really addressed
enough.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.560
We've become 'education-happy' in this country.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.160
We're becoming test-score-happy, college-happy.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.160
It's very strange to me.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.400
I'm going to get on my soapbox and say I think
should be educated, yes, but when you see

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.230
people saying "all of our kids went to college"
and it's like "all of our kids bought a saw".

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.300
It's a tool; it's not a goal in life.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.599
It's something that you use to try to get
to where you're going in life, ten, twelve

00:37:38.599 --> 00:37:40.349
years down the road.

00:37:40.349 --> 00:37:45.520
And it becomes almost a state-sponsored religion
in terms of its morality.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.520
I discovered this--.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.630
I wrote a play, it was called "Peter versus
the Wolf".

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:56.839
One of the lines in the show with the judge
of this trial uses the word 'irregardless'.

00:37:56.839 --> 00:37:58.940
And people cringe when they hear this word.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:04.430
I was trying to imply that the judge wasn't
very smart because she says 'irregardless

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:08.280
of the metaphoricalness of the situation';
that was the line.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.490
And people would come up to me after--.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:14.339
This was in Spokane and Texas and Massachusetts
and they would pull me aside like my fly was

00:38:14.339 --> 00:38:15.849
open [laughter], you know, in the voice.

00:38:15.849 --> 00:38:20.869
"Hey, Justin", and they'd look around, "irregardless
is not a word".

00:38:20.869 --> 00:38:24.780
And I'd look at 'em and say "metaphoricalness
isn't a word either".

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.710
[laughter] No one seems to be bothered about
that.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.400
To me, this is evidence of trauma.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.820
This is evidence of trauma.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.600
I just see people who are always coming to
me with "how can I write a book like this?".

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.530
And I say "well, you gotta take a pen and
actually, like, write the first letter of

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.470
the first word".

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:43.740
And they freeze.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:48.190
[laughter] Because they have to get over all
this fear and trauma, 'will I make a mistake',

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.839
'will I fail', 'what will people think of
it'.

00:38:50.839 --> 00:38:55.980
And for me it was about getting the technique
of overcoming that fear and that trauma that

00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.430
allowed me to be much more effective and creative
and stand up in front of some of the smartest

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:03.080
people around and talk about a book on stupidity.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:07.650
Let's face it folks, this is pretty bizarre
when you think about it.

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.930
I'm making mistakes constantly, even as I'm
standing up here.

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:11.930
But that's OK.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:15.800
I'm trying to connect with you and hopefully
make peoples' lives better.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.440
And I cannot be perfect when I do that.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:22.510
In fact, the whole concept of perfection,
on a test, why do we teach this as a goal?

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.510
You can't be perfect.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:25.849
You can be better but you can never be perfect.

00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:27.830
It's very bizarre to me.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.890
But again, that's the classroom conditioning.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:32.280
And you get this model of 'perfection is possible'.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:36.300
Now I look at myself, "oh, I'm not perfect,
I have no right to be".

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.650
So, I'm trying to combat what I feel is some
negativity.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:44.599
It's just basic fear, it's fear, in its many
manifestations and forms.

00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:46.460
Evil is a manifestation of fear.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.080
So I'm just trying to do my bit.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.960
I'm trying to do my bit very imperfectly but
thank-you very much for that.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.020
I appreciate the thought.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:58.600
I'm hoping that people are --. There's something
called emotional fractals.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.820
There's nothing that I'm
doing here that is unique.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.140
Everybody else is doing a
version of it.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.890
People are trying, thinking about it and
trying to fix things.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:07.320
They're doing their own version of
it.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.410
And what I'm trying to do is kind of reinforce
the fractals of people who are

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:13.700
doing good things themselves, somewhere else.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.580
And just have the courage to come out and
say well, how about

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.930
this and see where it goes.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:18.930
You just never know.

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:21.070
So
more questions I hope?

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.339
Even dumb ones would be
appreciated.

00:40:22.339 --> 00:40:23.339
Yes, sir?

00:40:23.339 --> 00:40:29.130
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Well, first you don't have to call
me sir since we're

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.130
friends.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:34.109
[laughter] When you decided to write your
first book which

00:40:34.109 --> 00:40:37.580
was Real Men Don't Rehearse.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.930
Did you have this fear of
failure back then is this that was before

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.099
Principles of
Applied Stupidity.

00:40:42.099 --> 00:40:43.380
So did you have a fear?

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.930
You went to the publishers and you thought
they

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.470
were going to laugh you out of the office?

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.290
&gt;&gt;Justin: Oh, this is a good story.

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:52.180
He's asking you about my
first book which is my Boston Pops memoir,

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:56.400
Real Men
Don't Rehearse which is just my Pops war stories.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.090
I
always wanted to be an author but I was like

00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:59.500
how can I do
this?

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.910
Well, first I went to the bookstore and there's
a

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:06.130
whole bunch of books on how to be an author.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:09.930
I call this
the wannabe author exploitation market and

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:12.551
they have all
these books on how to write a book and they're

00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:14.740
all 25
dollars and I paid it happily.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.810
And then there are
books that have every single literary agent

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.849
in the world is listed in these books.

00:41:18.849 --> 00:41:21.640
And they have these
instructions about how to write a query letter

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.210
to get
published.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:28.880
I had this vision of a house in a nice little
town in Vermont with a white picket fence

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.619
and I was going
to have a little office in there.

00:41:31.619 --> 00:41:34.480
I was just going to
get royalty checks every two weeks of 100,

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.210
000 dollars a
pop and I was going to live this glorious

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:39.640
-- this was my
dream.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.170
And so, how do I do this?

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:45.060
Well, of course I
follow the instructions in these books not

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.400
realizing that
I was going to look exactly like the 2 million

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.320
other
people who were following these instructions,

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.960
sending the
exact same query letter to the exact same

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.440
400 literary
agent.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.510
I spent 400 dollars on stamps and didn't even
write -- Real

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.940
Men Don't Rehearse is not my first book.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.690
I wrote a
relationship book.

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.089
I wrote a cookbook.

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:06.089
What else did I
write?

00:42:06.089 --> 00:42:08.690
Oh, I wrote a giant Hallmark card.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.120
It was like
Chicken Soup for the Soul.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:15.010
Because I was imitating what
I saw other people succeeding at as opposed

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:19.079
to being
myself which is Justin Locke, who's a snarky

00:42:19.079 --> 00:42:22.320
ex-bass player
with a lot of good stories.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.170
Who would, who would want to
buy that?

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:28.970
And finally just -- I got fired from score
reading and I said at that point -- that's

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:29.970
a long story.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.260
I work for the TV shows of the Pops.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.849
At that point I said oh,
well I can't lose any money by writing my

00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:38.250
scandalous,
salacious memoir about playing for the Pops.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:41.080
It was really therapy
to just sit down and write all these funny

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:45.200
stories of
backstage concert disasters.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.849
And I submitted this to
about 50 literary agents or so.

00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:53.300
Every single one of them
says, "Justin, this is a really funny book.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.079
Who wants to
read a book about a bass player?

00:42:56.079 --> 00:42:57.079
Don't see a market for
it."

00:42:57.079 --> 00:42:59.940
I said, "well, how about all the other bass
players?"

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.310
And they just looked at me funny at that point.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:04.590
[laughter] I kept
getting this same response.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:07.250
I said you know somebody's going to
buy this.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:09.050
I'm just going to give it a shot.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:11.760
And I, you
know, pulled out my credit card and went to

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.380
a guy who did
wedding invitations down in Lakeville, Massachusetts.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.270
And he printed up my book, 300 copies.

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:20.230
I gave it to a friend of mine who gave it
to Paul

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:24.510
Sullivan who's the host of the WBZ/CBS radio
show.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.869
He loved it
and he wanted to promote the Fourth of July

00:43:27.869 --> 00:43:28.869
Pops show.

00:43:28.869 --> 00:43:31.869
So he invited me down to WBZ to be on for
ten minutes on

00:43:31.869 --> 00:43:33.050
national radio.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.980
This is two months after self-publishing my
first

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.270
book.

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:40.030
And well, the other guests didn't show up
and I

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:41.859
was an hour early because I didn't want to
be late.

00:43:41.859 --> 00:43:42.960
He
brings me in.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.849
I start talking about the switchboard
lights up because everybody wants to tell

00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:48.180
their Arthur
Fiedler story.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.260
They all wanted to reminisce about Arthur
Fiedler.

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:56.020
I was live coast to coast for two hours
talking about Real Men Don't Rehearse.

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.780
And you know here
I had all these other books that were not

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:00.780
me.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:01.780
I wasn't
being myself.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:06.030
I was imitating to be safe because I
didn't want to be rejected.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:07.160
I didn't want to fail.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.369
When
I actually put my true self out for people

00:44:10.369 --> 00:44:12.880
to -- because
I was horrified by the idea of printing a

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.441
book and
handing it to you and say would you like to

00:44:16.441 --> 00:44:19.810
buy my book
please sir and if you said no I would just

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:23.810
fall into a
puddle of shame and self-doubt and self-loathing.

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:26.201
I was
completely locked up by it.

00:44:26.201 --> 00:44:27.720
I was paralyzed by it.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.940
And
finally one day I said, "the hell with everything.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.910
I'm going to
publish it anyway."

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:33.400
And low and behold it just worked.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:36.050
My whole bass playing career worked like that.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:37.250
I just
kept falling into things.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:38.250
Principles.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.780
I just ran into
Mary Richardson at Planet Fitness one day

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.849
and I knew her
vaguely from Channel Five.

00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:44.990
"Justin what are you up to?"

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.349
"I just wrote a book, called
Principles of Applied Stupidity."

00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:49.400
Two weeks later, I was
on Chronicle.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:53.030
They did a whole show about me.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:55.240
There's
no -- you can always get into these structures

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.910
and
procedures but consistently they just lead

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:00.230
you into this
path of conformity.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:02.160
And I find if you just go out and
say "Well, here I am.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.070
I'm imperfect but I'm doing my best shot",
people warm

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.660
to that.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.970
People recognize their own vulnerability and
their own isolation with that.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.099
And this is what, again
what Arthur Fiedler did.

00:45:13.099 --> 00:45:16.359
This guy -- he liked to go to
fires.

00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:19.000
He would chase around to look at buildings
burning.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.650
He just loved that.

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:24.310
[audience chuckles] Can you imagine, you know,
Keith Lockhart,

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:25.520
oh my goodness.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.050
He likes fires.

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:29.640
[laughter] What would
the press office do with that.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.000
But he had this
personality.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000
And he was honest.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.470
He was true to himself.

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.430
And I guess that's what I'd like to say to
people.

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:38.450
There's so much pressure on us to conform.

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:41.350
So much
pressure on us to get this car and this clothing

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:45.060
and this makeup and
this surgery and this whatever.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.460
You know, a lot of people I
find don't see the beauty in themselves.

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:52.000
I didn't see
the beauty or talent in myself for a long

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
time.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
So I'm
trying to share that with people.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.250
That's what this is
about.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:57.340
Thank you very much for asking that question
and prompting

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.859
a very long speech.

00:45:59.859 --> 00:46:01.359
Anyway.

00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:02.790
Any more questions,
comments?

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:04.000
I'm open for that.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.140
Yes sir.

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:12.950
&gt;&gt;Male #5: You mentioned the hero reflex and
it's like tricking

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:17.339
the people around you into building their
untapped reserved.

00:46:17.339 --> 00:46:18.339
&gt;&gt;Justin: Yes.

00:46:18.339 --> 00:46:23.740
&gt;&gt;Male #5: I wonder how much can this exhaust
this resource?

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:28.210
If
they run on this hero thing all the time will

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:30.890
it crash
and burn?

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:32.920
Can the society handle that.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.320
&gt;&gt;Justin: That's a very good question.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.320
Would we crash and burn?

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.320
I don't know.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:41.170
It's something that I just encountered
this on a daily basis at a the Boston Symphony

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:42.170
and Boston
Pops.

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:43.619
This is how they operated.

00:46:43.619 --> 00:46:45.849
And you can't do it 9 to 5.

00:46:45.849 --> 00:46:50.040
A workweek at the
symphony is 21 and a half hours and you are

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.990
completely
burned out from those 21.

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:55.670
Because when you're in a
rehearsal or performance with them, you're

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:58.330
absolutely at your
highest level and you have to go home and

00:46:58.330 --> 00:46:59.330
sleep.

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:01.440
There
was actually a study about music students

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.960
that the better
ones actually slept more and practiced less

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.540
because they
were very intense when they practiced and

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:07.940
I do subscribe
to that.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.630
It always surprises me.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:13.800
I've never had a 9 to
5 job so I have difficulty relating to how

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.650
do you work
intensely from 9 to 5?

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:18.280
I don't think you can.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.440
So would
you rather -- it might be better to just say

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:25.000
okay we're
going to have what we call services.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Service week.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.440
Eight or nine service weeks.

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.280
And you can have five concerts
and four shows.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.349
I mean, five rehearsals and four shows
or 3 rehearsals and six shows.

00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:35.960
However you want to do
it.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.550
But that's kind of how you manage the resource.

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:42.010
It's a resource like any other; it's not infinite.

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:43.010
How do you manage it?

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:44.010
I
don't know.

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:45.970
If it's an orchestra I can tell you how to
do it.

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:48.720
But otherwise I'm just sharing the orchestra
culture.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.720
But thank you for that question.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.720
It's a really
good one.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.840
Boy, you guys ask good questions.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.760
You're so
smart.

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.760
Go ahead.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:56.760
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Don't say the word smart.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:01.500
It's funny because those
were the two words I didn't allow in my classroom,

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.710
smart and
stupid..

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:03.960
&gt;&gt;Justin: Very interesting.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.010
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Smart is a fixed thing.

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:10.930
You tell a kid smart and they
don't work harder to be intelligent.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.480
&gt;&gt;Justin: Well, this is true.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.420
I actually suffered from that
being the A student all the time.

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:19.910
When I got out of
school, I was completely unprepared for life.

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:21.869
The first
time I sat down to do my taxes, I thought

00:48:21.869 --> 00:48:23.230
it would be like
the SATs.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:26.250
Okay, I'll just answer all the questions.

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:27.940
Non-farm income?

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.250
[laughter] What is that?

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:31.670
April 14th.

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:34.910
I had quite
a meltdown that day trying to do that.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:36.589
I was much better
off.

00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:38.540
I think the kids who failed a lot in school
were

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.201
much better prepared for life when they got
out of school than I was.

00:48:41.201 --> 00:48:43.600
I went through
a lot of failure training.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.740
And I said okay how do you
recover from this.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.000
How do you do that.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.680
It's a big
topic.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.680
What is smart?

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.680
what is stupid?

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.680
It's traumatizing.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.349
I just want to open that discussion for folks.

00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:57.560
When I
first wrote the book some people that I think

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.660
are very
smart on my personal board of directors got

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:03.530
very upset
with me because they had issues with the word

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:04.630
stupid.

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.050
You'll find there are people who just they
were told they

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.500
were stupid when they were ten years old by
somebody and

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.260
now it's like an un-lanced boil.

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.900
They're emotional issues like
this lurking all the time.

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.940
And what these top conductors
did they always went around that instead of

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.500
trying to go
through it.

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:28.070
Well, if you have to read the book I guess
for getting all the little techniques to use

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:31.089
that making
mistakes at just the right point.

00:49:31.089 --> 00:49:34.230
Anyway one more going
going?

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.230
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:38.980
Alex, Shannon, and Google
thank you for giving me this platform to speak.

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.070
I really
appreciate it.

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:42.849
Thank you for staying and asking
wonderful questions.

00:49:42.849 --> 00:49:43.910
It's great to be here.

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:44.910
Thank you.

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.911
[Applause]
