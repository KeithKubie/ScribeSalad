Use Telnet to make a request to www.example.com.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The request is going to be a get request for the path slash.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Remember to use http 1.0, it will make your life a little bit easier.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When you do this, I want you to answer

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
a few questions for me.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
First--what is the status code in the response?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And second--what is the value of the location header?
