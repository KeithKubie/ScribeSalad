RACHEL AMERA: Hi.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900
I'm Rachel Amera, and I'm based
in the San Francisco office

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.820
usually.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.840
I'm part of the gPause Program.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.070
I'm a volunteer to help bring
in speakers and coordinate that.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.180
And today I'm really excited
to bring in Doctor Leslie Carr.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.140
Doctor Carr is here
to talk about why

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.160
being present in
any relationship

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.400
is vital for
emotional well-being

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.480
and emotional health.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.890
So this is going to be a
great talk for all of us.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.270
We all have
relationships, I think.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.460
Whether it's at work, whether
it's in your personal life,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.640
with your family,
relationships are everywhere.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.510
It's really what
is the groundwork

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.385
for a lot of what we do.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:40.010
So today, we're going
to talk about how

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.680
we can improve any of those,
which is I think not only

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.280
important for work,
but in any case

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.380
and in any aspect of our lives.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.490
Again, we'll look at things
like the interpersonal science

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.480
behind that, too.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.440
So that's part of what
we want to bring out

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.340
in the gPause
Program, is what is

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.920
going on in the world
of learning more

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.590
about this from a
scientific standpoint,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.680
a neuroscience standpoint.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.064
So Doctor Carr is going
to talk about that, too.

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:04.439
And then we're
going to all learn

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.563
how to be better listeners.

00:01:05.563 --> 00:01:07.970
We're going to learn how
we can tune in, literally,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.980
to other people so
we can feel more

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.350
supported by our own presence.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.170
And I think that is a skill
that I know I could use and get

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.010
more of, and I think all of us
would like to learn more of.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.340
Doctor Carr is a licensed
clinical psychologist

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.240
who works out of San
Francisco, and she's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.940
a published author for
MindBodyGreen, the newsletter

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.400
in "The Huffington Post."

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.090
So without further ado,
I will introduce Leslie.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.475
Thank you for coming today.

00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:34.982
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:39.610
LESLIE CARR: Thank you so
much, Rachel, and thank you

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.620
all for being here.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.350
Since we're here today to
talk about mindfulness,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.990
I just want to begin by
allowing us to take a moment

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.529
to just shift gears.

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:51.070
Perhaps we can all
just take a minute

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.910
to forget about anything that
we were doing before we came

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.917
into this room, just give
ourselves permission to not

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:00.500
think about anything
that you're going

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.160
to do when you leave here.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.623
Take a minute to just feel
your butt in your seats.

00:02:07.623 --> 00:02:09.039
Since I'm standing,
I'm just going

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.630
to take a minute to really
feel my feet on the ground.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.720
And perhaps you can
just give yourself

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.450
a moment to allow
your eyes to fall

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.410
on anything that is in your
natural field of vision.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.410
And just take a
moment and look at it.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.080
Take a deep breath.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.310
For those of you who don't
know what mindfulness

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.860
is-- I know a couple of you
raised your hands before saying

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.420
that this is unfamiliar
territory for you-- when we

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.890
talk about mindfulness,
this is really

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.960
what we're talking about.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.730
We're really just talking
about present moment awareness.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.170
It's a certain type
of psychological state

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.200
that involves thinking less
about the past and the future

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.210
and more about what's actually
happening right in front of us.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.370
Unfortunately, it
sounds so simple,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.210
but I think in reality, in the
Western world, very few of us

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.720
spend much time here.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.160
And what I'm going to be
talking to you about today

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.270
is how we can use that type
of psychological attention

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.850
in our relationships to be
more present with one another

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.430
and to make us better listeners.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.530
And it is absolutely
not an exaggeration

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.680
to say that using
these skills actually

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.090
has a measurable impact
on our mental health,

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.790
and on the mental
health of the people

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.170
that we are having
conversations with,

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.410
existing in relationship
with, and that kind of stuff.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.460
So without further ado, I want
to take a moment just before we

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.110
really dig in here to
speak for just a minute

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.620
about mental health in general.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.430
Because I'm not
here today to talk

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.594
about mental
illness-- if anything,

00:03:49.594 --> 00:03:51.510
I'm actually here to
talk about mental health,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.039
but these are very
interrelated concepts.

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:56.830
And I think it's
important to kind of start

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.690
by defining our terms a little
bit and just making sure

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.090
that the train is moving
in the right direction.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.190
So maybe I can just
start with a question.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.440
Raise your hand if you
think of mental illness

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.380
as being created by chemical
imbalances in the brain,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.870
if you think of it as
being a largely genetic

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.519
or biochemical experience.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.890
Perhaps you could-- OK.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.510
So that gives me certainly
a frame of reference.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.170
I'd say probably 50% of you
roughly raised your hands.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.660
And I'm not surprised by that.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.790
If anything, I'm
sort of surprised

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.289
that more people didn't raise
their hands, just because that

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.880
is something that-- it's an idea
that exists in popular culture

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.690
absolutely.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.710
I think that we are
really steeped in the idea

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.200
that our mental health
experiences are created largely

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.599
by genes and biochemistry.

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.640
And I'm not here to say
that that isn't the case.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.820
I'm not here to say
that genes don't

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.709
matter, that our
biochemistry doesn't matter.

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:53.250
But I think that there is this
other piece of the puzzle that

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.810
doesn't get nearly as
much air time, which

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.080
is the role that things like
our relationships and our life

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.700
experiences play in our mental
health or mental illness.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.560
We have traumatic
experiences, we respond

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.907
to those traumatic experiences.

00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:10.490
Believe it or not,
we have experiences

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.300
that are entirely mundane, and
we learn from those experiences

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.155
and take them forward with us.

00:05:16.155 --> 00:05:19.455
So I guess what I want
to make clear right now

00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:21.830
is just that it's not that
genes and biochemistry doesn't

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.320
matter, but what I'm going to
be talking to you about today

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.070
primarily is this other piece,
the piece of our relationships

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.900
and the experiences
that we have.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.000
And just to drive this
point home, in case

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.550
this is confusing for
anybody, something

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.130
that I just want to
really make clear

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.090
is that because of this thing
that we call epigenetics,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.800
we have to sort of
recognize that even

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.770
if we possess the
gene for something,

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.420
or even if there's a biological
proclivity toward something,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.640
our life experiences, whether
we're exposed to toxins,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.230
whether we have good
relationships in our lives,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.110
these things have the power
to quite literally turn genes

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.490
on and off and affect
their expression.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.199
So I think this is
really important stuff

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.240
that we're talking about.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.280
There's actually amazing
cutting-edge research

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.380
going on right now showing
that people who are chronically

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.530
lonely are more likely
to be aggressive,

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.340
and it quite literally is
turning genes on and off

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.540
that are impacting how people
are behaving in the world based

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.940
on just the experience of
being chronically lonely.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:30.360
So I am going to zip you through
about 70 years of research

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.770
in my field and tell
you a couple of stories

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.500
that I think will help
to explain the way I

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.480
look at some of this stuff.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.190
And perhaps we'll
take it from there.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:49.110
The first story that I want to
tell you takes us back to 1945.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.026
We were starting to
realize-- at the time,

00:06:52.026 --> 00:06:53.400
people were starting
to realize--

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.250
that we had a really
big problem happening

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.010
in our orphanage system,
because orphans were dying

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.460
at a really alarming rate,
a rate that greatly outpaced

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.590
children in the
general population.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.650
And at first, naturally
they thought that this

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.070
was an immunity issue.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.700
The concern was
really just that there

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.460
were so many babies and nurses
and people in a relatively

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.720
contained environment that it
was creating a situation where

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.400
just germs were really thriving
and the kids were getting sick.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.340
The problem was that
their reaction to this

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.310
was to kind of batten
down the hatches

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.527
and to do things like
touch the children less.

00:07:33.527 --> 00:07:35.360
They actually went so
far in some orphanages

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.030
to put up sheets
between the cribs

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.950
so that the kids were
totally and completely

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.142
separated from one another,
separated from their caregivers

00:07:43.142 --> 00:07:44.100
and that kind of stuff.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.040
And their nurses were
told to touch them

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.570
as little as possible,
to touch them

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.180
just enough to change their
diapers and hand them a bottle.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.240
And the problem
actually got worse.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.470
It became even more extreme.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.260
So 1945 again, a
psychoanalyst and physician

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.670
named Rene Spitz decided that he
wanted to take a look at this.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.522
And he created a bit of a--
we actually wouldn't really

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:11.980
call it an experiment
today, but he

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.438
wanted to investigate
the situation

00:08:13.438 --> 00:08:18.160
by comparing the children
in these orphanages

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.860
to children who were being
raised in the prison system

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.714
by their mothers because their
mothers had been incarcerated.

00:08:23.714 --> 00:08:25.130
Because there
obviously were a lot

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.310
of similarities between
these environments,

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.830
just a lot of people in a small
space, less access to things

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.840
like natural air and
that kind of stuff.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.460
And in the time that
Doctor Spitz was reviewing

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.572
this information,
37% of the kids

00:08:42.572 --> 00:08:45.030
in the orphanage-- it was an
American orphanage that he was

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.220
looking at-- 37% of the kids
between the ages of zero

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.640
and three died, and none of
the children in the prison

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.300
population died.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.720
And when they looked at the
data, what they realized

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.304
was that the only difference
between these babies

00:09:00.304 --> 00:09:02.720
was the fact that the ones who
were being raised in prison

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.178
were being raised
by their mothers,

00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:07.850
there were people around, and
the ones in the orphanages

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.770
were not really having any
contact with people at all.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.750
And it's definitely worth noting
that not only were the kids

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.870
dying, but for the kids
who were not dying,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.260
they were really
not doing very well.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.320
They were psychiatrically
not doing very well.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.860
They had lower IQs than kids
in the general population

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.910
or the kids in the prison did.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.510
Eventually they were developing
physical disabilities,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.920
because they weren't able
to get around and crawl.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.840
And one of the reasons
why this research was

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.260
so groundbreaking at the
time that it came out

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.080
was because mothers in
the 1940s were actually

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.670
told that they shouldn't
touch their children too much

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.700
because it might spoil them.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.640
And this was one of the first
things that made people really

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.020
question that advice,
which brings us

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.960
to the next major
piece of research that

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.990
came on its heels.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.510
It was a psychologist
named Harry Harlow

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.070
who was working out of the
University of Wisconsin

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.340
at the time.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.460
And inspired by
Spitz's research,

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.100
he wanted to conduct
some research

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.010
with rhesus monkeys
in environments

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:19.760
where we could sort of control
the environment a little bit

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.260
more.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.340
And some of you might
be familiar with this,

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.930
because this is a little
bit sort of psych 101

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.590
kind of stuff.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.650
But what he wanted to do,
he did a series of studies.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.740
And they began with what
has been termed the cloth

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.680
mother versus the wire mother.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:43.550
He created two environments
for these monkeys.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.310
He gave them the option of
either a wire mother that

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.834
provided food but no additional
comfort or anything like that,

00:10:50.834 --> 00:10:52.625
and then the cloth
mother that was made out

00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:55.720
of terry cloth that was
physically comfortable

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.540
but didn't provide any
nourishment of any kind.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:04.430
And his theory-- I guess what
he was looking to investigate

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.390
is the theory at the time
was that children really only

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.000
became attached to their parents
because that's where they got

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.600
food and that kind of stuff.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.784
So his theory was basically that
if these monkeys were the way

00:11:14.784 --> 00:11:16.950
he thought they would be,
that they wouldn't express

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.296
much interest in the
terry cloth mother,

00:11:19.296 --> 00:11:20.920
because it didn't
actually provide them

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.980
with any nourishment
or any food.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.130
Now it's probably
not that shocking,

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.100
but actually the monkeys
ended up spending

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.280
like 90% of their days kind of
hanging out on this terry cloth

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.560
mother, and then just running
over to the wire mother

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.430
to get food periodically
whenever they were hungry.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.490
And perhaps even Harlow
himself was not that surprised,

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.830
because terry cloth is a lot
more comfortable than wire.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.540
So I guess he felt the need
to take things a little bit

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.520
further.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.820
And he designed
another study that

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.720
made things just a
little bit more extreme

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.790
where he would do things
like scare the monkeys

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:00.550
and then see what would happen
once they had been hanging out

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.520
on the cloth mother for awhile
and had become ostensibly

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.070
sort of attached to it.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:10.930
What would happen if you
took them out into the room,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.040
scared them.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.060
What they do?

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.820
And monkeys are often used--
rhesus monkeys particularly--

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.890
in psychological
research, because they

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.360
display some characteristics
that are similar to humans.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.000
And the monkeys
did something that

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.470
is typical of what
humans would do,

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.610
and they would run back
to the cloth mother

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.966
because-- it's sort
of in the same way

00:12:32.966 --> 00:12:34.340
that you would
see with children,

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.020
that if a kid is scared
it would run to its mom.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:41.710
The rhesus monkeys would do
that with the cloth mother.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.170
Now unfortunately,
Harry Harlow did not

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.780
like rhesus monkeys very much.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.640
He actually went on the
record as saying that.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.537
So some of his research starts
to get a little bit more

00:12:52.537 --> 00:12:53.370
and more disturbing.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.140
And if you're an
animal lover like me,

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.440
you're not going to want to
hear what I have to say next.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.280
But in order to push the
limits, what he started to do

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.600
was he would take
the rhesus monkeys

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.940
and put them in isolation
chambers for three months, six

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.710
months, nine months, a
year, sometimes even longer

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:12.450
than that.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.520
And the amounts of time
actually really stop mattering,

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.080
because the point
is that by the time

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.930
a rhesus monkey has
been put in an isolation

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:27.794
chamber for 12 months, it
emerges really not the same.

00:13:27.794 --> 00:13:29.210
The monkeys, by
the time they were

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:33.560
in these chambers for a year,
were behaving really bizarrely.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.850
They would rock
themselves back and forth,

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:40.546
stare off into the distance,
and that kind of thing.

00:13:40.546 --> 00:13:44.640
And if you're wondering why
I'm telling you these stories,

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.840
it's because I'm trying to
drive us towards a point.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.470
And that point is what
was happening here?

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.110
I don't know if anyone
has any theories about why

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.650
these babies in their
orphanages would be dying,

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:02.160
or why the monkeys, when
put in isolation chambers,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.880
would emerge so
psychologically distressed.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.620
But what we now
know, 70 years later,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.035
is that what the monkeys and the
babies were lacking was this.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.770
The photos and the
images behind me

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:24.272
are showing what we call
in my field attunement.

00:14:24.272 --> 00:14:28.970
It's the technical term that we
have started to use in my field

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:34.750
for this process, which is
a very delicate dance that

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.180
happens between babies
and their caregivers.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.630
And if you've ever
known an infant,

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.060
you have probably
participated in this yourself.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.820
It turns out that even just
these micro-moments that

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.460
happen in facial expression and
the relationship that develops

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.000
between a child
and its caregiver

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.670
provides an enormous
psychological function

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.890
in helping us to
develop brains that

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:07.550
are capable of things like
psychological organization.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.890
Babies between about
zero and three months

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.270
aren't really
capable of this yet.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.160
It's something that's
commonly referred

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.490
to as the fourth trimester.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.710
But after about three
months, once you

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.120
get to three months,
six months, nine months,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.070
you start to see this
dance quite a bit more.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.400
And what you start
to see, or what

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.250
we have come to realize
is true about infants,

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.340
is that this is
literally how babies

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:38.500
start to realize that they're
separate beings psychologically

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.240
from their caregivers and
from the people around them.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.950
There's this complex
dance that happens

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:49.700
in facial expression that plays
a really important role in who

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.620
we are and who we come to be.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.030
And it's very closely
related to this other thing

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:00.320
that we refer to as attachment.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.640
Attachment in psychology
and in our well-being

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.360
is a really big
and vast concept.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.680
This is where a lot of
research takes place today.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.380
But as you can see in this
sort of graph behind me,

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.950
the basic concept
behind attachment

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.830
is it has to do with what we
consider to be sort of signal

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.150
response communication.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.780
The idea that a baby has
a need, like its diaper

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.840
needs to be changed,
so it cries,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.530
it signals to its
caregiver that it has

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.750
a need that needs to be met.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:37.410
And in an ideal world, the
caregiver meets that need.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.200
And over time, a sense
of trust and safety

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.230
develops not just between
that baby and its caregiver,

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.110
but between that child
and the world itself.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:54.320
There's this idea that I have a
need and that need can be met.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.860
And what we know
now, as a result

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.470
of Harlow's research
and Spitz's research,

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.579
is that it's not just
food and diaper changes

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:07.670
that babies need, but
it's actually this.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.599
It's what we call attunement.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:14.930
And even though this is
vitally important for babies,

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:20.940
it doesn't stop being
important for adults.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.250
If you've ever had that
experience of just feeling

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.060
really connected to
somebody, feeling

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.690
like you're having a
conversation with someone

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.260
and they're just
really getting you

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.470
and you're totally
on the same page,

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.260
there is a
neurotransmitter that is

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.250
responsible for making
you feel that way,

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.390
and it's called oxytocin.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.770
Oxytocin has been called
the bonding hormone.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.370
And it's a neuropeptide
that flows whenever

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:51.280
we're feeling really close and
connected to somebody, if we're

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.540
having a really
good conversation.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.990
For women, we tend to get
extra big bursts of it

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.400
when women are having
orgasms, or are

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.970
in labor, which contributes
to that feeling of feeling

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.900
super bonded to your baby
in that moment after birth.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.270
And what you can sort
of see in these images

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.280
is people just having happy
conversations with each other,

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:17.840
face to face, and having
a lot of oxytocin flowing.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.580
And I don't think that
it will surprise you

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.090
when I say that
instead of seeing this

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:29.590
these days, what we often
see more of is this.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.020
And I am not
anti-technology, believe me.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.800
I am not standing
before you as a Luddite.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.230
I love technology.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.200
As a psychotherapist, a lot of
the people that I work with I

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.890
see via Skype.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.840
I'm active on social media.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.120
I am not an
anti-technology person.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.830
But I don't think
I'm alone when I

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:55.600
say that as we start to
see more and more of this,

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.350
that I don't think I'm
the only person who

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.440
is starting to become a
little bit distressed by it

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.380
and is maybe starting
to perceive some

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:09.950
of the downsides of just how
much exposure to technology

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.620
we've been engaging in lately.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.610
And I think that this,
headlines like this,

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:18.800
are a pretty good
example of that.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.690
I think these are the kinds
of questions that we're

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.520
asking ourselves more and more.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.920
And neurobiologically-speaking,
it's

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.590
worth noting that part of
the reason why technology

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.570
is so satisfying to
use is because we get

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.960
these little dopamine bursts.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.250
From a neurotransmitter
perspective,

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.040
it's the same thing,
it's the same sort

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.210
of neurobiological
reward that we

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:47.420
get when we're playing the
slots or doing cocaine.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:52.820
It's extremely pleasurable
to get a dose of dopamine.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:58.970
But what we don't get when we're
using technology is oxytocin.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:05.430
We don't have the same bond
that we feel with each other

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.300
when we're having a face to
face conversation, or even

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.035
a conversation over the phone
when we're using technology.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.380
And one of the dilemmas
that we have here,

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.140
and this is where I feel
like what we're talking about

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.920
is really important,
is that it's

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.950
starting to become
more and more extreme.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.090
This article right
here, which came out

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:30.370
in April of this year
in The New York Times,

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.420
talks about some really
disturbing research

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.310
where they're recognizing that
little kids are spending so

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.400
much time looking
at screens that they

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.060
are less able to
interpret nonverbal cues.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.160
They're less able to
read facial expressions.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.460
Their social skills
are quite literally

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.070
suffering as a result.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.460
So most of the
people in this room

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:57.060
are old enough to probably
remember a time when we weren't

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.960
using technology so much.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.520
I think even we are experiencing
the ramifications of spending

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.600
so much time using technology.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.680
I think it's really
hard to even imagine

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.460
what is happening to kids
who are three years old right

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.510
now, six years
old, 10 years old,

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:15.650
with so much exposure
to technology.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:22.600
So what is the point
of all of this?

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.670
The point in my
mind is really just

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.290
that our human
relationships really

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:31.540
matter, perhaps more
so than a lot of us

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.960
really give them credit for.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.470
I'm going to spend the rest of
this talk focusing primarily

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.340
on listening, talking
about what it really

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.960
means to be a good listener.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.360
And something that
I just want to make

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.850
clear is that I think in
adult to adult communication,

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.800
really listening
to each other is

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.290
sort of the updated version
of those attunement photos

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.810
that I was showing to you.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.570
How we listen to
each other is how

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.250
we make our presence
felt by the people

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.720
that we're in
relationships with.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.730
And I want to just sort of
transition and shift gears

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.582
here a little bit
by reading a quote.

00:22:16.582 --> 00:22:18.040
I'll go ahead and
read this to you.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.270
This is one of my
favorite psychologists,

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.162
someone named Carl Rogers.

00:22:22.162 --> 00:22:23.870
He has so many beautiful
quotes, and this

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.680
is one of my favorites.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.270
Sensitive, active listening is
exceedingly rare in our lives.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.420
We think we listen,
but very rarely

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:36.055
do we listen with real
understanding or true empathy.

00:22:36.055 --> 00:22:39.490
Yet listening of this
very special kind

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:44.780
is one of the most potent
forces for change that I know.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.730
Now something that is very
cool about Carl Rogers

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.970
is that he is the originator
of something that has

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.760
been termed active listening.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.800
It's actually sort
of a code of skills.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.020
And it's something that's been
tremendously influential for me

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.000
in my work as a psychotherapist,
but it also provides

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.840
the backbone of what the
FBI teaches its hostage

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.730
negotiators, which
I actually think

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.000
is a really
fascinating data point.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.950
The FBI created a course in
1979 called the National Crisis

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.420
Negotiation course.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:23.730
And since 1979, it has been
the number one course worldwide

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.860
for training people in
high-stakes crisis negotiation.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.700
It's what they use to
train their own FBI hostage

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.830
negotiators, but
it's also anyone

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.780
in the world who needs
to learn about this

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.350
for the sake of
diplomacy or anything

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.340
like that can come and
attend this course.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.420
And the data is
really outstanding.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:47.210
It has successfully contributed
in tens of thousands

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.890
of lives saved as a result of
the success of this program.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:57.680
And all they train people
in is active listening.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.330
The FBI actually tells
its hostage negotiators

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.520
to not try to troubleshoot the
crisis, or to try to convince,

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.750
let's say, a hostage-taker to
do something in particular.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.630
They quite literally just
train them in listening,

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.990
rapport-building,
helping a hostage-taker

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.640
to feel heard and understood.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.780
And it actually works.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.910
It's effective at getting people
to just kind of soften and let

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:26.830
go of their agenda.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:29.050
So we'll spend the rest
of this talk speaking

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.460
a little bit about active
listening and what it entails.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.370
To begin, we'll just say that
active listening includes

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:41.030
sincerely trying to understand
another person's opinion

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:45.110
or subjective experience,
respecting the other person's

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:49.360
feelings and experience,
expressing empathy,

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.860
and building rapport.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.075
And what it doesn't include
is being judgmental--

00:24:55.075 --> 00:24:56.950
which is sometimes
easier said than done,

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:02.640
but it's a goal-- rushing the
process or the conversation,

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.460
problem-solving, or patronizing.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:12.540
And I have, over the years,
isolated six specific steps

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.640
that I think are
particularly important when

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.617
we talk about listening and when
we talk about active listening.

00:25:17.617 --> 00:25:19.950
And just one by one I'm going
to bring you through them.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:22.134
And afterwards, we'll
transition into the Q&amp;A.

00:25:22.134 --> 00:25:24.800
So if you have any questions, we
will have more than enough time

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.230
for that.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:31.994
But the first one is
making eye contact.

00:25:31.994 --> 00:25:33.910
And something that I
want to bring you back to

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.690
is just at the
top of this speech

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.960
when I was just kind of inviting
us to really get present

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.770
and just to focus
on what was actually

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.800
happening in the moment.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.720
This is really our
first opportunity,

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.230
I think, when we're having
a conversation with somebody

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.500
to really bring things back
to a place of mindfulness,

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.569
and to remind ourselves that we
don't have to be multitasking

00:25:56.569 --> 00:25:58.110
and we can really
be paying attention

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.068
to what they're saying.

00:25:59.068 --> 00:26:02.222
I think making really good
eye contact-- the point is not

00:26:02.222 --> 00:26:04.180
necessarily for it to be
creepy, you don't want

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.590
to be staring at somebody--
but by making really good eye

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:13.020
contact, you can allow
yourself to just kind of forget

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.550
about other things.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.240
You can really focus
on making eye contact

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.240
and stop thinking about
what you need to do,

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.270
your to-do list,
what you're going

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.740
to do after you're done with
the conversation, whatever

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.730
the case may be.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.830
And part and parcel
of that is what

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.900
we call mirroring an
effective facial expression.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:37.230
This is also a little bit
like those attunement photos.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.000
It's worth noting
that this is something

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.220
that people do naturally,
so it's actually

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.330
not something that we have
to work super hard at.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.642
But a really good example
of where this is important

00:26:47.642 --> 00:26:49.100
is just that if
you were telling me

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.310
something that was really sad
or something that really bummed

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.226
you out and I was looking
at you with a really

00:26:53.226 --> 00:26:56.890
big smile on my face, that
would be super creepy, right.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:02.080
So the goal is really
just to kind of get

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.260
in tune with the moment.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.500
And if you're talking to
somebody who's telling you

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.440
about something that makes
them feel sad, just kind of,

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.350
you know, take in that
vibe a little bit,

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.830
kind of going with it.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.510
This is a really
big, important one.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.650
Don't think about what
you're going to say next.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.760
I think this is particularly
rife in our culture

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.270
because people are so afraid
of a moment of silence

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.030
I think in a lot of ways that
it's really common for people

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:34.720
to spend the time that
someone else is speaking

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.780
thinking about how
they're going to respond.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.940
And what I want to
suggest to everyone here

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.360
is that it's actually OK if
there's a moment of silence.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.750
If somebody gets to the end
of their sentence and you

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:52.260
have to think for a
moment before you--

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.770
as you collect your
thoughts and say

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.240
whatever you're going to say.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.010
The funny thing is that I find
that it's actually very rare

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.760
that very much time goes by.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.110
Usually we're able to process
things really quickly.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:07.230
But allowing somebody to
fully complete their thought

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.750
and to get to the end of their
sentence before we jump in

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.560
and respond is actually
a very crucial piece

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.220
of listening and having
a good conversation.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:23.530
So this next one is easier
said than done, but also very

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:24.100
important.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.200
Sincerely trying to
suspend judgment.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.320
One of the things
that I value most

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.910
about my experience of
having become a psychologist

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:41.530
is really fully having the
opportunity to recognize

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.580
how much people's
perspectives vary from one

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.350
another, kind of going
back to what I was saying

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.100
in the beginning just
about how our life

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.240
experiences and
our relationships

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.430
play a really big role in our
mental health, mental illness,

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.040
that kind of thing.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:02.340
It's actually really--
can be surprising to know

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.780
how much people's
perspectives on the world

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.080
are shaped as a result
of the experiences

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.990
that we've had in the past.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.200
So I think just if we even
notice ourselves feeling

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.140
inclined to judge
another person,

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.200
it's a really important
and valuable time

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.681
to just take a step back and
to recognize that you think

00:29:20.681 --> 00:29:22.930
whatever it is that you think
because of your own life

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:23.760
experiences.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.380
Whoever it is that
you're talking to you

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.820
has lived through an
entirely different universe

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.590
of life experience.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:33.420
And the goal in a
conversation is really

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.784
to seriously try to understand,
and you can't really

00:29:35.784 --> 00:29:37.200
do that if you're
judging someone.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.158
I mean if you were-- if
we kind of take it back

00:29:39.158 --> 00:29:42.410
to the FBI hostage negotiation
situation for a moment,

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:46.300
it actually wouldn't really
be very effective conflict

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.730
resolution if the hostage
negotiators weren't sincerely

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.780
able to suspend judgment
and try to understand

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.050
what a hostage-taker
is motivated by.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:00.270
What are they really motivated
by, what do they want here.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:03.252
So trying as much as
possible to suspend judgment

00:30:03.252 --> 00:30:04.085
is really important.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.360
Asking clarifying questions.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.180
This might sound a
little bit obvious,

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.490
but it's related to the
piece right before it.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.350
If you don't understand,
then it really

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:21.120
is your job to just ask
questions until you understand.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.340
And I think it
can be really good

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.984
for us to remember,
keep in mind,

00:30:24.984 --> 00:30:26.400
that when we're
listening, there's

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.544
really no such thing as
asking too many questions.

00:30:28.544 --> 00:30:29.960
If you're really
not understanding

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.160
what's bothering someone, just
ask more and more questions.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.050
And finally-- this one is
really important, too--

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.850
just making
statements that prove

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.310
that you're paying attention.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.460
I think one thing
that's a little bit

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.584
unfortunate about listening
is that just because we

00:30:44.584 --> 00:30:47.112
are listening
doesn't necessarily

00:30:47.112 --> 00:30:48.570
mean that the other
person is going

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.130
to feel like we're listening
or is going to feel heard.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.180
And the goal is
truly to make sure

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.910
that the other
person feels heard.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.550
So even if somebody's talking
all about how overwhelming they

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.330
are-- or how overwhelmed they
feel, they're complaining

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.970
they've got so much going
on, something as simple

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.520
as it sounds like you
feel really overwhelmed,

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.250
kind of distilling
it into something,

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.570
can be really helpful.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:17.370
So again, I just want
to conclude today

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.670
by saying that I
think that everything

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.180
that we're here to
talk about today

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.120
is really important stuff.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.700
Something that might be
interesting for a lot of you

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.267
guys to note is, I know this
stuff can be really confusing

00:31:33.267 --> 00:31:35.350
to people, you know,
psychiatrists, psychologists,

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.930
that kind of thing.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.870
Psychiatrists are
medical doctors.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.020
They're the people that
write prescriptions.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:45.100
As a psychologist, I don't
have prescription privileges.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.170
Pretty much everything
that I do in my work

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:49.890
is related to the
conversations that I

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:53.350
have with people, my
ability to listen, to be

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.780
present with them,
to express empathy.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.050
And it's not to say that
that's all that I do,

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.710
and I'm not suggesting that
anyone here go out and practice

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:05.010
psychotherapy without a license,
but I have years of experience

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.760
under my belt that have
shown me that it's actually

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:14.170
really surprising how much
better people can feel

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.910
in general when they have a
conversation with somebody

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:19.450
where they feel heard
and they feel understood

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:23.310
and they feel like that
person was able to be present

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:26.650
and to listen to them
without judgment.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.350
And I have also
come to find over

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.015
the course of the
past couple years

00:32:30.015 --> 00:32:33.050
that because there's sort of
a shortage of good listeners

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.690
in the world, I think that a
lot of times when people are

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.880
in the presence of someone who's
a good listener-- and I know I

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.504
have this feeling
all the time, if I

00:32:39.504 --> 00:32:41.420
feel like I'm in the
presence of someone who's

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.070
a really good listener, it
feels super refreshing to me.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.760
So I just want to
encourage everyone

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.490
to kind of take these
skills out on the road

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.670
and to be someone
that other people feel

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.175
is a refreshing
person to be around.

00:32:55.175 --> 00:32:57.120
And maybe with that
in mind, we can just

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.719
turn it over to the Q&amp;A.

00:32:58.719 --> 00:33:00.260
AUDIENCE: So thanks
for coming today.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.520
So the question I had
is how much are you,

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.135
let's say, like [INAUDIBLE] I
am in the typical situation,

00:33:06.135 --> 00:33:08.060
like we are all on our phones.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.720
So how much you are
explicit about it

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.890
and how much you are implicit,
and just to clarify should

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:16.140
I actively listen to my friends
and hope that will create

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.430
that atmosphere, or
people that I care about,

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.040
redefine rules of engagement.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.730
I don't know if you have one.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.776
That's what I mean by
explicit or implicit.

00:33:24.776 --> 00:33:26.150
LESLIE CARR: So
just to make sure

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:27.524
that I understand
the question, I

00:33:27.524 --> 00:33:29.680
take it it's basically
like how do you

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.627
kind of-- how do you
sort of cultivate

00:33:31.627 --> 00:33:33.710
this kind of environment
with your friends, right.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:36.440
Do you just lead
by example, do you

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.006
tell people to turn their
phones off, that kind of thing?

00:33:40.006 --> 00:33:43.240
Yeah, I think it
really varies actually.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.150
I mean I look at a
lot of this stuff

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:50.140
through the lens of just
really building awareness.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.984
So I think you probably could
make different decisions based

00:33:52.984 --> 00:33:55.150
on the environment that
you're in, how well you know

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.460
people, that kind of thing.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.280
I think if you were with someone
that you didn't know very well,

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.350
you probably wouldn't want
to come across as chiding.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.270
So you might want to just lead
by example, stay off your phone

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.920
if you can.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.961
If you find that they're
using their phone a lot,

00:34:10.961 --> 00:34:16.610
maybe just don't jump in
and start doing it yourself.

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.800
But if it's someone that
you know really well,

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.050
perhaps you could just-- if
this is resonating with you

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.800
and you feel like
there's some truth to it

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.600
and it's something you
want to carry forward,

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.725
you could always just tell
them what you've learned

00:34:27.725 --> 00:34:29.969
or how you're thinking
and feeling about it,

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:33.409
and see if that influences
them to do things differently.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:39.170
I do think-- I have noticed
for myself that if you engage

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.050
other people in a
conversation about it

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.631
and you increase their
awareness for themselves

00:34:43.631 --> 00:34:45.630
about how maybe constantly
being on their phones

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:47.925
is impacting them, it's a
lot easier to sort of say

00:34:47.925 --> 00:34:50.050
let's leave the house right
now and just like leave

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:51.139
our phones here.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:54.570
Let's just actually put the
technology away completely

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:55.929
and just go.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:59.460
And I think that a lot of people
are willing to get on that page

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.200
once their consciousness
is raised around it.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.890
But it's very context-dependent.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:05.270
Does that help?

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.982
OK.

00:35:05.982 --> 00:35:10.310
AUDIENCE: In terms of the
modern loneliness kind of stuff,

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.010
do you have any data
or see any patterns

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:15.460
about like it's worse in cities
or in different situations,

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.230
or like other environments
people can put themselves

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.330
that are better or worse?

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:24.020
LESLIE CARR: That's a
really good question.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.070
The data around that is
complicated I read something

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.940
recently that said
that people who

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:35.020
live in non-urban environments,
rural or-- I was about to say

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.980
rural or suburban, but they
may have been-- actually I do

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.780
think it was related to rural
and suburban environments.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.600
They were saying that
people experience

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.680
greater degrees of
loneliness just because they

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.800
are physically separated
by other people

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.170
and not living, existing
with as much community.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.530
But I also know that
there's a lot of research

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:56.330
that people who
live-- they've done

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.080
really fascinating
research, some of which

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:05.000
involves rats, that the more
people or animals or whatever

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.490
that you crowd into
a certain, space,

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.420
the more they avoid each
other and sort of create

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.280
a sense of psychological
distance that we theorize

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.360
is meant to kind of
buffer against some

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.810
of the physical distance
that's being impinged upon.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.937
There actually is some
really interesting research

00:36:21.937 --> 00:36:23.520
that has to do with
urban environments

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.740
showing that even though
you have a lot of people

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:31.320
who are physically there, they
tend to avoid one another more.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.990
Anecdotally, we can
probably see this

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.060
in cities like New York City.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.490
People are less likely
to know their neighbors

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.020
than, let's say, people who
live in a suburban environment,

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.936
because I think they
tend to buffer themselves

00:36:41.936 --> 00:36:42.940
a little bit more.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.430
So I think that we see different
things in different places.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:53.630
But I think it probably has more
to do on an individual level

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.170
with people in the way they
are existing in the world

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.040
and relating to people
in their community,

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.899
whether it's suburban,
rural, or urban.

00:37:01.899 --> 00:37:03.190
Does that answer your question?

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:04.900
It's complicated, I think.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.580
I think it has more to do
with an individual person's

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.460
psychological makeup
than it has to do

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:16.130
with the density of the
population where they are.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.020
Yeah.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.225
In terms of whether
they feel lonely or not.

00:37:19.225 --> 00:37:22.070
AUDIENCE: So what
about a situation at

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.405
work where I'm feeling
like in the zone

00:37:25.405 --> 00:37:27.450
and I'm really
focused on something,

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:31.020
and then I have to go out
and maybe there's a client

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.592
or like I'm meeting
with my manager

00:37:33.592 --> 00:37:36.050
and I need to be open and do
some of these active listening

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.090
skills.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.020
If I'm in this
focused zone, it's

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:42.030
just not conducive maybe
for the active listening.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.670
I don't know--
how can I do that?

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:44.878
What would be the way to go--

00:37:44.878 --> 00:37:46.580
LESLIE CARR: It's
such a good question.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.025
I've focused it through the
lens of almost gear shifting.

00:37:51.704 --> 00:37:54.120
There are a couple of different
ways that you can do this.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.520
I think if you even have
so much as a hallway

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.950
to walk down from computer
to business meeting, that

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:05.212
can sometimes be enough
time or space to create

00:38:05.212 --> 00:38:06.670
a little bit of a
physical distance

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.710
where you can create a little
bit of an emotional pivot

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.340
of sorts.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.710
It's kind of a matter of
stepping away from the computer

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.280
and giving yourself
the walk down

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.140
the hallway to just kind of
slough things off and shift

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.330
gears.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.600
A lot of it is
intentional in my mind,

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.070
that if you create the
intention on that hallway

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:28.120
walk to shift gears and
to try to be more present,

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.402
you can even use the
walk-- for those of you

00:38:30.402 --> 00:38:32.610
who are familiar with
different styles of meditation,

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:35.410
there are seated meditations
where we close our eyes

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.910
and do that kind of thing, and
there are walking meditations

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:42.387
where we just walk and focus
on the feeling of our feet

00:38:42.387 --> 00:38:42.970
on the ground.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.630
That's a little bit
more akin to the sort

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:48.510
of mindfulness-based
awareness exercise

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.510
that I brought us through
right in the beginning

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:53.410
of the talk, the
idea that you can

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.100
turn on this kind of awareness
anytime you want just by sort

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.120
of making a decision to do so.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.780
So if you have the opportunity
to take a walk and just shift

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.720
gears, you can do it that way.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.320
And if you don't
have the opportunity,

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.800
if you don't have that
hallway, I would just

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.830
say as you turn to
speak to someone

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.730
and they're starting
to talk to you,

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:18.855
just give yourself a moment
to just look them in the eye,

00:39:18.855 --> 00:39:20.980
take a moment to even look
at the top of their head

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.190
if you don't want to be staring
at their eyeballs, and just

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.731
sort of ground
yourself a little bit.

00:39:24.731 --> 00:39:31.270
Kind of do a little bit
of an attentional pivot.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:34.066
Something to try out, maybe
you can see if it helps.

00:39:34.066 --> 00:39:35.720
AUDIENCE: So my
question is basically

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:41.059
about the miscommunication
or misunderstanding.

00:39:41.059 --> 00:39:42.475
As you mentioned,
different people

00:39:42.475 --> 00:39:44.160
have different perspectives.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.990
So maybe you said one
thing, your friend

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.440
understands differently.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.510
And sometimes you could
create some hard feelings.

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:58.500
But you'd really like
to get this cleared,

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.710
you don't like to
[INAUDIBLE] this

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:03.300
between you and your friend.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.560
So what would be the best way?

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:10.916
Because they just take
maybe the wrong way.

00:40:10.916 --> 00:40:13.520
AUDIENCE: So that is
such a juicy question.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.590
So just to recap,
I take it you're

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:17.390
saying if you have
a misunderstanding

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:19.042
with somebody--
you say something,

00:40:19.042 --> 00:40:21.000
they take it the wrong
way, you didn't mean it,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.340
let's say the way they
took it, but now you

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.820
have two people who are kind
of not seeing eye to eye,

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.750
how do you work it out.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.810
This is a little bit
of an advanced skill,

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:34.260
but a really, really good one.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:38.310
Going back to that idea of just
suspending judgement and really

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.530
honoring somebody's
subjectivity,

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.530
I think that one of the most
amazing gifts that we could

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:50.900
give ourselves or somebody
else is to understand that

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:54.090
it's not-- especially when it
comes to interpersonal conflict

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.900
or communication, it's
really not a matter at all

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:00.730
of who's right and who's wrong,
but taking two different people

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.280
who have two completely
different subjectivities about

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.320
something and understanding that
however it is that, let's say,

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.720
person B responded to
what person A said,

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.646
that it's not that
they're wrong--

00:41:12.646 --> 00:41:14.270
they may have
misinterpreted something,

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:19.820
they didn't take it the
way person A intended it--

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.420
but to really divorce
things from who's right

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.430
and who's wrong and just try
to understand each person's

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:26.260
perspective.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.470
Because, for example, the
reason why the second person

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:32.390
may have misinterpreted
what person A said

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.000
is because it triggered a
past memory of something.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.560
Like you saying x, y or z to me
reminds me of something that's

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.970
old and now I feel upset
at you, it's not even

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:44.970
your fault, that kind of thing.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:48.270
So just trying to understand
why the person took it

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.800
the wrong way and
then explaining that,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.090
despite what that
person thought,

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:57.070
that you meant
something else, and just

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:59.640
honoring both person's
subjectivities usually

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.110
is I think probably the best
way to resolve a conflict,

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.750
rather than feeling
like but you're

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.350
wrong to have
interpreted it that way.

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:07.766
That's not what I
meant, therefore

00:42:07.766 --> 00:42:10.690
you're wrong for
having interpreted

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:12.071
what I said in that manner.

00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:13.570
But just sort of
saying like oh, I'm

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:17.404
so sorry, I didn't mean
to-- it wasn't my intention.

00:42:17.404 --> 00:42:19.070
I think you heard
that in a way that was

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.236
different than what I meant.

00:42:20.236 --> 00:42:23.480
But tell me what you're
thinking or feeling.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.540
You know?

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.740
Does that help?

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.356
All right, good.

00:42:27.356 --> 00:42:31.390
AUDIENCE: How could someone
who is a good active listener

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:35.149
effectively engage with
someone who is not?

00:42:35.149 --> 00:42:36.440
LESLIE CARR: That's a good one.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:41.800
That's a really good one.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.850
And actually don't step
away for me, Rachel, yet,

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.590
just in case she
needs that mike back.

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:48.020
Because here's
what I'm wondering.

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:52.350
So I take it that you're
thinking of situations where

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:54.632
someone is doing a really
good job of listening

00:42:54.632 --> 00:42:56.090
and the other person
is really kind

00:42:56.090 --> 00:43:00.000
of running roughshod over them
and doing all of the talking.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.700
The first thing that I
think of is potentially

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:08.780
maybe needing to interject
more than feels natural to you.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.330
If you're the kind of person
who is often accustomed to being

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.270
in the listening role and
you're with someone who's

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:17.680
more than happy to kind of
keep talking and kind of take

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.682
advantage of the fact
that you're listening,

00:43:19.682 --> 00:43:21.640
you may have to do
something that's quite a bit

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.560
different than what I've been
talking about today, which

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.160
is really summon the
gumption to kind of speak up

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.310
or to talk over someone,
or to maybe even at times

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.800
say excuse me, I was
speaking, I'm not done yet.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.680
You know, to sort of assert
yourself a little bit more.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.300
That in some ways
could be the topic

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:43.660
of a whole different speech, how
to assert yourself in that way.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.366
But I guess I would say
that I don't think that

00:43:46.366 --> 00:43:48.990
just because we've been talking
about the benefits of listening

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:53.620
today that it's always our
job to listen and never assert

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.300
ourselves or never try to be
the one who's speaking or having

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.730
an opinion or
expressing that opinion.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.100
Everyone deserves a
chance to-- everyone

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.030
deserves a seat at the table.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.856
So yes, I would not want
any of this material

00:44:06.856 --> 00:44:08.230
to be misinterpreted
in that way.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.480
But it might be time
just to speak up

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.065
for yourself a little bit more
with whoever that person is.

00:44:14.065 --> 00:44:17.847
AUDIENCE: So I find that as a
recently new parent that some

00:44:17.847 --> 00:44:20.690
of the most complex
relationships

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:24.770
I have are within my family,
and sometimes even with my kids.

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:28.940
What does it look
like to sort of get

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.400
on the same page with
your kids by doing

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.650
this sort of active listening?

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:37.580
Rather than saying no, you're
not supposed to do that,

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:41.320
to really make them feel
heard and to figure out

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:47.980
some common ground so that you
can move them towards a place

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:51.320
where they kind of
are behaving in a way

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.850
you think is appropriate
without kind of judging them.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:56.350
LESLIE CARR: That's
a good question.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:59.565
How old are your kids?

00:44:59.565 --> 00:45:02.090
AUDIENCE: One and
two and a half.

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:03.200
But they grow fast.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.580
LESLIE CARR: Yes, they do.

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.337
Yes they do.

00:45:05.337 --> 00:45:06.420
And you're planning ahead.

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.340
I like it.

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:14.400
So I am not a parent, and
I'm not a parenting expert.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.570
But I'll tell you
what I think of when

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:18.810
I think about that question.

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.240
There are two things
primarily that come to mind.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.310
One is that you do,
for better or worse,

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.900
as a parent have
to be the parent.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.029
You're going to have
to sometimes tell them

00:45:31.029 --> 00:45:33.570
that it's bedtime or tell them
that they need to do something

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:36.030
that they may not want to do.

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:39.140
And I don't necessarily
feel like a parent has

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.850
to be a perfect active
listener, let's say,

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:45.440
with a toddler who's
throwing a tantrum.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:49.300
But I think where
these skills could

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.325
be particularly
useful in parenting,

00:45:51.325 --> 00:45:54.160
and especially parenting
any child who's

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.580
getting to be old enough
to express an opinion

00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.944
or whatever, is just to,
in certain circumstances,

00:46:00.944 --> 00:46:02.610
honor the fact that
that kid is actually

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.340
responding to something.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.600
I think one of the
biggest problems

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.810
that we have nationally-speaking
when I look--

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:11.660
and this gets more
into issues related

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:18.010
to mental health, mental illness
sort of on a national scale.

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:21.010
Something that I think is a real
shame is that a lot of times

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:25.500
when kids are let's say acting
out, like behavior that's

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.540
traditionally considered
to be acting out,

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.020
a lot of times that kid is
just going through something

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:34.540
and the adults, the parents
around them, their teachers,

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.510
are more concerned
with getting the kid

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:40.930
to behave than trying to figure
out what it is that's going on.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.210
So as your kids start to
get a little bit older,

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:45.180
I wouldn't
necessarily apply this

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.020
to the tantrum that happens
in the grocery store aisle

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:52.589
because they really want the
fruit roll-ups or something.

00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:54.630
But if you start to realize,
especially if you're

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:57.600
starting to see a
pattern around a way

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.840
that a kid is
responding-- let's say

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.510
they're starting
to kind of act out

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:04.360
or they're becoming a little
bit problematic in some way--

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.910
getting super curious what
is happening with this kid

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:11.060
right now, and what is
he or she responding to,

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:14.654
and how can I maybe honor
his or her subjectivity

00:47:14.654 --> 00:47:16.320
and just get really
curious about what's

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.610
happening rather than
just trying to get them

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:20.220
to do what I want them to do.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:20.970
There are going to
be times when you're

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:22.011
going to have to do that.

00:47:22.011 --> 00:47:24.760
You're just going to
have to be parental.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.994
And knowing when to do
each of those things

00:47:26.994 --> 00:47:29.160
is where things get maybe
a little bit more nuanced.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.580
But I do think there's a lot
to be said for getting curious

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:33.496
about why kids are acting
the way that they do

00:47:33.496 --> 00:47:37.840
and trying to figure it out
as opposed to just trying

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.514
to make it stop.

00:47:39.514 --> 00:47:41.930
AUDIENCE: All right, so when
we have issues or are talking

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:43.610
to other people and
we're triggered,

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.709
there's like a
conflict or you don't

00:47:45.709 --> 00:47:48.000
want to speak to someone
specifically, how much of that

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.880
is from my own experience, from
what my history is and maybe

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.160
my family, versus like the
actual moment in me speaking

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.500
with that person?

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.350
Is it both of those things?

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:01.505
Is it like--

00:48:01.505 --> 00:48:03.380
LESLIE CARR: Will you
say that one more time?

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.440
I'm not sure if I understand it.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.040
So if I'm in a conversation
with someone, engaged

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.790
in a conversation, and
I'm just triggered,

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:14.270
like something lights up and I'm
all of a sudden annoyed or like

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:17.500
wow, how could they say
that, or have a reaction,

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.470
I'm wondering in the
moment how much of that

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:24.530
is from something in my
past versus in the moment.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:27.350
LESLIE CARR: That is
super context-dependent,

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:30.900
and I think varies
really depending

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.000
on what the circumstances are.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.387
I think that we have
moments all the time

00:48:35.387 --> 00:48:37.470
where we feel triggered
by something that somebody

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:42.460
said to us because that
person is being an asshole,

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.060
you know, and then sometimes
when we're feeling triggered

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.780
by something because it's
activating something deeply

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.970
personal for us and
maybe we're overreacting

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.190
a little bit because
something is getting

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.330
triggered that's deeper.

00:48:56.330 --> 00:49:00.960
That is-- it would be very hard
to come up with a ratio that's

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.710
attached to that
that is generalizable

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:07.500
all across the board,
because I think

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.530
it's so unique to every
single individual moment

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:12.482
that people live through.

00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:14.690
But I think even just being
aware of the fact that it

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:17.320
happens is something, you know,
knowing that it's not always

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.111
what's happening in
the moment is sometimes

00:49:19.111 --> 00:49:21.770
triggering something
historical, that's good to know.

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:24.020
RACHEL AMERA: Dr. Carr, thank
you for coming in today.

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:24.780
Really appreciate it.

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:25.080
Thanks.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:25.680
LESLIE CARR: Thank you.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.580
Thank you, everybody.

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:30.191
