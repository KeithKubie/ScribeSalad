00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.110
In this lesson, we talked about
several technologies that are relevant

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.860
to the data center space.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.830
We described the commonly used
multi-tier software architecture models,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.190
and discussed the management
tradeoffs that exists among them.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.583
We talked about cloud computing and

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:21.208
the role that it plays in addressing
some of the scale and cost related

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:26.410
challenges to supporting really
large-scale applications and services.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.765
And we also briefly mention some of the
popular technologies that form the cloud

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:32.397
computing landscape today.
