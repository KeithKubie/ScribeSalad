00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.130
MAGNUS HYTTSEN: Do you
want to build better apps?

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.080
In that case, you've
come to the right place,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.600
because we're now proud to
release Google Play Services

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.630
7.0.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.690
And that's exactly what
Google Play Services

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.890
is all about-- enabling
you to build better apps.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.730
In this release, we've packed
a number of new features,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.130
and we also have
a brand new API.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.340
So join us, and
let's check it out.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.480
Let's start with location,
location, and location.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.570
I mean, what can be
more basic than location

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.060
in a mobile environment?

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.730
GOOGLE NOW VOICE:
Connectivity, perhaps.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.440
MAGNUS HYTTSEN: All right,
but you get the point.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.994
Location is always important.

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:39.660
You want to know where
your friends are,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.590
what interesting
stuff there is nearby,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.130
or just to keep track
of where you are.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.240
That's where Fused Location
Provider comes into play.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.970
The Fused Location Provider
can identify location,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.170
combining information from a
number of different sources,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.840
such as the GPS, Wi-Fi network
information, or the cell

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.510
network that you're
connected to.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.450
But how can your app
detect and ensure

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.170
that location settings
are enabled on the device,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.470
and have them turned
on if they're not?

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.440
Well up to now, this has
not been straightforward.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.760
But with this
release it will be,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.040
since you can now check
if the necessary location

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.950
settings are enabled for a given
location request to succeed.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.690
And if there are
possible improvements,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.700
you can display a
one touch control--

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.270
like the one you see
here-- for the user

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.310
to change their settings
without leaving your app.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.390
So this is great news for your
app, as well as your users.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.150
For example, when Google
Maps integrated the location

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.790
settings dialog, there
was a dramatic increase

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.290
in the number of users who
were in a good location state.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.770
So this is important stuff.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.400
And that brings us over
to-- yeah, that's right,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.120
we've got a new API.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.185
Let's welcome the Places API
with a round of applause.

00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:55.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.310
The Places API uses
Google databases

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.320
of places and business to
identify the things that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.060
exists at a location.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.640
So for example, if this is
my current longitude latitude

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.020
location, then the
Places API could

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.940
identify that I am actually
in Building 48 at Googleplex

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.630
where I am recording this video.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.170
So how do you add
this to your app?

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.530
Well, first of all, there
is a built-in picker.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.470
The user picks
their current place,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.050
and your app can get all
the relevant information

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.980
about the place-- such as name,
address, phone number, website,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.220
and even more.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.440
But that's not all.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.440
You can also
programmatically ask

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.330
the API for the
user's current place

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.290
through the getCurrent
Place method.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.670
And it's also possible to
report that the user is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.180
at a particular place
using the addPlace method.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.240
So Places-- a great
new API to use,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.180
turning the world into
real life objects.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.870
And we've got a
separate DevByte going

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.170
into more detail
on this API, so be

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.870
sure to check the references
at the end of this video.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.050
Now turning to Google Fit.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.750
In this release, we split the
single fitness API constant

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.200
into six different
API constants.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.360
Why?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.550
Because this significantly
reduces the memory footprint

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.370
for Google Fit apps,
in particular for apps

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.240
that are running
in the background.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.710
And there's just no limit
to the types of fitness data

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.640
that you want to
measure and record.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.900
So therefore, we've added two
more data types, namely-- body

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.190
fat and sleep.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.890
What the heck?

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.330
Hey, no pranks!

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.240
New slide, new slide!

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.010
Whew.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.810
[GROWL]

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.430
Those are the Google Fit
enhancements in this release.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.600
So go out there and
create great fitness apps.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.400
And wrapping it
up with Play Game

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.100
Services, where we've added
the Nearby Connections API.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.390
If your app implements this,
it allows Android devices

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.160
to connect to an Android TV and
be used as a remote controller,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.370
for example, when playing games.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.950
And that's it for Release
7.0 of Google Play services.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.320
And remember, when you
use Google Play Services,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.200
you build better apps.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.530
And now it's your turn to
go out there and create

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.320
those great apps!

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.999
And don't forget to
tell us all about it.
