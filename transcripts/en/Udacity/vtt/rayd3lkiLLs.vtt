00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.630
And what about any metrics,
or things that you measured,

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.390
which you thought were
important that weren't?

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.150
&gt;&gt; So, I don't know if this exactly
is what you're looking for, but

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.260
I can definitely think of
situations where metrics

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.110
told us a story that didn't really match
reality, and in one of these situations,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.490
we went through a period of time where
our growth was really, really fast.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.120
We were acquiring new MRR, monthly
recurring revenue, very, very quickly,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.260
and we put that number up on the board
every month, and everybody was cheering,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.000
and one of the things we started
noticing that while our new MRR growth

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.470
was going up and up and
up our churn numbers were also going up.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.760
So we had customers that were falling
out of the back of the pipeline as well.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.990
And for anybody who's been
involved in a SaaS business,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.790
your churn is one of the most important
metrics to track, because it means that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.040
when it's high you've got a leaky
bucket and you need to work harder and

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.110
harder to fill that bucket
while water pours out of it.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.760
And when we dug into it,
it turns out that we had been giving

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.350
new customers a short amount of time
where they could do a trial with us and

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.250
then forcing them to make a big decision
after that amount of time was up.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.670
And for a lot of these bigger companies
that we never really worked with before,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.200
this just wasn't enough time, and so
they would start a trial, they would get

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.710
to the end of this trial and they
wouldn't be ready to actually commit or

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.180
not, and they would fall out,
they would churn out.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.120
And so while we were able to, because
of these short trials we were able

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.550
to sort of say,
hey there's no commitment up front, we

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.880
were able to get a lot of new revenue in
through the door, we also were creating

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.740
a situation where ultimately we didn't
provide a good customer experience.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.360
And so that was a situation where we had
a metric which looked really great, but

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.270
there was something underneath
that we hadn't seen that was

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.440
pretty important to pay attention to.
