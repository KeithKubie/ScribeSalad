00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The initial value for the velocity of the car is of course 120 km/h converted to m/s

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and the initial value for the velocity of the rim of the wheel

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
has to equal the velocity of the car so that there is no slip.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The implementation of the forward Euler method should be straightforward.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The top most subplot illustrates the braking distance.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The endpoint of each these curves is at the braking distance.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The second subplot shows that the car velocity decreases almost linearly.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This is not quite sure of the wheel velocity.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In particular, you can see that the rear velocity

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
quickly deceases to zero when the strength of braking this too high.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The most interesting part, however, is the lower subplot. It shows the wheel slip.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If we apply just a little of braking, we're going to run into the lower equilibrium, which is a stable one

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and which is always below the optimum value of the wheel slip of 0.2,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and to see that for this curve colored in green and this curve colored in purple,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
we do not reach such a reasonable equilibrium, however, the wheel locks up.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The wheel slip becomes one, which we have seen in the plot above as well.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Among these five options, the red one seems to work best and you see that we must not apply

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
too little braking and that we must not apply too much braking.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You maybe wondering about this artifact here. Remember how we compute the wheel slips.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
One minus the velocity of the rim of the wheel divided by the velocity the car.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
If these two gets close to zero, the ratio is going to vary widely.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This is a numerical artifact. So the reason for this artifact is built into our equations.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
At the end of the simulation, we're dividing numbers, which are close to zero.

00:01:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's always a bad idea when it comes to maintaining stability.
