00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.940
so when you go to sleep at night if

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950
so when you go to sleep at night if
 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.500
so when you go to sleep at night if
you're someone who hasn't had any sleep

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:06.510
you're someone who hasn't had any sleep
 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.420
you're someone who hasn't had any sleep
deprivation you're very normal sleep

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:08.430
deprivation you're very normal sleep
 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.609
deprivation you're very normal sleep
pattern what we tend to see is that in

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:10.619
pattern what we tend to see is that in
 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.250
pattern what we tend to see is that in
adults they go to bed and they start off

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260
adults they go to bed and they start off
 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.350
adults they go to bed and they start off
by going into the deeper stages of sleep

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
by going into the deeper stages of sleep
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.570
by going into the deeper stages of sleep
so the deeper stages of sleep are really

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580
so the deeper stages of sleep are really
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.060
so the deeper stages of sleep are really
those times of quiescence you're really

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
those times of quiescence you're really
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.760
those times of quiescence you're really
restoring your body and we have a few

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770
restoring your body and we have a few
 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.260
restoring your body and we have a few
different stages of sleep so you have

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270
different stages of sleep so you have
 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.450
different stages of sleep so you have
sleep stage 1 2 and then 3/4 one is a

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
sleep stage 1 2 and then 3/4 one is a
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.070
sleep stage 1 2 and then 3/4 one is a
little bit lighter stage of the quiet

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
little bit lighter stage of the quiet
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.410
little bit lighter stage of the quiet
non REM sleep and then 3 4 is really

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
non REM sleep and then 3 4 is really
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.319
non REM sleep and then 3 4 is really
deep deep sleep and what you want is you

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
deep deep sleep and what you want is you
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.660
deep deep sleep and what you want is you
actually want a number of you want to go

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
actually want a number of you want to go
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.160
actually want a number of you want to go
through all these stages throughout the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
through all these stages throughout the
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.780
through all these stages throughout the
night so people only focus on getting

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
night so people only focus on getting
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.240
night so people only focus on getting
the deep sleep but in reality we spend

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250
the deep sleep but in reality we spend
 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250
the deep sleep but in reality we spend
almost 60% of the night in this stage to

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
almost 60% of the night in this stage to
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.410
almost 60% of the night in this stage to
sleep so we go through in the beginning

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
sleep so we go through in the beginning
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.850
sleep so we go through in the beginning
of the night we go into the really deep

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860
of the night we go into the really deep
 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.010
of the night we go into the really deep
stages of sleep and we actually cycle

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
stages of sleep and we actually cycle
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.930
stages of sleep and we actually cycle
through so when you go down to the deep

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
through so when you go down to the deep
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.120
through so when you go down to the deep
stage then you go back up and you

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130
stage then you go back up and you
 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.650
stage then you go back up and you
actually come into something called REM

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
actually come into something called REM
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.139
actually come into something called REM
sleep which is after about 90 minutes so

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
sleep which is after about 90 minutes so
 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729
sleep which is after about 90 minutes so
when you're in limb sleep your brain is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
when you're in limb sleep your brain is
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.039
when you're in limb sleep your brain is
very active your body's quiet but your

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
very active your body's quiet but your
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.630
very active your body's quiet but your
brain is really processing a lot of

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
brain is really processing a lot of
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.459
brain is really processing a lot of
things a lot of emotions we dream the

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469
things a lot of emotions we dream the
 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.440
things a lot of emotions we dream the
most right and sleep and then you go

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
most right and sleep and then you go
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.050
most right and sleep and then you go
back down into deep stages and so on so

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
back down into deep stages and so on so
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.029
back down into deep stages and so on so
forth and you cycle throughout so that

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039
forth and you cycle throughout so that
 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.219
forth and you cycle throughout so that
you do about 5 to 6 cycles throughout

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
you do about 5 to 6 cycles throughout
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.010
you do about 5 to 6 cycles throughout
the night and we spend more time in REM

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
the night and we spend more time in REM
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.050
the night and we spend more time in REM
later on in the night than we do earlier

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
later on in the night than we do earlier
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.550
later on in the night than we do earlier
on that's why people tend to remember

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
on that's why people tend to remember
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.230
on that's why people tend to remember
their dreams in the morning a little bit

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
their dreams in the morning a little bit
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.059
their dreams in the morning a little bit
better and if earlier in the night when

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:26.069
better and if earlier in the night when
 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:27.469
better and if earlier in the night when
you're really in a lot of deep sleep

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
you're really in a lot of deep sleep
 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.899
you're really in a lot of deep sleep
if someone wakes you or the phone rings

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
if someone wakes you or the phone rings
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.819
if someone wakes you or the phone rings
or something you're really confused

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
or something you're really confused
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.589
or something you're really confused
really even if it's an hour or two after

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599
really even if it's an hour or two after
 

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:34.789
really even if it's an hour or two after
you fell sick because you're in such a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
you fell sick because you're in such a
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.940
you fell sick because you're in such a
deep sleep at that point

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950
 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.650
well sleep tense - we actually don't

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660
well sleep tense - we actually don't
 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.300
well sleep tense - we actually don't
know the function of sleep all that well

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310
know the function of sleep all that well
 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.120
know the function of sleep all that well
yet but sleep is a time of quiescence in

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130
yet but sleep is a time of quiescence in
 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.180
yet but sleep is a time of quiescence in
the brain when you're in the more deeper

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190
the brain when you're in the more deeper
 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.490
the brain when you're in the more deeper
stages of sleep REM sleep your body is

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500
stages of sleep REM sleep your body is
 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.050
stages of sleep REM sleep your body is
quiet but your mind is actually very

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060
quiet but your mind is actually very
 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.120
quiet but your mind is actually very
active so it's a time when your body and

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130
active so it's a time when your body and
 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.840
active so it's a time when your body and
your brain is restoring itself it's

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850
your brain is restoring itself it's
 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.910
your brain is restoring itself it's
repairing any cell damage that happened

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920
repairing any cell damage that happened
 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.330
repairing any cell damage that happened
during the day it's really repairing

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340
during the day it's really repairing
 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.160
during the day it's really repairing
like I said repairing your body but also

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170
like I said repairing your body but also
 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.920
like I said repairing your body but also
helps with digestion helps with memory

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930
helps with digestion helps with memory
 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.110
helps with digestion helps with memory
it has a lot of things that it's doing

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120
it has a lot of things that it's doing
 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.270
it has a lot of things that it's doing
while you're asleep

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280
 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.480
so sleep deprivation and sometimes an

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490
so sleep deprivation and sometimes an
 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.070
so sleep deprivation and sometimes an
insomnia which is a little bit of a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080
insomnia which is a little bit of a
 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.870
insomnia which is a little bit of a
different form but just getting a lack

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880
different form but just getting a lack
 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.370
different form but just getting a lack
of sleep can lead to a number of

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380
of sleep can lead to a number of
 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.470
of sleep can lead to a number of
different decrements so decrements and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480
different decrements so decrements and
 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.900
different decrements so decrements and
attention and concentration being able

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910
attention and concentration being able
 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.480
attention and concentration being able
to learn more efficiently that's just

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490
to learn more efficiently that's just
 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.890
to learn more efficiently that's just
not as good

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900
not as good
 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.620
not as good
also there's motor vehicle accidents

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630
also there's motor vehicle accidents
 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.870
also there's motor vehicle accidents
workplace accidents we see that a lot

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880
workplace accidents we see that a lot
 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.310
workplace accidents we see that a lot
workplace actions with people who are

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320
workplace actions with people who are
 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.140
workplace actions with people who are
sleep deprived or people who work shifts

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150
sleep deprived or people who work shifts
 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.760
sleep deprived or people who work shifts
and they don't get the right amount of

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770
and they don't get the right amount of
 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.260
and they don't get the right amount of
sleep during the day or at night and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270
sleep during the day or at night and
 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.820
sleep during the day or at night and
also there's a new line of research

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830
also there's a new line of research
 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.470
also there's a new line of research
showing that people who don't get enough

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480
showing that people who don't get enough
 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.690
showing that people who don't get enough
sleep their body doesn't metabolize as

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700
sleep their body doesn't metabolize as
 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.780
sleep their body doesn't metabolize as
well and so they actually it leads to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790
well and so they actually it leads to
 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.760
well and so they actually it leads to
weight gain so if you're not getting

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770
weight gain so if you're not getting
 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.170
weight gain so if you're not getting
enough sleep you might have difficulty

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180
enough sleep you might have difficulty
 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.540
enough sleep you might have difficulty
losing weight
