00:00:00.308 --> 00:00:03.078
- [Instructor] So I have a
gumball machine right over here.

00:00:03.078 --> 00:00:07.440
It has yellow, and green,
and pink, and blue gumballs.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.061
Let me throw a few blue ones in there.

00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:12.705
And what we're going to
concern ourselves in this video

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:14.791
are the yellow gumballs.

00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:17.283
And let's say that we
know that the proportion

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.116
of yellow gumballs over here is P.

00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:24.025
This right over here is a population,

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:25.775
population parameter.

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:32.244
And for the sake of argument,
just to make things concrete,

00:00:32.244 --> 00:00:36.894
let's just say that 60% of
the gumballs are yellow,

00:00:36.894 --> 00:00:38.144
or 0.6 of them.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:43.210
Now let's review some things
that we have seen before.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.854
I'm gonna define our
Bernoulli random variable,

00:00:45.854 --> 00:00:49.854
let's call this capital
Y, which is equal to one

00:00:51.027 --> 00:00:54.989
if when we take one random
gumball out of that machine

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.906
we get a, we pick a yellow gumball,

00:00:59.717 --> 00:01:03.930
and it's equal to zero if when
we pick one random gumball

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.812
out of that machine we don't pick yellow,

00:01:06.812 --> 00:01:07.979
so not yellow.

00:01:10.222 --> 00:01:13.099
From previous videos we
know some interesting things

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:15.712
about this Bernoulli random variable.

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:17.202
We know its mean.

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:20.478
We know the mean of our
Bernoulli random variable.

00:01:20.478 --> 00:01:22.837
It's going to be the
proportion of yellow balls

00:01:22.837 --> 00:01:27.105
in this population, so it's
going to be equal to P,

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:31.197
which in this particular
case we know is 0.6,

00:01:31.197 --> 00:01:32.741
and we know what the standard deviation

00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:35.161
of this Bernoulli random variable is.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:39.072
It is going to be P times one minus P,

00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:40.136
actually that's the variance.

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:41.227
We want to take the square root of that

00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:42.832
to get the standard deviation.

00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:45.099
So in this particular scenario,

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:49.266
that's going to be the
square root of 0.6 times 0.4.

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:53.328
Fair enough.

00:01:53.328 --> 00:01:54.826
This is all review so far.

00:01:54.826 --> 00:01:56.899
But now let me define,

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.037
let me define another random variable X,

00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:03.704
which is equal to the
sum of 10 independent,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.177
independent trials, trials of Y.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.967
Now, we have seen random
variables like this before.

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:21.840
This is a binomial random variable.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.238
Now, what do we know about its
mean and standard deviation?

00:02:25.238 --> 00:02:28.416
Well, in previous videos we
know that the mean of this

00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:32.345
binomial random variable is
just going to be equal to

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:36.345
n times the mean of each
of the Bernoulli trials

00:02:37.493 --> 00:02:39.993
right over here, so n times P,

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:44.260
which in this particular
situation is going to be,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.427
n is 10, we're doing 10
trials, and P is zero, 0.6,

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:51.956
which is equal to six.

00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:53.080
And that makes sense.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.310
If 60% of the balls here are yellow

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.133
and if you were to take a
sample or if you were to take

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:01.301
10 trials, so if you were to
take ten balls one at a time,

00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:03.784
they have to be independent,
so you keep looking at them

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:05.623
and then replacing them,
but if you took 10,

00:03:05.623 --> 00:03:08.186
then you would expect that
six of them would be yellow.

00:03:08.186 --> 00:03:10.273
They're not always going to be six yellow,

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.920
but that would be maybe
what you would expect.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.350
All right, now what's the
standard deviation here?

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.369
So our standard deviation is equal to,

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.406
and we have proved this in other videos,

00:03:20.406 --> 00:03:21.647
it's equal to the square root

00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:24.314
of n times P, times one minus P.

00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:28.330
Notice you just put an n right over here

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.836
under the radical sign.

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:33.157
And so this is going to get us
in this particular situation

00:03:33.157 --> 00:03:35.240
to 10 times 0.6 times 0.4

00:03:39.214 --> 00:03:41.795
and then the square root of everything.

00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:43.271
So all of this is review.

00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.794
If it's unfamiliar, I
encourage you to review

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:49.673
some of the videos on
Bernoulli random variables

00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:52.113
and on binomial random variables.

00:03:52.113 --> 00:03:54.011
But what we're going to do in this video

00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:56.672
is think about a sampling distribution

00:03:56.672 --> 00:03:58.598
and it's going to be the
sampling distribution

00:03:58.598 --> 00:04:02.340
for a sample statistic known
as the sample proportion,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.279
which we actually talked
about when we first introduced

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:05.951
sampling distributions.

00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:08.608
So let's say, so let's
just park all of this,

00:04:08.608 --> 00:04:11.511
this is background right over here.

00:04:11.511 --> 00:04:14.177
Let's start taking samples of 10.

00:04:14.177 --> 00:04:15.759
And I didn't pick that randomly.

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.685
I want to make it
reconcile with what we do

00:04:17.685 --> 00:04:19.374
with our random variable here.

00:04:19.374 --> 00:04:23.211
And so let's take a sample of 10 gumballs

00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:27.978
and let's calculate the
proportion that are yellow.

00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:31.114
And so we will call that
our sample proportion,

00:04:31.114 --> 00:04:33.494
and I might as well
just do that in yellow.

00:04:33.494 --> 00:04:35.627
So we want to calculate
the sample proportion

00:04:35.627 --> 00:04:36.875
that are yellow.

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:39.659
And what is this equivalent to?

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.299
Well, you could say, Well
this is equivalent to

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:43.703
my random variable X.

00:04:43.703 --> 00:04:47.022
I want to count the number
of gumballs that are yellow

00:04:47.022 --> 00:04:50.440
and then I'm gonna divide
it by the sample size.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.776
So I'm gonna divide it by n.

00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:56.948
And in this case, it
would be X divided by 10.

00:04:56.948 --> 00:04:58.198
I know what some of you are thinking.

00:04:58.198 --> 00:04:59.034
Wait, wait, wait.

00:04:59.034 --> 00:05:00.280
Hold on for a second.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.530
X is sum of 10 independent,

00:05:03.422 --> 00:05:05.709
independent trials right over here.

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:08.745
To be independent, you
can't just take 10 gumballs.

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:10.127
You have to take them one at a time

00:05:10.127 --> 00:05:12.184
and then replace them
back in order for them

00:05:12.184 --> 00:05:14.236
to be truly independent.

00:05:14.236 --> 00:05:17.136
But remember, we have our 10% rule.

00:05:17.136 --> 00:05:21.102
We have our 10% rule, which
tells us that if a sample

00:05:21.102 --> 00:05:24.564
is less than or equal to
10% of the population,

00:05:24.564 --> 00:05:28.138
that you can treat each of
the gumballs in this situation

00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:29.937
as being independent.

00:05:29.937 --> 00:05:31.869
So let's just say for the sake of argument

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:35.301
that there are 10,000 gumballs in here,

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:36.832
and so we can feel pretty good

00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:38.803
that these samples,
that each of the things

00:05:38.803 --> 00:05:41.820
in the sample are
independent of each other

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.725
by our 10% rule.

00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:45.808
And so each of these are,

00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:50.125
each of these 10 gumballs what we see,

00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:51.882
they are going to be independent,

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:54.711
I'm going to put them in
quotes, by the 10% rule.

00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:58.178
And so in that situation,
we can make this claim

00:05:58.178 --> 00:06:02.553
or we can feel good that
this claim is roughly true.

00:06:02.553 --> 00:06:06.106
And so let's say for that
first sample that we do,

00:06:06.106 --> 00:06:09.273
our sample proportion is equal to 0.3,

00:06:11.286 --> 00:06:13.637
so three of our gumballs just happened,

00:06:13.637 --> 00:06:16.657
three of our 10 gumballs
just happened to be yellow.

00:06:16.657 --> 00:06:18.490
Then we'd do it again.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.002
So we take another sample.

00:06:20.002 --> 00:06:22.974
We calculate our sample
proportion, this statistic again,

00:06:22.974 --> 00:06:25.655
remember, it's trying to estimate
our population parameter,

00:06:25.655 --> 00:06:29.234
and let's say that time it
happens to be seven out of 10,

00:06:29.234 --> 00:06:30.739
and we just keep doing that.

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:35.505
And if we keep doing that,
and we plot it on a dot chart

00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:37.557
or a dot distribution
I guess we could say,

00:06:37.557 --> 00:06:40.664
where our possible outcomes
you could have zero out of 10,

00:06:40.664 --> 00:06:45.391
one out of 10, two, three,
four, five, so half of them,

00:06:45.391 --> 00:06:49.248
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,
so that would be all of them.

00:06:49.248 --> 00:06:53.716
And so you could plot okay,
0.3 is one, two, three,

00:06:53.716 --> 00:06:56.007
that's one scenario where I got,

00:06:56.007 --> 00:06:59.469
where my sample proportion is 0.3.

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:03.088
Then 0.7, that's one
situation where I got a 0.7.

00:07:03.088 --> 00:07:06.333
And let's say I were to
take another sample of 10

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:10.223
and I were to get 0.7, then
you would plot that over here.

00:07:10.223 --> 00:07:13.356
And if you kept taking
samples and kept calculating

00:07:13.356 --> 00:07:16.485
these sample proportions and
you kept plotting it here,

00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:19.315
you would get a better, and
better, and better approximation

00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:23.482
for the sampling distribution
of the sampling proportion.

00:07:25.516 --> 00:07:29.021
But how can we actually
characterize the true sampling

00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:32.071
distribution for the sample proportion?

00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:36.674
What is going to be the mean
of this sampling distribution

00:07:36.674 --> 00:07:39.873
and what is going to be
the standard deviation?

00:07:39.873 --> 00:07:43.717
Well, we can derive that from
what we see right over here.

00:07:43.717 --> 00:07:47.197
The mean of our sampling distribution

00:07:47.197 --> 00:07:51.187
of our sample proportion is
just going to be equal to

00:07:51.187 --> 00:07:55.581
the mean of our random
variable X divided by n.

00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:59.877
It's just going to be the
mean of X divided by n,

00:07:59.877 --> 00:08:01.853
which is equal to what?

00:08:01.853 --> 00:08:04.089
Well, the mean of X is n times P.

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:06.308
This is n times P.

00:08:06.308 --> 00:08:09.798
You divided it by n,
you're going to get P.

00:08:09.798 --> 00:08:11.396
And that makes sense.

00:08:11.396 --> 00:08:13.261
One way to think about
it, the expected value

00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:15.598
for your sample proportion is going to be

00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:18.256
the proportion of gumballs
that you actually see.

00:08:18.256 --> 00:08:21.068
And so this also a good indicator
that this is going to be

00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:23.501
a reasonably unbiased estimator.

00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:26.084
Now let's think about
the standard deviation

00:08:26.084 --> 00:08:28.828
for our sample proportion.

00:08:28.828 --> 00:08:31.830
Well, we can just view that
as our standard deviation

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.186
of our binomial random
variable X divided by n.

00:08:36.186 --> 00:08:39.809
So this is going to be
equal to the square root of

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:43.892
n times P, times one minus
P, all of that over n,

00:08:45.031 --> 00:08:47.242
which is the same thing as if we put this,

00:08:47.242 --> 00:08:49.855
if we divide by n inside the radical,

00:08:49.855 --> 00:08:51.468
it'd be the same thing as the square root

00:08:51.468 --> 00:08:54.718
of nP times one minus P over n squared.

00:08:57.276 --> 00:08:59.978
Divide the numerator and denominator by n,

00:08:59.978 --> 00:09:04.145
you will get the square
root of P times one minus P,

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.353
all of that over n.

00:09:08.294 --> 00:09:10.797
And so in this particular situation,

00:09:10.797 --> 00:09:13.611
where our parameter is 0.6,

00:09:13.611 --> 00:09:16.098
where our population parameter is 0.6,

00:09:16.098 --> 00:09:20.350
so it's going to be 0.6,
that's the true proportion

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.835
for our population.

00:09:21.835 --> 00:09:24.410
And then what would out
standard deviation be

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.577
for our sample proportion?

00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:30.879
Well, it's going to be
equal to the square root

00:09:30.879 --> 00:09:34.046
of 0.6 times 0.4, all of that over 10.

00:09:36.006 --> 00:09:38.491
And we can get a calculator
out to calculate that.

00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:42.658
So if we take 0.6 times 0.4
equals, divided by 10, equals,

00:09:45.716 --> 00:09:47.844
and then we take the square root of that,

00:09:47.844 --> 00:09:50.761
and we get it's approximately 0.15.

00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:54.407
Approximately 0.15.
