[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.860
Hi, my name is Pamela.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.240
I'm the CEO at Stories.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.250
We start building the app
in the US to test the idea.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.470
And now we are working in the
server with Python, Redis,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.000
and Django to host
it in Google Cloud.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.180
With Stories, we want to create
a world [? live ?] library

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.060
of [? heard ?] stories.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.890
So we want to get stories
from all the world.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.020
And maybe when you
go to other places,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.540
then you can read stories about
it or know what is inspiring

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.650
people to write the stories.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.930
Many people are starting
to do their own challenges.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.510
For example, a
Chilean writer made

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.960
"100 [? And ?] Writing Days."

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.640
And now she's going
to publish the book.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.370
And because of that,
all people start

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280
to make their own challenges.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.920
For example, with
the special dates,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.530
like Halloween,
users start writing

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.620
because they want
to share stories

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.240
about Halloween or horror.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.860
And they ask for us to make
a picture of the challenge

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.320
to motivate more
people to write.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.280
Everybody has the
stories to tell.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.840
And everybody wants
to hear a good story.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.470
So we were trying to invite
people to share stories

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.530
and see the life
with writer eyes.
