00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
we mean with word embeddings okay the
 

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:47.889 align:start position:0%
we mean with word embeddings okay the
point<00:14:43.790><c> is</c><00:14:44.029><c> to</c><00:14:44.509><c> try</c><00:14:44.779><c> to</c><00:14:44.839><c> represent</c><00:14:45.439><c> a</c><00:14:46.009><c> word</c><00:14:46.939><c> as</c><00:14:47.180><c> a</c>

00:14:47.889 --> 00:14:47.899 align:start position:0%
point is to try to represent a word as a
 

00:14:47.899 --> 00:14:50.889 align:start position:0%
point is to try to represent a word as a

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:50.899 align:start position:0%
real valued vector that basically
 

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:54.009 align:start position:0%
real valued vector that basically
represents<00:14:51.740><c> what</c><00:14:52.550><c> that</c><00:14:52.759><c> words</c><00:14:53.029><c> means</c><00:14:53.449><c> in</c>

00:14:54.009 --> 00:14:54.019 align:start position:0%
represents what that words means in
 

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.620 align:start position:0%
represents what that words means in
terms<00:14:54.350><c> of</c><00:14:54.649><c> other</c><00:14:55.009><c> words</c><00:14:55.339><c> right</c><00:14:55.790><c> so</c><00:14:56.060><c> so</c><00:14:56.449><c> the</c><00:14:56.600><c> the</c>

by<00:23:07.890><c> the</c><00:23:07.950><c> Semantic</c><00:23:08.400><c> Web</c><00:23:08.430><c> community</c><00:23:09.060><c> how</c><00:23:09.690><c> can</c><00:23:09.720><c> we</c>

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:10.350 align:start position:0%
by the Semantic Web community how can we
 

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
by the Semantic Web community how can we
better<00:23:11.190><c> improve</c><00:23:11.580><c> this</c><00:23:11.760><c> automated</c><00:23:12.150><c> knowledge</c>

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:12.450 align:start position:0%
better improve this automated knowledge
 

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.930 align:start position:0%
better improve this automated knowledge
based<00:23:12.660><c> construction</c><00:23:13.260><c> so</c><00:23:14.100><c> the</c><00:23:14.220><c> team</c><00:23:14.430><c> used</c><00:23:14.760><c> a</c>

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
based construction so the team used a
 

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
based construction so the team used a
combination<00:23:15.150><c> of</c><00:23:15.600><c> these</c><00:23:15.720><c> word</c><00:23:16.260><c> embeddings</c><00:23:16.970><c> to</c>

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:17.970 align:start position:0%
combination of these word embeddings to
 

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.810 align:start position:0%
combination of these word embeddings to
be<00:23:18.120><c> able</c><00:23:18.240><c> to</c><00:23:18.420><c> search</c><00:23:19.080><c> for</c><00:23:19.110><c> and</c><00:23:19.820><c> validate</c>

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
be able to search for and validate
 

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.700 align:start position:0%
be able to search for and validate

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:22.710 align:start position:0%
information gained from a set of
 

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.650 align:start position:0%

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
structured and unstructured knowledge so
 

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.870 align:start position:0%
structured and unstructured knowledge so
this<00:23:24.780><c> is</c><00:23:25.050><c> actually</c><00:23:25.410><c> one</c><00:23:25.620><c> first</c><00:23:26.280><c> place</c><00:23:26.490><c> in</c><00:23:26.730><c> the</c>

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is actually one first place in the
 

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
this is actually one first place in the

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:31.770 align:start position:0%
in the 2017 semantic web challenge okay
 

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
in the 2017 semantic web challenge okay
so<00:23:32.160><c> now</c><00:23:32.400><c> we</c><00:23:32.460><c> were</c><00:23:32.910><c> kind</c><00:23:33.150><c> of</c><00:23:33.210><c> getting</c><00:23:33.360><c> an</c><00:23:33.570><c> idea</c>

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:33.690 align:start position:0%
so now we were kind of getting an idea
 

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
so now we were kind of getting an idea
about<00:23:34.290><c> how</c><00:23:34.800><c> we</c><00:23:35.220><c> would</c><00:23:35.870><c> take</c><00:23:37.310><c> language</c><00:23:38.310><c> make</c><00:23:39.180><c> it</c>

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:39.330 align:start position:0%

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
computational put it into a knowledge
 

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.370 align:start position:0%
computational put it into a knowledge
base<00:23:41.970><c> so</c><00:23:42.000><c> that</c><00:23:42.360><c> we</c><00:23:42.450><c> can</c><00:23:42.600><c> aggregate</c><00:23:42.750><c> it</c><00:23:43.170><c> over</c>

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
