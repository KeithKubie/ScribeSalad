Fitzpatrick:
Hello, and this is,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.067
despite other slides
to the contrary,

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:07.067
"The Myth
of the 'Genius Programmer.'"

00:00:07.067 --> 00:00:08.734
And before we get started...

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:10.234
Collins-Sussman:
Should we do some introductions?

00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:12.234
Fitzpatrick: Should we do--
Your mic--can't hear your mic.

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:13.834
Collins-Sussman:
Can't hear my mic at all.

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:14.901
Well, let's fix that.

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:16.901
Hey. So let's do
some introductions.

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:18.400
Who are we?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.901
Fitzpatrick:
My name is Brian Fitzpatrick.

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:21.234
I usually go by Fitz.

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:23.067
Collins-Sussman:
My name is Ben Collins-Sussman.

00:00:23.067 --> 00:00:25.234
I usually go
by Ben Collins-Sussman.

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:26.901
Fitzpatrick:
And we're basically a couple

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:28.901
of long-time
Version Control geeks.

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:31.234
We worked
on Subversion years ago.

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:32.734
Collins-Sussman:
And we have a lot of experience

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.133
in the Open Source world,

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.901
so we tend to speak about things
that are related to Open Source,

00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:38.901
but not necessarily related
to Open Source.

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:40.567
Fitzpatrick: Right.
When we started at Google,

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.734
we worked on code.google.com.

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:44.901
We still work
with Google Code, actually.

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:46.567
Collins-Sussman: Absolutely.
And if you're interested

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.734
in the project-hosting service,
which is what my team works on,

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:51.100
we're doing a talk tomorrow

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.400
about our Mercurial
implementation

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.033
on top
of Google infrastructure,

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:57.734
which is a new feature
on Google Code.

00:00:57.734 --> 00:00:58.734
So come see that.

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:00.400
Fitzpatrick:
But enough about us.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.701
Who are you?

00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.067
So we have
a couple questions for you,

00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:05.067
so we can get an idea
about the audience.

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:06.234
Collins-Sussman: Survey.
Fitzpatrick: Survey.

00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:08.734
So how many people
in this room write code

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.400
entirely by themselves only?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.734
Never with other people.

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:14.234
Collins-Sussman:
Or how many people

00:01:14.234 --> 00:01:15.901
like writing code
by themselves?

00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:17.067
Fitzpatrick:
All right, yeah.

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:18.400
Collins-Sussman:
All right, that's great.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.234
Fitzpatrick: So how many people
work in teams?

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:22.400
Okay, that's good.
Everybody's awake.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.934
How many people in this room
do code reviews

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:27.234
as part
of your development process?

00:01:27.234 --> 00:01:28.400
Collins-Sussman:
Wow.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.734
Fitzpatrick:
Is that good or bad?

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:31.567
Collins-Sussman:
I'm impressed. That's great.

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:33.400
Fitzpatrick:
All right, one last question.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.567
Who is afraid of looking stupid
in front of other people?

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:39.400
All right,
we're in the right place.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.400
Excellent.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.734
Collins-Sussman:
So before we go on,

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.901
we should let you know
these are very opinionated talks

00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:45.567
that Fitz and I give
every year.

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:47.734
They're really based on our own
subjective experience,

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:49.100
and that's fine.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.567
You know, if we say things
that upset you or anger you,

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:53.234
we've done our job.
Fitzpatrick: Right.

00:01:53.234 --> 00:01:54.234
Collins-Sussman:
And we encourage you,

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:55.400
if you don't like it, you can...

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.100
Fitzpatrick:
If you have different opinions,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.901
please get your own talk
at your own conference.

00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:00.167
[laughter]

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:01.734
So before we go, though,

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:03.400
we're gonna have you do
a little more work.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.400
You're gonna have to read
a few slides

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
and check out
some of our quotes here

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.400
that we've got.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.734
Collins-Sussman:
What is this talk about?

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:12.234
Fitzpatrick: We're not gonna
read them to you,

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:14.000
so here's the first one.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.167
All right.
The second one.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.834
Okay, and now
for a really good one.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.267
Collins-Sussman:
Okay.

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:33.067
So what do these all have
in common?

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:36.067
You guys, any ideas here?

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:38.234
All right, it's
a rhetorical question, but...

00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:39.734
Right, so what's going on here,

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:41.734
there's a lot of insecurity
going on, right?

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:43.400
This is a common feeling
that we all have.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.400
So we're gonna go off of this.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.734
We're actually getting these
responses last year at I/O.

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:50.567
People were coming up to me
and saying these sort of things.

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:52.067
So it got us thinking about,

00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:53.501
"Well, what's going on
with psychology here?

00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:54.901
"What's going on
in people's heads?

00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:56.734
"Why do they want to hide
their code so much?

00:02:56.734 --> 00:02:58.734
What's really
at the bottom of this?"

00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:00.334
Which is how we came up
with this talk

00:03:00.334 --> 00:03:01.567
and where we get this idea

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:03.734
of the myth
of the genius programmer.

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:05.234
Let's do one more quote.

00:03:05.234 --> 00:03:06.834
Fitzpatrick:
Okay.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.667
Collins-Sussman: Interesting.
"Pervasive elitism."

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.234
Fitzpatrick: This is rooted
out of a general desire

00:03:14.234 --> 00:03:15.567
to not look stupid.

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:17.400
It's sort of a--
you know, everybody, I think,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.400
wants to look
like a smart developer.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.267
I know I certainly do,
to some extent.

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:25.000
And--but there's
a lot of different reasons

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.567
behind why people do this,
and we're gonna start

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:29.901
with something a little
almost seemingly unrelated.

00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:34.067
But why do people buy products
endorsed by celebrities, okay?

00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:37.434
Michelle Obama wore this dress
to the Inauguration, okay?

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:39.567
Boom, suddenly,
it sold out, all right?

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:40.901
Collins-Sussman:
Or Michael Jordan

00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:42.400
wears Nike shoes, right?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.901
Everyone wants to buy Nikes

00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:45.734
'cause they love Jordan
or basketball.

00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:47.167
What's really going on here?

00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:49.167
Like, do you actually believe
that if you buy Air Jordans,

00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:51.234
you're gonna be
as good as Michael Jordan?

00:03:51.234 --> 00:03:52.567
Fitzpatrick: Yes.
Collins-Sussman: No.

00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:54.234
But there's something
going on, right?

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.567
There's some nugget of
human psychology going on here,

00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:59.734
where it's in our instinct
to find celebrities,

00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:02.968
find people to idolize and want
to be like those people,

00:04:02.968 --> 00:04:06.601
and we sort of latch on
to whatever simple behaviors

00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:09.567
or materialistic pieces
that remind us

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:12.434
of this celebrity
or this behavior.

00:04:12.434 --> 00:04:14.234
Fitzpatrick: That's true in the
world of programming as well.

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:15.501
I mean, we have our heroes.

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:18.734
We have Linus Torvalds,
to some extent, Bill Gates even.

00:04:18.734 --> 00:04:20.400
Guido here at Google--

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.901
you know, I mean, he wrote
Python himself, right?

00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:24.234
Not quite true, you know?

00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:25.901
Collins-Sussman: Did Linus write
Linux all by himself?

00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:27.901
Fitzpatrick: Right.
We have Kernighan and Pike

00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:29.367
and Kernighan and Ritchie.

00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:31.901
I mean, these guys don't always
deserve all the credit.

00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:33.567
They certainly deserve
some of the credit.

00:04:33.567 --> 00:04:34.868
They're the leaders, right?

00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:36.534
Or they sort of
started something,

00:04:36.534 --> 00:04:38.033
but they're mythologized.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.734
So the personas
that they become

00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:42.734
are bigger than life,
to some extent,

00:04:42.734 --> 00:04:44.601
and, to some extent,

00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:46.901
rooted in a little nugget
of truth or fact

00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:48.901
and a whole lot of myth.

00:04:48.901 --> 00:04:50.567
Collins-Sussman:
So that's why we have this myth.

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:52.234
When we say "the myth
of the genius programmer,"

00:04:52.234 --> 00:04:55.534
we're talking about the myth
of, "Hey, here's a genius,

00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:59.033
"and genius goes off in a cave
and writes this brilliant thing

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:00.934
"and then reveals it
to the world

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:03.567
and, 'Oh, my gosh, this person's
famous forever,'" right?

00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:06.067
Reality is, that's not really
how it works at all.

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:08.567
They're--In fact, geniuses...

00:05:08.567 --> 00:05:11.901
they are so incredibly rare
that, I mean, it's almost--

00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:13.567
it's kind of
a meaningless term, right?

00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:14.901
Fitzpatrick: Right.
Collins-Sussman: Those folks--

00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:16.801
That myth just isn't true.

00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:19.334
Fitzpatrick: So, yeah,
the ultimate geek fantasy

00:05:19.334 --> 00:05:22.901
is to go off into your cave
and work and type in code

00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:24.300
and then shock the world

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.067
with your brilliant
new invention, you know?

00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:29.367
You--It's a desire to be seen
as a genius by your peers.

00:05:29.367 --> 00:05:31.234
Collins-Sussman: But there's
a flip side to that too, right?

00:05:31.234 --> 00:05:33.400
It's not just about,
"I want everyone to--

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.734
I want to be a genius
and shock the world."

00:05:35.734 --> 00:05:38.067
It's also, "I'm insecure."

00:05:38.067 --> 00:05:40.167
And what I mean by that is,
you know,

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:41.834
"I also don't want people
to see my mistakes.

00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:43.234
"All right,
maybe I won't be a genius.

00:05:43.234 --> 00:05:45.567
"Maybe I won't shock the world
with my brilliance,

00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:47.567
"but at least I don't want them
to see my trail

00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:49.234
"of failures and mistakes,

00:05:49.234 --> 00:05:51.567
and I'm gonna cover
my tracks," right?

00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:53.901
Fitzpatrick: Well, they want to
be seen as being clever, right?

00:05:53.901 --> 00:05:55.567
Collins-Sussman: Clever people
don't make mistakes.

00:05:55.567 --> 00:05:56.801
Fitzpatrick:
Right, exactly.

00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:59.067
So the result is people wind up
working in a cave.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.167
A classic example of this is,

00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:04.567
how long will you drive around
before asking for directions?

00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:05.667
Okay?

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:07.067
How long are you gonna be
completely lost

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:08.901
before asking
for directions, you know?

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.234
I mean, you're not gonna say,
"Oh, I'm lost.

00:06:10.234 --> 00:06:11.901
I'm immediately gonna ask
for directions."

00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:13.400
Collins-Sussman:
Well, it's hard to admit

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.901
that you've made mistakes
sometimes,

00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:16.934
especially publicly, right?

00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:19.000
So that's why we showed
these quotes in the beginning

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.734
with people saying, you know,
"Can you erase my history?

00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:24.267
Can you hide my project
until it's perfect?"

00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:25.567
Right? I mean,
it's more of this,

00:06:25.567 --> 00:06:27.234
"I don't want to show everybody
what I'm doing

00:06:27.234 --> 00:06:28.734
till I think it's perfect."

00:06:28.734 --> 00:06:30.400
Fitzpatrick: Right. So you may
be thinking, "Well, big deal."

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.567
Collins-Sussman:
Why do we care?

00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:32.734
Fitzpatrick:
Why is this a problem?

00:06:32.734 --> 00:06:33.901
Why should I care about this?

00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:36.601
The primary reason
is it inhibits progress

00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:40.133
and not just personal progress,
but project progress, okay?

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:44.734
It's sort of the "many eyes
make all bugs shallow" quote.

00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:47.400
But if everyone's off
working in a cave

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.234
and just occasionally throwing
code out to the project,

00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:52.234
code quality remains low,

00:06:52.234 --> 00:06:54.234
and your bus factor
remains low.

00:06:54.234 --> 00:06:56.901
How many people here have ever
heard of the bus factor?

00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.767
Collins-Sussman:
We talk about it every year.

00:06:58.767 --> 00:07:00.167
Fitzpatrick:
Weren't you here last year?

00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:01.234
No, okay.

00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:03.234
Bus factor
is the number of people

00:07:03.234 --> 00:07:04.400
on your software project

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.400
that have to get hit by a bus

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.801
that are gonna leave you
in a world of hell, okay?

00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:11.901
All right?
So if there's only one person

00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:14.400
that knows that really obscure
file-system code

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.901
and they get hit by a bus,

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:19.067
whether that bus comes
in the form of an actual bus,

00:07:19.067 --> 00:07:20.767
or they get married,

00:07:20.767 --> 00:07:22.734
or they have a kid,
or they change jobs,

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.400
or they move away,
or they get bored...

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.901
Collins-Sussman:
It happens all the time.

00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:27.234
So this is one of the things

00:07:27.234 --> 00:07:29.434
we talk about all the time
in teams,

00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:33.067
whether it's a team at work
or a team on an Open Source,

00:07:33.067 --> 00:07:37.000
is to not get so territorial
that you have low bus factor

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.467
on different components, right?

00:07:38.467 --> 00:07:39.667
It's a common thing, right?

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:40.834
You know,
you can't touch that code.

00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:42.067
It belongs to Joe.

00:07:42.067 --> 00:07:43.234
Well, wait a second, you know.

00:07:43.234 --> 00:07:44.567
What happens
if Joe's gone, right?

00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:45.868
Now you're in trouble.

00:07:45.868 --> 00:07:47.400
So one of the things
you should be watching out for

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.567
is you should have
as many people touching

00:07:49.567 --> 00:07:50.734
and getting familiar

00:07:50.734 --> 00:07:52.400
with as many parts of the code
as possible.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.801
You want that redundancy
on your team.

00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:56.434
But if you're off working
in a cave

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:57.901
and you're hiding your tracks,

00:07:57.901 --> 00:08:00.667
well, no one knows
what you're doing.

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:01.834
Fitzpatrick:
You could be working

00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:03.901
on the wrong thing entirely,
actually,

00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:06.033
if you're off doing
some really big feature

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:07.334
or big piece of code.

00:08:07.334 --> 00:08:08.734
Collins-Sussman:
Well, here's a nice analogy

00:08:08.734 --> 00:08:10.567
that we like to talk about,
which is, you know,

00:08:10.567 --> 00:08:12.901
think about the way you interact
with your compiler, right?

00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:14.567
You have a really tight
feedback, right?

00:08:14.567 --> 00:08:16.901
You write a function,
you compile it,

00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:19.067
make sure it
at least compiles, right?

00:08:19.067 --> 00:08:21.734
Maybe you write a UniTest
if you're doing great, right?

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:24.400
But nobody sits down
and writes,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.400
you know, thousands
and thousands of lines of code

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.067
and then runs their compiler
for the first time.

00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:29.400
It just doesn't happen.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.901
Fitzpatrick: Not anymore.
Collins-Sussman: [laughs]

00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:32.234
Fitzpatrick:
Maybe 50 years ago, right?

00:08:32.234 --> 00:08:34.400
Collins-Sussman: Right.
In the mainframe days maybe.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.501
So, you know,
it's the same way--

00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:38.901
if you're working
on programming in any way,

00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:41.434
you should not be doing it all
in a cave

00:08:41.434 --> 00:08:43.701
and then sort of waiting to
spring it and see what happens.

00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:46.234
You want other people seeing
what you're doing

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:47.901
as soon
as it makes sense, right?

00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:49.400
We'll talk about what that is.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.934
Fitzpatrick: Right.
But I mean, in addition,

00:08:50.934 --> 00:08:53.067
if you're off in the cave,
you don't learn as quickly.

00:08:53.067 --> 00:08:54.901
It's harder for you
to improve your skills, right?

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:58.234
There's a balance
between spinning your wheels

00:08:58.234 --> 00:08:59.567
and being lost

00:08:59.567 --> 00:09:01.667
and asking the person
next to you

00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:04.567
every question that comes
into your head, right?

00:09:04.567 --> 00:09:07.400
But I mean, this problem isn't
unique to computer science.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.234
It pervades all sciences,
you know, math, anthropology,

00:09:10.234 --> 00:09:12.567
especially when you get
into hard research,

00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:13.901
you know, you see
this sort of thing.

00:09:13.901 --> 00:09:15.167
Collins-Sussman:
Well, I think if any folks

00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:16.400
are in the academic world,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.901
and computer science
is part of this,

00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:20.400
there's this constant tension
probably caused

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.901
by the "publish or perish"
philosophy, right?

00:09:22.901 --> 00:09:25.901
Where, gee, you're all supposed
to be in academia.

00:09:25.901 --> 00:09:27.400
You're supposed
to be sharing knowledge

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.234
and collaborating
and helping each other

00:09:29.234 --> 00:09:32.067
and cooperatively advancing
the state of the art,

00:09:32.067 --> 00:09:34.734
but everybody has to hold
their research to their chest

00:09:34.734 --> 00:09:37.067
and not show anybody
what they're doing

00:09:37.067 --> 00:09:38.567
until they're published, right?

00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:39.567
And what happens?

00:09:39.567 --> 00:09:41.200
Oh, you end up
publishing a paper

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.267
which is redundant with somebody
else's paper, right?

00:09:44.267 --> 00:09:46.567
Or maybe you worked on the wrong
thing and didn't realize it

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:48.234
'cause you never told anybody
what you were doing.

00:09:48.234 --> 00:09:50.567
Or maybe if you had collaborated
with this other person,

00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:53.067
you guys could've written
a better paper together, right?

00:09:53.067 --> 00:09:56.067
Same exact tension,
just in writing software, right?

00:09:56.067 --> 00:09:59.167
The sooner you get your idea out
and other people looking at it,

00:09:59.167 --> 00:10:01.567
you can find out, "Am I working
on the right thing?

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:03.734
"Do I have the right idea?

00:10:03.734 --> 00:10:05.400
"Should I go back
to the drawing board?

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.901
"Should I be collaborating
with this person

00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:08.234
'cause they're working
on it too?"

00:10:08.234 --> 00:10:09.501
I mean, it's the same issue.

00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:11.801
Fitzpatrick: Right.
So a little bit of more bad news

00:10:11.801 --> 00:10:13.167
to this for you, okay?

00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:16.901
Is that you're not
a one-of-a-kind, right?

00:10:16.901 --> 00:10:19.234
Okay?

00:10:19.234 --> 00:10:21.734
The, uh...

00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:23.400
If you're
one-in-a-million, right?

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.667
That means there's over
a thousand people just like you

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.400
out there right now, okay?
Collins-Sussman: It's true.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.901
[laughs]

00:10:28.901 --> 00:10:30.901
Fitzpatrick: Glad you guys
liked that. Thanks.

00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:32.167
But even if you're a genius,

00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:34.567
working well with others
may make or break you, okay?

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:36.067
Like attracts like.

00:10:36.067 --> 00:10:39.767
And we work hard to hire
really smart people at Google.

00:10:39.767 --> 00:10:41.567
And I don't care
how smart you are.

00:10:41.567 --> 00:10:44.567
If you can't sit there and
communicate with someone else

00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:47.567
or work together in a team
and achieve consensus,

00:10:47.567 --> 00:10:50.300
you're not gonna be successful
working on a team of people.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.667
Collins-Sussman:
This is one of those things

00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:52.968
that I always try
to communicate,

00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:54.234
especially to students

00:10:54.234 --> 00:10:55.534
who are just starting out
in computer science

00:10:55.534 --> 00:10:57.100
is that software,

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.968
even though it's fun
to write code alone,

00:10:59.968 --> 00:11:02.234
you know, late at night
in your basement, whatever,

00:11:02.234 --> 00:11:04.634
actually writing software
that's successful--

00:11:04.634 --> 00:11:07.033
it's an inherently
collaborative activity.

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.801
And it actually forces you
to deal with people

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:10.901
and talk with people, and
that's why we encourage people

00:11:10.901 --> 00:11:13.100
to get involved in Open Source,
because it's sort of like,

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.901
"Okay, well,
maybe you're still in college,

00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:16.734
but here's your chance
to actually work with people

00:11:16.734 --> 00:11:18.734
and work on a team
and see what it's gonna be like.

00:11:18.734 --> 00:11:21.667
I mean, one of the things
I always ask people is,

00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:23.901
"Can you name
a piece of software

00:11:23.901 --> 00:11:25.601
"that's really successful,

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:27.567
"really widely used
by a lot of people,

00:11:27.567 --> 00:11:29.234
and was written by one person?"

00:11:29.234 --> 00:11:31.234
Fitzpatrick: And before anybody
yells out Metafont,

00:11:31.234 --> 00:11:34.734
that's not widely used, okay?

00:11:34.734 --> 00:11:36.400
But anyway,
so this is a trap, okay?

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.234
Of this sort of
wanting to be a genius.

00:11:38.234 --> 00:11:40.567
So how do we avoid this, okay?

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:44.067
Quite frankly, the first step
is to drop the ego, okay?

00:11:44.067 --> 00:11:46.067
Instead of having
a large personal ego,

00:11:46.067 --> 00:11:49.067
which actually impedes
collaborating on a project,

00:11:49.067 --> 00:11:52.067
have a strong collective ego
around your project

00:11:52.067 --> 00:11:53.968
or the piece of software
you're working on.

00:11:53.968 --> 00:11:55.400
A great example
in the Open Source world

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.267
is the Apache
Software Foundation, okay?

00:11:58.267 --> 00:12:01.267
Community is the essence
of every project

00:12:01.267 --> 00:12:02.968
in the Apache
Software Foundation.

00:12:02.968 --> 00:12:05.734
That's what's most important
to them, more so than code.

00:12:05.734 --> 00:12:07.567
Companies call Apache up
all the time and say,

00:12:07.567 --> 00:12:09.567
"Hey, we want to give you guys
a billion lines of code.

00:12:09.567 --> 00:12:10.567
Blah, blah, blah."

00:12:10.567 --> 00:12:11.801
Collins-Sussman:
And then walk away.

00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:13.000
Fitzpatrick: And then, yeah,
"Have a nice day."

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.100
And they're like,
"We don't want it.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.734
"We don't want
a pile of code by itself

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:17.234
"that it's just gonna bit rot.

00:12:17.234 --> 00:12:18.901
We want to build
a community around this."

00:12:18.901 --> 00:12:21.067
And so, as a result,
people working on the projects

00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:23.567
tend to be proud of--I mean,
I don't know about you guys,

00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:25.734
but I want to be proud of
the stuff that I'm working on.

00:12:25.734 --> 00:12:27.033
Collins-Sussman:
Absolutely.

00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:28.567
It's a good way to keep
your project healthy too.

00:12:28.567 --> 00:12:30.400
Fitzpatrick: So you don't want
to be this guy.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.901
Collins-Sussman:
Not on your project.

00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:33.734
Next thing to think about

00:12:33.734 --> 00:12:35.901
is how you interact
with people.

00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:37.868
How do you give
each other feedback?

00:12:37.868 --> 00:12:40.801
And it involves, you know,
actually being a nice person.

00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:42.434
Fitzpatrick: What?
Collins-Sussman: I know.

00:12:42.434 --> 00:12:43.834
It's crazy.

00:12:43.834 --> 00:12:45.901
But it is--actually,
it is a learned skill

00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:48.067
to give constructive criticism,

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:50.300
whether it be a code review
or just a design,

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.901
discussion of design.

00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:53.767
And to take criticism as well.

00:12:53.767 --> 00:12:56.400
If you work in Open Source, you
learn to be pretty thick-skinned

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.567
so that you can take
nonconstructive criticism

00:12:58.567 --> 00:13:00.167
along with
the constructive criticism,

00:13:00.167 --> 00:13:02.734
but it's something that we
should all aspire to do, right?

00:13:02.734 --> 00:13:04.901
Is how to do it in a nice way.

00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:07.167
Fitzpatrick: Right.
The way to look at it is that

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:10.000
your code
isn't part of you, right?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.067
You want to work for the best
piece of software as a whole,

00:13:13.067 --> 00:13:15.934
not to sort of get
your one little clever bit in.

00:13:15.934 --> 00:13:18.267
Here's an anecdote.

00:13:18.267 --> 00:13:20.400
A friend of mine
left Apple a few years ago,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.868
went to work
at a smaller company

00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:24.767
that had been around for a while
as an engineering manager.

00:13:24.767 --> 00:13:27.200
And he went in and saw that
they were using Version Control,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.133
and he set up so it would
send out code-review emails,

00:13:29.133 --> 00:13:31.200
'cause they weren't sending out
code-review emails.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.834
And he started
doing code reviews.

00:13:32.834 --> 00:13:34.100
And, you know, he thought,

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.934
"Okay, you know,
I'm gonna try and get these guys

00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:37.868
"a little, you know,
more rigorous engineering.

00:13:37.868 --> 00:13:39.467
We'll have
some better practices here."

00:13:39.467 --> 00:13:40.801
And a week and a half later,

00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:43.300
the director of engineering
calls him in and says,

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.667
"You know,
I'm getting a lot of feedback

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:47.834
"that you're really
bringing people down

00:13:47.834 --> 00:13:50.534
with all this negative criticism
of everybody."

00:13:50.534 --> 00:13:52.133
He's like,
"What are you talking about?"

00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:53.567
"Yeah, these code-review things
you're doing,

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:56.267
you know, people are getting
really upset by that."

00:13:56.267 --> 00:13:58.467
And, you know,
how do you respond to that?

00:13:58.467 --> 00:14:01.634
This is something that
is really integral, I think,

00:14:01.634 --> 00:14:03.067
to writing good software.

00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:04.400
Collins-Sussman:
That's a cultural problem, too,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.634
in some companies, right?

00:14:05.634 --> 00:14:06.634
Some people really--

00:14:06.634 --> 00:14:08.367
Especially in a lot
of corporations,

00:14:08.367 --> 00:14:10.434
you'll see
not only territorial--

00:14:10.434 --> 00:14:12.868
You know, "This is my code.
You can't touch it."

00:14:12.868 --> 00:14:15.567
But also, "How dare you
tell me what to write

00:14:15.567 --> 00:14:17.701
"or make comments
on what I just wrote?

00:14:17.701 --> 00:14:19.267
Mind your own business."

00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:20.801
I mean, that is
a very common behavior,

00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:23.467
and it's hard to get companies
to break out of that cycle,

00:14:23.467 --> 00:14:24.868
increase the bus factor,

00:14:24.868 --> 00:14:26.367
do code review all the time.

00:14:26.367 --> 00:14:27.367
At Google, we actually--

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.267
We're not allow to submit code

00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:31.734
into our Version Control system
until there's code review.

00:14:31.734 --> 00:14:34.133
Like, it will reject
your change

00:14:34.133 --> 00:14:36.234
until there's proof
that some peer

00:14:36.234 --> 00:14:38.801
has looked at what you've done
and given it a thumbs-up,

00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:40.334
which is a great thing.

00:14:40.334 --> 00:14:43.133
Fitzpatrick: Right.
So criticism is actually good.

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.901
And the next important thing
is that you have to learn

00:14:44.901 --> 00:14:47.067
to sort of
embrace failure, okay?

00:14:47.067 --> 00:14:49.400
People, I mean--
I'm afraid of failing.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.567
Certainly,
I think most people are, okay?

00:14:51.567 --> 00:14:54.234
But, you know, the whole NASA
"failure is not an option" thing

00:14:54.234 --> 00:14:55.734
is a load of crud, right?

00:14:55.734 --> 00:14:58.400
Failure is an option,
except in one case.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.334
It's failing
on the same thing repeatedly.

00:15:00.334 --> 00:15:02.901
That's never good, because
you're not learning, right?

00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:04.000
Collins-Sussman:
And it's embarrassing.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.334
Fitzpatrick:
Well, it's embarrassing,

00:15:05.334 --> 00:15:07.067
but if you're failing--
You try something and fail.

00:15:07.067 --> 00:15:08.234
Try something different
and fail,

00:15:08.234 --> 00:15:09.400
and you try
something different.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.734
Every time you fail,
you learn something.

00:15:10.734 --> 00:15:12.834
And for many people,
that's the best way

00:15:12.834 --> 00:15:14.234
that they learn
how to do things.

00:15:14.234 --> 00:15:15.734
Some people learn
by sitting in a room

00:15:15.734 --> 00:15:17.901
and hearing two other guys
yammer on forever.

00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:19.234
Some people learn
by reading a book.

00:15:19.234 --> 00:15:20.567
And some people learn
by looking at pictures.

00:15:20.567 --> 00:15:21.901
Some people learn
by trying and failing.

00:15:21.901 --> 00:15:23.567
Collins-Sussman:
Well, this is also important--

00:15:23.567 --> 00:15:25.067
I mean, it's another
cultural issue here,

00:15:25.067 --> 00:15:27.234
is when failure does happen,
be ready for it.

00:15:27.234 --> 00:15:28.934
Don't freak out.

00:15:28.934 --> 00:15:31.067
Document what happened,
what did you learn from it.

00:15:31.067 --> 00:15:32.400
What are you gonna do
different next time, right?

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.400
That's why
we do postmortems on--

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.400
you know,
when something crashes,

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.901
or there's some--
some bad thing happens.

00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:40.567
We write it up
and learn from it.

00:15:40.567 --> 00:15:43.734
Fitzpatrick: Right. And the
point is not to assign blame.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:45.501
It's to look at what you did,

00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:46.801
have everyone else
look at what happened

00:15:46.801 --> 00:15:48.067
so that we don't do this again.

00:15:48.067 --> 00:15:49.901
Collins-Sussman: I think
a big issue also around failure

00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:53.067
is just natural human fear.

00:15:53.067 --> 00:15:55.400
I have a--You know, I can relate
to this personally.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.067
I started learning banjo
a few years ago,

00:15:58.067 --> 00:15:59.901
playing in bluegrass jams.

00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:03.734
And, you know, they would
occasionally try to call on me

00:16:03.734 --> 00:16:05.567
to do banjo solos, right?

00:16:05.567 --> 00:16:07.400
Which is really,
really hard to learn,

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.067
and I just wouldn't do it,
or I--you know, bow out.

00:16:10.067 --> 00:16:11.567
And someone took me aside,
and he said, you know,

00:16:11.567 --> 00:16:14.667
"You realize that 50%
of learning to solo

00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:16.734
"is just not caring
how good you sound

00:16:16.734 --> 00:16:18.067
and just losing the fear."

00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:19.334
It was totally true.

00:16:19.334 --> 00:16:20.734
I was like, "All right,
these are my friends.

00:16:20.734 --> 00:16:22.067
If I sound terrible,
who cares?"

00:16:22.067 --> 00:16:24.234
And sure enough,
I mean, he was absolutely right.

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.234
I just started playing
really bad solos,

00:16:26.234 --> 00:16:28.234
but it got better and better,
and I kept learning,

00:16:28.234 --> 00:16:30.067
and that was a huge step.

00:16:30.067 --> 00:16:32.300
So I mean, if you can just make
that mental shift

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.567
and say, "It's all right.

00:16:33.567 --> 00:16:36.067
I'm gonna fail,
and it's not a big deal."

00:16:36.067 --> 00:16:37.734
No fear.
That's fine.

00:16:37.734 --> 00:16:39.334
You move on.
You learn.

00:16:39.334 --> 00:16:40.901
You've got
a better anecdote, actually.

00:16:40.901 --> 00:16:42.567
Fitzpatrick: Well, this
is a complete anecdote.

00:16:42.567 --> 00:16:44.567
It's a story about the executive

00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:46.067
who makes
a bad business decision,

00:16:46.067 --> 00:16:48.067
and the company loses
$10 million for the company.

00:16:48.067 --> 00:16:50.234
The next morning,
comes into work.

00:16:50.234 --> 00:16:51.901
His secretary says, you know,

00:16:51.901 --> 00:16:53.801
"The CEO wants to see you
in his office."

00:16:53.801 --> 00:16:55.267
And the guy
hangs his head down.

00:16:55.267 --> 00:16:57.400
He's like, "This is it.
I'm gonna get fired," you know?

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.567
Walks into the CEO's office,
and he's like,

00:16:59.567 --> 00:17:01.567
"So I guess you want
my resignation."

00:17:01.567 --> 00:17:03.567
The CEO looks at him and says,
"Resignation?

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:05.567
"I just spent
$10 million training you.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:06.901
Why would I fire you?"

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:08.400
[laughter]

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.234
But again, I mean,

00:17:10.234 --> 00:17:12.734
I bet you that's a mistake
that guy never will make again.

00:17:12.734 --> 00:17:15.400
I lived in Italy
for three years, okay?

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.234
I moved there,
and I had been studying Italian,

00:17:17.234 --> 00:17:18.901
and I was really proud
to use my Italian.

00:17:18.901 --> 00:17:22.467
I went into a cafe,
and I ordered a sandwich,

00:17:22.467 --> 00:17:24.033
and they give me
this massive sandwich,

00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:25.567
and I wanted a knife
to cut it with.

00:17:25.567 --> 00:17:27.567
So I thought I'd be cool
and use my Italian,

00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:30.734
and I promptly asked them for
a toothbrush to cut my sandwich.

00:17:30.734 --> 00:17:32.200
[laughter]
The guy just looked at me.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.467
And I'm like, "Toothbrush."
And he's like, "No."

00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:35.734
Collins-Sussman:
That's true.

00:17:35.734 --> 00:17:37.400
Fitzpatrick: But never made
that mistake again.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.567
Collins-Sussman:
Speaking languages

00:17:38.567 --> 00:17:39.934
in a foreign country
is very intimidating.

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.567
I mean, you're just so scared
of looking like a fool,

00:17:41.567 --> 00:17:43.400
but you don't learn otherwise.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.567
Fitzpatrick: Well, it's the
easiest way to learn, I think.

00:17:45.567 --> 00:17:48.067
That sort of hot-white fear
you get going up your neck

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.901
'cause you asked
for something embarrassing.

00:17:49.901 --> 00:17:51.567
Collins-Sussman:
So failing is--

00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:53.234
It's not just
about embracing failure,

00:17:53.234 --> 00:17:54.734
but it's also
failing fast, right?

00:17:54.734 --> 00:17:57.234
We're talking about iterating
as quickly as we can.

00:17:57.234 --> 00:17:59.067
This is something we actually
talk about a lot at Google,

00:17:59.067 --> 00:18:01.901
was don't just fail,
fail quickly

00:18:01.901 --> 00:18:05.267
and pick up and try something
different as fast as you can.

00:18:05.267 --> 00:18:06.567
And that's why
we've got sort of, like--

00:18:06.567 --> 00:18:08.067
We got this Google Labs
site now, right?

00:18:08.067 --> 00:18:09.567
Where are people
are experimenting

00:18:09.567 --> 00:18:10.734
with different projects.

00:18:10.734 --> 00:18:11.834
And if they fail, that's fine.

00:18:11.834 --> 00:18:13.067
They'll just put something up

00:18:13.067 --> 00:18:15.734
or change it the next day
and try it again, right?

00:18:15.734 --> 00:18:18.734
The faster you can fail
and the faster you can iterate,

00:18:18.734 --> 00:18:20.567
the faster you will learn
and get better.

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:22.400
Fitzpatrick: And you don't have
to hide it if you fail.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.400
It's okay, you know. You don't
have to hide your tracks.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.501
We talk about, you know,
in a Version Control world,

00:18:26.501 --> 00:18:29.234
you know, people use
Subversion versus Mercurial

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:30.734
versus Git, et cetera.

00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:32.067
Git Rebase is something

00:18:32.067 --> 00:18:33.901
that people use often
to sort of hide their tracks.

00:18:33.901 --> 00:18:35.400
There are
some legitimate uses, I think,

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.734
if you want
to clean things up a bit.

00:18:36.734 --> 00:18:38.100
Collins-Sussman:
Or maintain a vendor branch.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.400
Fitzpatrick: Maintain
a vendor branch, et cetera.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.734
But people
are typically looking to say,

00:18:40.734 --> 00:18:42.400
"Oh, you know, I was working
on all this stuff.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.901
"I made all these
sort of false starts

00:18:43.901 --> 00:18:45.133
"I don't want
anybody else to see,

00:18:45.133 --> 00:18:46.667
"you know,
my stupid mistake here,

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:48.000
where I forgot to check
the type of something."

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.567
Collins-Sussman: Rewrite
my history so it's perfect.

00:18:49.567 --> 00:18:51.067
Fitzpatrick: That's right.
Yes, exactly.

00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:53.734
Just like
the history of the world.

00:18:53.734 --> 00:18:55.734
But what it comes down to is--

00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:58.734
One of the ways of making
this problem better

00:18:58.734 --> 00:19:00.901
is to practice, okay?

00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:02.400
If you practice,

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.734
it makes your iteration-failure
cycle faster, okay?

00:19:05.734 --> 00:19:07.567
And it basically--

00:19:07.567 --> 00:19:10.234
it's sort of less scary
to fail,

00:19:10.234 --> 00:19:12.267
because you'll tend to have
smaller failures.

00:19:12.267 --> 00:19:13.567
Collins-Sussman:
This way, the failures

00:19:13.567 --> 00:19:14.901
tend to get smaller over time,

00:19:14.901 --> 00:19:16.400
and the successes
tend to get larger,

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.734
and that's a trend you'll see,

00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:20.067
especially if you're learning
as you fail fast.

00:19:20.067 --> 00:19:21.534
Fitzpatrick:
Right.

00:19:21.534 --> 00:19:24.901
And the next thing is sort of
to be a small fish, all right?

00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:26.901
If you were
the senior developer

00:19:26.901 --> 00:19:29.067
on a team or in a company
or something

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:31.400
and everyone looks to you
and you're sort of the teacher

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.901
or the king/queen bee,
whatever,

00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:36.067
if you're only working
with people junior to you,

00:19:36.067 --> 00:19:37.567
you are gonna learn things
from them,

00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:39.901
but it's gonna be harder
to improve your skills

00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:43.567
than it would be if you
were working with someone else

00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:46.501
who is smarter than you, who is
a better engineer than you.

00:19:46.501 --> 00:19:47.901
Collins-Sussman:
Actually, you know,

00:19:47.901 --> 00:19:50.901
in my experience, when you're
a big fish in a pond,

00:19:50.901 --> 00:19:52.400
it's very comfortable,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.567
but you're not really learning
very much, right?

00:19:54.567 --> 00:19:57.901
You feel safe,
but you don't get much better.

00:19:57.901 --> 00:20:01.067
And when you are a small fish
in a huge pond,

00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:02.734
it's very scary, right?

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:05.067
Fitzpatrick: Sometimes
you get eaten, though.

00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:06.133
Just kidding.

00:20:06.133 --> 00:20:07.334
Collins-Sussman:
That's what it was like

00:20:07.334 --> 00:20:08.567
when we started
at Google, right?

00:20:08.567 --> 00:20:09.734
It was very like, "Aah!"

00:20:09.734 --> 00:20:12.067
You know,
it's just so many people.

00:20:12.067 --> 00:20:13.734
But you get better
really quickly, right?

00:20:13.734 --> 00:20:16.067
Again, it's all about the reward
of facing that fear.

00:20:16.067 --> 00:20:17.567
Fitzpatrick: It's like
the old Emacs joke, you know?

00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:19.067
It's got a really steep
learning curve,

00:20:19.067 --> 00:20:20.467
but that just means
you learn a whole lot

00:20:20.467 --> 00:20:21.901
in a short period
of time, right?

00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:24.734
But beyond being a small fish,
the other thing is to sort of--

00:20:24.734 --> 00:20:28.300
And this has to do
with not only being successful,

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.167
but also being a leader,
which is to be influenced, okay?

00:20:32.167 --> 00:20:34.234
'Cause the more that you're open
to the influence of other people

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.567
who might have
a really good idea

00:20:36.567 --> 00:20:38.067
or a novel way
of looking at something

00:20:38.067 --> 00:20:39.701
or accomplishing something--

00:20:39.701 --> 00:20:42.734
The more actual influence that
you bank and have on others,

00:20:42.734 --> 00:20:45.234
the more likely
they are to listen to you.

00:20:45.234 --> 00:20:47.234
Collins-Sussman: Or it's respect
is a two-way street, right?

00:20:47.234 --> 00:20:50.901
I would say it's not just about
respect being a two-way street.

00:20:50.901 --> 00:20:54.534
It's about vulnerability,

00:20:54.534 --> 00:20:58.234
in that
if you can show yourself

00:20:58.234 --> 00:21:01.901
to be open to change
and willing to admit mistake--

00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:03.067
I guess being vulnerable

00:21:03.067 --> 00:21:04.734
is another form
of being influenced, right?

00:21:04.734 --> 00:21:06.067
It's an extreme case.

00:21:06.067 --> 00:21:08.067
If you can admit your mistakes
in front of your peers

00:21:08.067 --> 00:21:10.234
and say, you know, "I was wrong.
I made the wrong choice.

00:21:10.234 --> 00:21:13.234
I had the wrong opinion."

00:21:13.234 --> 00:21:15.234
A lot of people
are afraid to admit that,

00:21:15.234 --> 00:21:17.067
'cause they're afraid, you know,
in the short term,

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:18.501
it's gonna make them look weak

00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:19.901
or like they don't know
what they're doing.

00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:22.067
But in fact, you know,
if you think about people

00:21:22.067 --> 00:21:23.901
that you really admire,
you may have worked with,

00:21:23.901 --> 00:21:25.601
they make themselves
vulnerable a lot.

00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:27.634
And over the long term,
they get perceived

00:21:27.634 --> 00:21:30.567
as big figures,
big strength figures, right?

00:21:30.567 --> 00:21:33.067
Wow, that person is so strong

00:21:33.067 --> 00:21:36.367
that they're not afraid
to admit mistakes and failures.

00:21:36.367 --> 00:21:37.901
Fitzpatrick: Oh, and it's not
just about their ideas

00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:39.400
or their way of doing things.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.400
It's a way also to sort of
cement people's dedication

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.234
to what your project is
or what you're doing,

00:21:44.234 --> 00:21:47.167
'cause, you know, we like to
talk about buses a lot, I guess,

00:21:47.167 --> 00:21:50.567
but it's the difference between
being the person driving a bus

00:21:50.567 --> 00:21:52.067
and a whole bunch
of people as passengers

00:21:52.067 --> 00:21:53.067
that are following you

00:21:53.067 --> 00:21:55.067
and taking turns
driving the bus, right?

00:21:55.067 --> 00:21:56.901
If you're working on a project,

00:21:56.901 --> 00:21:59.267
whether it's an Open Source
project or within a company

00:21:59.267 --> 00:22:02.567
where different people take
the lead at different times,

00:22:02.567 --> 00:22:05.234
you're gonna attract
a different caliber of person,

00:22:05.234 --> 00:22:06.901
or different type of person,

00:22:06.901 --> 00:22:10.567
who wants to participate
and carve out the path

00:22:10.567 --> 00:22:12.901
as opposed
to somebody following you.

00:22:12.901 --> 00:22:15.234
Collins-Sussman: Absolutely.
So let's talk about--

00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:17.567
A little diversion here
and talk about software tools,

00:22:17.567 --> 00:22:21.067
since that's--our background
is in software tools--

00:22:21.067 --> 00:22:23.234
and talk about, specifically,
how they affect

00:22:23.234 --> 00:22:25.901
your collaboration
and your social habits.

00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:30.234
One of the classic Internet
sayings, right, is,

00:22:30.234 --> 00:22:34.734
"You can't fix social problems
with technical solutions" right?

00:22:34.734 --> 00:22:36.901
And there's all sorts
of classic examples of, like--

00:22:36.901 --> 00:22:40.200
For example, you know,
the whole DRM issue, right?

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.567
Or if we just keep inventing

00:22:41.567 --> 00:22:44.234
more and more complicated
DRM technology restrictions,

00:22:44.234 --> 00:22:46.567
they don't fix the problem,
except most people will say,

00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:48.734
"Well, really, there's some kind
of social issue here."

00:22:48.734 --> 00:22:51.067
What is intellectual property?
What is fair use?

00:22:51.067 --> 00:22:52.901
What is--you know,
what is the nature of--

00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:54.234
Fitzpatrick:
Isn't that problem solved yet?

00:22:54.234 --> 00:22:55.734
Nobody downloads
music anymore, right?

00:22:55.734 --> 00:22:57.901
Collins-Sussman: Clearly, it's a
societal, cultural issue, right?

00:22:57.901 --> 00:23:00.000
Not something
that can just be papered over

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.400
with evermore complex
DRM technologies.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.067
Or another one I've talked about
is, in Version Control,

00:23:06.067 --> 00:23:07.234
I see a lot of people--

00:23:07.234 --> 00:23:09.400
A lot of administrators
will start, you know--

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.901
especially
in Open Source projects,

00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:13.901
they'll start trying to do
path-based access control

00:23:13.901 --> 00:23:15.901
and say, "This person's allowed
to commit to this branch,

00:23:15.901 --> 00:23:17.300
"but not this one.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.234
And this person can only commit
to this file, but not this one."

00:23:20.234 --> 00:23:22.400
They start creating
all these complicated rules,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.067
and I sort of say, "All right,
well, what's going on here?

00:23:25.067 --> 00:23:27.400
Why are you creating all these
technological restrictions?"

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.734
"Oh, we got to make sure people

00:23:28.734 --> 00:23:30.234
don't commit
to the wrong places."

00:23:30.234 --> 00:23:33.067
And they're like, "Well,
if they did, what would happen?"

00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:36.901
You would all notice it.
You'd roll it back, right?

00:23:36.901 --> 00:23:38.334
'Cause it's
a Version Control system.

00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:39.467
You can undo, right?

00:23:39.467 --> 00:23:40.901
You'd ask the person
what happened.

00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:42.567
If it was a mistake,
they apologize.

00:23:42.567 --> 00:23:45.234
If it wasn't a mistake,
they're in trouble, right?

00:23:45.234 --> 00:23:47.400
Or you tell them to leave
the project or something.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.234
So it's sort of, like,
okay, it's a social problem.

00:23:50.234 --> 00:23:52.067
You don't need this
technological restriction

00:23:52.067 --> 00:23:53.400
to solve it.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.234
It's not a good solution.

00:23:55.234 --> 00:23:57.734
Fitzpatrick: Or the endless
spams arm race, right?

00:23:57.734 --> 00:24:01.567
I mean, that's--that's--
it goes back and forth, right?

00:24:01.567 --> 00:24:03.067
Collins-Sussman:
The social problem being

00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:04.567
the world is full of jerks.

00:24:04.567 --> 00:24:06.567
Fitzpatrick: Right, exactly.
Yeah, exactly, that's the thing.

00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:08.501
You know, the Internet--
That's what I was saying.

00:24:08.501 --> 00:24:10.567
The world is full of jerks,
but the Internet makes it seem

00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:12.567
like they all live
right next door to you, right?

00:24:12.567 --> 00:24:14.400
[laughter]

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.734
So you can't use technology

00:24:15.734 --> 00:24:18.067
to solve these
sociological problems, right?

00:24:18.067 --> 00:24:20.567
Well, not always, okay?
Collins-Sussman: Usually.

00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:22.067
This is--this is a--

00:24:22.067 --> 00:24:23.901
It's sort of a--
it's a false truth,

00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:26.734
insofar as there are things
you can do to encourage people

00:24:26.734 --> 00:24:29.400
to "do the right thing," right?

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.901
For example, on Google Code,

00:24:30.901 --> 00:24:33.901
if you want to comment
on an issue on the issue track,

00:24:33.901 --> 00:24:36.234
if you want to create an issue
or something or file a bug,

00:24:36.234 --> 00:24:37.567
you have to sign in, right?

00:24:37.567 --> 00:24:39.234
There's a very simple reason
for that.

00:24:39.234 --> 00:24:42.067
First of all, we want to limit
spam a little bit,

00:24:42.067 --> 00:24:44.400
but more importantly,
if someone reports a bug,

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.767
it's nice to have a way
to get back to them.

00:24:45.767 --> 00:24:47.734
I can't tell you
how many times in the past

00:24:47.734 --> 00:24:49.734
people have reported bugs
out there,

00:24:49.734 --> 00:24:52.234
and they leave
no contact information,

00:24:52.234 --> 00:24:54.901
or they screw up their email
address or something like that.

00:24:54.901 --> 00:24:56.300
Collins-Sussman: Right.
So that's an example

00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.167
of a small technological change
having a big social impact.

00:25:00.167 --> 00:25:01.567
Fitzpatrick:
It doesn't solve the problem.

00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:03.067
Collins-Sussman: But it
definitely changes behavior.

00:25:03.067 --> 00:25:05.901
Another example is
on Google Code project hosting,

00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:08.901
we only allow a small number
of licenses,

00:25:08.901 --> 00:25:10.400
which angers
a lot of people, right?

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.734
They want to come in
and use some Open Source license

00:25:13.734 --> 00:25:15.734
that's fairly obscure,

00:25:15.734 --> 00:25:17.567
and they say,
"Why isn't it on the site?"

00:25:17.567 --> 00:25:20.567
And our answer is,
"Well, because we want to stop

00:25:20.567 --> 00:25:22.400
"proliferation
of Open Source licenses.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.834
We think it's bad
for the Open Source world."

00:25:24.834 --> 00:25:26.234
And that's fine, you know.

00:25:26.234 --> 00:25:28.234
Either they'll choose
one of the standard licenses,

00:25:28.234 --> 00:25:29.901
or they'll go host
their code somewhere else,

00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:32.734
which is okay,
but we've had a definite impact,

00:25:32.734 --> 00:25:36.067
a social impact, through
that small technological choice.

00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:37.400
Fitzpatrick: Right.
Collins-Sussman: So, yeah.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.767
Sometimes you can affect--

00:25:38.767 --> 00:25:41.734
You may not be able to solve
gigantic social problems,

00:25:41.734 --> 00:25:43.567
but you can have--

00:25:43.567 --> 00:25:44.901
Small technological choices

00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:47.901
can have big social,
behavioral changes, right?

00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:49.901
Fitzpatrick:
So defaults are important, okay?

00:25:49.901 --> 00:25:51.400
I mean, you want to examine

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.067
how do tools behave
out of the box, okay?

00:25:54.067 --> 00:25:56.901
This doesn't actually fix
the core social issue at hand,

00:25:56.901 --> 00:25:59.901
but it does influence
people's behavior quite heavily.

00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:01.567
Collins-Sussman:
So let's look at some--

00:26:01.567 --> 00:26:03.567
how some software tools behave.

00:26:03.567 --> 00:26:04.734
What's their default behavior,

00:26:04.734 --> 00:26:07.400
and how does it affect
the way you collaborate?

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.734
One example is--

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:11.567
How about, you know--

00:26:11.567 --> 00:26:14.567
On your software team,
when somebody commits a change,

00:26:14.567 --> 00:26:16.067
maybe you do
code review beforehand,

00:26:16.067 --> 00:26:17.400
but certainly
in the Open Source world,

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.901
it's pretty common
to do code review

00:26:18.901 --> 00:26:21.367
after somebody
submits a change, right?

00:26:21.367 --> 00:26:24.400
In a lot of projects, an email
will go out with the diffs,

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.067
and it'll go
into all the mailboxes

00:26:26.067 --> 00:26:27.400
of all the participants.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.567
And what's cool about that
is that it makes it

00:26:30.567 --> 00:26:32.400
almost effortless
to do code review, right?

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.567
It's like, their changes are
being pushed right to your face,

00:26:35.567 --> 00:26:37.400
and you're reading your email,
and you're like,

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.567
"Oh, looks like
they got a typo here or a bug.

00:26:39.567 --> 00:26:41.567
Let me reply
really quick," right?

00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:43.567
As opposed to projects
that don't do that,

00:26:43.567 --> 00:26:45.901
there's almost
no code review at all, right?

00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:49.067
Big social change
for a small technological trick.

00:26:49.067 --> 00:26:50.400
Fitzpatrick:
Right.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.901
So sort of set
the Wayback Machine

00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:53.701
before the Internet
was really popular

00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:55.801
and Open Source
was really huge.

00:26:55.801 --> 00:26:57.567
How many people here
have heard of CVS?

00:26:57.567 --> 00:26:59.801
The Version Control system,
not the pharmacy.

00:26:59.801 --> 00:27:01.167
Okay, good.

00:27:01.167 --> 00:27:03.067
Collins-Sussman: We actually
asked a bunch of students.

00:27:03.067 --> 00:27:04.734
We gave this talk a few weeks
ago to a bunch of students,

00:27:04.734 --> 00:27:06.234
and we asked, "How many people
have heard of CVS?"

00:27:06.234 --> 00:27:08.234
And they all raised their hands.
Fitzpatrick: I was blown away.

00:27:08.234 --> 00:27:10.534
Collins-Sussman: We were like,
"Well, you're only, like, 19."

00:27:10.534 --> 00:27:11.901
And they're like--

00:27:11.901 --> 00:27:13.901
"How many people have heard
of the Version Control...?

00:27:13.901 --> 00:27:15.400
Nobody raised their...
Fitzpatrick: No one at all.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.567
Which is good, really.

00:27:16.567 --> 00:27:18.400
Collins-Sussman:
Change that slide.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.234
Fitzpatrick:
You know, people talk

00:27:20.234 --> 00:27:21.734
about Open Source getting big.

00:27:21.734 --> 00:27:23.234
They talk
about Richard Stallman.

00:27:23.234 --> 00:27:24.734
They talk
about Linus Torvalds.

00:27:24.734 --> 00:27:27.033
But CVS actually played
a really important role,

00:27:27.033 --> 00:27:28.400
insofar as it cre--

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.400
There was a feature created
in it in the mid '90s

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.601
called Anonymous Pserver.

00:27:32.601 --> 00:27:34.234
It was
anonymous network access,

00:27:34.234 --> 00:27:36.400
where any random one
of these jerks on the Internet

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.734
could download your source code

00:27:39.734 --> 00:27:42.067
into a CVS working copy,

00:27:42.067 --> 00:27:45.234
fiddle with it, and then
send you a nice, small,

00:27:45.234 --> 00:27:48.033
concise patch
that could fix a bug,

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:49.400
add a new feature, et cetera.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.234
Collins-Sussman: That was
a huge social event, right?

00:27:51.234 --> 00:27:52.634
Fitzpatrick:
It had a huge impact,

00:27:52.634 --> 00:27:55.834
insofar as it made it
virtually effortless...

00:28:08.901 --> 00:28:10.400
Collins-Sussman:
...Mercurial?

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.501
A few. Okay.

00:28:11.501 --> 00:28:12.501
Darks.

00:28:12.501 --> 00:28:13.901
Fitzpatrick:
Bizarre, anyone?

00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:16.334
Collins-Sussman: Monotone.
Fitzpatrick: No, just kidding.

00:28:16.334 --> 00:28:18.234
Collins-Sussman:
Okay, so...

00:28:18.234 --> 00:28:20.567
But distributed versions
was kind of interesting.

00:28:20.567 --> 00:28:23.067
What are the default behaviors
of distributed Version Control?

00:28:23.067 --> 00:28:24.734
It's sort of
a double-edged sword, right?

00:28:24.734 --> 00:28:28.234
On the one hand,
it's kind of not so great,

00:28:28.234 --> 00:28:30.734
because the default behavior,
when you start off,

00:28:30.734 --> 00:28:32.400
is to fork, right?

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.234
You start off grabbing
the entire history

00:28:35.234 --> 00:28:37.067
and crawling
into a cave, right?

00:28:37.067 --> 00:28:39.033
And it's actually
a little bit more work

00:28:39.033 --> 00:28:40.567
if you want to contrib--
get your code back.

00:28:40.567 --> 00:28:42.567
You have to find
someone else to talk to,

00:28:42.567 --> 00:28:44.067
find a server,
do a push, right?

00:28:44.067 --> 00:28:45.400
I mean, it's actually--

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.734
You know, there's
a little more effort involved.

00:28:47.734 --> 00:28:50.234
So in one sense,
it discourages collaboration,

00:28:50.234 --> 00:28:52.567
but in another sense, it also
encourages collaboration,

00:28:52.567 --> 00:28:55.400
because--excuse me--

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.234
it lowers the barrier for
everyone to participate, right?

00:28:58.234 --> 00:29:00.834
Instead of just, you know,
"the official committers"

00:29:00.834 --> 00:29:03.567
on a project having access
to the history,

00:29:03.567 --> 00:29:06.234
having the ability to do
checkpoints of their code,

00:29:06.234 --> 00:29:09.234
now everybody in the world
has the exact same tool set,

00:29:09.234 --> 00:29:11.234
and everybody
can checkpoint their code

00:29:11.234 --> 00:29:13.601
and do whatever they want,
and there's no--

00:29:13.601 --> 00:29:17.067
Being a committer really just
becomes a social title, right?

00:29:17.067 --> 00:29:18.901
It becomes
a branding job rather than

00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:21.234
a "I have special tools,
and you don't" kind of thing.

00:29:21.234 --> 00:29:23.067
Fitzpatrick: And I think
this is really great,

00:29:23.067 --> 00:29:25.234
but I think it does concern us
a little bit

00:29:25.234 --> 00:29:26.734
that, you know--

00:29:26.734 --> 00:29:28.567
What are people gonna do
in four or five years?

00:29:28.567 --> 00:29:30.734
Is this gonna
sort of tilt the dial

00:29:30.734 --> 00:29:33.400
back in the other direction
for collaboration?

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.701
Collins-Sussman:
But like you said,

00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:36.901
you know, it lowers the barrier
for people walking by

00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:38.901
to participate, right?

00:29:38.901 --> 00:29:41.567
I mean, in the old days,
you had to check out the code,

00:29:41.567 --> 00:29:43.067
email a patch,

00:29:43.067 --> 00:29:45.400
wait for somebody on the list
to review your patch.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.701
Maybe they liked it,
maybe they didn't.

00:29:46.701 --> 00:29:47.901
And then
you were kind of helpless.

00:29:47.901 --> 00:29:49.734
Now you don't have
to wait for that,

00:29:49.734 --> 00:29:51.400
so it might be
a good thing too.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.400
Fitzpatrick: Right. So there's
a moral to this story, right?

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.067
Which is you need
to pay attention

00:29:55.067 --> 00:29:57.400
to the default behaviors
of the tools that you have.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.901
And you need to ask yourself,

00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:02.567
"What is the social behavior
of this--

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:05.067
this tool is encouraging for--
I mean, to use?"

00:30:05.067 --> 00:30:08.901
And that can vastly affect the
dynamic of your team, basically.

00:30:08.901 --> 00:30:10.734
Collins-Sussman:
So there's one more thing

00:30:10.734 --> 00:30:13.400
we want to talk about,
which is how to--

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.901
Right.
So we're talking about--

00:30:14.901 --> 00:30:16.734
We want to collaborate.
Collaboration's important.

00:30:16.734 --> 00:30:19.267
Don't be afraid. Pay attention
to what your tools are doing.

00:30:19.267 --> 00:30:20.567
But here's the big question--

00:30:20.567 --> 00:30:22.734
When is a good time
to collaborate, right?

00:30:22.734 --> 00:30:25.234
Do you do it early on?
Do you do it late?

00:30:25.234 --> 00:30:29.067
So we have done
some wonderful research...

00:30:29.067 --> 00:30:30.400
Fitzpatrick:
Minutes of research.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.901
Collins-Sussman:
Minutes of research

00:30:31.901 --> 00:30:33.901
about the evolution
of a project, right?

00:30:33.901 --> 00:30:37.067
I mean, it starts out
as an idea in your head, right?

00:30:37.067 --> 00:30:40.067
And then after a little while,
you make a prototype

00:30:40.067 --> 00:30:41.567
just to sort of
show other people

00:30:41.567 --> 00:30:44.901
or maybe just to satisfy
yourself that it's gonna work.

00:30:44.901 --> 00:30:47.734
And then you say,
"Hey, come take a look at this."

00:30:47.734 --> 00:30:49.400
You show one person
or a few friends.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.901
Aah. Ooh, sorry.
Nice.

00:30:50.901 --> 00:30:53.267
And then you write a lot
of code--code, code, code.

00:30:53.267 --> 00:30:57.567
And then you dominate the Earth,
and everything's fine.

00:30:57.567 --> 00:31:02.067
So the real question is,
while you're doing this phase--

00:31:02.067 --> 00:31:04.067
First of all,
you don't have to hide, right?

00:31:04.067 --> 00:31:07.067
I mean, you can do all of these
phases in the public eye.

00:31:07.067 --> 00:31:08.567
It's really a question of,

00:31:08.567 --> 00:31:11.133
at what point do you start
advertising yourself, right?

00:31:11.133 --> 00:31:12.300
Like, even if you've just--

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.901
If you're still working
on a mock-up,

00:31:13.901 --> 00:31:16.567
it's not like you need to be
in a cave to do that, right?

00:31:16.567 --> 00:31:18.734
Chances are, most people
aren't gonna know you're working

00:31:18.734 --> 00:31:20.400
on that mock-up,
even if you're doing it

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.067
on an Open Source repository.

00:31:22.067 --> 00:31:24.000
They're not gonna see you
until you start screaming

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.067
and mailing lists and saying,

00:31:25.067 --> 00:31:26.934
"Hey, come look
at what I'm doing."

00:31:26.934 --> 00:31:28.400
Fitzpatrick:
But the real question here is,

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.901
where does
the third milestone go, right?

00:31:29.901 --> 00:31:31.400
You don't want to start
involving people

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.567
too early or too late.

00:31:33.567 --> 00:31:35.400
For good or for bad,

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.334
people typically
involve people too late.

00:31:37.334 --> 00:31:38.400
It's rarely that someone

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.234
involves people too early,
you know?

00:31:40.234 --> 00:31:42.067
If you're done,
it's too late, okay?

00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:43.567
Collins-Sussman:
[laughs]

00:31:43.567 --> 00:31:45.901
Fitzpatrick: But there's a huge
risk of wasting your own time.

00:31:45.901 --> 00:31:49.234
You know, you might be trying
to come up with a project

00:31:49.234 --> 00:31:50.567
to change the world.

00:31:50.567 --> 00:31:52.234
It might be doing
something Open Source.

00:31:52.234 --> 00:31:53.901
You might be just coming up
with sort of something

00:31:53.901 --> 00:31:55.400
in your spare time you want
to pitch to your team

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.567
that you work with
at the office, right?

00:31:57.567 --> 00:32:00.667
But if you go off and you just
make a whole lot of progress

00:32:00.667 --> 00:32:02.901
without talking to the people,
getting some feedback,

00:32:02.901 --> 00:32:05.567
there's a huge risk of just
wasting your own time, you know?

00:32:05.567 --> 00:32:07.734
You could have
really bad design choices

00:32:07.734 --> 00:32:09.901
that are undoable
without starting over.

00:32:09.901 --> 00:32:12.067
You know, anyone--Those of you
guys who do code reviews,

00:32:12.067 --> 00:32:13.501
if you ever get somebody
that gives you

00:32:13.501 --> 00:32:14.901
a 5,000-line code review,

00:32:14.901 --> 00:32:18.567
what can you really do with that
other than check it for syntax?

00:32:18.567 --> 00:32:20.234
Or check it and say,
"Oh, you forgot.

00:32:20.234 --> 00:32:22.067
This is two spaces here.
It should be one."

00:32:22.067 --> 00:32:24.067
Collins-Sussman: Well, I mean,
it's too late to really go back

00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:25.901
and make significant changes.
Fitzpatrick: Right.

00:32:25.901 --> 00:32:27.667
And you're not gonna want
to digest all that.

00:32:27.667 --> 00:32:30.567
To digest what that amount
of code would do,

00:32:30.567 --> 00:32:31.901
you really want to see
a design doc

00:32:31.901 --> 00:32:33.400
or talk to the person about it.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.067
Collins-Sussman: The other issue
is that a lot of people

00:32:35.067 --> 00:32:36.567
aren't gonna be interested
in your project,

00:32:36.567 --> 00:32:39.901
because there's no opportunity
for them to take a stake, right?

00:32:39.901 --> 00:32:43.234
If your project's 95% finished,

00:32:43.234 --> 00:32:45.734
why would I want to get involved
when it's mostly done, right?

00:32:45.734 --> 00:32:47.400
There's very little opportunity

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.200
for me to come in
and make a mark

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.067
and feel like I'm really
affecting the direction, right?

00:32:52.067 --> 00:32:54.734
So, uh...
[laughs]

00:32:54.734 --> 00:32:56.400
Talk about brain crack.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.667
Fitzpatrick:
Brain crack.

00:32:57.667 --> 00:33:01.167
Yeah, so anybody here ever watch
the Ze Frank on the Web?

00:33:01.167 --> 00:33:03.400
He had this thing called
"The Show" a few years ago.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.567
He had this one episode where
he talked about brain crack.

00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:08.067
It's these ideas people have.
People have ideas all the time.

00:33:08.067 --> 00:33:10.234
You have an idea, and you think,
"This is a brilliant idea."

00:33:10.234 --> 00:33:11.567
You sort of nurture it
in your head,

00:33:11.567 --> 00:33:12.901
and you think
about how wonderful it is,

00:33:12.901 --> 00:33:14.067
and there's angels around,

00:33:14.067 --> 00:33:15.567
and it's
the greatest thing ever.

00:33:15.567 --> 00:33:16.968
You never act on it,

00:33:16.968 --> 00:33:18.734
because as soon as you try
and implement it or act on it,

00:33:18.734 --> 00:33:21.901
you usually find out that most
of them are garbage, okay?

00:33:21.901 --> 00:33:23.901
But, you know, you keep
these ideas to yourself,

00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:25.567
and they're sort of, like--
He calls them brain crack,

00:33:25.567 --> 00:33:27.400
you know,
'cause you just feed on them.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.033
So the point
is to try to get things out

00:33:30.033 --> 00:33:31.567
as quickly as possible.

00:33:31.567 --> 00:33:34.067
Collins-Sussman: Well, let's
look at the opposite scenario.

00:33:34.067 --> 00:33:37.400
What happens if you start
getting collaborators

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.601
working with you too early
in the process?

00:33:39.601 --> 00:33:41.734
And the answer to that--
I think a good example

00:33:41.734 --> 00:33:44.234
is go look
at a huge number of projects

00:33:44.234 --> 00:33:46.067
on SourceForge or Google Code,

00:33:46.067 --> 00:33:49.734
where there's, like, one author,
and there's nothing up there

00:33:49.734 --> 00:33:52.234
but, like,
maybe a Wiki page that says,

00:33:52.234 --> 00:33:54.067
"Dudes, we should write
this cool software

00:33:54.067 --> 00:33:55.400
and take over the world.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.567
Let's talk about it," right?

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:57.734
And, like...

00:33:57.734 --> 00:33:59.400
you know,
one of two things happens.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.400
Either nobody cares, and
nobody comes, nothing happens,

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.067
'cause there's no prototype.

00:34:04.067 --> 00:34:05.400
There's nothing
to look at, right?

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.734
Or, even worse, 50 people come,
or 100 people come,

00:34:09.734 --> 00:34:11.400
and they all want to do
different things,

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.734
and you end up sort of having
this endless discussion

00:34:13.734 --> 00:34:15.567
about what it could be,

00:34:15.567 --> 00:34:17.901
and you get into sort of
this design by committee

00:34:17.901 --> 00:34:19.234
where nothing happens, right?

00:34:19.234 --> 00:34:21.234
And the whole thing
just kind of stalls.

00:34:21.234 --> 00:34:22.567
Fitzpatrick:
Well, you--you're the great--

00:34:22.567 --> 00:34:24.400
You run the risk
of attracting a lot of people

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.567
that don't want to do
what you want to do, okay?

00:34:26.567 --> 00:34:27.901
You want to go there,

00:34:27.901 --> 00:34:29.567
and somebody shows up
and wants to go here.

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:30.901
And you
didn't really communicate

00:34:30.901 --> 00:34:32.567
that you wanted to go there
in the first place.

00:34:32.567 --> 00:34:34.234
So they're not wrong.

00:34:34.234 --> 00:34:36.067
You're just gonna waste
a lot of time and energy.

00:34:36.067 --> 00:34:37.234
Collins-Sussman:
So what you want to do

00:34:37.234 --> 00:34:38.901
is you want to go
for the sweet spot.

00:34:38.901 --> 00:34:42.734
What we call the sweet spot
is you have a coherent design

00:34:42.734 --> 00:34:44.167
and a mission statement, right?

00:34:44.167 --> 00:34:48.067
Clearly written out on your
Website, goals and non-goals.

00:34:48.067 --> 00:34:50.067
What the purpose is--
exactly what you're gonna do.

00:34:50.067 --> 00:34:52.734
So people can't show up
and completely derail

00:34:52.734 --> 00:34:54.734
the direction
that you've chosen, right?

00:34:54.734 --> 00:34:57.734
And you got to have
some amount of running code.

00:34:57.734 --> 00:34:59.133
It doesn't have to be a lot,

00:34:59.133 --> 00:35:01.267
just enough
to say that you're serious

00:35:01.267 --> 00:35:03.400
and to get the idea going
in other people's heads--

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.734
Just a proof of concept, right?

00:35:04.734 --> 00:35:06.567
Or just a mock-up or something

00:35:06.567 --> 00:35:08.400
so that it's far enough along

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.234
that it feels like
there's some inertia, right?

00:35:11.234 --> 00:35:13.901
But not so far enough along
that people feel like,

00:35:13.901 --> 00:35:16.400
"Oh, I can still get in
and get involved

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.567
and really influence
this project," right?

00:35:18.567 --> 00:35:20.901
"Make a mark. There's a lot
of work to do still."

00:35:20.901 --> 00:35:22.734
Fitzpatrick: Right, but you have
to be ready to make revisions.

00:35:22.734 --> 00:35:25.234
You have to be ready for that,
for the criticism

00:35:25.234 --> 00:35:27.067
and, you know, it might be
to make some changes

00:35:27.067 --> 00:35:29.067
and discuss and backtrack...

00:35:29.067 --> 00:35:31.067
Collins-Sussman:
And document your failures.

00:35:31.067 --> 00:35:32.734
Fitzpatrick:
Don't hide the history.

00:35:32.734 --> 00:35:36.067
I mean, that's really--
It's a really important thing.

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:39.801
One thing that we've noticed
a lot in Open Source projects

00:35:39.801 --> 00:35:41.400
is that there's
a lot of documentation

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.734
about what they're gonna do
and what they'd like to do

00:35:44.734 --> 00:35:47.567
and sort of what they've done
that's worked for them.

00:35:47.567 --> 00:35:49.567
But rarely do you find
any documentation

00:35:49.567 --> 00:35:51.734
of stuff that they've tried
that they failed at, you know?

00:35:51.734 --> 00:35:53.033
People have a design doc
that didn't work.

00:35:53.033 --> 00:35:54.234
They just delete it.

00:35:54.234 --> 00:35:55.567
They're like,
"Oh, I'm gonna pretend

00:35:55.567 --> 00:35:56.901
like that
never happened," right?

00:35:56.901 --> 00:35:58.901
Collins-Sussman: That whole
branch never happened.

00:35:58.901 --> 00:36:00.234
Fitzpatrick:
Right, exactly.

00:36:00.234 --> 00:36:02.234
But in a lot of cases,
this can be a huge time-saver,

00:36:02.234 --> 00:36:05.234
because let's say that
you're having a huge discussion

00:36:05.234 --> 00:36:07.067
about something,
and you go off and you try it,

00:36:07.067 --> 00:36:09.234
and it doesn't work, so you
delete the code and whatnot.

00:36:09.234 --> 00:36:11.501
A year later, someone comes up
and has this huge discussion.

00:36:11.501 --> 00:36:12.734
They want to try
this great idea

00:36:12.734 --> 00:36:14.567
that you did last year
and failed, okay?

00:36:14.567 --> 00:36:16.234
Now, it's easy enough
if you can point them

00:36:16.234 --> 00:36:17.901
to the change list
where it happened.

00:36:17.901 --> 00:36:19.901
Collins-Sussman: What if
you've left the project, right?

00:36:19.901 --> 00:36:21.400
What if you've left
the project,

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.234
or the person who tried
the experiment is gone?

00:36:23.234 --> 00:36:24.501
They're not there to remember

00:36:24.501 --> 00:36:27.400
or even point you to the deleted
branch to read the docs.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.234
Fitzpatrick: It's good to have
that mailing list

00:36:29.234 --> 00:36:30.901
that's read there
that that happened.

00:36:30.901 --> 00:36:33.067
It's not bad.
It's okay.

00:36:33.067 --> 00:36:35.067
The world is full
of false starts

00:36:35.067 --> 00:36:37.400
that eventually rot away.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.234
But we have a couple case
studies here to talk about.

00:36:40.234 --> 00:36:42.067
First of all is Subversion,

00:36:42.067 --> 00:36:44.901
which is--you know,
was our project many years ago.

00:36:44.901 --> 00:36:46.901
And, uh--Well, you go ahead
and tell it.

00:36:46.901 --> 00:36:48.133
Collins-Sussman:
Well, I mean,

00:36:48.133 --> 00:36:49.400
I don't know if this
is the model,

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.901
but we think
we did a pretty good job

00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:53.234
with starting this project.

00:36:53.234 --> 00:36:56.400
I mean, it started out
with three guys in an office

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.734
writing a design doc together,
just the three of them.

00:36:59.734 --> 00:37:01.834
Took us maybe two weeks,

00:37:01.834 --> 00:37:04.067
three weeks
to actually get it right.

00:37:04.067 --> 00:37:05.734
And I think three's
kind of the sweet number.

00:37:05.734 --> 00:37:07.534
Like, one person
writing a design doc

00:37:07.534 --> 00:37:09.234
is gonna make
a lot of wrong choices.

00:37:09.234 --> 00:37:10.567
Two or three people is great,

00:37:10.567 --> 00:37:12.567
because they can call
each other.

00:37:12.567 --> 00:37:14.400
They can say,
"That's a bad idea. Here's why."

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.901
And there's enough perspective.

00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:18.067
If you get
more than three people,

00:37:18.067 --> 00:37:19.901
then it starts to become
a circus, right?

00:37:19.901 --> 00:37:21.234
It's the same reason,
like, why meetings

00:37:21.234 --> 00:37:23.968
with more than five people
never accomplish anything.

00:37:23.968 --> 00:37:25.400
Yeah, never converge.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.567
Fitzpatrick: Everybody ever
travel with a group of people,

00:37:27.567 --> 00:37:29.400
like travel around Europe
or backpack or something?

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.667
You get more than six people,
you can't go anywhere.

00:37:31.667 --> 00:37:33.133
[laughter]

00:37:33.133 --> 00:37:34.901
You go to the next corner,
and it's a big discussion.

00:37:34.901 --> 00:37:36.400
Collins-Sussman: That's true
of a business meeting too.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.234
Fitzpatrick: Exactly.
It's also true about meetings.

00:37:38.234 --> 00:37:39.634
Collins-Sussman:
So with design docs,

00:37:39.634 --> 00:37:41.567
I think two or three people
is sort of that perfect number.

00:37:41.567 --> 00:37:43.400
And then
after we got the design doc,

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.400
we went, and we brought it
to a larger forum.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.734
We gave a presentation
about it.

00:37:47.734 --> 00:37:50.067
We invited comments,
and we put it up on a web site,

00:37:50.067 --> 00:37:51.400
and we started
getting feedback.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.067
And then
we just started coding,

00:37:53.067 --> 00:37:55.400
and, amazingly,
about a month or two later,

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.567
we had some working--
very basic working code.

00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:01.567
And suddenly,
as soon as we had working code,

00:38:01.567 --> 00:38:03.567
suddenly all these people
started showing up.

00:38:03.567 --> 00:38:05.567
We didn't even advertise,
but somehow,

00:38:05.567 --> 00:38:07.901
it was like we crossed
this magic threshold,

00:38:07.901 --> 00:38:09.567
and we said, "It's okay now.
Come on, come on, come on."

00:38:09.567 --> 00:38:11.067
Fitzpatrick: We have to remember
nine years ago,

00:38:11.067 --> 00:38:13.067
it was CVS
in the Open Source world.

00:38:13.067 --> 00:38:14.434
Collins-Sussman:
It was only CVS.

00:38:14.434 --> 00:38:16.234
Fitzpatrick: It was only CVS
in the Open Source world.

00:38:16.234 --> 00:38:17.601
That was it.

00:38:17.601 --> 00:38:20.067
But the other thing--
You're erasing history here.

00:38:20.067 --> 00:38:22.234
You forgot to tell them
about us going into a cave.

00:38:22.234 --> 00:38:23.567
Collins-Sussman:
It never happened.

00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:25.067
Fitzpatrick:
There was a lot of people

00:38:25.067 --> 00:38:26.567
that showed up
a little bit early almost,

00:38:26.567 --> 00:38:28.167
and we said,
"All right, we're gonna create

00:38:28.167 --> 00:38:29.300
"this private mailing list

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.901
"and have
our design discussions there,

00:38:30.901 --> 00:38:32.901
because these people
are distracting us."

00:38:32.901 --> 00:38:34.400
Collins-Sussman:
Well, we were embarrassed.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.400
Fitzpatrick:
Yeah, but Brian Behlendorf

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.267
was outraged.

00:38:39.267 --> 00:38:41.067
Anybody who knows
Brian Behlendorf,

00:38:41.067 --> 00:38:42.734
the guy is never outraged.

00:38:42.734 --> 00:38:45.234
But he was very angry,

00:38:45.234 --> 00:38:47.734
and he told us
to cut it out, basically,

00:38:47.734 --> 00:38:49.400
and get our butts
back out there.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.734
Collins-Sussman:
Stop talking in private, right?

00:38:51.734 --> 00:38:53.734
If they're bored by what
we're saying, they can leave.

00:38:53.734 --> 00:38:55.400
Fitzpatrick: Right. And we were
pretty indignantly angry

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.567
about it at the time.

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:57.734
But, you know,
four years later,

00:38:57.734 --> 00:38:59.234
you know,
we're laughing about it.

00:38:59.234 --> 00:39:00.667
He was totally right.

00:39:00.667 --> 00:39:02.567
Collins-Sussman:
So what's our other...?

00:39:02.567 --> 00:39:03.901
Fitzpatrick:
Our next case study--

00:39:03.901 --> 00:39:05.300
Collins-Sussman:
Well, you talk.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.734
Fitzpatrick: All right, next
case study is the two of us.

00:39:07.734 --> 00:39:09.901
So we've given dozens
of talks together

00:39:09.901 --> 00:39:12.901
over the past, I don't know,
four years, five years,

00:39:12.901 --> 00:39:14.567
and we've known each other
for about 10 or 11,

00:39:14.567 --> 00:39:17.567
but sort of the case study
is how we write our talks.

00:39:17.567 --> 00:39:21.567
I mean, what we've done over
the past five years is we take--

00:39:21.567 --> 00:39:24.234
we put the phones away,
leave the laptops at the office,

00:39:24.234 --> 00:39:26.734
take a couple notebooks,
and go to a cafe.

00:39:26.734 --> 00:39:27.901
And then they close the cafe.

00:39:27.901 --> 00:39:29.400
Collins-Sussman:
Paper notebooks, made of tree.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.067
Fitzpatrick: Then they close the
cafe, and we find another cafe,

00:39:31.067 --> 00:39:32.567
and they close that cafe.

00:39:32.567 --> 00:39:34.901
So if we show up in your cafe,
you might want to throw us out.

00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:37.734
But we sit down there and--

00:39:37.734 --> 00:39:40.067
Oh, I forgot
to plug in the laptop.

00:39:40.067 --> 00:39:41.567
Collins-Sussman:
Good thing we're almost done.

00:39:41.567 --> 00:39:43.067
Fitzpatrick: Yeah, good thing
we're almost done.

00:39:43.067 --> 00:39:45.234
Collins-Sussman:
Except we lost our...

00:39:45.234 --> 00:39:47.400
Fitzpatrick:
Lost our...

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.734
Is there power?
Collins-Sussman: There it is.

00:39:50.734 --> 00:39:52.734
Fitzpatrick:
Oh, uh, grab it.

00:39:52.734 --> 00:39:54.067
It's over here, sorry.

00:39:54.067 --> 00:39:56.234
Collins-Sussman:
That's it.

00:39:56.234 --> 00:39:57.901
Fitzpatrick: So this
is a great example of failure.

00:39:57.901 --> 00:39:59.067
This is why we did this.

00:39:59.067 --> 00:40:02.734
[laughter]
This is completely intentional.

00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:05.067
You got the plug over there?
Thank you.

00:40:05.067 --> 00:40:06.300
Collins-Sussman:
There we go.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.567
Fitzpatrick:
All right, that's much better.

00:40:08.567 --> 00:40:09.567
Collins-Sussman:
Awesome.

00:40:09.567 --> 00:40:11.734
Fitzpatrick:
Gosh, I feel stupid.

00:40:11.734 --> 00:40:14.567
So case study is forgetting
to plug your laptop in.

00:40:14.567 --> 00:40:17.901
But so we sit down with--
on paper and we just brainstorm.

00:40:17.901 --> 00:40:20.601
One of us usually has an idea
for what we want to talk about.

00:40:20.601 --> 00:40:23.067
And we'll brainstorm
or sort of riff on that idea.

00:40:23.067 --> 00:40:24.901
And we act as filters
for each other.

00:40:24.901 --> 00:40:26.901
"Oh, we think
that's a good idea.

00:40:26.901 --> 00:40:29.000
Let's go in that direction.
Let's not."

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.234
What we wind up with at the end
is a whole bunch of ideas,

00:40:31.234 --> 00:40:33.567
and then once we get
the ideas together,

00:40:33.567 --> 00:40:35.234
we put it together
in an outline

00:40:35.234 --> 00:40:36.734
and try and make it
a little bit more coherent

00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:38.167
and group like things together.

00:40:38.167 --> 00:40:39.634
Collins-Sussman:
And then someone else goes

00:40:39.634 --> 00:40:41.567
and puts it into slides and then
gives it to the other person.

00:40:41.567 --> 00:40:43.501
Then they change the slides.

00:40:43.501 --> 00:40:45.567
It sort of bounces
back and forth, right?

00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:47.901
But it's
a nice gradual evolution.

00:40:47.901 --> 00:40:50.400
At no point are we hiding
from each other or--

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.234
Fitzpatrick:
But another thing we learned

00:40:52.234 --> 00:40:54.734
is that if you're gonna give
a talk at an event like this,

00:40:54.734 --> 00:40:57.767
you want to actually not walk
in here completely fresh

00:40:57.767 --> 00:40:59.167
and never
having spoken this before.

00:40:59.167 --> 00:41:01.734
So we can stand at home

00:41:01.734 --> 00:41:03.734
or in the office
and do it in a conference room,

00:41:03.734 --> 00:41:05.567
but we decided to give
a presentation

00:41:05.567 --> 00:41:07.734
at the local user group
in Chicago,

00:41:07.734 --> 00:41:09.734
and we learned some things about
what did and what didn't work.

00:41:09.734 --> 00:41:11.234
For example,
when you're speaking

00:41:11.234 --> 00:41:14.067
to a room full of 19-year-olds,
they don't know what CVS is.

00:41:14.067 --> 00:41:16.400
Then we also gave it
to the engineers

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.067
in our office in Chicago,

00:41:18.067 --> 00:41:20.067
and we got
some great feedback from them.

00:41:20.067 --> 00:41:22.067
And then we gave it here, and we
learned to plug in the laptop.

00:41:22.067 --> 00:41:23.234
Collins-Sussman:
Which you're reading quickly.

00:41:23.234 --> 00:41:24.567
Fitzpatrick:
Yes, exactly.

00:41:24.567 --> 00:41:25.968
That's the first time
I've made that mistake,

00:41:25.968 --> 00:41:28.067
and hopefully I won't fail
that way again, at least.

00:41:28.067 --> 00:41:29.734
Collins-Sussman: All right, so
let's just back up really quick.

00:41:29.734 --> 00:41:31.234
We have our obligatory summary,

00:41:31.234 --> 00:41:33.734
just in case you forgot
what we were saying.

00:41:33.734 --> 00:41:36.234
So there are no geniuses.

00:41:36.234 --> 00:41:38.400
Fitzpatrick:
There are very few geniuses.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.901
Is Jeff Dean here?
Collins-Sussman: Okay.

00:41:39.901 --> 00:41:41.234
[laughter]
Fitzpatrick: Okay.

00:41:41.234 --> 00:41:42.534
I was told by another Googler

00:41:42.534 --> 00:41:44.067
if Jeff was here,
we're gonna be in deep trouble.

00:41:44.067 --> 00:41:45.901
Collins-Sussman: So right.
So there's no geniuses.

00:41:45.901 --> 00:41:48.501
It's our natural instinct to try
and want to be a genius,

00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:49.901
but we should fight that

00:41:49.901 --> 00:41:53.234
and actually try to collaborate
as much as we can, early, often.

00:41:53.234 --> 00:41:55.067
Don't be afraid
of collaboration.

00:41:55.067 --> 00:41:57.767
And pay attention to what
your tools are doing to you

00:41:57.767 --> 00:41:59.133
and the people you work with,

00:41:59.133 --> 00:42:01.567
'cause they do affect
your collaborative behavior.

00:42:01.567 --> 00:42:03.067
And finally, make sure
you're paying attention

00:42:03.067 --> 00:42:04.567
to when
you collaborate, right?

00:42:04.567 --> 00:42:06.567
Not too early, not too late.

00:42:06.567 --> 00:42:08.100
It all is sort of--

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.567
There's a critical sweet spot
for success in collaboration.

00:42:10.567 --> 00:42:11.901
Fitzpatrick:
Right.

00:42:11.901 --> 00:42:15.100
And of course, there's actually
a secret to all this

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.234
that you probably shouldn't
share outside of this room,

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:19.901
but believe it or not, if you
actually do all these things,

00:42:19.901 --> 00:42:22.267
people will think
you're a genius.

00:42:22.267 --> 00:42:26.067
So--'Cause it's not the typical
thing that people do.

00:42:26.067 --> 00:42:27.901
People don't make
themselves vulnerable.

00:42:27.901 --> 00:42:31.000
They don't sort of--
They're not open to influence.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
And, uh...

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.100
Collins-Sussman:
That's it.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.567
Fitzpatrick: But that's it.
Thanks.

00:42:34.567 --> 00:42:37.501
[applause]

00:42:38.901 --> 00:42:42.067
Collins-Sussman:
We got 15 minutes.

00:42:42.067 --> 00:42:44.234
Fitzpatrick: Yeah, we have some
time for questions and answers.

00:42:44.234 --> 00:42:47.400
So if anyone has any questions
or preferably answers,

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.167
there are some mics
in the center of the room.

00:42:49.167 --> 00:42:51.667
If you could get
up there and...

00:42:54.734 --> 00:42:57.567
Collins-Sussman:
Uh-oh, two at once.

00:42:57.567 --> 00:42:58.901
Fitzpatrick:
Protocol. Okay.

00:42:58.901 --> 00:43:01.000
man: Two questions--
one for the audience, actually.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.834
Who would consider themselves
a pair programmer?

00:43:06.767 --> 00:43:08.567
Fitzpatrick: See, they can't get
their hands all the way up.

00:43:08.567 --> 00:43:10.567
[laughter]

00:43:10.567 --> 00:43:13.400
man: And the same question
to you guys, really.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.901
What do you think
about pair programming,

00:43:14.901 --> 00:43:16.400
kind of formally?

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.067
Fitzpatrick:
I personally think it's ideal

00:43:19.067 --> 00:43:20.901
if you're working
on something really difficult.

00:43:20.901 --> 00:43:22.901
When I wrote CVS to SVN,

00:43:22.901 --> 00:43:24.567
which is probably
one of the hardest things

00:43:24.567 --> 00:43:26.067
I've ever worked on
in my life--

00:43:26.067 --> 00:43:30.734
I learned more about CVS and RCS
than I wanted to learn ever.

00:43:30.734 --> 00:43:32.400
Karl Fogel and I did a lot
of pair programming.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.767
It was really good,

00:43:33.767 --> 00:43:35.734
because it was really grungy,
difficult problems.

00:43:35.734 --> 00:43:37.067
But for sort of day to day,

00:43:37.067 --> 00:43:40.434
I prefer more of
the write-code-review process.

00:43:40.434 --> 00:43:42.834
Collins-Sussman: It creates
social stress, right?

00:43:42.834 --> 00:43:44.334
If you're pair-programming
with somebody,

00:43:44.334 --> 00:43:46.901
you better be really--
know each other really well

00:43:46.901 --> 00:43:49.567
and be very tolerant
of each other's quirks, right?

00:43:49.567 --> 00:43:52.234
Otherwise, it can actually--
you can start arguing

00:43:52.234 --> 00:43:54.734
about whoever's driving, right?

00:43:54.734 --> 00:43:56.234
"Don't format
the code that way."

00:43:56.234 --> 00:43:57.901
Or, "Don't you know
that shortcut?"

00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.734
Or, you know, it can get
a little maddening.

00:43:59.734 --> 00:44:01.734
Fitzpatrick: There's a number of
really good engineers at Google

00:44:01.734 --> 00:44:04.234
who pair-program all the time,
and they do a great job of it,

00:44:04.234 --> 00:44:06.567
and they're
amazingly productive.

00:44:06.567 --> 00:44:08.400
man: Thanks.
Fitzpatrick: Yeah.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.667
man: So advice on dealing
with egos,

00:44:10.667 --> 00:44:12.133
'cause I agree with you guys,

00:44:12.133 --> 00:44:13.934
but there's definitely people
on the team

00:44:13.934 --> 00:44:16.234
that, you know, their ego
is always in the way.

00:44:16.234 --> 00:44:17.734
Fitzpatrick:
Advice on dealing with egos.

00:44:17.734 --> 00:44:19.234
Collins-Sussman:
What is the advice?

00:44:19.234 --> 00:44:21.534
Fitzpatrick: How do you deal
with people that have a big ego?

00:44:21.534 --> 00:44:23.734
Is that the question?
Wow.

00:44:23.734 --> 00:44:25.234
Um...pass.

00:44:25.234 --> 00:44:26.901
No, I'm kidding.
[laughter]

00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:29.901
That's a hard question,
because...

00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:32.901
typically if they're running
the project, they'll--

00:44:32.901 --> 00:44:34.901
Again,
like attracts like, okay?

00:44:34.901 --> 00:44:38.400
People who are sort of
the friendlier, nicer,

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.667
consensus-building people

00:44:39.667 --> 00:44:41.734
are gonna attract people
that like to work with that.

00:44:41.734 --> 00:44:43.400
People who are the big,
you know, ego--

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.234
"It's about me.
Let's be aggressive here.

00:44:46.234 --> 00:44:48.400
I'm the alpha male.
Let's fight about things."

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.868
Collins-Sussman:
They attract other alphas.

00:44:49.868 --> 00:44:51.133
Fitzpatrick: Exactly. They're
gonna attract other people

00:44:51.133 --> 00:44:52.400
that either want to follow them
and be like,

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.734
"Oh, yes, you're right.
Wonderful."

00:44:53.734 --> 00:44:54.901
Or they're people
that just want to fight them,

00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:56.267
because that's
what they want to do.

00:44:56.267 --> 00:44:58.234
So I don't know
I'd have a particular recipe--

00:44:58.234 --> 00:45:00.000
We have another talk
that you can find on YouTube,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.067
if you look
for "poisonous people,"

00:45:02.067 --> 00:45:03.834
that talks all about
how to protect your project

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:04.901
from poisonous people.

00:45:04.901 --> 00:45:06.901
So there's a little plug
for that.

00:45:06.901 --> 00:45:08.400
We gave it here
last year, actually.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.234
Collins-Sussman: That's actually
probably the best prescription

00:45:10.234 --> 00:45:11.601
we have is that talk.

00:45:11.601 --> 00:45:13.400
It's just how to deal
with difficult people in general

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.400
on your project.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.567
Fitzpatrick:
Yeah.

00:45:15.567 --> 00:45:16.734
Next question.
man: Hello.

00:45:16.734 --> 00:45:18.234
Fitzpatrick:
Hello.

00:45:18.234 --> 00:45:19.734
man:
Let's see if we can deal

00:45:19.734 --> 00:45:22.567
with some constructive criticism
here, if it's okay with you.

00:45:22.567 --> 00:45:24.400
Fitzpatrick:
Yeah.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.901
man: It sounds to me
like what you're saying

00:45:25.901 --> 00:45:29.734
is almost like
humanistically programming,

00:45:29.734 --> 00:45:31.400
which is fine,

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:36.033
except what it relates--

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:38.400
you have to be in a certain kind
of environment.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.234
And maybe your company has set
up a certain kind of environment

00:45:42.234 --> 00:45:43.901
at a certain stage in time

00:45:43.901 --> 00:45:47.734
that this kind of way of dealing
with things works.

00:45:47.734 --> 00:45:50.067
But in a different
kind of environment--

00:45:50.067 --> 00:45:51.567
that is,
the majority of the world--

00:45:51.567 --> 00:45:54.734
I feel that a lot of the things
you're talking about,

00:45:54.734 --> 00:45:57.734
people are gonna get crucified.

00:45:57.734 --> 00:45:59.567
And I'm not saying
that's bad or good.

00:45:59.567 --> 00:46:01.400
I'm just saying
that's the reality of things.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.234
It's like when I talked
to Kent Beck,

00:46:03.234 --> 00:46:05.234
what, eight years ago
about extreme programming,

00:46:05.234 --> 00:46:07.467
the problem with all the guys
in the class was,

00:46:07.467 --> 00:46:09.901
"Nobody's gonna--I'm gonna take
this back to my company,

00:46:09.901 --> 00:46:11.400
and nobody's
gonna want to do this."

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.734
So my first thing is
that you have to be very careful

00:46:14.734 --> 00:46:17.567
about applying these things,

00:46:17.567 --> 00:46:20.067
because you go back
and do these things,

00:46:20.067 --> 00:46:21.901
and you're gonna get
in a lot of trouble

00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:23.067
in a certain environment.

00:46:23.067 --> 00:46:26.067
Secondly,
the no-ego thing is great.

00:46:26.067 --> 00:46:29.067
We'll just send everyone off
to a Zen center for a year.

00:46:29.067 --> 00:46:31.067
[laughter]
You know?

00:46:31.067 --> 00:46:33.901
People have egos.
I'm a psychologist for 30 years.

00:46:33.901 --> 00:46:35.734
I deal with people,
and that's real.

00:46:35.734 --> 00:46:37.734
That's an ego thing.

00:46:37.734 --> 00:46:40.901
Thirdly, there's plenty of
evidence that there are geniuses

00:46:40.901 --> 00:46:42.901
in the world.

00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:45.400
I think that's obvious.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.067
And there's plenty of evidence
that there's a whole range

00:46:48.067 --> 00:46:50.567
of people that are good
at programming.

00:46:50.567 --> 00:46:52.901
Some people are good. There's
a fair amount of research

00:46:52.901 --> 00:46:54.567
that talks
about the great programmers

00:46:54.567 --> 00:46:57.400
can write 100 times better--

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.901
Fitzpatrick:
I'm gonna stop you there.

00:46:58.901 --> 00:47:01.067
I don't disagree with you on
that--Can you hold on a second?

00:47:01.067 --> 00:47:02.400
I don't disagree with you.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.400
I'd be glad to talk to you
a little more offline.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.734
"The genius is a myth" thing

00:47:05.734 --> 00:47:07.400
is definitely a straw man
that we're setting up.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.701
There are geniuses,

00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:10.167
but the point we're trying
to make precisely

00:47:10.167 --> 00:47:11.501
is that there
are remarkably few.

00:47:11.501 --> 00:47:13.901
There are far fewer
than most people realize.

00:47:13.901 --> 00:47:17.300
And I think our talk
is much more aimed

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.400
at people who are able
to control their project

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.567
or their environment.

00:47:20.567 --> 00:47:22.234
If you're
in a corporate environment

00:47:22.234 --> 00:47:25.234
or something
where you have no control

00:47:25.234 --> 00:47:27.234
over the actual way
the software is developed,

00:47:27.234 --> 00:47:28.901
you're gonna have
a very hard time doing that.

00:47:28.901 --> 00:47:30.734
And you're right.
You might get crucified.

00:47:30.734 --> 00:47:32.567
And our legal staff
has asked me to say

00:47:32.567 --> 00:47:34.734
this is not medical advice.

00:47:34.734 --> 00:47:36.567
[laughter]
And please be careful.

00:47:36.567 --> 00:47:37.901
But please,
we'd love to talk to you more

00:47:37.901 --> 00:47:39.567
about it afterwards in person.
Thanks.

00:47:39.567 --> 00:47:41.234
Collins-Sussman:
We're describing the ideal here,

00:47:41.234 --> 00:47:42.501
right?

00:47:42.501 --> 00:47:44.734
Getting from the ideal,
actually implementing that,

00:47:44.734 --> 00:47:46.901
making it happen,
is a whole separate problem.

00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:50.067
Fitzpatrick: Right. I mean, we
deal with the Open Source world,

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:51.234
for starters.

00:47:51.234 --> 00:47:52.901
And then coming to Google,

00:47:52.901 --> 00:47:55.067
it's run inside like a whole
bunch of Open Source projects,

00:47:55.067 --> 00:47:56.100
to some great extent.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.400
So it's a similar
sort of gestalt.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.567
Collins-Sussman: Right.
Fitzpatrick: Next question.

00:48:01.567 --> 00:48:06.734
man: Hi. I hope this will be
interesting to many people.

00:48:06.734 --> 00:48:09.734
So you mentioned
being a small fish.

00:48:09.734 --> 00:48:12.234
Do you have any advice of--

00:48:12.234 --> 00:48:16.734
So if you're in an environment
where you're not a small fish,

00:48:16.734 --> 00:48:18.567
so how to change that,

00:48:18.567 --> 00:48:21.400
without leaving the environment,
of course.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.734
Or how to find other ways

00:48:25.734 --> 00:48:28.067
to improve your skills.

00:48:28.067 --> 00:48:30.234
Collins-Sussman: So the question
is, "If you're a small fish,

00:48:30.234 --> 00:48:33.067
how do you deal with--
how do you become a big fish?"

00:48:33.067 --> 00:48:35.734
Sorry, if you're a big fish,
how do you become a small fish?

00:48:35.734 --> 00:48:37.067
Fitzpatrick:
You hire bigger fish.

00:48:37.067 --> 00:48:38.734
Collins-Sussman:
That's it.

00:48:38.734 --> 00:48:40.901
If you're talking about
in a corporate environment,

00:48:40.901 --> 00:48:42.234
if I were in that situation,

00:48:42.234 --> 00:48:44.734
I would start looking around
for bigger fish, right?

00:48:44.734 --> 00:48:46.901
"Where are
the really hard projects?

00:48:46.901 --> 00:48:49.567
"Where are the people who are
much more knowledgeable than me?

00:48:49.567 --> 00:48:52.567
How can I somehow get involved
with what they're doing," right?

00:48:52.567 --> 00:48:55.067
And maybe it's just
slow involvement at first,

00:48:55.067 --> 00:48:58.567
but try to sort of creep
your career in that direction,

00:48:58.567 --> 00:49:00.667
because if you're not
being challenged,

00:49:00.667 --> 00:49:02.734
if you're not a little bit
scared all the time,

00:49:02.734 --> 00:49:04.901
just a little bit,
then you're not gonna improve.

00:49:04.901 --> 00:49:07.067
Now, I mean, I--

00:49:07.067 --> 00:49:09.234
That's not
a guaranteed solution.

00:49:09.234 --> 00:49:11.067
Sometimes you may be trapped,

00:49:11.067 --> 00:49:13.767
in which case, I guess I might
just go look for another job.

00:49:13.767 --> 00:49:16.067
If I were truly bored
at my job, right?

00:49:16.067 --> 00:49:18.067
Fitzpatrick: Right.
In the Open Source world,

00:49:18.067 --> 00:49:19.901
you know,
you typically want to attract

00:49:19.901 --> 00:49:21.400
these kind of people
and projects.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.234
So if you're--
If it's built on consensus

00:49:24.234 --> 00:49:27.234
and other people can still
come in and have an influence,

00:49:27.234 --> 00:49:30.567
that's typically what
will attract the bigger fish.

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:32.901
man: So you're saying
if you can change

00:49:32.901 --> 00:49:34.834
your corporate environment,

00:49:34.834 --> 00:49:37.234
start an Open Source project,
basically.

00:49:37.234 --> 00:49:40.234
Fitzpatrick:
Again, corporate environments--

00:49:40.234 --> 00:49:41.567
it's really risky.

00:49:41.567 --> 00:49:43.067
If you are one
of the small fish

00:49:43.067 --> 00:49:45.901
or, like, you're just
an engineer on a large project,

00:49:45.901 --> 00:49:48.400
you know, you have no power
to change that necessarily.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.701
You can do what you do,

00:49:49.701 --> 00:49:51.734
but you're not gonna be able
to guide a project

00:49:51.734 --> 00:49:53.234
from that seat that you're in.

00:49:53.234 --> 00:49:55.234
Collins-Sussman: If you're
a big fish in a corporation,

00:49:55.234 --> 00:49:56.567
you probably do have
a lot of power

00:49:56.567 --> 00:49:59.067
to start migrating your career

00:49:59.067 --> 00:50:01.567
towards other
bigger fish, right?

00:50:01.567 --> 00:50:03.234
Fitzpatrick: Right.
Collins-Sussman: It's possible.

00:50:03.234 --> 00:50:06.400
Fitzpatrick:
Next question, please.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:10.234
man: Hi. You talked
about avoiding a low bus factor

00:50:10.234 --> 00:50:11.901
and having as many people look

00:50:11.901 --> 00:50:13.734
at as many pieces of code
as possible.

00:50:13.734 --> 00:50:15.167
And you talked about it
in the context

00:50:15.167 --> 00:50:17.567
of people being egotistical and
wanting to own a piece of code

00:50:17.567 --> 00:50:19.067
and no one else touch it.

00:50:19.067 --> 00:50:20.767
But I think there's
a practical factor there.

00:50:20.767 --> 00:50:22.234
When you have a big project
with few people,

00:50:22.234 --> 00:50:24.400
that the more proficient
someone is with a component,

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.067
the more quickly
they can implement features

00:50:26.067 --> 00:50:27.400
or solve bugs.

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.734
And if everyone spreads
themselves too thin, maybe...

00:50:30.734 --> 00:50:32.400
maybe development
would slow down.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.434
I don't know.

00:50:33.434 --> 00:50:35.234
I feel like this is true
on my project

00:50:35.234 --> 00:50:36.901
and my work experience.

00:50:36.901 --> 00:50:38.567
I feel like when bugs come in,
we want to assign it

00:50:38.567 --> 00:50:40.067
to the person who knows
that component best.

00:50:40.067 --> 00:50:41.567
They can fix it fastest.

00:50:41.567 --> 00:50:43.901
But we've thought about maybe
purposely assigning bugs

00:50:43.901 --> 00:50:46.400
to people who know it less
to help spread knowledge.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.901
Is that a good idea, or is this
concern completely false

00:50:48.901 --> 00:50:50.234
and just coming out of ego?

00:50:50.234 --> 00:50:51.734
Collins-Sussman: I think
there's a tension there,

00:50:51.734 --> 00:50:52.734
like you said, right?

00:50:52.734 --> 00:50:54.601
The fastest thing to do

00:50:54.601 --> 00:50:58.400
is to have the people who know
the code best work on it, right?

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.167
But you need to sort of find
a balance, right?

00:51:01.167 --> 00:51:03.734
Where you're balancing
short term versus long term.

00:51:03.734 --> 00:51:05.234
In the short term,

00:51:05.234 --> 00:51:07.234
it's best to have the experts
work on the code they know,

00:51:07.234 --> 00:51:08.901
'cause it'll get done
faster, right?

00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:11.400
In the long term, though,
you want to occasionally,

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.400
like you said,
maybe have someone

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.901
who doesn't know
that code as well

00:51:15.901 --> 00:51:18.734
pair-program a bug fix
with somebody who does,

00:51:18.734 --> 00:51:22.567
or give somebody a small task
in that foreign area of code,

00:51:22.567 --> 00:51:24.567
which isn't particularly
time-critical,

00:51:24.567 --> 00:51:27.434
but will give that person
some experience with the code

00:51:27.434 --> 00:51:29.400
so that if the expert
does get hit by a bus,

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.901
you'll be covered
for the long term.

00:51:30.901 --> 00:51:32.501
So, yeah, it's
about risk management, right?

00:51:32.501 --> 00:51:33.734
Short and long term.

00:51:33.734 --> 00:51:35.234
Fitzpatrick: And we're certainly
not advocating

00:51:35.234 --> 00:51:36.601
that everyone on your project

00:51:36.601 --> 00:51:38.734
knows how to do absolutely
everything in the code base.

00:51:38.734 --> 00:51:41.400
There's ways
of improving your bus factor

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.734
without actually making everyone
into a generalist,

00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:47.067
and that is
good solid documentation

00:51:47.067 --> 00:51:49.234
in code and comments,
design docs,

00:51:49.234 --> 00:51:51.067
and then just
general documentation.

00:51:51.067 --> 00:51:52.567
Collins-Sussman:
And code review, right?

00:51:52.567 --> 00:51:55.067
If one person--If there's code
review going on,

00:51:55.067 --> 00:51:57.567
then it's really pretty much
impossible for one person

00:51:57.567 --> 00:51:58.901
to know an area of code.

00:51:58.901 --> 00:52:01.067
Somebody
must've reviewed that code

00:52:01.067 --> 00:52:02.400
that went in there, right?

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.901
At least have
a cursory knowledge.

00:52:03.901 --> 00:52:05.734
Fitzpatrick:
Next question, please,

00:52:05.734 --> 00:52:07.067
in front.

00:52:07.067 --> 00:52:08.234
man: Uh, yes.

00:52:08.234 --> 00:52:11.067
You were talking
about technological solutions

00:52:11.067 --> 00:52:12.400
for social problems.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.834
And you mentioned that Git

00:52:15.834 --> 00:52:18.300
and other distributed systems
have this problem

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.567
where the first thing
you do is fork.

00:52:20.567 --> 00:52:23.901
But I wonder if--And I don't
want to put you on the spot,

00:52:23.901 --> 00:52:26.634
'cause I think this must be some
sort of competitor of yours,

00:52:26.634 --> 00:52:29.067
but GitHub
has taken that model

00:52:29.067 --> 00:52:34.434
and sort of mushed it together,
so it's both--

00:52:34.434 --> 00:52:36.067
You fork, but when you fork,

00:52:36.067 --> 00:52:38.567
somebody else can see
that you forked their code.

00:52:38.567 --> 00:52:40.901
And we've had cases
where I work lately

00:52:40.901 --> 00:52:44.067
where we have fixed something,
and the next day

00:52:44.067 --> 00:52:46.400
it would get pulled
back into the main branch.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.400
So I wonder, you know,
how you think about that.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.567
And maybe even if you could--
if Google Code was thinking

00:52:52.567 --> 00:52:56.234
about going somewhere
in that direction.

00:52:56.234 --> 00:52:57.567
Collins-Sussman:
Well, Google Code

00:52:57.567 --> 00:53:00.133
actually supports
Mercurial now.

00:53:00.133 --> 00:53:01.834
And, yes, we are working

00:53:01.834 --> 00:53:05.234
on the whole sort of server-side
clones, much like GitHub.

00:53:05.234 --> 00:53:07.434
I think that's gonna be coming.

00:53:07.434 --> 00:53:09.067
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:53:09.067 --> 00:53:11.067
It's not deployed yet,
but, yeah, it would be--

00:53:11.067 --> 00:53:14.400
it's definitely on our road map
to sort of have, you know--

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.901
having users be able to clone
repositories on the site

00:53:16.901 --> 00:53:19.567
and do polls from them
the same way GitHub does.

00:53:19.567 --> 00:53:22.067
But I was saying
there's a balance, right?

00:53:22.067 --> 00:53:26.234
Yeah, people start out forking,
but on the other hand,

00:53:26.234 --> 00:53:28.901
it's a much lower barrier
to participation

00:53:28.901 --> 00:53:30.534
than with a centralized system.

00:53:30.534 --> 00:53:33.400
So I think
it balances out, right?

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.734
Or maybe it's even better
in the long run

00:53:35.734 --> 00:53:38.400
for participation.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.901
Fitzpatrick: We have one
last question it looks like.

00:53:41.901 --> 00:53:42.901
man: Hi.

00:53:42.901 --> 00:53:44.234
You did give a very nice talk--

00:53:44.234 --> 00:53:45.734
Fitzpatrick:
Into the microphone, please.

00:53:45.734 --> 00:53:48.067
man: Yeah. You did give
a very nice talk

00:53:48.067 --> 00:53:51.234
about how you should be
to pick up team enrollment.

00:53:51.234 --> 00:53:53.234
But usually what when you're
working on one reserve,

00:53:53.234 --> 00:53:56.067
when you start implementing
what you just talked about,

00:53:56.067 --> 00:53:57.734
it's not just someone
becoming a genius,

00:53:57.734 --> 00:53:59.067
but you become a guinea pig.

00:53:59.067 --> 00:54:01.734
Your manager wants you
to write more code.

00:54:01.734 --> 00:54:04.567
Your peers look up to you, even
though you are a small fish.

00:54:04.567 --> 00:54:06.400
Just out of college, you know,
they expect you--

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.067
You know all this,
and I'll just bring up

00:54:08.067 --> 00:54:09.734
a magical solution
and, of course--

00:54:09.734 --> 00:54:11.734
It's like a little bug trying
to pull an airplane.

00:54:11.734 --> 00:54:14.267
And then you're kind of
in that limbo,

00:54:14.267 --> 00:54:17.234
where you want a code,
but you're afraid of coding.

00:54:17.234 --> 00:54:20.067
And the more you code, your
manager wants you to code more,

00:54:20.067 --> 00:54:21.734
and then suddenly,
you start to dream code.

00:54:21.734 --> 00:54:23.200
Your girlfriend
becomes angry at you

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.567
because you forget about her.

00:54:24.567 --> 00:54:26.734
Your mother complains
because you're not calling her.

00:54:26.734 --> 00:54:28.901
So all these psychological
problems come up.

00:54:28.901 --> 00:54:30.567
So how do you actually think
about this?

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:32.234
Fitzpatrick: We have
another talk in five minutes

00:54:32.234 --> 00:54:33.734
on how to replace your manager.

00:54:33.734 --> 00:54:37.400
[laughter]
No, I'm just kidding.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:41.400
Collins-Sussman: Hmm. I don't
think I've seen that situation.

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.234
Are you talking
about the general pressure

00:54:43.234 --> 00:54:44.901
to write more code?

00:54:44.901 --> 00:54:46.400
I mean, I guess
I don't quite understand.

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.834
Fitzpatrick: I think it's
a pressure from management

00:54:47.834 --> 00:54:49.067
to behave in one way

00:54:49.067 --> 00:54:50.434
when it's not necessarily better
for the team.

00:54:50.434 --> 00:54:52.567
Is that the general gist
of what you're talking about?

00:54:52.567 --> 00:54:55.234
man: It's just a matter
of becoming a guinea pig.

00:54:55.234 --> 00:54:56.400
You are the one--

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.067
You become a victim
of experimentalization.

00:54:59.067 --> 00:55:01.234
Fitzpatrick:
Right. So...

00:55:01.234 --> 00:55:03.234
Collins-Sussman: Wow.
I don't know.

00:55:03.234 --> 00:55:05.567
Fitzpatrick: We don't have
a solution for that.

00:55:05.567 --> 00:55:07.400
Collins-Sussman:
I think we're out of time.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.234
Fitzpatrick:
I think we're out of time.

00:55:09.234 --> 00:55:11.400
Collins-Sussman:
Darn. Rats.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.400
Fitzpatrick:
Thanks to everybody for coming.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.334
[applause]
