1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,780
But now it just want to give you
some biographical details. Um,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,800
that might be kind of
interesting. Parallel, um, to, um,

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,830
the basically the entire body of
work by a Fitzgerald that wears thin.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,010
Um,

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,010
last time we were ready assault that
Fitzgerald was married to seldom,

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,040
um, psia. Um, and she was a very, um,

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,840
um, you know, basically the, the um,

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,370
social center in Montgomery,
Alabama where he was stationed.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,550
Um, so, um,

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,060
he referred to her as the
first American flapper.

11
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:46,480
So obviously there has resonances
of for the story, but he's,

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,180
Bob's her here,
you know,

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,070
we know that that is where he gets
that part of his inspiration for.

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,540
Um, and so it, it actually, um,

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,490
and he has other stories
about flappers as we know.

16
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:03,780
Here's the whole collection called
flappers and philosophers. So, um,

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,610
seldom has been there pretty much,
um,

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,800
from quite early on in the short stories,

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,100
but really the work and we're just seldom
has the most important presence is um,

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,780
tenderness and Nate,
so just some interesting details,

21
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,310
some interesting parallels.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Some of you might have been surprised
that the call you refers to dig as captain

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,220
diver right when she raised
him from the sanitorium.

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,590
Um, and in terms it's not really a very
well accounted for because Dick and fat,

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,620
um, didn't really fight. Um,

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,150
he was considered too
valuable to be lost in battle.

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,100
So he was in Switzerland. He
was nodding in combat. Um, but,

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,993
um,

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,430
Nicole refers to him as captain diver
and it turns out that this is kind of an

30
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:03,431
interesting personal connection
to Fitzgerald's on live
and this relation to the

31
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:09,340
seller. It turns out that, um, in the, uh,

32
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,680
Fitzgerald collection that I
was talking about last time, uh,

33
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,730
the University of South Carolina, um,
there are a couple of very price, uh,

34
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,900
of items in that collection.
One is this briefcase, uh,

35
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,470
saying Scott Fitzgerald Fifth Avenue,
um,

36
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,950
and the other is this hip flask,
uh, with an inscription from it.

37
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,880
Um,

38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,610
and it turns out that this is
a gift from Zelda to Scott.

39
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,990
Before they were married,
when they were just coding.

40
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,410
And this is the inscription on that
flask to first lieutenant as Scott

41
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,630
Fitzgerald, 65th infantry.
Camera's Sheridan, forget me,

42
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:55,800
not [inaudible], September 18, 1918,

43
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,100
Montgomery, Alabama. So
it turns out that the,

44
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,090
the military rank is a
small personal detail, um,

45
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,240
in the caution the attribution,
um,

46
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,300
often military ran that in fact was not
really the real professional identity

47
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:17,200
for first year at any point. But,
um, she finally, I mean he was there,

48
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:21,790
he was in Montgomery, he was not fighting,
uh, either in Montgomery, Alabama,

49
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,810
but,
um,

50
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,490
she referred to him as first attending
more dignify a title and we'll see the

51
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:32,491
titles as they were the ones referred
to as doctor or mister as they make a

52
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:35,800
difference. Um, intended. It's
nine. So from the very beginning,

53
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,690
I kind of title consciousness on my part
of Fitzgerald that gets translated into

54
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:44,890
the captain drop diver in
tender is the night. Um,

55
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,100
but that's just a very,
very small connection.

56
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:52,510
The most important condition is some
of you might know has to do with a very

57
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:55,380
long history as long and painful history,
um,

58
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,120
of mental instability
on the part of the cell.

59
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:01,990
There basically from the 1930s on.
Um,

60
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,890
she never was not inside
clinic at some point, you know,

61
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,880
Hook career until she died.
Um,

62
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,440
she was in and out of mental institutions.
Um,

63
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,950
some more luxurious than others.

64
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:19,210
I'm not looking like Amanda Institution
has also, we'll begin with those. Anyway,

65
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,290
this is their,
um,

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,660
referenced to him as Captain
Diver and a tennis tonight. But,

67
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,970
um, this is the one of
the first issue when two,

68
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:32,270
I think it might've even had been the
first, uh, car praying Gwynn's in, um,

69
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,220
problem in Switzerland. Um, uh,

70
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,320
and we'll see a picture of her room there.
There was in 1930.

71
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,273
Uh,

72
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,810
and as you can see almost like
a hotel room and very, you know,

73
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:51,811
not looking like a idea of Amanda Mental
Institution and certainly not the place

74
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:55,330
where Dar would go to when it
goes to Jackson, Mississippi.

75
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,940
So at the very other end
of the social spectrum,

76
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,650
that's where she started out when she
began her long career of medicalization.

77
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,660
Um, and this is, um, her,

78
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,720
the picture of her release from
problems and you can see the,

79
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:16,690
she actually looks very different
from when she was 18. Um,

80
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,090
the almost unrecognizable the
two of them. Even what, I mean,

81
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:26,200
I guess it's separated by
a number of years as well,
but really I'm looking very,

82
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,590
very different. Um, and that
was, I think there was the,

83
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,390
the earliest instance in 1930, um, to, um,

84
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,480
even there was a unduly optimistic that
noses that she was recovered as you

85
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,540
recover from, um, the,

86
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,720
the breakdown because she was
very soon hospitalized again.

87
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,880
And this time in and other
even more famous Swiss clinic,

88
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,050
um, the rural Horsley which is where
young actually your practice. Um,

89
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,650
so in an infant I think for,
I was sharing was there briefly as well.

90
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,240
So in tender is the night,

91
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,270
there's a reference to fry that Dick
Divers to get to Vienna before Friday

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,200
retires. And there's also, um,
the Swiss clinic. So all that is,

93
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,970
is in part,
um,

94
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,140
it kind of has the connection to sell
us on medical history in Switzerland.

95
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,090
Um, then, and then she went
to a bunch of other ones. Um,

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,360
I can't even keep track of all the ones,
different ones that she went to. Uh,

97
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,340
but at some point in 1932, she went
to Johns Hopkins was back in this,

98
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,630
they were back in this country.

99
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,250
She went to Johns Hopkins Hospital and
that turned out to have put an opponent

100
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:44,870
in fact on both of them because
when she was at Hopkins,

101
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,780
um,
what part of the treatment was there?

102
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,450
She would have to write
for two hours a day.

103
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,840
That was part of the medical treatment.
Um,

104
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,670
so she started writing. She
wrote a novel called, um,

105
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,410
save me the walls, uh, which
was published in 1932. Um,

106
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,150
it was only about a thousand copies,
so,

107
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:12,740
so it, you know, it didn't make its
way into American literature. Exactly.

108
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,150
Um, but it's interesting in many
ways because it is sell the,

109
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,760
using her own medical history,

110
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,150
using her marriage to a scarf is general,
um,

111
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,610
using all their personal stuff
as material, um, for this,

112
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,810
for this novel.

113
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,230
And Fitzgerald actually tried to stop it
from the impoverish or try to revise it

114
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:40,240
very significantly, uh,
before it was published. Um,

115
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,440
and then after it was published here,

116
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:47,441
this opinion about his wives
novel plagiaristic unwise
in every way should not

117
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:51,980
have been written. Um, so this is a,

118
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,040
in many ways kind of long and
painful example of the many,

119
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:03,551
many instances in American literature
of the husband having some control over

120
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,850
the wires writing different.

121
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,060
Most famous example is Ted Hughes and
Sylvia Plath rater who lenders were

122
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,820
actually edited by him,
um, after her death. Um,

123
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,530
so in this case she did get it published
but it didn't reach a very wide

124
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,820
audience and he was against
their from day one. Um,

125
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,940
the daughter Scottie had the
similar different opinion.

126
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,210
She just said that this sort of
competition is traditionally the bane of

127
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:33,860
literary romances.

128
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,160
So at least she has a fairly clear view
about the marriage that there was quite

129
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,630
a bit of competition going on,

130
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:44,980
even though obviously he was
the one who was the writer.

131
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,450
She has some aspirations as well.

132
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:51,920
And if she had encouraged my actually
help have had more of a career.

133
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,340
Um, so the element of competition, uh,

134
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,990
between husband and wife I think is quite
an important theme. Even though, um,

135
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,610
Fisher road try to downplay it,
you know,

136
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:05,550
in saying that his wife is the one who
really had no talent and she had to

137
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:07,410
plagiarize from him,
um,

138
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,330
that he must've register the fact that
she was more of a competitor than he let

139
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:16,020
on. So we'll see how that plays
out in the dynamics between, um,

140
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,050
Dick Diver and they call and who winds up.

141
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,710
So there's one other super interesting,
this is actually not so important,

142
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:26,840
but just the kind of a point of reference.
Um,

143
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,810
as we know, there's another woman,
significant woman in tenders and they,

144
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,920
rosemary the actress. Um, and it
turned out that I think this is,

145
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,350
it's generally thought that this is the
person, um, bad rosemary is based on,

146
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,890
and we can sort of see that,
you know,

147
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,490
she has this very
wholesome in the sun look,

148
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,150
but she also was tremendously
disciplined as an actress. Um,

149
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,660
and in these shared a very
distinguished career as an actress. Um,

150
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,680
so this is the, the, um, the,

151
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,100
the Hollywood contribution
to tender is the night,

152
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,830
but I want to emphasize,
um, and other, um,

153
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,560
today's lecture actually will be
more about cinematic techniques.

154
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:13,060
So in even though she personifies
Hollywood's contribution to tender is the

155
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,640
night,
um,

156
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Ashley is in terms of formal techniques
that film would have more of an input on

157
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,160
the narrative technique of tenders night.
Um,

158
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,750
but I want to go back very briefly to,
um,

159
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,540
do something that we've been
talking about all semester,

160
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,600
which is the very important,
um, and in many ways, uh,

161
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,690
variously played out dynamics
between the half and half, not, um,

162
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,703
so just,

163
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,370
I know you guys might not have
gone to the and of this novel,

164
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,920
so I apologize for giving you,

165
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,390
but there's really no way I could talk
about the novel without talking about the

166
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:56,340
ending. Um, so without knowing
the details in between,

167
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:01,320
this is the last two
paragraphs of tenders tonight.

168
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,370
But he became entangled with a girl who
worked in a grocery store and he also,

169
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,440
he was also involved in the lawsuit
about some medical question.

170
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,710
So he left Lockport after that.

171
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,480
He didn't ask for the children
to be center in America
and then answer when they

172
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:26,481
call wrote asking him if he needed money
in the last leather she had from him.

173
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,410
He told her that he was
practicing in Geneva, New York,

174
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,970
and she got the impression that he has
saddled down with someone to keep housely

175
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,990
and she looked up at Geneva in an atlas
and found it was in the heart of the

176
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:44,580
finger lakes section and consider
a pleasant place perhaps.

177
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,760
So she liked the thing, his
career was biding his time. Again,

178
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:51,000
like grants and Galena.
His latest note,

179
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,130
it was postmarked from corn.
Now New York,

180
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,080
which is some distance from Geneva
in various more time. In any case,

181
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:03,860
he's almost certainly in that section
of the country in one time after,

182
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,860
in one time or another.

183
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,900
So those last five nurse,
uh,

184
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,170
it's five of the pruners was
in American literature. Um,

185
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,200
he's a total nobody by the animal
novel in one time or another.

186
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,220
Um, so this is a novel that, um,

187
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,660
loose very fast. You know,
we start out with him,

188
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,880
um, at the top of his profession,
full of promise. In fact,

189
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:38,440
when we first see him, he
is idolized by everyone, um,

190
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,240
around him,
um,

191
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,270
to get from there to this ending that
the woman in his life would be someone

192
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:47,620
that he sees in the grocery store.

193
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:52,621
And not even that I'm getting into trouble
of his very modest medical practice,

194
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,170
a drifter, a drifter going
from one small town to another,

195
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,030
and there's the additional in
south that he starts out in Seward,

196
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,110
Switzerland of city that
everyone knows about to Geneva,

197
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,021
New York,

198
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:16,021
which Nicole has to look up in an atlas
and he can even hold on to this Geneva.

199
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,580
So, um, it is in many ways
the ending is the beginning,

200
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:26,410
but the highly ionized
beginning. Uh, so just to,

201
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,120
um, we've seen this structure before and
I promise you will see it one more time.

202
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,310
Um, so, um,

203
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,580
the last three novels that we read
basically of this thing structure,

204
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:39,400
but for totally to
totally different effect.

205
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,130
So from what we've,
no,

206
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,790
at this point we know that there's one
other novel has this circular structure.

207
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,790
The ending is the beginning,
which is for whom the bell tolls.

208
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:52,120
So we've talked about this, we just
want to give you those two sentences.

209
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,081
Beginning,

210
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:58,081
he laid flat on the Brown pine near the
floor of the forest and then the last

211
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:03,370
line he could feel his heart beating
against the pioneer floor of the forest.

212
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,460
Um,
so it is having ways,

213
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,700
very tender rendition of a life that
could be construed as the life of a half

214
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:14,800
not right.
You know,

215
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:19,360
we talked about that possibility that
maybe he really has nothing I has is a

216
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:23,650
broken leg that's very alcoholic. We
then, which is not to be dismissed,

217
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,920
but against that ironic reading, um,
handling where post variable there,

218
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,120
uncle,
um,

219
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,260
image of in the [inaudible]
as the beginning, uh,

220
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,480
as the kind of,
uh,

221
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,420
Adler's deferral of the moment of death.

222
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,560
So he's still alive is almost as
if it were beginning of again,

223
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,350
and we as the readers one
end to begin all over again.

224
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,850
It is that illusion perpetrated in our
minds to me this morning that Hemingway

225
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:58,301
is able to write a novel that in some
sense doesn't really have an ending.

226
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,730
Right? You know, if the in
the ending is the beginning,

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,560
the actual death scene is the
four to the point of infinity.

228
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,580
So this is having ways very tender,
uh,

229
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,850
wrapping up of the life of Robert
Jordan and for whom the bell tolls.

230
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,520
And in contrast to that,

231
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:23,220
Fitzgerald is about as brutal as can be.
Um,

232
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,280
it's um, so he, you know,
this actually is, um,

233
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,720
kind of surf surprising that,
um,

234
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,870
that he would want to be
so thorough going, um,

235
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,600
in the dental or the vision of the diver.
But that's,

236
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,030
that's he wants how he wants to rate.
Um,

237
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:45,250
so today we'll look at that ending,
um,

238
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,090
the cruelty of that and
laying that, um, to, um,

239
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,900
the question there is a speed. We know
that the novel was moving very fast.

240
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,250
Lots of things have to happen
for us to get to that very,

241
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:00,980
very low point at the end of the novel.

242
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,340
So what has happened and what this
Fitzgerald have to do in order to speed up

243
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:12,710
the narrative to such an extent that he
would get to that absolute low point. So,

244
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,530
um, last time we talked about, um, montage
and we talk about flash back, right.

245
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,740
Um, as to cinematic techniques
that are input into Fitzgerald.

246
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,540
And today we'll look at
three very, very common, uh,

247
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,460
filming techniques and the way that
they actually help to speed up the

248
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,353
narrative.

249
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,380
It is not self evident that a close up
would in fact speed up the narrative.

250
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:41,690
But the way Fitzgerald uses
his close ups actually does,

251
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,680
and it's not always clear the cross
cutting with speed up the narrative,

252
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:50,660
one of the scan. And he uses this very
fun techniques to move things forward.

253
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,720
And then we have the very fast
motion of the negatives resolutions,

254
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,760
things being taken away from,
from, um, from Dick Diver of. So,

255
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,990
um, let's look at a couple
of instances of close up. Um,

256
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,140
and this is just so obviously visual
that it's sort of hard to look away from

257
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,940
that without actually with how to read
this without having some kind of visual

258
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:20,920
image. Um, this is about
rosemary as you know,

259
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,780
she has this crush on
him, on the diver, um,

260
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,550
and really desperately ones, um,
you know, to, to have an affair.

261
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,390
Um, so, but it doesn't quite
happen for, for awhile.

262
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,660
Presently she kissed him several times
in the mouth who face getting big as it

263
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:38,840
came out to him,

264
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,220
he never seen anything so dazzling
as the quality of the skin.

265
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,440
And since sometimes beauty gives
back to images once best thoughts,

266
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,350
he thought of his responsibility about
Nicole and have the responsibility of her

267
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,820
being two doors down across the
corridor, the reins over. He said,

268
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,530
do you see a sign on the slate?

269
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,790
Rosemary stood up and
leaned down and said,

270
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,930
most sincere thanks to him.
We're such actors,

271
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,040
you and I. Um, so okay, so, you know,

272
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,590
we're starting out and you know
it on one kind of register.

273
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,640
Um, we're starting out
with the notion of, um,

274
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,800
rosemary as this kind of
love stick puppet. Um,

275
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,460
that's just pining for
him. Um, and, and, and,

276
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:36,030
and unrequited love on top of
that. That is going nowhere. Um,

277
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,830
so and so the first part up to the last,
uh,

278
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,330
three lines of that,

279
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,360
of that passage is really all about
Dick dies in this noble person.

280
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:52,170
Even though he could have taken advantage
of rosemary and she was pining for him,

281
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,690
he could have easily
taken advantage of hers.

282
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:57,350
And I doing that because thinking
of his results to Nicole,

283
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,070
two doors down the hall,

284
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:04,190
all that is really about a nobility
and magnanimity and uprightness of Dick

285
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,020
Diver.
Um,

286
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:12,050
the last three why's swingers to the
other and of other sides and narrative.

287
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,290
And all of a sudden we see what
kind of a person rosemary is,

288
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,100
that in fact we don't really,
and she was completely truthful.

289
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,520
Rosemary is never not truthful.
Um,

290
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,290
even though she's an actress,

291
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:33,120
she actually is the most
truthful person in the novel. Um,

292
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,480
and this is an absolute statement that
is completely right about both of them.

293
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,400
She is an actress. Um, so
it's very hard to know where,

294
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,010
um,
you know,

295
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:51,020
where the acting begins and where
the feeling with the acting and,

296
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,560
and where they're feeling begins.
Um,

297
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,670
she's so discipline that you would act
in a certain way and then she runs into

298
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:02,340
an obstacle and she stops acting in
that way as she was doing right there.

299
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,080
You know, it's like trying out, you know,

300
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:07,590
one rude and saying that is going nowhere
and then suddenly seen that maybe you

301
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:10,170
should act in a different fashion.
Um,

302
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,200
so there is a way in which the emotional
life of rosemary has been completely a

303
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:21,380
professionalized to such an extent that,
um,

304
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,280
that she's always acting,

305
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:27,840
which was not even to say that
she's not sincere and, um,

306
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,330
Fitzgerald credit score of being sincere.

307
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,180
It's just that that is what she is.

308
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:38,181
I don't think that she's capable of
having any kind of emotions outside of her

309
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:43,620
professional identity as an
actress. Um, so this is, um,

310
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,260
you know, this, this is what she is.

311
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,980
So it is the blindness to that,

312
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,760
that he doesn't realize,
um,

313
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,520
that she's not exactly a lovesick puppy.

314
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:03,010
She is someone who is actually
acting in a particular fashion.

315
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,150
Um,

316
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:09,150
and who not only has the
full understanding of what
kind of person she is,

317
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,290
but she is a full understanding
of what he is. Right.

318
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:19,291
So it's not surprising that she should
know herself to be primarily an address

319
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,320
is not an accusation to say that that's
what she is above everything else.

320
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:30,040
She was primarily an actress,
so she has that degree of self knowledge,

321
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,370
but she also has the knowledge about
him that even though he is supposedly a

322
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:37,054
doctor,

323
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,630
he actually is at heart an actor and that
is an accusation and much more serious

324
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,280
accusation directed at him than it is
directed at her because she has been

325
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:55,240
totally upfront. You know, she's not,
she never, she never is not an actress,

326
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,940
um, from beginning of the novel
too. And she is defined by that. Um,

327
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,450
he is supposed to be a doctor so
he's not supposed to be an actor,

328
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,800
but they turn up,
turns out that maybe the end,

329
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:10,000
the most truth about him
is that he is an actor.

330
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,500
And then all the,

331
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,160
all the appearance of nobility
or the appearance of uprightness,

332
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,100
my turn out to be an act that is putting
up for her benefit and act that is

333
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,010
putting up for his own benefit.

334
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:30,370
Sometimes we can act
for ourselves as well.

335
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:35,670
So it shows the degree of knowledge of
him and it clear eye on the set amount

336
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:37,370
of,

337
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:42,370
on off sick evaluation of
exactly what kinds of man he is.

338
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,210
So it is the most acute statement about
Dick Diver that we've seen up to this

339
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,010
point. This is quite
early. Page one oh five.

340
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,460
So it is that acuteness that astute
knowledge about the man that she was

341
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:02,211
supposedly idolizing that gives the lie
Ashley to the adoration that she seems

342
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,720
to be raining on him.
Um,

343
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,770
that is actually completely within bangs.
She was practicing,

344
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:16,100
you know, what if, what it's like
to be an enduring love puppy,

345
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,590
she's acting that pot,

346
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,000
but it's a pot that she is
just doing it very well.

347
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,040
Um,
so the,

348
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,290
just to move this to the two
analysis of the narrative technique,

349
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,240
um, the moment, um, that, um,

350
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,680
that, that when we have that kind
of sudden switch in perspective,

351
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,380
um,
Ashley comes with um,

352
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,560
a visual detail that her face is coming
closer and closer to him and a face is

353
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:50,720
getting big as it comes up to him.

354
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,750
So let's remember that one visual detail
that her face completely fills his

355
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,450
field of vision that he
sees nothing but her face.

356
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,590
So let's keep that one visual detail in
mind and see what Fitzgerald does with

357
00:24:07,591 --> 00:24:12,500
that detail that close up. So this
is another scene quite a bit later.

358
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,200
Um,
Ashley's a flashback.

359
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,660
So going back to the point when they call,

360
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,310
we're still in the sanitorium when she
was asking him to take care of her,

361
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,870
Nicole was up in her
head now crew or school,

362
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,880
trying to collate the center mentalities
of a childhood as deliberate as a man

363
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:32,930
getting drunk after battle.

364
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:38,000
He breathed over her shoulder
and turn her insistently about.

365
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,540
She kissed him several times.
Her face getting the,

366
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,430
every time he came close her hands,
holding him by the shoulders,

367
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,050
Israeli hot.

368
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,820
Suddenly there was a booming from
the wise loves across the lake.

369
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:58,180
Cannons were shooting and have bearing
clouds in order to break them of help,

370
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,860
bearing clouds knowledge to break them.

371
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,910
The lies of the prom and not
went off went on again. Um,

372
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,110
so the,

373
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:12,120
we get that the repetition of
that same visual detail, um,

374
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,910
they're kissing her face,

375
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,630
getting very big as it gets close to him.

376
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:22,631
So the repetition of the same clothes
out and we'll this odd is that we get

377
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:27,860
exactly the same narrative sequence.
After that close up,

378
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,580
after their visual detail
of the fares getting big,

379
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,740
we get the sacs switch
to a different narrative.

380
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,010
Register, right? So
this is not Nicole, uh,

381
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,830
passing judgment on him.

382
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:47,831
So it was not exactly the same
structure as the incident with Rosemary,

383
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:54,310
but there's a switch abrupt switch to a
different sequence of narrative in this

384
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:58,850
case is such a quite a
trivial event. Um, there were,

385
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,860
there were shooting cannons in order
to break up the hell bearing clouds,

386
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:06,620
I guess is something he do in Switzerland.
Um,

387
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,650
but the point is that
cannons were being fired,

388
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,830
right? Um, in peace time in Switzerland,

389
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,870
which is the kind of surprising fact in
itself since when those not so familiar

390
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,880
with Canada's being
fired for that purpose,

391
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,100
but given the fact that we'll
be seeing the intertwined,

392
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:33,140
the superman pose, um,
images of love and war,

393
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:38,120
the firing of the cannons is
certainly not trivial at this point.

394
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,260
So at the very least,

395
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,620
we can say that there's an
intrusion into this scene of

396
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,830
the undeniable and historical
proven reality of war as well.

397
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,040
One is just a fact of history
that there was such a war.

398
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,230
So this is visceral,

399
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,980
is not going to recreate that war
for us except for the going over the

400
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:07,950
battleground and talking about it ticking,
you know,

401
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,850
20 lies to events of foot that
referenced and we saw last time,

402
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:16,851
he's not going to go further in the
direction of whirlwind and he has done so

403
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:21,880
far,
but he is going to give us echoes of Whoa,

404
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,890
Whoa. One in civilian
situations. And not only that,

405
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:30,891
but he's going to use that as a narrative
follow up to love scene specifically

406
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:38,190
to close up when a woman's face
is getting bigger and bigger.

407
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,760
So we can say that what the close
up is doing for Fitzgerald is,

408
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,580
especially the woman's face getting
bigger and bigger is the dramatization of

409
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:54,280
visualization of the woman's
power goes with demand, right.

410
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,900
So when Rosemary,

411
00:27:55,901 --> 00:28:00,210
his face is getting so bad that she
stills the entire visual tableau,

412
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,720
that is the point when we
see that Rosemary Ashley
knows exactly what comes from

413
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:10,550
and the driver is that she is
absolutely clear that about him. Um,

414
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,470
here there's not that equivalent cleared.

415
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:16,770
I judgment from the pilot and they
call because she's still a patient.

416
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,810
She hasn't gotten to that point yet.

417
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,380
But Fisher is giving us equivalent the
structure equivalent of that kind of

418
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,500
judgment in the sense that there's a
sudden break up of the love scene and the

419
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:33,501
replacement of that love scene by
something that is like an intimation of

420
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,880
battle.
So at the very least,

421
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:40,910
we should be prepared for the fact that
maybe war is not extraneous to laugh,

422
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,880
maybe more is actually organic to love
that maybe Warren is the narrative

423
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:48,690
structure of love.

424
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,840
That love takes the form of a battle
between the two people who are turning

425
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:59,040
joined in this fashion.
Um, so this is, um,

426
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,380
in many ways a kind of a prelude
to a kind of visual tableau,

427
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:09,450
um, that is, uh, a kind of a gesture
towards the future of that narrative.

428
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,670
Um, but I want to look at
another technique now, um,

429
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,270
which is also very prominent
and very unmistakable, um,

430
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,640
in, uh, tenderness tonight, which
is determining of crosscutting.

431
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,570
Um, so this is in book two
of a tangent is tonight.

432
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,010
And especially in section
10 of 10 of Bach too.

433
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,840
So the beginning of session 10
begins where in Zurich, in September,

434
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,040
Dr Diver had tea with baby Warren.

435
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,790
So at this point still a doctor,
um,

436
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,850
and is in that professional capacity
that he would have tea where baby Lauren

437
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:56,281
and sister who's trying to get a doctor
to take care of her by a doctor from

438
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:58,960
their call.
Um,

439
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,760
so they're having tea and talking
about various things and he's still not

440
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:08,560
agreeing to being alive lawn care
taker for Nicole at this point. Um,

441
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,710
but this is what happens on page one 58,

442
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,920
one page done. Next page actually. Um,

443
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:21,030
we get a southern abrupt
switch to Nicole's point of
view from her point of view

444
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,790
and narrated by Nicole herself
as in the first person. Um,

445
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,290
so let's see. This is
outside of her exchange. Um,

446
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,300
the ladders there, she
wrote rise to dig, die for.

447
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:40,460
We'll get a sense of how Nicco
things by following this, um,

448
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,840
this, this kind of monologue
that is given to us. Um,

449
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,370
as counterpoint to the TB train,
Dick Diver and, and, and baby Warren.

450
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,930
How do you do lawyer?

451
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,940
We're going to call tomorrow for
a week and then back to Zurich.

452
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,990
That's why I want you in system to settle
this because it doesn't matter to us

453
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,220
how much I'm allowed.

454
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,520
We're going to live very quietly in Syria
for two years and Dick has enough to

455
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:09,400
take care of us. No baby. I'm
more practical than you think.

456
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,730
It's only for clothes and
things. I'll need it. Why?

457
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:15,340
That's more than than the estate.

458
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,570
Can they stay really afford to give me
all that I know will never managed to

459
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:24,370
spend it. Do you have that much? Why
do you have, why do you have more?

460
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,850
Is it because I'm supposed
to be incompetent? Alright.

461
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,500
Let my share pilot them. No,
they refuse to have anything.

462
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,900
Whatever to do with it.
I have to feel bloated for us.

463
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,250
I'm not even reading and very well at
this could in and read much better. Um,

464
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,050
to get the tone. Exactly.
What a sharp business woman,

465
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,760
Nicole.
Yes.

466
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,840
In the space of one short exchange.

467
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,320
She achieves through things she
manages to get her share of the estate,

468
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,250
right. So you know, she only
needs, it begins by saying, okay,

469
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:06,490
we're going to live very modestly on
the next page. We don't need the money.

470
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:11,290
I just needed for clothes and you know,
incidentals. So very modders requirement,

471
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,520
very modest demand on the estate.
She gets the amount,

472
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:17,380
she says it's too much.

473
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:22,870
She checks out to see how much baby is
getting and finds, I'll you. In fact,

474
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:25,690
what she's getting is
less than what baby gets.

475
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,870
So she gets an increase right
then and there on the spot.

476
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,930
More than that,

477
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,400
this of course the question whether they
will have a share of that income and

478
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,420
she's admitting to the fact that she
would have to feel below that for the two

479
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:48,080
of them, that he's not going to
get a penny of that any home.

480
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,280
So in the space of one paragraph,

481
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:57,281
that switch from the exploded view to
Nicole's point of view is in fact an

482
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:01,550
incredible fast forward of the narrative.

483
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,810
Changing our conception of Nicole from
a patient in a mental institution to

484
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,550
sharp business woman who
is going to keep very,

485
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:20,990
very tight control over the
money that comes to her,

486
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,020
um,
that we shouldn't forget after all,

487
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,460
she is the granddaughter of a man,
um,

488
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:32,900
who has a huge fortune who has made
that huge fortune and there's a constant

489
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:36,810
reference as an, uh, for whom
the bell tolls, the length,

490
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,310
the cross generation linked
to the grandfather, um,

491
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:45,370
in tenders the night this also across
generation cross-generational link to

492
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:50,960
Nicole's when father that maybe she is
more her grandfather's granddaughter than

493
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:51,794
we may think.

494
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:57,010
So the effect of that cross cutting is
to take the narrative away from the x

495
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,110
side of the story and
deposit the Asian saves.

496
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,910
Strictly on Nicole side, the, she is the
one who's asked, they call them the shops.

497
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,240
She is the one who actually has to
financial control over the future of that

498
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:18,500
marriage. Um, so it, it, it,
let me just give you one other,

499
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,960
um, much more smaller incidents
of that cross cutting. Um,

500
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,080
all of this many pages after that cross
cutting his toe in the first person in

501
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:31,910
the Co's voice.
Um,

502
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,610
and so from being a mental institutions
and there's just married to, to,

503
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:41,180
to, to take diverse are there the saddle,
she has the control over the money.

504
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:41,960
Um,

505
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,960
but she also is beginning to complain
about the particular shape the marriage is

506
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:49,814
taking.

507
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,050
But I was gone again by that time
trains and Beiges they were all one.

508
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,790
That was why he told me a traveling.
But after my second child,

509
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:04,010
my level go topsy was born,
everything got dark again.

510
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:09,080
If I could get word to my
husband who has seen fit to the,

511
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:13,970
certainly here to leave me
in the hairs of incompetence.

512
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,700
You tell me my baby is black.
That's farcical.

513
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,960
That's very cheap.
We ran to Africa merely to see 10 God.

514
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:27,830
Since my principle interest
in life is archeology,

515
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,140
I'm tired knowing nothing and
being reminded of it all the time.

516
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,890
So page one 61,
um,

517
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,930
we can see the speed of this development
of that particular orientation of the

518
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:47,721
marriage from the beginning when she's
not even married to Dick Diver to the

519
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:52,800
next page one 59 when
she's married to him.

520
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,830
But retaining full control of her
finances to page one 61 when she is in a

521
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:04,311
position to complain about
his behavior as a husband.

522
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,330
Uh, well there's art here and the thing
is actually quite have a handle on the

523
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,240
[inaudible] is that once again,

524
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:17,270
this was with two of those completely
in explicable intrusion of a racialized

525
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,700
detail.
Um,

526
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:24,570
and the person of Nicole's
daughter tops it, um,

527
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,520
that my baby is black is really coming
out of nowhere except for the fact that

528
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:34,521
we know that Fitzgerald has a long history
of racializing particular characters

529
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,000
or critical moment.

530
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,800
So let's just go and you guys know
the tops is a reference to, um,

531
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,730
uncle Tom's cabin right into Harriet
Beecher. Stowe is novel. Um, and um,

532
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,740
Tufts is a black character and it's one
of the most vivid black hairdressers in

533
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:50,460
that novel.

534
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,990
So his fist gyros kind of backhand
attributed to 19th century classic.

535
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,850
And resurrecting the name
of a black character, um,

536
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,090
totally inappropriate names
for the dollar of Nicole,

537
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,110
but nonetheless, that's
what he just give her. Um,

538
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:12,111
so this is just to just to flesh
out the features of the history of

539
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:16,500
racialization, um, in
Fitzgerald and the great Gatsby.

540
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:20,120
We know that there really are no
black characters in the great Gatsby,

541
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,990
but there's this constant intrusion
of black hairdressers strangely.

542
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,770
So as we cross Blackwell's island limo,

543
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:32,220
same pastors driven by way show for
and which that three mothers knee,

544
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,430
two bucks an hour ago, I laugh,
allow us the yolks of the eyeballs,

545
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,430
rope to others in holiday rivalry. So
this is gas. We go into town with, uh,

546
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:45,530
nick and all of a sudden the intrusion
of the three blacks in the Limo Syndrome

547
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:51,190
by wedge show for that is a
kind of a visual metaphor, uh,

548
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,270
for the upstart guest be trying to,
um,

549
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,900
to elevate themselves higher
than he, than he should be. Um,

550
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,680
in this case it, the
racialization, um, that,

551
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,850
that we see in tender is the night,
um,

552
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:10,940
has to do I think with a
Mormon of marital volatility.

553
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,510
Um,

554
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:17,510
we know that she actually has control
of the basic structural future of that

555
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:23,490
marriage, which is the money. Um, and the

556
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,640
given that control,

557
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:31,641
she is in a position to put a particular
spin on that marriage and the marriage

558
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:35,580
has to do with Nicolette,

559
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:39,580
with the fact that they are
traveling because he is,

560
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,080
he needs to travel,
that she has an involuntary appendage,

561
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,240
um, to his constant travel and
um, the, his neglecting her.

562
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:54,270
So this is in many ways a very early
paving of the ground for the eventual

563
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,840
outcome of the novel that is highlighted
by Nicole presenting herself as the

564
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:09,130
victim. Nice party in the marriage. Right?

565
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,150
So to racialize herself and to racialize,

566
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,160
her daughter is a very specific and I
guess tested technique of demonstration,

567
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:27,340
a degree of grievance.
The degree of felt oppression of the pod,

568
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,890
even though she's not really black,

569
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:35,250
is almost as if she were the
black person at that rate.

570
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,570
So that's what the metaphor is doing
for her. She's anything but black.

571
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:45,580
But she's treated as if she were black.
That's what she's claiming.

572
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,600
So we don't really know with,
we agree with her. Yeah.

573
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:54,630
But this is who Nikos interpretation
of the marriage is that she is the

574
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:58,840
oppressed party in that marriage.
Um,

575
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,200
so let's look at one other
instance of crosscutting to Nicole.

576
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:13,170
And this is once again taking the
narrative agency or at least taking those,

577
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,070
landing the story on Nicole
side to why don't you,

578
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,040
why don't you register,

579
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:24,150
register and why did you register mister
and Mrs diver instead of doctor and

580
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:29,350
this is diver. I just wonder it
just throw it through my mind.

581
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,720
You're taught me that work is everything.

582
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:36,810
And I believe you used to say a man
knows things and when he stops knowing

583
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,830
things,
he is like anybody else.

584
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:44,220
And the thing is to get power
before he stops knowing things.

585
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,100
If you want to turn topsy turvy or right,

586
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,990
but most you are Nicole follow
you walking on her hands.

587
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,993
Um,

588
00:40:55,070 --> 00:41:00,070
so I think that by page one 60 to one
page for the shape of what is to come is

589
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:07,411
pretty much unmistakable
and it is conveyed very much
through a tome of voice,

590
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,330
um, through, in this case,

591
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:18,390
almost a repetition of exactly the same
kind of structure that we're seeing

592
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,530
between dead and rosemary.

593
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,560
Rosemary is the one who am page one
oh five already has seen true take the

594
00:41:25,971 --> 00:41:26,804
heifer.

595
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,920
She has thin through him so that he or
she can pass the most wounding judgment

596
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,040
on the Houston. Now the
doctor isn't afterward. Um,

597
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:42,430
Nicole has arrived at that
conclusion on page one 62 that he,

598
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,800
he's not a doctor or a doctor as opposed
to know to have medical knowledge.

599
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,850
That's what makes a medical
doctor another good after his dad.

600
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,070
Here's more knowledge than his patient,

601
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:00,550
but she knows at this point that in fact
he doesn't have any more knowledge than

602
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:06,170
the average person. They just
lost his claim to being a doctor.

603
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,820
And so,
you know,

604
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:12,821
they're not that many more identities
available to him once it's lost that claim

605
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:18,570
to a professional identity. She's not
saying outright that he's a dog, the,

606
00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:22,130
he's an actor,
but she's implying as much.

607
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,990
And there's that other detail about
his wellbeing turned topsy turvy.

608
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:27,740
Um,

609
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:32,740
as well as the naming of the thing that
the thing is to get power before he

610
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:36,980
starts knowing thing. Um, it is

611
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,010
naming exactly what it is the
deep diver has failed to do.

612
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,080
If he has done things from bright,

613
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:50,530
he will have had after we can chose
the marriage before he loses out in the

614
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:51,920
Department of Knowledge.

615
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,250
But now that he's lost out in
the department of knowledge,

616
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,790
he's not going to have power
in that marriage as well.

617
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,540
So the very sharp,
clear,

618
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:07,570
I absolutely understand the of judgment
of her husband is very much an echo of

619
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:12,710
what rosemary has test into it
much earlier. Um, and it comes,

620
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,330
it comes over to us,

621
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:19,030
comes across to it once again through
the technique of cross cutting. So, um,

622
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:21,320
you know, I was, I would
say that the, so, so the,

623
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,720
the emptying out of any kind of sustenance
anymore of sustenance in Dick divers

624
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:28,581
come very,

625
00:43:28,581 --> 00:43:33,581
very early and is through this complete
the steady erosion of any emulation,

626
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:39,070
um, for him on the part of the two
women who started out as great, um,

627
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,480
idolizes of him.
Um,

628
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:45,350
so now we've gotten to a point where
we actually see the speed of the,

629
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:49,220
of the negative resolution and picking
up the speed becomes just faster and

630
00:43:49,221 --> 00:43:52,670
faster. Um, so this is the first, um,

631
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,520
the Sousas the couple there three,

632
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:59,030
basically the three points
of no return for desire for,

633
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,280
on his way to losing his medical
practice and Lockport. Um,

634
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:08,000
the first point of no return is the
fight he gets with a cabin near Erie.

635
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:13,870
He walked past the staring a currently
in airy and up to the grinning face,

636
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,850
hit it with a smashing,
left the side of the jaw.

637
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,570
The man dropped her for this
is a cab driver he got into
a fight with for moment.

638
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,210
He stood over him in trials.

639
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,090
But even as the first Pang of doubt
shot through him, the world real,

640
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:34,080
he was clubbed down and FIS and boots
beat on him in the strange tattoo.

641
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,630
It felt as nose break like a shingle.

642
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:41,980
And his eyes jerk as they a snap back
on the rubber band into his head or rib

643
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,170
splintered. And those then
pain, he'll voluntarily,

644
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:47,400
he lost consciousness,

645
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:52,630
regain it as he was raised
her same position and there's
risk joke together with

646
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,650
him cards.
The plain clothes lieutenant,

647
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,660
whom here knocked out was themselves
drew back his arm as smashing into the

648
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:04,440
floor. Um, this was a very brutal scene.

649
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:09,441
Lots of people are getting shot and Duke
diver is important to turn out to point

650
00:45:09,451 --> 00:45:12,150
out this,
not except from that violence.

651
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:17,100
And this is the first emptying
out of his professional identity,

652
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,553
um,

653
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:23,580
that he adopted is supposed to be
treating someone who has been subjected to

654
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:25,470
that kind of violence.

655
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,700
And instead it turns out he is the one
who needs a doctor to take care of him.

656
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,500
Um, so, um,

657
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:36,530
this is what happens when you have
things happening very fast and this is,

658
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:41,400
um, um, image. Ashley of the
Caribbean area, which it's still,

659
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:42,840
it's kind of sinister looking,

660
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:47,210
but this is the person that gang of
them actually beating up on the guy for.

661
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:48,330
Um,

662
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:52,820
so what is interesting is that even
though things aren't actually happening

663
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,340
raining down fast,
they can fast on dig diver.

664
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:00,450
He's actually accused of being moving
too fast with see the various people who

665
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,620
accuse him a very things we've seen.
Rosemary is accusing him of something.

666
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:10,100
Nicole accusing him of something and he's
now being accused by his partner in a

667
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,370
clinic. Um, in,

668
00:46:12,371 --> 00:46:16,800
in this conversation between the France
and his wife for sharing. Cathy said,

669
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,550
you are the solid when you do the
work as the kids are here and toys.

670
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,910
And in my opinion,
the hairs raises almost done.

671
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,860
Friends let themselves believe with ever
increasing conviction that dig travel

672
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:33,890
intellectually and emotionally at such a
rate of speed that the vibrations Java,

673
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,990
it's only two of them talking behind
his back saying that you know,

674
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:39,450
that he's not such a great
partner to begin with.

675
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,160
And we see the consequence of that kind
of conversation between France and his

676
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:48,990
wife. Uh, when they're talking about
they're solving that medical partition,

677
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:53,100
this is no go. He says suddenly,
well, that's occurred to me.

678
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:56,910
Praise and that your heart
isn't in this project anymore.

679
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,070
I know I want to leave.

680
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,490
We should strike some arrangement about
taking Nicole's money up gradually.

681
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,030
I thought about that too,
that I've seen this coming.

682
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:11,360
I'm able to arrange other backing and it
will be possible to take all your money

683
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:16,581
out by the end of the year to can not
intended to come to decision so quickly.

684
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,290
Nor was he prepare for friends who
sold readily acquiescence in the brake.

685
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:26,220
You know, he was really without
now without desperation,

686
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,240
he had long felt the ethics
of his profession dissolving
into a lifeless mask.

687
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,620
So this is the speed of the break out of
that and medical practice against again

688
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:44,430
at the speed that they can not
comment on that he had not asked for.

689
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,890
It is somebody else's being that is
dictated the narrative development.

690
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,670
Um, and they'll just give you, I know
that we're on, was running all the time,

691
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:59,310
so it gives you the final
part of that resolution, um,

692
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,020
against in fast motion.
You get,

693
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,380
actually I'm going to skip this because
I know that we're running out of time,

694
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:08,410
so there's this, um, this
will be on the PowerPoint,

695
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:14,730
but I'm just going to go to the very end
of the narrative about love as war with

696
00:48:16,871 --> 00:48:21,040
spin, seeing the super
imposition of love and we're,

697
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:22,690
we're one all the way through.

698
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:27,690
And finally we see the infusion of world
one into this description of Nikos idea

699
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:32,750
of what the marriage was like.
Again, she struggle with it,

700
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,760
finding him with a small fine eyes with
the pledge arrogance of a top dog within

701
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:42,990
these and transferring to another man
with a Kimberly with sendlane of years,

702
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:48,410
she'd fallen with her money and her faith
that his sister just liked him and was

703
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:49,211
behind her.

704
00:48:49,211 --> 00:48:54,211
Now with a thought of the new enemies
he was making his bitterness for this

705
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:58,390
other battle she used,
even her weaknesses,

706
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:03,420
fighting bravely and courageously with
the oak hands and crockery and bottles,

707
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,440
empty receptacles of his
experience, his sins, outrages,

708
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:12,910
mistakes and sunlight in
the space of two minutes.

709
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:18,390
She achieved because they train and
justify herself to herself without liars.

710
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:21,550
Subterfuge cut the court forever.
Okay,

711
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:26,910
two minutes for her to come to the final
decision about the marriage and this is

712
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,300
the final mirror image.
And this,

713
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:36,360
I would just say this is a great
moment to pair up with the barber.

714
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:37,660
Uh,

715
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,660
seeing the rape scene and filmed about
holds the mirror in front of them.

716
00:49:43,361 --> 00:49:48,040
They call reflected the passage between
the man side and the ones and the cost.

717
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:52,390
Dot it up at the side of Tommy Bob.
And the manager's going to narrate,

718
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:55,600
entering and willing
sharply into the manager.

719
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:01,170
She knew of of joy that there was going
to be some kind of showdown in a minute.

720
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,540
They came into Nicole's booth.

721
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:09,570
His expression in merging and no way
from behind the towel is hastily wins

722
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:13,600
phase. Your friend has worked
himself up into a state.

723
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:17,260
He wants to see us together. So I
agree to have it over with. Come along,

724
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,590
but my hair is half cut.
Nevermind. Come along.

725
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,910
Resentfully she understanding coffers,
remove the towels,

726
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:29,330
filling messy and unadorned.
