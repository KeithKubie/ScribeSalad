MALE SPEAKER: Hi,
thanks for coming.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.029
I'm very pleased to have
Greil Marcus here today.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.190
Greil is one of the
world's first rock critics

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.560
and a native of the Bay Area.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.900
Grew up in Menlo Park.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.820
And sort of knew Bob Weir,
and sort of knew Jerry Garcia,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.480
but not claiming any
great credit in that one.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.310
So he went to Berkeley
in American studies.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.310
And in 1975, wrote a
book, "Mystery Train,"

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.590
which is used in
college studies now,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.730
including by our two
videographers here

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.860
who studied him in school.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.840
He also wrote for "Rolling
Stone" at the very beginning.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.530
Also "Creem" and
the "Village Voice."

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.220
Some of his other books
are "Lipstick Traces,"

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.190
"Invisible Republic," "The
History of Rock and Roll

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.950
in 10 Songs," and his current
book, which is on sale here,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.952
"Three Songs, Three
Singers, Three Nations."

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:56.160
The number keeps coming down.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.076
I'm hoping the next book
will be one song that

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:02.520
tells you everything you need
to know about rock and roll.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.749
So please welcome Greil Marcus.

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:07.503
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.710
GRIEL MARCUS: Thanks, Bob,
and thank you for coming.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.140
So I'm here to talk about
this very small book called

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.760
"Three Songs, Three
Singers, Three Nations."

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.360
And it came out of
a series of lectures

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.104
that I was asked to give
at Harvard a few years ago.

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:29.770
There was supposed
to be three lectures.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.810
So I thought, OK,
I'll pick three songs.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.900
And what I wanted
to do was to take

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.130
songs that seemed as if
they didn't have authors,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.570
as if they were just--
came out of the air.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.310
And there are a lot of American
folk songs that feel like that,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.300
or that are like
that, songs where

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.850
it's impossible to
trace their origins.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.840
There's no known composer.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.410
There's no original.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.550
So there's no version you can
say, well, that's just a copy.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.100
If there's no original,
there's no copy.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.320
These are just songs
that are common property.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.760
I think of them as
commonplace songs.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.030
And what I was interested
in was not just

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.320
songs like a folk song--
say, "East Virginia--"

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:34.360
or let's see-- a
blues song, like "Poor

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.650
Boy, Long Way From Home,"
songs that are just in the air.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.540
I wanted to take songs
that felt like that,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.780
but weren't necessarily
anonymous, weren't necessarily

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.220
authorless.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.060
And I ended up with three songs.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.910
The first one I talked
about was Bob Dylan's

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.620
"Ballad of Hollis Brown--"
obviously not a folk song,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.810
not a song with
an unknown author.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.530
A very specific person wrote it
at a very specific time, put it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.910
out in a particular
album, and there it was.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.060
But it always had
the feeling of being

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.370
a song that was handed down from
generation to generation, so

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.580
that even if there were an
actual author at some point,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.650
that person would have
been completely forgotten.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.910
It's a song about a farmer.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.740
We don't know anything
about him except his name,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.590
because it's mentioned
in this song.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.340
And in the very, very end, in
the last verse of the song,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.800
South Dakota is mentioned.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.130
But otherwise, it's
just completely generic.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.070
There's a farmer.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.210
His farm is failing.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.940
There isn't enough food
to feed his family.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.150
No one will help him.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.780
He has no friends.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.720
And he ends up killing himself
and his wife and his children.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.320
And it's the kind of song that
always carries with it the aura

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.190
of the Great Depression.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.430
And if you go to YouTube and
you look at videos that fans

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.370
have made, they all
show dust storms,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.210
and they all show Okies fleeing
the Dust Bowl, and foreclosures

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.510
of buildings.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.610
And all the pictures
are from the '30s.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.760
You're looking at
Dorothea Lange.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.320
You're looking at Ben Shahn,
all these famous, iconic images

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.460
from that time, because it
just has that feeling to it.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.790
Except it wasn't about
the Great Depression.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.250
It was set right in
its moment, 1964,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.775
when it was written
and released.

00:04:45.775 --> 00:04:47.150
But people thought,
oh, this must

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.630
be about the Great Depression.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.680
Well, the thing is,
with a family farm,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.100
the depression is a year
away for almost everybody.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.410
That's the nature of
having a small farm that's

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.840
totally dependent on
itself and on the market

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.690
and on the weather, forces
that can't be controlled.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.860
So it has that feeling of
being a song that maybe

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.450
was from the 19th century,
maybe after the Civil War, maybe

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.320
before it, but most
likely the 1890s

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.140
when, in fact, there was a
horrendous depression that

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.670
swept through the Midwest.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.070
It has that feeling--
or the '30s.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.870
The last thing it feels
like is the 1960s.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.450
But it's a story about a man
who kills his family and then

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.710
himself that appears in this
country every year or so.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.390
Every year or so, you'll
see a small story.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.280
Maybe it will be two,
three, four column inches,

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.870
but that's all, about a man
in Florida, most recently

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.940
two years ago, who killed
himself and his family

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.750
for whatever reasons.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.660
And in this case, it was
economic destitution,

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.780
the same as in the song.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.970
So that was something
that was interesting--

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.960
a song that felt as
if it had no author,

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.590
but had a very specific author.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.190
And I wanted to play around
with how and why Bob Dylan might

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.940
have created a song,
made a song this way.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.650
As it happened, he used a melody
from a very ancient-- 400,

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.660
500-year-old-- folk song called
"Pretty Polly," a common song

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.180
all through Appalachia,
all through the south,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.930
from the 18th century forward.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.930
And he has a very
distinct cadence,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.380
pounding kind of melody.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.340
It's full of foreboding.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.440
And you just have
a sense of force,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.110
and something terrible
is about to happen.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.060
All that's carried
in the melody.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.560
So he took the melody
from that old folk song

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.500
and wrote new words to it.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.200
So that was one example.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.800
Another example was
a song that really

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.430
is what's called a
folk lyric song, where

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.250
a certain person learned
this song at a certain time,

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.350
but he learned it
from a friend who

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.280
had learned it from an uncle.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.120
And the uncle was
dead, so there's

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.300
no way of asking who
the uncle heard it from.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.470
This was around 1900
when a college student

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.360
named Bascom Lamar Lunsford
was waiting for a train

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.660
to take him back to
Asheville, North Carolina.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:39.365
And his college friend,
a guy named Fred Moody,

00:07:39.365 --> 00:07:40.240
taught him this song.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.580
And it was called "I Wish I
Was a Mole in the Ground."

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.320
It's one of the
strangest songs in all

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:55.460
of American music-- all of
American iconography, really.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.120
And there isn't a
single element in it,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.960
except one, that can
be traced to any place

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.280
or any time or any person.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.520
A folk lyric song
means verses-- a song

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.480
that's made out
of verses or maybe

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.860
just single lines,
maybe even an image,

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.760
that come from different songs.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.100
And they're called floating
verses or floating lines.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.770
And a person will take pieces
of all these various songs, all

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.810
these familiar elements,
and put them together

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.750
in his or her own way and
say, well, this is my song.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:33.789
I made this song.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.120
I wrote this song.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.530
But in fact, there won't be
a single original word in it.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.340
It's the arrangement.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.500
It's the presentation that's
original, if anything is.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.390
But here is a song
that has lines

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.380
in it that are utterly strange.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:55.300
It's a song that goes back
and forth, verse by verse,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:01.110
between essentially
overthrowing the world and sex.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:06.950
Every other verse is
about destruction or love.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.480
And it starts out, I wish
I was a mole in the ground.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.920
I wish I was a
mole in the ground.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.490
I wish I was a
mole in the ground.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:20.030
If I was a mole in the ground,
I would root that mountain down.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.290
And I wish I was a
mole in the ground.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.710
So here is someone who's
saying, I wish I was blind,

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.690
I was this ugly, hideous
creature scurrying

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.600
under the earth kind of thing,
that if anybody sees me,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.430
they'd want to kill me.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.270
And I'm going to burrow
under that mountain-- which

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:44.110
means power, which
means the state, which

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.230
means the north after the
Civil War, which means anything

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.200
that you feel oppresses you.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.180
And I'm going to burrow
under that mountain,

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.050
and I'm just going to
paw away at it until I

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.350
bring the entire mountain down.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.860
It's a fantasy of revolution,
that one little mole

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:08.580
can bring the entire structure
of power, whatever it might be,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.550
down.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.760
And you go from that
verse to a verse

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.930
about a woman named
Tempi, or Kempi, who

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.730
is running over a hill.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.110
And she wants a $9
shawl, and she's

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.640
going to let her
hair hang down, which

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.499
is an age old American
image for making love.

00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:32.040
All these things
are going to happen.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.560
You go back and
forth between I wish

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.380
I was a lizard in
the spring, I wish

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.960
I was a lizard in the spring.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.320
Again, being a
mole is not enough.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.354
You want to be a lizard?

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.720
And that verse,
again, is a fantasy

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.520
of a basement, a fantasy
of not being seen,

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.890
of being there but not there.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:01.680
And then you go back to
Tempi coming over the hill,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.970
waving a $40 bill.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:10.450
And the singer says, baby,
where you been so long.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.740
Now, American folk
song is-- and I'll

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.040
be getting to more of this in a
couple minutes-- American folk

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.750
song is made up of all
different kinds of codes.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:24.980
Baby let your hair hang
down means let's have sex.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.000
Where you been so
long means who were

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.140
you sleeping with last night.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.530
That's what it means.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.860
That's the only thing it means.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.890
She comes over the
hill with a $40 bill,

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.166
and I say baby, where
you been so long.

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.290
You want to translate that?

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.550
That means she's
been on the streets,

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.260
and she's come back with $40.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.410
And it all rushes by very fast.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.700
That's the only
thing in the song

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.940
that is specific to
anything-- a $40 bill.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.920
And in its way, it's just as
odd as wanting to be a mole.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.870
What is a $40 bill?

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.400
I listened to this
song-- and I've

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.250
loved this song for more
than 40 years-- 46 years.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.050
I can really date to
when I first heard it.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.460
And it was only in the past
few years I thought, $40 bill?

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.820
Who's ever heard of a $40 bill?

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.530
And thanks to this magic
tool called the internet,

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:31.050
you can actually
just go find out.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.070
And so I did.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.800
And boom, the $40 bill was
issued by the Continental

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.230
Congress in 1778.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.370
It was in circulation for
only a couple of years.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.420
That's the only
time there has been

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.190
a $40 bill in the history
of the United States.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.000
Just stunning that you
could find this out.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.360
And there wasn't
one any other time.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.090
It was obviously some
bizarre anachronism.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:03.600
And you go right to, dare
I say, Google Images,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.570
and there will be a $40 bill.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:10.340
And again, the
Continental Congress--

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.870
it's not as if the country
actually had a name.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.830
One of the bills says the United
States of Northern America.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.470
That didn't catch on.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.680
But they were trying.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.594
That's official US currency.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:31.390
And if you go through
normal channels--

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.850
I decided at one point
I needed a $40 bill

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:40.360
so I could use it as an
illustration in this book.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.150
And taking something off Google
Images wasn't good enough.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.230
I had to get an actual $40 bill.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.780
So I tried the Smithsonian.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.710
And they did a search.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.230
They couldn't find anything.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.290
I tried the Library of Congress.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.860
I tried the National Archives.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.700
Everything came up zero.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.720
Nobody knew.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.130
Nobody could find out
anything about it.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.680
Nobody had it.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.860
So I had to go to eBay.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.210
And within a couple of
days, there was a $40 bill.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.840
It was really not
very difficult,

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.740
and it wasn't even
that expensive.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:19.880
Given what I had to pay
for it, if you figure

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.010
a $40 bill and you
factor in inflation

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:28.070
for 250-- 270 years,
whatever it's been,

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.330
275 years, that
$40 bill would be

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.730
worth a lot of money,
a whole lot more money

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.450
than I had to pay for it.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.950
So I got a $40
bill, and I managed

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:45.600
to have it shot and sent to the
publisher, and that was that.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.590
But that's the only
thing that's specific.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.490
And it's the only
thing that says

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.250
this song, or at least
one element of this song,

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:59.580
is as old as the
memory of a $40 bill.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:04.040
It doesn't mean this song began
to come together in the 1770s.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.740
But it means that at some point,
someone who's putting this song

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:14.080
together takes a line from
another song, or maybe a poem,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.000
or maybe something this
person heard in an argument

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.700
or in a bar.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.830
You tried to pay
with a $40 bill?

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.480
There ain't no such
thing as a $40 bill.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.670
$40 bill-- what an
interesting idea.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:33.000
I'll stick this in my song,
maybe just as another image

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.460
of unlikeliness.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.050
I wish I was a mole.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.810
I wish I was a lizard.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.100
I have a $40 bill.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.710
Maybe it fits that way.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.170
Maybe it's more
specific than that.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.100
So maybe that means
that somebody remembered

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.030
when there was a $40 bill.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.530
So maybe it could be the 1820s.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.090
You can't understand
anything about this song

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.410
in terms of musicology.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:00.980
It's just there.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:06.360
In 1928, this man,
Bascom Lamar Lunsford,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.630
who was a college student when
he learned this song in 1900,

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.060
recorded it.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:17.590
He was a strange character--
North Carolina lawyer, judge,

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.850
newspaper editor,
Democratic Party operative.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.900
During the First
World War, he was

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.270
hired by the Justice
Department to chase down

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.812
draft dodgers in New York City.

00:16:29.812 --> 00:16:32.020
God knows why they had to
bring him to New York City,

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.110
but they did.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.820
He actually began
recording in the '20s.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.630
Eleanor Roosevelt was
a great folk music fan.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:46.810
She invited him to perform
at the White House in 1936

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:52.180
for President Roosevelt and
the King and Queen of England.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.320
And that was one of the
high points of his life.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.970
And he became a
folklorist, and he

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.810
recorded hundreds
and hundreds of songs

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.470
for the Library of Congress
along with commercial records.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.390
And so he made a
record of this song,

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.760
"I Wish I Was a
Mole in the Ground."

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.160
And in the '50s and the '60s,
when there was a folk revival,

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.560
a huge revival of interest
in old folk songs,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.829
people began to sing it,
and it began to travel,

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.930
began to be heard.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.670
All sorts of people
tried to record it.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.319
And now it's a commonplace song.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.490
It's there.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.570
But this is a song that
absolutely has no author.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.400
It has performers.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.830
But it is a song whose
origins are completely lost,

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.230
except for that $40 bill.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.540
The other song I wanted
to fool around with

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.960
was a song that I first
heard, as most people

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:56.450
who know it first heard
it, I think, in 1994.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.210
There is a film director
named Terry Zwigoff,

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.940
and his first movie
was called "Crumb."

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.750
And it was about
the comics artist R.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:12.640
Crumb, one of the most scabrous
and obscene and hilarious and

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.220
adventurous comics artists
that the United States has

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.610
produced in the last century.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:26.060
And he's presented-- he would
be about my age now, somewhat

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.630
older, so say he's
in his mid 70s now.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:34.120
And this movie is made in the
early 1990s when he's still

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.570
living in San Francisco.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.890
And you follow him,
and you hear interviews

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.510
with people who know
him or are close to him.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.120
And he talks a lot.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.120
And you also get
to know his family.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.400
And his family is a ruin.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.100
His parents are long gone.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.160
He has two brothers.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.250
They're both crazy.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:58.120
They're both commitable,
although they're not committed.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.280
And they're people who live
in hovels and never leave.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.420
They're just ruined people.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.690
Crumb-- R. Crumb, Robert
Crumb, we meet him.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.350
And he's cranky, and
he doesn't like people,

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.760
and he just complains.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.160
I've corresponded with him
occasionally over the years.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.330
He's incredibly funny.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.980
He's just uproarious.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.460
And he corresponds by letters,
by handwritten letters.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.430
But he's a professional
cartoonist.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.930
His lettering is just
wonderful to read.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.250
It's like reading a cartoon.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.790
And it's just great to
listen to his voice.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.000
It comes through.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.020
And it's all about, I hate this.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.240
Nothing is-- this is
an insult to humanity.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.080
I can't believe you
mentioned that to me.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.030
And you don't feel like
he's actually angry.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.110
This is just how he talks.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.580
But in the movie,
you get to know him.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.690
He is the ultimate misanthrope.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.040
He does not like people.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.830
He doesn't like the weather.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.200
He doesn't like the
way the concrete feels

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.060
on his shoe leather.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.450
There's just nothing he likes.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:17.490
And you meet him as
an unpleasant person

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.270
who doesn't want to
live in the world,

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.240
like his brothers,
who essentially

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.020
don't live in the world.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.780
But he does live in the world.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.070
He does function in the world.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.750
But he doesn't like it.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.750
And then there's this
scene where he's in a room,

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:40.840
and the room is lined with
shelves of 78 RPM records

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.760
from the '20s and '30s.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.130
And when he was in his early
20s, he was a record collector.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:51.212
He collected old blues and
country records from the South.

00:20:51.212 --> 00:20:53.520
And he would go
through the south,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.350
like many record collectors did.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:21:00.450
And he would essentially knock
on doors in poor white sections

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.330
or in black sections
of small towns,

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.830
and he'd say, do you have
any old records that you'd

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.510
like to sell, the premise being
that there might be people who

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.860
had old records that they
just hadn't gotten around

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.640
to throwing out.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.350
And there might be things
that you would really

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.619
want-- something
incredibly rare,

00:21:19.619 --> 00:21:21.910
something that no one had
ever heard of that turned out

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:26.460
to be beautiful and unique.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.570
And you would pay $0.25
for these records,

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.060
and maybe up to $1.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.640
If you paid over $2,
you were considered

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.160
some kind of
dilettante, some kind

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.930
of rich kid who came down--
instead of collecting stamps,

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.390
bought somebody
else's collection.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.160
So that was frowned on.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.890
And he did that.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.230
He went from door to door.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:47.270
He knocked on doors.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:51.210
And he amassed this collection,
this extraordinary collection

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.510
of 78 records.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:58.630
And so you see him, and
he's there in a little room.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.220
And he goes up to the shelf,
and he pulls a record off,

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.310
and he puts it on a phonograph.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.470
And then he lies down on
a kind of cot, a day bed.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.700
And he lies down, and
he closes his eyes,

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.520
and this song begins to play.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.830
And it's just from
another world.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.340
It is one of the strangest
things I'd ever heard,

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.930
and I'm sure most of the people
in the theater had ever heard.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:24.930
And you just don't know.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.120
What are you listening to?

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.470
This music sounds as if
it came out of the ground.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.840
It barely sounds like
it was sung by a person.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.380
It sounds like it was sung by
a dead person, a person who's

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.780
trying to talk to you from
the other side of death.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.610
All this comes
through instantly.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:48.920
And he's lying there,
and he's saying,

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:56.750
sometimes I listen
to music like this

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:04.210
and I feel this is the
voice of ordinary people,

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.650
common people-- and
he says that kind

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:11.030
of disdainfully--
common people making

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.010
a connection with eternity.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:18.290
And then he's embarrassed by
how open he's left himself.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.410
He says, making a
connection to eternity,

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.500
or whatever you
want to call it--

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.900
that I should entertain
a notion as corny, as

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.786
human, as eternity.

00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:33.160
And you're listening
to the song,

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.210
and you're saying, yeah, right.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:34.840
That's right.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.710
This is somebody making
a connection to eternity.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.380
I could never have
put it any better.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.550
I left the theater-- and I'm
sure I wasn't the only one

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.210
when that movie was over--
and I drove straight

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.250
to the nearest
record store, hoping

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.100
there might be a soundtrack
album to this movie,

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.790
and that this song
might be on it.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:55.870
And it was.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:59.200
So I'm going to play you this
song, and then talk about it

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.250
some, and maybe play it again.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.736
[MUSIC - GEESHIE WILEY, "LAST
 KIND WORDS BLUES"]

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.925
So that's the song that I heard.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.140
I got the soundtrack album.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.770
I played the song
over and over again.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:20.070
Geeshie Wiley was the
name of the performer.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:25.120
And I found out pretty
quickly that in 1930, she

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.420
had made records for the
Paramount Recording Company

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.700
in Grafton, Wisconsin.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.310
She recorded a lot
of blues singers,

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:37.500
mostly from Mississippi,
but from elsewhere, too

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.140
in the late '20s and early '30s.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:45.770
And she had recorded by herself
and with a partner named Elvie

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:50.850
Thomas, E-L-V-I-E Thomas.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.330
And they had made
records together.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.940
Elvie Thomas made one
under her own name.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.100
Geeshie Wiey made three
under her own name.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.730
Some were Geeshie and Elvie.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:04.800
And what you found
out almost immediately

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.720
if you began to try
and dig into this

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.290
was that nobody knew
anything about these people

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:13.590
at all-- absolutely nothing.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.050
You can presume because
their names and their records

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:22.040
and their voices that two
people, at least who were

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.340
calling themselves
by these names,

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.232
existed at this point
in time in 1930.

00:28:29.232 --> 00:28:31.280
But that's all there was.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.310
There was nothing.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.450
Nobody knew the real
names of these people,

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.470
because Geeshie
is not a real name

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.210
and Elvie is not a real name.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.590
Those are nicknames.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.580
Nobody knew where
they were from.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.520
Nobody knew when they were born.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.450
Nobody knew when they died,
presuming that they had.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.910
Nobody knew anything,
absolutely nothing.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:57.820
These were the ultimate
phantoms of American art.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.790
And this is a song that
captivated hundreds

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.510
and thousands of people.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:09.060
And blues researchers
began to search the south.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.210
And some had been
searching for a lot

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:18.640
long before this song appeared
in Terry Zwigoff's movie.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.460
And no one had found
out anything at all.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.400
It was a mystery
beyond mysteries.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.440
Who are these people?

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.610
How did they come
to be recorded?

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.090
How did a song this
singular, this strange,

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:36.300
this ghostly and spooky
and threatening, beautiful

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.190
and captivating-- how did a
song like this come to be?

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.720
Who could create this song?

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.750
And long before there
were any answers--

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:52.040
and there are answers now,
because a writer named

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:58.200
John Jeremiah Sullivan spent
three, four years doing

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.180
research of extraordinary
ambition and reach,

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:08.810
which essentially meant
finding the greatest living

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:12.830
authority on early blues,
a man named Mack McCormick,

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:18.150
who lived in Houston-- recently
died-- going to visit him,

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:22.250
asking if he knew anything
about these people.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:25.170
And having him
say, well, in fact,

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:31.810
he interviewed Elvie Thomas in
1961 in Houston where he lived.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.220
He had heard about this
person who he'd never

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.060
heard of himself, had
never heard her records,

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.060
didn't really know
anything about her.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.020
But he had heard from
another blues singer

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.990
that there was an old blues
singer living in Houston.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.030
She had made some
records, and maybe she

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:49.360
was the sort of person
he'd want to talk to.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.290
And he had gone to talk to her.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.050
Well, that was 1961.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.870
That was a long time ago.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.850
And he had the
interview somewhere.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:00.970
He always transcribed his
notes immediately and always

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.460
wrote up a transcript.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.060
He had it somewhere.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.760
But he said, I live with
what I call the monster.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:13.250
And the monster was
his entire house

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.680
filed according to
an arcane system

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.090
that nobody could
ever understand

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.360
of books, of
records, of articles

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.090
of his own research, his own
transcripts, his own files,

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:30.410
hundreds of thousands
and tens of thousands

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:39.920
of artifacts in a kind of
Augean stables of research.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.430
And he said, I don't
where that might be,

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:47.580
but I do remember
talking to her.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.950
So here is the Rosetta
stone, but I'll never

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:53.650
be able to find it.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:58.920
So with a couple of
hints that Sullivan

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.220
was able to get
from McCormick, he

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.200
began to go through
census records

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.570
and police records and
trial records in Houston

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.140
starting around 1900.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.400
Ultimately, over several
years and over the discovery

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.780
of the transcript of
this interview, which

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.500
included the details of
this person's real name,

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.680
Geeshie Wiley's real name,
when this person, Elvie Thomas,

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.640
was born, and many other
details, including the fact

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.890
that while she was
born in Houston,

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:38.410
while she grew up in Houston,
lived there her adult life,

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:43.590
in her 40s, she came to
San Francisco in 1939,

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.710
and she worked for the
key railroad, which

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.660
means the streetcar system.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.980
And she was here
until the late '40s

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.400
when she went back to Houston.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.790
Turned out she was born in 1891.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.960
And one of the strangest
and most evocative things

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.100
that she said in the interview
she did in 1961-- when

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.190
she had become religious,
she looked upon blues

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.370
as her sinful days.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.060
She didn't want
to talk about it.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.540
She was a different person then.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.220
She hadn't found the Lord then,
who she called the master.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.350
But now I serve the master.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:22.000
I don't do that sort
of thing anymore.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.170
But she was born in 1891.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.170
And she said that
she learned how

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:32.590
to play blues guitar when
she was 11 years old, which

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.840
is to say in 1902.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.980
And she said there
were blues even then.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.500
In other words, Mack
McCormick had found a person,

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.100
and now John Jeremiah Sullivan,
reading the transcripts

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.720
of this interview,
had found a person

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.690
who remembered when there
was no such thing as blues.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:59.740
She could say yes, I remember
when there were blues, which

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.910
means when I was
seven, when I was six,

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.010
there was no such thing.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:06.440
I had never heard
anything like that before.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.929
No one had heard anything
like that before.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:14.420
This music, in fact,
did appear in the 1890s.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.659
And in a way, it was
something in Texas,

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:19.420
something in
Mississippi, something

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.620
in South Carolina when
someone would report

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:30.120
hearing an eerie, strange,
unearthly, unhealthy, evil kind

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.900
of music where there wasn't
singing, there was moaning,

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.900
and there weren't
notes on the guitar

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.929
so much as smears and slurs.

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:40.730
And what is this?

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.409
Where did it come from?

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:45.520
This is not white folklorists
from Harvard University

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.880
coming down to the south and
saying, oh, this is so strange.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.679
What is it?

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:52.400
This is people like
W.E.B. Du Bois.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.150
This is people like W.C.
Handy, the so-called father

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.280
of the blues.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.340
These are African Americans
who are Southerners

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.320
who are being confronted
with his music and saying,

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.510
this is not of this Earth.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:12.420
This is like what
we just listened to.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:17.010
So John Sullivan
was able to find out

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:20.640
when Elvie Thomas was born.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.440
He was able to
reconstruct her life.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.170
And this took years.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:30.090
And it involved meeting people
who were members of the church

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:32.760
that she belonged
to, talking to people

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.970
who knew her, talking
to her pastor,

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.730
reconstructing her life.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:40.390
One of the things
he found out was

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:45.450
that she was a lifelong lesbian,
that she lived with a woman

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:53.370
most of her life who was her
wife except under the law.

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:54.770
She never wore dresses.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.130
She only wore pants.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:02.630
He found out what brand
of cigarettes she rolled.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.450
He was able to find out a lot.

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:08.620
And about Geeshie Wiley, he was
able to find out her real name,

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.190
Lilly Mae, Lilly Mae Wiley.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:15.000
He was able to find out where
she was born-- in Louisiana--

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.830
when she was born, in
1908, and that they

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:25.090
had become musical
partners in around 1928,

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:29.680
1929 when Geeshie
Wiley was only 20

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:34.160
and Elvie Thomas would have
been in her late 30s, a really

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.100
unusual partnership.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:41.580
And they traveled together
in 1930 to Wisconsin

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.940
to make records.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.610
And then they disappeared.

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:49.190
And what Sullivan
was not able to do

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:54.540
was to find out what happened
to Geeshie Wiley after 1931.

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.780
He found out that
in 1931, she had

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.560
been arrested for
killing her ex-husband,

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.960
for stabbing him in the neck.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.330
And he was not able
to find out anything

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:06.171
that happened after that.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.140
Was there a trial?

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.370
Was she convicted?

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:12.760
Did she go to prison?

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.010
Was she acquitted?

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.090
Was the case thrown out?

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:16.960
Nothing.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.160
And she disappears after that.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:26.470
In the interview that
Elvie Thomas gave in 1961,

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:34.910
she says I heard she was in
Oklahoma about five, six, seven

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.910
years ago in Oklahoma.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:39.830
That would have been
in the early '50s.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.910
But that was all she knew.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.650
And she wasn't even
sure about that.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:47.180
So she disappeared again.

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:50.100
And when I was talking
with John Sullivan--

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.590
because we consulted
back and forth all

00:37:52.590 --> 00:38:00.170
through this research of his,
mainly because 20 years ago,

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.310
I wrote a piece for
a magazine called

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:06.430
"Oxford American" about the
song that we just listened to.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:09.080
And I tried to
talk about the fact

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.720
that it wasn't just the mystery
of nobody knowing anything

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:20.240
about these people
that was interesting.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:23.640
What was more interesting
was the mystery in the song.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.570
The song itself was a mystery.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.430
Anyway, it turned
out the fact checker

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:32.890
they assigned to this article
was John Jeremiah Sullivan.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:36.780
So years later, when the
bug of this song bit him,

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:43.710
he got in touch, and we began
to bat ideas back and forth.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:51.650
And he was not able to find out
anything about her after that.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:54.610
And he just mentioned,
I don't even

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.880
know when and where she died.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:02.380
And then he said, if she died,
he said she'd be 106 today.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.870
It's possible.

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:07.080
It's possible that she's alive.

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.820
It's possible that
in 1994, somebody

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:14.640
said to her-- when she was
an old woman-- said to her,

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.000
I saw this movie, and they
played your song in it.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.470
Maybe she went to see the movie.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.270
You begin to
fantasize about this.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.180
Right about this time,
I was telling my wife

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:30.240
about the call I had just
had with John Sullivan.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.726
And she said,
that's interesting.

00:39:32.726 --> 00:39:35.580
Our doctor, who she
had just been to see,

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.820
mentioned that
his oldest patient

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.950
was a black woman who was 106.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:43.950
And light bulbs are
going off like crazy.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.610
Oh my god.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.080
Here in-- he's a
Berkeley doctor,

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.930
but Elvie Thomas
was in San Francisco

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:54.800
for 10 years in the 1940s.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.980
Why shouldn't she
end up in Berkeley?

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.700
So I called him.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:06.590
And I said, your patient--
you have a patient who's 106.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.986
He said, yeah, Bertha Johnson.

00:40:08.986 --> 00:40:11.410
Oh, OK, Bertha Johnson.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:12.740
He said, why do you ask?

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:13.440
And I told him.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.220
And he said, oh, that's not her.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.541
He said, but she did sing
with Louis Armstrong.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:28.000
The jokes history plays on us.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.570
And yet what is so
fascinating about this song,

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:34.240
particularly looking
for authorless songs,

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.860
songs that just seem to be part
of the landscape, that just

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:44.340
seem to emerge from it, is that
here is a song with a melody

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.850
that nobody recognizes
played in a minor key, which

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:53.520
was completely
uncharacteristic of blues,

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:59.630
and with lines in it that come
from countless other songs that

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:03.670
are just generic-- they're the
essence of what it means to be

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:10.210
a commonplace song-- that you
quote from some other song,

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:15.550
lines like-- and maybe you
caught it-- my mother told me.

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:19.710
Now, in blues, there's
only one time when

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.940
your mother tells you anything.

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.769
She doesn't tell you when
you're about to get married.

00:41:25.769 --> 00:41:28.310
She doesn't tell you when you're
about to leave home and seek

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.460
your fortune.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:34.730
Your mother only tells you
something just before she died.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.170
And that's the way
this line goes.

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:40.500
My mother told me,
just before she died.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.110
There's another verse when she
mentions the Mississippi River.

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:47.580
And again, in blues and
in old country music,

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.820
when you mention the
Mississippi River,

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.390
there's something you have
to say about the Mississippi

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:53.460
River.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.730
You have to say
it's deep and wide.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.410
And after you've said
the Mississippi River,

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.510
you know it's deep
and wide, then

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.830
you can go say
something of your own

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:07.170
if you have the
imagination to do that.

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:09.950
So it has these elements.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:11.510
I went to the depot.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.390
I looked up at the sun.

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:16.680
That's from hundreds of songs.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.960
And what comes after
that-- and one song goes,

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.470
I went to the depot.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.160
I looked up at the sun.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.670
Sometimes, it's the
sign telling you when

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.950
the trains are going to arrive.

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:30.880
In one song, it says,
I went to the depot.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.250
I looked up at the sign.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:37.041
It said good times here,
but better down the road.

00:42:37.041 --> 00:42:37.540
OK.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.900
That's interesting.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.130
When Geeshie Wiley sings the
line I went to the depot,

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:46.440
I looked up at the sun,
said train don't come,

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.590
going to be some walking done.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:52.030
Just something she
wanted to put in there.

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.620
That's what she put in.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.760
But there are also
lines in this song

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.190
that have never appeared
as far as anybody

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:04.040
has been able to find in any
other song, or for that matter,

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:09.160
in a poem or a novel
anywhere, lines

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:14.820
that seem as if they had to
come from one person at one time

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:19.700
only-- from this woman in
Geeshie Wiley, and that was it.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:24.225
Because no one else had ever
come up with these images.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:33.530
And then there were variations
on commonplace verses

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:40.650
that again were twisted and
distorted so that they would

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:43.310
create an aura, they
would create a mood,

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.410
they'd create an atmosphere
that was different,

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.970
that was complete,
that was total,

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:52.490
and an atmosphere of death.

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:58.610
It starts out the last kind
words I hear my daddy say.

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:03.080
Lord, the last kind words
I hear my daddy say.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.070
That's the whole first verse.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.460
It sets you up.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:07.680
All right.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.950
What are they?

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:11.810
What did he say?

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:17.700
He says something that, again,
no one had ever heard before.

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:25.750
He says, if I die, if I
die in the German war,

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:30.083
I want you to send my body--
send it to my mother-in-law.

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:34.380
It's hard to understand.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.040
The words aren't
altogether clear.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.670
But when I first
heard that, I thought,

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:41.820
this is the ultimate
mother-in-law joke,

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.485
or else he really loved
his mother-in-law.

00:44:48.465 --> 00:44:52.500
And also, it's very spooky
for us listening today.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.640
If I die, if I die in the German
war-- this is recorded in 1930.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.260
She doesn't know there's going
to be another German war.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.540
So it unsettles time for us.

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:09.610
It turns it into a
wheel, makes it spin.

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:13.540
And then the next verse is
so brilliantly constructed.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.140
And I'll play the song again.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.530
Listen to the way she
takes a single syllable.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:23.250
Most often, it's the word "I,"
but it doesn't have to be.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:27.190
But she takes a single
syllable or a phoneme,

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.630
and she stretches
it out all the way

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:33.440
across what for any other
singer would be an entire line.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.680
And she just holds
that note in the air

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.840
until you're so captivated by
the sound that she's making,

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.610
you may forget to even hear
what words she's singing.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:45.400
Because it doesn't matter.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.920
Because the atmosphere of death
that she is creating around

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.640
this song in every single
verse and every note

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.320
is so complete that you
don't need words to explain

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.420
to you what the song is about.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:04.470
The next verse is if I get
killed, if I get killed.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.050
And she has constructed
this so perfectly.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:11.630
If she were to say if I get
killed, if I get killed,

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:15.420
it would take the weight--
it would take the impact away

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.850
from the word killed.

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:20.630
Because the word "if" has its
own body, has its own strength.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:25.020
But she dispenses with the
I. He says, if I get killed,

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:25.740
if I get killed.

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.240
You got a very soft
opening, and then

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:33.070
a hard consonant, the k--
if I get killed, killed.

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:39.270
So kill comes across-- if I
get killed, if I get killed.

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:41.800
And then again, she goes
off into an area where

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:46.210
no one's ever been before-- if
I get killed, if I get killed,

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:48.760
please don't bury my soul.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.760
Just leave me out.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:54.970
Let the buzzards eat me whole.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:55.730
All right.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:57.700
OK.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:02.790
That goes back thousands
and thousands of years

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:08.890
to when early settlements,
Neolithic settlements in Turkey

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:14.170
and other places, their form
of burial was to take the dead,

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:17.330
leave them outside the
walls of the settlement,

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:20.330
let the buzzards
pick the bones clean,

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:25.250
and only then dispose of the
bones in a ritualistic manner

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.040
that we would recognize.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.040
That's what people did.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.060
And that goes back.

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:34.180
Whether that is a
human race memory, what

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.780
Hume would call a
collective memory,

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.010
whether it's a story that
she was told in her childhood

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:44.200
that passed down over
the centuries, who knows.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:48.850
But in any case, it's there, and
it's never appeared in any song

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:50.590
that anybody knows.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:53.960
But she can pull the string.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.650
When she gets to the verse
the Mississippi River,

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:01.450
you know it's deep and
wide, the conventional way

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:10.390
to finish that verse is to
say I can stand right here

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:13.880
and see my baby
on the other side.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:18.020
See, Mississippi River,
it's deep and wide,

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:21.900
but I love my baby so much
that I can stand here,

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.440
and I can see her
on the other side,

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.010
because my heart is
filled with love,

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.580
and it's giving me
extraordinary eyesight,

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:32.210
and I can see all the way
across the Mississippi River.

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:35.730
And that's not what she says.

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:42.120
And this is a woman of
a mind that isn't ours,

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.510
that is hers, who thinks
differently than we do,

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.150
who sees things
differently than we do.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:51.020
She says, I can
stand right here,

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:54.630
see my face from the other side.

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:56.520
That is stranger.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.660
She is standing here.

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.680
She sees her face on the
other side of the river,

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.180
but she is seeing her
face from the other side

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.720
of the river, which means
she's in two places at once

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.641
and seeing her own face all
the way across the Mississippi

00:49:10.641 --> 00:49:11.140
River.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.850
And that destabilizes the song.

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:17.510
That opens up a trap
door in the song.

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:21.180
And she follows it
with the next verse.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:25.160
What you do to me, baby,
it never gets out of me.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.900
And that couplet may have
appeared in other blues songs.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.150
I've never heard it.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:33.680
It's just a moment of
extraordinary warmth,

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:34.540
tenderness.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.000
It's incredibly erotic.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:43.040
It's just this blessing right
there in the first two lines

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.270
of the song.

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:51.530
And she says, I may not see you
when I cross the deep blue sea.

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:53.320
The deep blue sea--
again, talking

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:58.130
about codings and blues-- the
deep blue sea means death.

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:00.400
When you cross
the deep blue sea,

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.900
you are going to the other side.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:06.490
You are going to die.

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:10.960
And you're supposed to
say I know I'll see you

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.420
when I cross the deep blue sea.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:17.960
And it's so mandated
in the nature of blues

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.220
that any number of people who
have transcribed this song

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.400
and put the lyrics
up on the internet

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.370
say I know I'll see you when
I cross the deep blue sea.

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:28.690
That's what she ought to say.

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:31.550
It just isn't what she says.

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:35.540
Everybody in this
song has to be dead.

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:39.090
The last kind words
I hear my daddy say.

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:41.885
In blues, daddy usually
means lover or husband.

00:50:41.885 --> 00:50:43.340
It doesn't mean father.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.480
But it could mean father here.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.450
My mother, just before she died.

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.980
I can see my face
on the other side.

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.350
I'm already dead.

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:56.730
I may not see you when I
cross the deep blue sea.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:51:01.790
Everybody in this song is
dead, including the singer.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:08.080
And if you listen-- if you
allow yourself to be taken in

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.350
by her guitar solos at
the beginning of the song

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:14.065
and in the middle-- you
will hear that same sense

00:51:14.065 --> 00:51:17.830
of foreboding, that same
sense of completeness

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:22.590
that you could get in a short
story by Nathaniel Hawthorne,

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:31.230
like "The Minister's Black
Veil" or "Goodman Brown."

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:32.110
That's what you hear.

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:35.280
You hear the American
Gothic, the sense of curse,

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.670
the sense of deviltry.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.370
So I want to play this
song one more time and talk

00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:42.774
a little more about it.

00:51:42.774 --> 00:51:46.260
[MUSIC - GEESHIE WILEY, "LAST
 KIND WORDS BLUES"]

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.320
It was a privilege being
able to talk with you today.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.560
Thank you for coming.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.610
