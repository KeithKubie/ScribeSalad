JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Please--

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.229
please make your
way over here.

00:03:13.113 --> 00:03:14.050
Come on guys.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.020
You don't want to miss out.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.515
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:17.515 --> 00:03:18.014
Come up.

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:19.264
Come up here.

00:06:52.584 --> 00:06:53.582
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Are
you guys ready?

00:06:53.582 --> 00:06:56.077
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah.

00:06:56.077 --> 00:06:57.075
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:06:57.075 --> 00:06:58.910
We're going to start
here in a second.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.390
We have a live audience
tonight.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.780
So say hello to the people
on the internet.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.266
AUDIENCE: [CHEERS]

00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:07.182
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Hello, people.

00:07:07.182 --> 00:07:09.126
Thank you very much
for coming.

00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:12.916
We're going to roll a short
pre-roll for folks on the

00:07:12.916 --> 00:07:17.000
internet and officially kick
off this broadcast.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.620
Operator, roll it.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.050
MALE SPEAKER: It will be just
a thee-minute delay.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.242
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So there
is pre-roll rolling.

00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:30.014
Are you guys tired,
participants?

00:07:30.014 --> 00:07:31.938
AUDIENCE: No.

00:07:31.938 --> 00:07:33.570
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Everybody has a

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.450
beverage of their choice?

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.992
The bar is still open.

00:07:37.992 --> 00:07:38.914
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:07:38.914 --> 00:07:39.840
MALE SPEAKER: You're up.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.450
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.990
Well, good evening, everyone.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.925
Welcome to YouTube Developers
Live from Los Angeles today.

00:07:45.925 --> 00:07:48.250
We have an exciting show
for you today.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.485
We are reporting live from
Google Offices in beautiful

00:07:51.485 --> 00:07:53.550
Venice, California.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.430
And let me tell you a little
bit about this event.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.900
We started Saturday morning
with about 60 people.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.890
Throughout the event, the number
of guests fluctuated.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.120
But we are here in full force.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.210
We have impressive judges
tonight who will be judging

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.690
the entries for our Hackathon.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.570
Let me introduce the judges.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.520
We have Nanea Reeves
from Machinima.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.484
How are you doing?

00:08:19.484 --> 00:08:19.966
NANEA REEVES: Good, thank you.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:24.304
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you
very much for coming.

00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:26.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.450
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Then George
Strompolos from Fullscreen.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.660
How you doing, George?

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.606
GEORGE STROMPOLOS:
Doing very well.

00:08:30.606 --> 00:08:32.025
It's good to be here.

00:08:32.025 --> 00:08:34.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.534
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And Paul
Carff from Google.

00:08:36.534 --> 00:08:37.209
How are you doing, Paul?

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:38.929
PAUL CARFF: Good, thanks.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.767
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:43.659
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All
right, thank you.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.995
And then I have Krispy
with me here.

00:08:46.995 --> 00:08:48.300
KRISPY: Woo!

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.824
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:50.824 --> 00:08:52.880
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Krispy's going
to help the contestants

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.040
get their demos working.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.050
He's an extremely fast
developer, so he fan fix

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.270
last-minute bugs in your
code before you

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.366
even know they existed.

00:09:00.366 --> 00:09:00.842
Right?

00:09:00.842 --> 00:09:02.930
KRISPY: Yeah, it costs a
lot per line, though.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.670
So before we start, we were
going to play a short video

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.890
for you to kind of summarize
what has happened over the

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:19.714
last 48 hours, and also give
people watching us live a

00:09:19.714 --> 00:09:23.642
preview of how the work that
these awesome teams have put

00:09:23.642 --> 00:09:25.028
together came about.

00:09:25.028 --> 00:09:27.603
So let us try to
roll the video.

00:09:27.603 --> 00:09:28.865
Krispy edited this.

00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:29.872
KRISPY: Where is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:29.872 --> 00:09:31.122
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Right
on that spot.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.640
KRISPY: All right, so
this I just sort of

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.320
hacked together myself.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.530
Many of you remember
me walking around

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.230
with a camera today.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.820
So this is the short version.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.095
We have a longer one
coming later.

00:10:02.885 --> 00:10:04.881
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:04.881 --> 00:11:17.236
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:17.236 --> 00:11:20.230
-We're here to help you, answer
your questions, so that

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.558
this becomes a fairly enjoyable
event and you guys

00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:24.222
can walk away feeling that
you've accomplished something.

00:11:24.222 --> 00:11:26.717
-This is my desk.

00:11:26.717 --> 00:11:28.713
-People ask me whether
this is a real photo.

00:11:28.713 --> 00:11:34.368
And the answer is, it
is a real photo of

00:11:34.368 --> 00:11:35.699
me with a fake sign.

00:11:35.699 --> 00:11:37.196
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:40.190
-It's 166,000 years
of television

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.645
watched in a single day.

00:11:41.645 --> 00:11:44.706
-We don't want any conflict
between us and Google and

00:11:44.706 --> 00:11:47.341
their advertisement, because
our app has to do with

00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:50.933
enhancing the user interface
while you're watching content

00:11:50.933 --> 00:11:52.450
through your Google TV.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.003
-You ready for another exciting
day of hacking?

00:11:54.003 --> 00:11:54.910
-Yes.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.100
-Good.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.362
-As ready as ever.

00:11:57.362 --> 00:12:02.376
-It's a cool hackathon combining
YouTube and Google

00:12:02.376 --> 00:12:03.566
TV technologies.

00:12:03.566 --> 00:12:07.110
It welcomed everyone,
talked a little bit.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.687
And folks are putting up all
their ideas, and teams are

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:10.764
trying to form.

00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:14.462
And we're looking forward to one
hell of an event tonight.

00:12:14.462 --> 00:12:15.938
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:22.334 --> 00:12:26.570
KRISPY: Oh, we don't have a
projector, so lucky us.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.345
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Occasionally
our projectors decide that

00:12:28.345 --> 00:12:30.650
it's time to power down.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.470
So this was one of
those times.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.830
KRISPY: KS Monkey
strikes again.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:34.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We'll
bring them back up.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.354
KRISPY: I don't even
have a mic.

00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:36.723
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
The mic is out.

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:37.590
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
the mic is out.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.240
KRISPY: So this will
take two minutes.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.120
The internet thinks something
crazy is going

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.080
on right now, OK?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.330
They're freaking out.

00:12:48.722 --> 00:12:51.194
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So they
typically shut down at the

00:12:51.194 --> 00:12:53.002
least-opportune moment.

00:12:53.002 --> 00:12:55.944
And what is this all called?

00:12:55.944 --> 00:12:56.918
AUDIENCE: Murphy's Law.

00:12:56.918 --> 00:12:57.892
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Murphy's
Law, all right.

00:12:57.892 --> 00:13:00.327
We have some developers
who know.

00:13:00.327 --> 00:13:02.275
AUDIENCE: In front
of your screen.

00:13:02.275 --> 00:13:02.762
KRISPY: Yes.

00:13:02.762 --> 00:13:04.830
It says, "please wait while
the projector powers down.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.830
This will take approximately
two minutes." And I have no

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.942
other options.

00:13:08.942 --> 00:13:10.290
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: This is
a very simple system.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.112
KRISPY: So we know that the
demo gods are in the house

00:13:12.112 --> 00:13:18.880
tonight, because if this
is happening to me,

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.040
I pity all of you.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.670
All right, we'll get
this sorted out.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.180
I guess while we're waiting,
who wants to call out their

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.782
favorite moment of
this weekend?

00:13:30.782 --> 00:13:31.734
AUDIENCE: In-N-Out.

00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:32.686
KRISPY: In-N-Out Burger?

00:13:32.686 --> 00:13:34.270
You guys like the food?

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.728
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:35.728 --> 00:13:37.186
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:37.186 --> 00:13:39.040
KRISPY: Who at the
most burgers?

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.170
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.028
KRISPY: Four burgers?

00:13:42.028 --> 00:13:45.311
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:46.250
KRISPY: Hungry man.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:50.410
I best you had pizza afterwards,
too, right?

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.880
OK, so I guess we got
a little dead time.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.410
I don't really know
what to do.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.374
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, so for
those of you that have just

00:13:58.374 --> 00:14:00.664
joined us, I wanted to give you
a brief introduction of

00:14:00.664 --> 00:14:02.793
what it is that Nexus
7 actually uses.

00:14:02.793 --> 00:14:07.220
So in this course of this
hackathon, we have been using

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.142
various Google technologies.

00:14:09.142 --> 00:14:12.094
YouTube has recently released
several new APIs.

00:14:12.094 --> 00:14:17.506
So YouTube Data API V3, Player
API, Analytics API.

00:14:17.506 --> 00:14:20.950
And the content stands have
actually been using them for

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.630
these beautiful applications
that hopefully

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.990
will all work shortly.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:31.380
In addition to that, we were
using Google TV boxes,

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.340
sponsored by the
Google TV team.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.810
Paul works on that team.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.660
Thank you very much, Paul.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.628
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:43.100
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Your credit
card is due shortly.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.380
So we have quite a few Google
TV demos as well.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.840
I wanted to make one note.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.290
Krispy actually edited
this video.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.200
And it made me realize that
he has extremely good

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.952
video-editing skills, because
I could never do something

00:14:56.952 --> 00:14:58.430
like this, Krispy.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.990
KRISPY: It's a hobby of mine.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.210
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And that makes
me a little worried,

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.025
because I know our judges
represent companies that I

00:15:05.025 --> 00:15:07.058
actually have done business,
and they are hiring.

00:15:10.022 --> 00:15:11.504
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:11.504 --> 00:15:14.962
AUDIENCE: I have a recruiter
here, Kim.

00:15:14.962 --> 00:15:17.926
Kim, where are you?

00:15:17.926 --> 00:15:19.902
She's got a Machinima
t-shirt on.

00:15:19.902 --> 00:15:22.866
So if you're interested,
we have [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:22.866 --> 00:15:42.160
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.564
KRISPY: All right, we've
almost got this sorted.

00:15:43.564 --> 00:15:45.552
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
we got the audio back.

00:15:45.552 --> 00:15:46.546
Video's coming back.

00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:48.037
Shortly.

00:15:48.037 --> 00:15:49.528
Already up.

00:15:49.528 --> 00:15:52.013
Yes, and YouTube
is also hiring.

00:15:52.013 --> 00:15:54.995
We are right here
in Santa Monica.

00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:58.540
To find out more, go to
developers.google.com/jobs for

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.261
develop relations jobs, and
google.com/jobs for Google

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:03.247
opportunities.

00:16:03.247 --> 00:16:05.465
We also have catalogs
out here that can

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.191
help you with questions.

00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:11.974
So let us now talk about the
logistics for tonight.

00:16:11.974 --> 00:16:15.172
As I mentioned, we have a lot
of different interesting

00:16:15.172 --> 00:16:19.100
applications built with several
YouTube and Google TV

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.082
technologies.

00:16:20.082 --> 00:16:23.028
Each team will have five
minutes-- three minutes for

00:16:23.028 --> 00:16:24.501
demo and pitch.

00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:26.956
You'll be pitching to
our awesome judges.

00:16:26.956 --> 00:16:28.920
And do your best.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.357
Then the others will have about
two minutes for Q&amp;A,

00:16:32.357 --> 00:16:34.321
after which we transfer
to the next team.

00:16:34.321 --> 00:16:35.985
We have about 14 teams.

00:16:35.985 --> 00:16:36.775
We had 15.

00:16:36.775 --> 00:16:40.170
One team had to bail out
at the last minute.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:46.475
Their UI developer wasn't able
to make it, but they made

00:16:46.475 --> 00:16:48.420
excellent progress
on the back end.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.430
And they have also
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.580
So I just wanted a round of
applause to the team that

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.596
almost made it.

00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:57.254
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:57.254 --> 00:17:00.360
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And
let's get started.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.416
So we're going to go in
the order that we

00:17:03.416 --> 00:17:05.850
have shared with you.

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.730
KRISPY: Team number one.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.700
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Please come up.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.840
KRISPY: The YouTube
Social mashup.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:22.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.760
KRISPY: And do we have an
official clock-timer?

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.646
Or shall I do that?

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:29.550
All right.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.245
MALE SPEAKER: So how many
mics are there?

00:17:31.245 --> 00:17:32.500
KRISPY: There is one.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.012
Well, if somebody wants to stand
at the podium, you can

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:35.140
use that mic, too.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.100
MALE SPEAKER: That's cool.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.140
MALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.312
We've had a great
weekend so far.

00:17:39.312 --> 00:17:40.790
We're YouTube Social.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.100
MALE SPEAKER: I'm not
disconnecting anything.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.475
MALE SPEAKER: And we've been
hacking away for a

00:17:44.475 --> 00:17:45.425
bunch of hours now.

00:17:45.425 --> 00:17:47.830
And some of us slept,
some didn't.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:53.210
YouTube Social is all about
current trending topics and

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:57.110
content that's posted
on YouTube.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:03.160
MALE SPEAKER: So YouTube Social
allows you to check out

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.560
the latest trending videos being
posted on Google+ and

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.790
Twitter right now.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.090
You can watch it right
from your television.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.810
Just click Play and
start watching.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:18.140
Otherwise, we also have a
search API, or a search

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.360
feature, that's currently
being looked for.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.300
And you can search for your
latest interests, any subject

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.675
you want to search on, and it'll
return those results

00:18:30.675 --> 00:18:34.580
that are being posted right
now on Twitter, Google+.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.990
You can search for your favorite
artists or superstar,

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.580
and you'll get what people are
compelled to post about that

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.375
right now, all the
videos live.

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:50.230
You can even continue to come
back and get the latest

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.078
results every time
you come back.

00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:55.046
We're good?

00:18:55.046 --> 00:18:57.070
We're gonna show off
some searching.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.012
MALE SPEAKER: OK, showing it?

00:19:04.012 --> 00:19:05.440
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.450
So again, you play, switch out
the videos, you'll get that

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:15.230
information of who tweeted
or Google+ information.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.645
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:17.645 --> 00:19:20.410
MALE SPEAKER: Sweet.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.660
Someone else.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.550
And before we find something we
don't want to, let's check

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.600
out the search feature.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.216
Strongbob.

00:19:37.216 --> 00:19:39.184
Spongebob, there we go.

00:19:39.184 --> 00:19:40.660
What's this guy selling?

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.152
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:41.152 --> 00:19:42.628
-What's with all that yelling?

00:19:42.628 --> 00:19:46.564
You just can't wait for
me to die, can you?

00:19:46.564 --> 00:19:47.384
-They're selling chocolate.

00:19:47.384 --> 00:19:47.548
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:47.548 --> 00:19:50.008
MALE SPEAKER: I think we're
good with that.

00:19:50.008 --> 00:19:52.468
Keep searching.

00:19:52.468 --> 00:19:54.878
MALE SPEAKER: How about
them Lakers?

00:19:54.878 --> 00:19:55.836
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:55.836 --> 00:19:57.086
MALE SPEAKER: What
you got, Lakers?

00:19:59.668 --> 00:20:00.150
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:04.046
-How about [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:04.046 --> 00:20:04.544
tonight.

00:20:04.544 --> 00:20:07.034
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:07.034 --> 00:20:08.528
from LeBron James.

00:20:08.528 --> 00:20:12.262
What did he do to get a hug like
that from LeBron just a

00:20:12.262 --> 00:20:12.512
moment ago?

00:20:12.512 --> 00:20:15.002
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:15.002 --> 00:20:15.500
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.750
-[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.000
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.110
MALE SPEAKER: So not only can
you sit at home and follow

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.890
your favorite artists or team or
whatever celebrity that you

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.060
like and see videos that people
are talking about at

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:37.220
real-time, it's completely
multi-screen experience.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:41.070
And on your cell phone, on the
go, or wherever you are, you

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.845
can have it--

00:20:43.845 --> 00:20:45.095
pull it up.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.020
Oh, sorry.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.770
KRISPY: You guys have
30 seconds.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:52.258
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:20:52.258 --> 00:20:54.210
I wanted to show this,
but I can't.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.162
Skip it, please, because
probably going to go slow.

00:21:00.066 --> 00:21:01.930
MALE SPEAKER: We're trying a
new platform, it's pretty

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:02.770
almost responsive.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.330
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so
there's the thing.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:04.840
MALE SPEAKER: It's
a hosted app.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.760
MALE SPEAKER: It's a hosted
app, anywhere on your TV--

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:07.870
KRISPY: 10.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.496
MALE SPEAKER: --one your
computer, on your cell phone,

00:21:09.496 --> 00:21:10.810
everywhere accessible.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:11.610
Thank you so much.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:12.900
And with that, we open
to questions.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.440
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.414
KRISPY: All right.

00:21:14.414 --> 00:21:18.797
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:18.797 --> 00:21:21.130
MALE SPEAKER: We welcome
technical questions.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.976
We might duck and leave,
but we welcome them.

00:21:22.976 --> 00:21:25.030
KRISPY: Team number three, if
you could make your way up at

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:25.690
the same time.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.238
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And any
questions from the judges?

00:21:27.238 --> 00:21:28.763
MALE SPEAKER: Questions,
please, please.

00:21:28.763 --> 00:21:30.615
Get techy, get hardcore.

00:21:30.615 --> 00:21:34.273
PAUL CARFF: Hey guys,
congratulations on getting to

00:21:34.273 --> 00:21:35.980
this point.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.180
I had a question.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.710
As a user, are the videos that
you're returning tied to my

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.252
personal social feeds in any
way, or is it sort of

00:21:45.252 --> 00:21:46.502
generalized?

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.748
MALE SPEAKER: Not currently.

00:21:50.748 --> 00:21:54.050
But we can follow a certain
deal, so for example, certain

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.890
handles or certain hashtags.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.730
But yeah, currently we're not.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.746
Adding that would be
just identification

00:21:59.746 --> 00:22:01.638
and adding your personal--

00:22:01.638 --> 00:22:03.978
MALE SPEAKER: And you have to
sign in through OAuth, either

00:22:03.978 --> 00:22:07.436
through your Google+ account
or via Twitter account.

00:22:07.436 --> 00:22:09.659
And then we'd be able to have
the access to actually show

00:22:09.659 --> 00:22:14.022
you the YouTube content with
people that you know and that

00:22:14.022 --> 00:22:15.340
are close to you are
actually posting.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.304
And you do it out of the luxury
of your living room,

00:22:18.304 --> 00:22:20.114
because many of you don't want
to watch that kind of stuff at

00:22:20.114 --> 00:22:22.584
work, perhaps it's not
professional, you don't want

00:22:22.584 --> 00:22:24.232
to mix personal with work
and that stuff.

00:22:24.232 --> 00:22:27.196
So you might want to come home
and watch the content your

00:22:27.196 --> 00:22:29.680
crowd put online.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.690
NANEA REEVES: Could you explain
how you would make it

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.260
relevant to me?

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.460
MALE SPEAKER: I mean, in the
first place, because you're

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.710
interested in something
you do a search for.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.710
So if you're interested
in football--

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:41.400
NANEA REEVES: So it's all
keyed off the searching.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.840
Would you do any trending
as well?

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.830
MALE SPEAKER: It gets the latest
tweets and Google+s

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.590
right now, like literally the
latest ones right now.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.562
And you can get the
search ones.

00:22:51.562 --> 00:22:54.520
If you don't do any search, then
you just get whatever's

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.510
the latest.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.665
NANEA REEVES: So there's
no delay?

00:22:56.665 --> 00:22:57.471
MALE SPEAKER: There's
no delay.

00:22:57.471 --> 00:22:59.645
It's whatever people are doing
right now and are compelled to

00:22:59.645 --> 00:23:00.611
post on Twitter.

00:23:00.611 --> 00:23:02.540
NANEA REEVES: So it'd actually
be faster than YouTube

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.526
commenting is right now.

00:23:03.526 --> 00:23:04.418
MALE SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:23:04.418 --> 00:23:06.670
MALE SPEAKER: It's actually
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.704
People might be uploading, and
you see the result before the

00:23:08.704 --> 00:23:09.201
upload finishes.

00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:13.180
KRISPY: OK, I'm gonna have
to cut you guys off here.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.615
And, team number three,
where are you?

00:23:14.615 --> 00:23:15.340
We need to get going.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.100
Oh, you're right here?

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:16.360
Great.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.170
KRISPY: And just a reminder to
all the teams presenting

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.940
tonight, please talk into the
microphone so the intertubes

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.000
can hear you.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.860
So do you want me to cue
the URL for you?

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.022
Or who's gonna be here?

00:23:29.022 --> 00:23:29.720
CHARLIE STIGLER: Yeah,
you can start it up.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.610
There's only one person, so
I'll be here for a second,

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.590
then I'll be over there
in a little bit.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.010
Hi.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.140
I'm Charlie Stigler.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.420
I'm the founder of Zaption.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.890
Zaption is a platform
on the web.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:48.310
Pretty much, we let people
collaborate and learn from

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.175
interactive experiences.

00:23:49.175 --> 00:23:55.900
So for example, a teacher who
wants to easily share a

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.580
learning experience with their
students can put together a

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.670
series of videos and different
kinds of questions and

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.500
annotations and share it
with their students.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.690
And it kind of democratizes
learning, because they're able

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.422
to do all of this themselves
without the help

00:24:12.422 --> 00:24:14.590
of large new platforms.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.350
So the problem with that is
that there's not a lot of

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:21.150
money in education, so it's
expensive for them to upload

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.880
their videos to our servers.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.370
And since they had very
low budgets, it was

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.210
impractical for them.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.597
So what I worked on this weekend
is using YouTube as

00:24:30.597 --> 00:24:31.720
our videos host.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:36.300
So it's a seamless upload
experience with YouTube, and

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:40.450
they can actually do everything
without their even

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:45.870
realizing almost that they're
using YouTube.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:50.095
So I'm going to go show
how it works.

00:24:50.095 --> 00:24:54.525
Unfortunately, I have
to type while I'm--

00:24:54.525 --> 00:24:55.932
KRISPY: You can [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:55.932 --> 00:24:56.870
CHARLIE STIGLER: Oh, great.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.120
Thanks.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.570
So this is what how I can create
one of these video

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:04.520
experiences.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.890
So let's say we want to create
the experience in biology.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:13.960
So we can just go over here
and pull in some clips.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.170
So we can pull in clips
from YouTube.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.920
For example, We could say,
search YouTube for biology,

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.600
and pull in some interesting
videos, just drag and drop

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.300
them into our [? tour ?]
from YouTube.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.510
We also upload directly
from YouTube.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:32.300
So we could just click Upload
and store videos from our

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.274
computer, for example--

00:25:34.274 --> 00:25:37.570
well, I'd have to
log in, but--

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.770
onto YouTube.

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.330
And then once we have our
videos, we want to add some

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:42.960
interactions.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.180
We could go over here and drag
a text slide in and just edit

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.350
that in place-- say, OK,
watch this video.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.305
And then maybe we'd want to,
say, ask them a question.

00:25:53.305 --> 00:25:56.790
So we can drag in a multiple
choice question and say, what

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:02.320
kind of biology is this,
this kind or that kind?

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.060
So we just easily put in all
these interactive elements.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:12.570
And then we can publish it, and
all of this shows up as

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:15.400
they're going.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.900
And it asks them the questions
as they pop up.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.960
And of course we also offer
analytics for the [? tour ?]

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.070
owner, for the person who's
creating the experiences, to

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.880
see what did their
viewers respond.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.794
Did their students respond
well to these questions?

00:26:29.794 --> 00:26:32.214
KRISPY: Your time is up.

00:26:32.214 --> 00:26:37.538
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:37.538 --> 00:26:38.022
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Well done.

00:26:38.022 --> 00:26:39.960
Got any questions
from the judges?

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.900
NANEA REEVES: Yes.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.540
So this was an existing product
that you integrated

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.520
YouTube in, essentially
as a CDM.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.020
CHARLIE STIGLER: Yeah, so that's
the interesting part.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.670
Again, it existed.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:54.400
But the new part is that YouTube
now is pretty much our

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.610
entire back-end.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.260
We use almost no YouTube
interface elements-- in fact,

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.540
absolutely zero.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.242
But all the back-end hosting,
and we use the player API, the

00:27:05.242 --> 00:27:07.600
data API, the browser-based
upload API, and

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.843
the uploader widget.

00:27:08.843 --> 00:27:12.740
NANEA REEVES: So would you
monetize through YouTube then?

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.170
CHARLIE STIGLER: We could
monetize through YouTube.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.920
More likely we'd sell the
product, probably going to

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.200
sell it to, like, a school
board or an enterprise

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.830
organization that wants
to use it, rather than

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.050
monetizing via ads.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.505
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: It
looks really nice.

00:27:27.505 --> 00:27:28.710
Congratulations.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:29.515
CHARLIE STIGLER: Thanks.

00:27:29.515 --> 00:27:30.500
GEORGE STROMPOLOS:
I had a question.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.145
Are you using the in-out time
codes of YouTube videos?

00:27:34.145 --> 00:27:36.860
I notice a lot of times, when
people put YouTube videos in

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.257
sequence, you kind of
only want to show a

00:27:38.257 --> 00:27:39.320
snippet of it, not--

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.820
CHARLIE STIGLER: Actually,
yeah, we don't use--

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.170
the problem, we can't YouTube's
feature, because the

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.560
way that we loaded videos
dynamically, YouTube doesn't

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.780
support that yet.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.420
That's probably how
we're gonna do it.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.370
Currently we fake it.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.350
Oh yeah, we do that
exact same thing.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.380
We just can't use the YouTube
feature for it right now,

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.860
because the API doesn't
work for that.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.410
PAUL CARFF: What was the most
challenging part of

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.850
integrating this in
this weekend?

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.140
CHARLIE STIGLER: Actually, there
was a really difficult

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.240
part with trying to get the
video upload to work without

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.990
the page refreshing, because
it turns out that's almost

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.680
completely not supported, to
post a video using YouTube's

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.570
browser-based uploads and
have it not reload.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:18.180
But I found a way by hiding a
hidden iFrame inside the page

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:22.150
and all this crazy stuff, so
that everything just keeps

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.590
going page-- in fact, if you
just wait, the videos will

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.860
process, and you can drive them
straight in the media

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:28.740
after uploading them.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.920
NANEA REEVES: Are you using
the data API at all?

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.710
CHARLIE STIGLER: Yeah, we used
the data API to search for

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.630
videos, pull in information,
and tell when videos are

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.900
encoded or processed.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.960
Yeah, I think we used every
YouTube API, actually.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.945
KRISPY: All right, that's
your two minutes.

00:28:43.945 --> 00:28:44.862
Can I have the next team up?

00:28:44.862 --> 00:28:45.806
CHARLIE STIGLER: Thank you.

00:28:45.806 --> 00:28:47.694
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:47.694 --> 00:28:50.530
KRISPY: Thank you very much.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.900
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
And next team.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.880
KRISPY: Team number
four, Video Wars.

00:28:57.104 --> 00:29:00.200
All right, your time
starts now.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:00.920
MALE SPEAKER: Hello,
Venice Beach.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.869
How are you?

00:29:02.869 --> 00:29:04.761
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:04.761 --> 00:29:05.710
MALE SPEAKER: What's
your team name?

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.580
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, we're
good to go.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.032
MALE SPEAKER: What
did we land on?

00:29:09.032 --> 00:29:09.520
BattleTube?

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.610
MALE SPEAKER: BattleTube.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.764
I'm supposed to throw out there,
our team is from all

00:29:13.764 --> 00:29:14.550
over the country, came

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:16.075
together here at his hackathon.

00:29:16.075 --> 00:29:17.940
And it's pretty cool.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:22.080
Thank you, guys, for putting
this on for us.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:27.590
Somebody told me that people
were uploading 72 hours of

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.820
video per minute to YouTube.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.010
We looked into that.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.970
We found that about 38 minutes
of that was cat videos.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.550
And we just started asking
ourselves, what can we do with

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.650
the rest of that that's
interesting?

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.940
More seriously, though, a lot
of people come online, they

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.785
watch a lot of videos one after
the other of things that

00:29:44.785 --> 00:29:45.370
they're interested in.

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:49.280
Those are cat videos, car
videos, music videos, other

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.210
people playing video
games, you name it.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.480
And they find these by
the normal ways.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.100
They look at what's most
shared, most viewed.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.820
And that's cool.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.570
You find good stuff.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.202
But those lists are
just reinforcing.

00:30:00.202 --> 00:30:03.920
And we wanted to find maybe a
different, better way to rank

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.360
these things.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.290
So say you like cat videos.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.250
You come to our site, you
watch cat videos.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.520
You know what, we're going
to give you two

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.926
of them on one page.

00:30:11.926 --> 00:30:14.190
We're gonna save you a click.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.130
And all we want to know is which
one you think is better

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.340
between these two.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.590
So someone comes to our site,
they watch, they vote.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:22.810
We're gonna store that.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.670
We're gonna analyze
this data and make

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:28.170
our own leader boards.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.650
We have some categories
we populated.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:33.600
Of course you can
add your own.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.175
And I don't know, we think
this is fun cool.

00:30:37.175 --> 00:30:37.960
Oh, he's adding one now.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.075
That's great.

00:30:39.075 --> 00:30:40.190
What do we got here?

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.170
Someone throw something out.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:42.882
AUDIENCE: Penguins.

00:30:42.882 --> 00:30:44.205
MALE SPEAKER: Penguin's great.

00:30:44.205 --> 00:30:46.820
Thank you.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.467
We'll just let the app
speak for a minute.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.800
Oh, that looks like
a great one.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.644
I like it already.

00:30:56.644 --> 00:30:58.333
All right, that's my
vote right there.

00:30:58.333 --> 00:30:59.299
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:59.299 --> 00:31:01.231
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:01.231 --> 00:31:01.720
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.420
MALE SPEAKER: All right, cool.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.280
So this is fun.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.480
People can spend some
time on this.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.780
But we also think it has
a pretty cool business

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.200
application, which we'll tell
you about in a minute.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.170
But first, let's just talk
a little bit more about

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:12.570
what the app does.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.250
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, so
we're integrated with

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.310
mostly the data API.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:20.580
You can add videos, both by
putting in YouTube channel,

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.200
you can enter a playlist, or
you can just enter a search

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.570
term and it'll automatically
grab the

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.380
videos related to that.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.370
And then if you actually go
into the analytics for a

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:33.470
video, we're using the charts
API, showing the actual

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.880
battles that have happened,
and how

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.610
well a video is rating.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.376
So those are the APIs
we're using.

00:31:41.376 --> 00:31:43.920
And there's this application.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: So for example,
say I'm searching for

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:50.550
the next country singer, the
next-best country singer.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:53.770
And so I have a bunch of
people upload their own

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.220
talents on YouTube.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.260
But I want to know who is the
best, not the one with the

00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.900
most Twitter followers,
not the one

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.720
with the most Facebook--

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.968
KRISPY: OK, your time is up.

00:32:04.968 --> 00:32:05.966
MALE SPEAKER: That sucks.

00:32:05.966 --> 00:32:07.463
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:07.463 --> 00:32:09.459
KRISPY: I had to stop
you somehow.

00:32:09.459 --> 00:32:10.457
All right, so--

00:32:10.457 --> 00:32:11.460
MALE SPEAKER: That's a
good way to do it.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.600
KRISPY: --we've got questions
from the judges for the next

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.850
two minutes.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.835
PAUL CARFF: So a really
cool, fun concept.

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:19.070
It would be fun to use.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.000
It would be fun to
see the results.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.530
Where do you see it going?

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.230
How could something
like this evolve?

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:29.180
And maybe to sort of tip you
off on that, if you've seen

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.000
Hunch, which is a really cool
application which makes you

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.070
make simple A-B decisions,
they've been able to extract a

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.200
lot of interesting data
and interest graphs.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.630
So where do you see this
potentially going?

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: So as I was
going to say, it'd be good to

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.470
be used for, say, market
research, because, for

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:46.610
example, these two videos
are randomized.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.930
So you can't just pick and
choose, oh, I know that my

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.855
friend is in this one, so
without looking at any of the

00:32:51.855 --> 00:32:53.310
other options, I'm gonna
choose this one.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.080
So it forces you to choose
between two.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.740
And then because of the
algorithm, all of them appear

00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.600
the same amount of time.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.382
So in the end, you come
up with a very, very

00:33:02.382 --> 00:33:05.301
wholesome data set.

00:33:05.301 --> 00:33:10.080
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I think
auditions, talent agencies,

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.280
and research are--

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.240
that's how we would
love to see this

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.490
maybe make some money.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.190
But also the consumer
side, just for fun.

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:20.410
We want to help people
waste time.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:24.900
NANEA REEVES: I believe that
this moment is the provider on

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.470
YouTube that does the
video battles.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.314
Is that accurate?

00:33:30.314 --> 00:33:31.700
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: It is.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.460
NANEA REEVES: Yeah.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.250
OK, I certainly would be
interested in accessing the

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.930
leader boards from a recruiting

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.580
standpoint for new channels.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.440
And as you said, looking
for new talent.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.200
So I think there's a
good idea there.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.870
And I also liked your
presentation a lot.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:47.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank
you so much.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.490
NANEA REEVES: Mm-hm.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.422
Nice to see a lady
up there, too.

00:33:50.422 --> 00:33:56.086
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:56.086 --> 00:33:57.360
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
thank you very much.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.106
Thanks.

00:33:58.106 --> 00:33:59.356
Team number five.

00:34:05.346 --> 00:34:07.761
KRISPY: Team number five
to the podium.

00:34:07.761 --> 00:34:11.630
Team number five.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.290
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, guys,
how's it going?

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:13.600
We're [INAUDIBLE] hackers.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.060
My name's [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.360
JACOB: I'm Jacob.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.280
MALE SPEAKER: And this
is the app that we

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.020
decided to build today.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.940
So this is Wally.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.429
Pretty much it's a YouTube video
wall, as you can see.

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:30.460
Jacob, why don't you go ahead
and search for, like, Japan

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.110
earthquake.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:37.590
So pretty much we looked at
YouTube and we thought, how

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:38.969
could we make this better?

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:43.104
And we thought that the search,
it was cool, but we

00:34:43.104 --> 00:34:45.380
thought we can make
this cooler.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.000
When you look at Google Images
search or something like that,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.445
you see all the images
side by side.

00:34:50.445 --> 00:34:51.830
You can compare them
really easily.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.949
So we thought we would do the
same thing for videos.

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:58.060
And we're pretty proud of our
result, with what we came up

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.960
with in a little bit
more than 24 hours.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.490
So you can click on any
video to play it.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.946
Click again to pause it.

00:35:07.946 --> 00:35:09.850
You can play videos
multiple times.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:19.580
So let's say the Japan
earthquake just happened, and

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.230
you want to compare the
videos side by side.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.540
You don't have time to go onto
YouTube and click and go back

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.492
on the browser screen.

00:35:26.492 --> 00:35:28.760
Who has time for that anymore?

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.800
So basically you can
just easily compare

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.210
videos side by side.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.730
JACOB: So one of the interesting
things that we

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.300
found you can do with
it is for music.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.538
So having a bunch of videos from
a certain search term up

00:35:45.538 --> 00:35:47.850
on the wall at the same time
means that you can search

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.250
between them pretty quickly.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.690
So if you type in an artist
that you, like, say, Kanye

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.210
West or Simon &amp; Garfunkel, you
can actually do both of them

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.110
at the same time.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.422
You'll get a wall which can
function as a playlist.

00:35:58.422 --> 00:35:59.960
And you can do different--

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.960
it's also really nice having
multiple search terms, because

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.057
that way you can sort of
increase the bandwidth of

00:36:13.057 --> 00:36:15.460
things you're looking
for at once.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:19.330
And another thing that's nice
about it is video-searching.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.140
A lot of the times when there's
a new event that comes

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.670
up, you want to know
a lot about it.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:26.050
And usually one video doesn't
have all of the information

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:27.350
you're looking for.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.425
So you can see a bunch of videos
and search between them

00:36:29.425 --> 00:36:31.365
if one doesn't look like it has
what you're looking for.

00:36:35.245 --> 00:36:38.224
Just give it a few seconds.

00:36:38.224 --> 00:36:39.474
Sorry.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:51.311
And it also supports up to,
actually, three terms at once.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.900
So you can see it interweaves
the different results from--

00:36:58.900 --> 00:36:59.650
oh.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.705
Oh yeah, Kanye West and Simon--
oh, that's just Simon

00:37:01.705 --> 00:37:03.050
&amp; Garfunkel.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:06.225
So you can play it,
and it's nice.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.442
MALE SPEAKER: Do we have
any suggestions for

00:37:11.442 --> 00:37:12.202
stuff to try to search?

00:37:12.202 --> 00:37:13.678
KRISPY: OK, that's time.

00:37:13.678 --> 00:37:15.646
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, that's time.

00:37:15.646 --> 00:37:16.630
OK.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.106
JACOB: Cool, thank you.

00:37:18.106 --> 00:37:23.026
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:23.026 --> 00:37:24.645
PAUL CARFF: I think
it's kind of fun.

00:37:24.645 --> 00:37:27.280
I had a party at my house a
little while back, and we got

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:27.620
YouTube going.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.324
And we had to do one
YouTube at a time.

00:37:29.324 --> 00:37:32.640
And now I don't have to
do one at a time.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.000
I don't know what's gonna happen
when I have too many

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.340
beers going on.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.910
So the question I have is, which
API did you find the

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:42.660
easiest to use on this?

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.850
MALE SPEAKER: We used the
Data API for search.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:50.180
And we used the Player API
for embedding videos.

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.530
And if you want to talk
about the Player API.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:57.170
JACOB: Yeah, the Player API,
at first we had some issues

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.450
with the iFrame API, because
it would actually steal on

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:00.530
mouseover events.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.640
And so we had to add buffers
on the side so that it

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.402
wouldn't steal the--

00:38:04.402 --> 00:38:06.531
mouses on the left of the screen
starts going to the

00:38:06.531 --> 00:38:07.513
left thing.

00:38:07.513 --> 00:38:12.620
And after that, it actually
started working pretty well.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.670
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, the Data
API we thought was really

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:16.050
straightforward.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.615
It was really easy to just get
a search and compile the

00:38:19.615 --> 00:38:21.750
results back.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.450
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: Why the
decision to do horizontal

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:26.850
scroll, as opposed to
vertical scroll?

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.010
MALE SPEAKER: Horizontal
scroll, I feel

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.350
like it's more intuitive.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.660
We did have the idea to try to
include vertical scroll, but

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.280
unfortunately we didn't have
enough time for that.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:38.470
So that could be a future idea
that we could implement.

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:39.910
NANEA REEVES: I like
the horizontal UI.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:42.840
I thought it was really good
for TV formats as well.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.190
It'd be interesting to see if
you had a play-through feature

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:49.150
also that would lend itself to
large screens, where one video

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:52.640
would just play in sequence
if I selected one.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:57.290
I was wondering, would you be
able to add a layer where we

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.240
could, on a mouseover,
look at the info

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.858
associated with the video?

00:39:02.858 --> 00:39:04.270
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.180
We haven't implemented it yet,
but I think that would be

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.380
doable with the YouTube API.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.750
We were thinking of doing a
mouseover, where you could see

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:11.630
the description.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.230
NANEA REEVES: Right, I think
that would be cool.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:16.760
And then also, there's a site
called [? Polywar ?], where

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.193
they have all these filters
that you can drill down.

00:39:19.193 --> 00:39:21.840
And I think YouTube search also
has it on the images.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:25.360
It'd be interesting to see what
the video version of that

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.340
is so I could start filtering
creatively.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:31.640
And I think that would allow
for a lot of expression.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.450
I liked it.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.250
I thought it was really
cool for the

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.815
amount of time you had.

00:39:35.815 --> 00:39:36.210
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks..

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.674
KRISPY: All right, that's
two minutes.

00:39:37.674 --> 00:39:38.897
Thanks.

00:39:38.897 --> 00:39:40.364
Next team, please.

00:39:40.364 --> 00:39:41.831
[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:41.831 --> 00:39:43.787
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.530
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Team six,
team six, ready for you.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.780
All right.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.880
MALE SPEAKER: Which page do you
want to-- oh, can you get

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.130
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.170
We're good.

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:10.640
MICHAEL: Hi, I'm Michael.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.150
We're part of team Castem.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.030
We built a YouTube talent app.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:19.920
So imagine you're a casting
director and you need to find

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.110
talent for Survivor,
for example.

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.330
Casting directors will look
at thousands, if not up to

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:28.210
10,000, potential talents
to cast for the show.

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.740
In fact, it's such a big burden
for them that the

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.640
budget is up to half a million
dollars to cast for the show.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.540
Now, imagine your talent, you
have to drive around town, go

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:41.250
to a casting call, waste half
your day for the likelihood of

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:41.940
not being selected.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.400
So there's gotta be
a better way.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.557
So why not use the best platform
on the planet for

00:40:46.557 --> 00:40:48.552
this, which is YouTube?

00:40:48.552 --> 00:40:51.570
You can use YouTube not only to
find talent for the casting

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:53.530
directors, but to audition
as well.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.260
And that's what we've
done with our

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.280
hack for it this weekend.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.680
We've implemented five
APIs to find the

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.686
talent and then to audition.

00:41:05.686 --> 00:41:07.183
And then--

00:41:07.183 --> 00:41:11.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.340
MICHAEL: And this is the
demo of the app.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.663
MALE SPEAKER: Is this on?

00:41:17.663 --> 00:41:18.430
MICHAEL: Cool.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.520
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so what we're
doing here is emulating

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.390
a casting director.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:24.040
And I'm going to start
by searching for a

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:24.900
certain type of talent.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.140
And we found that paries are
young, interesting people

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.690
doing song rip-offs and
things like that.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.430
So I'm gonna do that search.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:36.920
And what this is going to do
is use the Freebase API to

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.660
basically do a search
that is categorical.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:44.480
So it's possible for me to
refine and narrow and to

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.760
actually that I want
parodies of a

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.650
composition, musical type.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.870
That can be really helpful
for a casting director.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:52.260
The other thing you'll see here,
though, is that there's

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.210
subcategories of TV programs.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:58.250
Maybe I want to exclude things
from Mad TV or Deal or no Deal

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.560
or various locations from
the search results.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.640
And as I go through this, I see
this is more user-based

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.900
than video-based, like you see
in other examples tonight.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.760
We're looking for specific
talent, like Hassan Hassar.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.710
And we're trying to find out if
he's actually featured in

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:13.820
his content.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.690
So we look a little bit at his
likes and his subscribers,

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.520
things like that.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.280
But we've got little four
thumbnails here.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.250
And sometimes I match up the
thumbnail of his account

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.140
profile with the clips
that he has.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.360
And then I can find out if he's
actually a real person of

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.400
interest for me.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.000
And then I can go and
communicate with him.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.860
So the other part of that loop
has to do with going and

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.655
finding a specific person
and communicating.

00:42:34.655 --> 00:42:37.050
This happens to be Keith,
my partner.

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:39.220
I'm interested in him, so
I'm gonna contact him.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.550
That's going to pop up a box
here that gives me some

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:44.640
suggested text that I can use in
my communication with him.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.950
When I go and log in, I can then
paste that in there, send

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:51.020
him that message, and he'll
get a link to an addition.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.600
That addition is here.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.800
And what we have is some basic
information that we collect.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.860
We go onto the next page.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.450
And this addition happens
to be a recording.

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.370
KRISPY: OK, that's time.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.204
MALE SPEAKER: No.

00:43:12.204 --> 00:43:13.330
All right, so--

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:14.320
MALE SPEAKER: Is that time?

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:14.605
Aww.

00:43:14.605 --> 00:43:16.300
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe it'll
run in the background.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:16.770
You can ask questions.

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:17.456
We're out of time.

00:43:17.456 --> 00:43:19.270
MALE SPEAKER: So as part of the
audition, which we didn't

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.445
have time for, is he was going
to sing "Call Me Maybe."

00:43:22.445 --> 00:43:26.248
MALE SPEAKER: I was going
to sing "Call Me Maybe."

00:43:26.248 --> 00:43:27.700
AUDIENCE: Do it, do it.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.540
MALE SPEAKER: If you guys really
want me to, I'll do it,

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.476
otherwise--

00:43:34.476 --> 00:43:35.950
MALE SPEAKER: There it
is, right there.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:39.140
KRISPY: Just remember to talk
into the microphone.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.530
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: So
super interesting.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:42.750
You guys are solving
a real problem.

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:44.690
Talent agents are all
over YouTube.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.600
They don't necessarily know
how to filter through it.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.510
I like that you're attacking
two sides of it, at the

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:54.510
submission angle, which I don't
think we got as much

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:56.710
insight into here, but then
also the reviewing angle.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:58.195
So really cool.

00:43:58.195 --> 00:44:00.175
Congratulations.

00:44:00.175 --> 00:44:02.880
NANEA REEVES: Yeah, I think it's
a great business idea.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.190
And there's a real
need for it.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:07.960
The challenge that I think
you're gonna have is that a

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.490
lot of casting calls have
physical attributes.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.020
You know, male, brown
hair, et cetera.

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.110
How are you gonna solve for
that in the searching?

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:19.050
Because I didn't even see that
addressed in your UI.

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:19.340
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:23.490
A lot of times, the YouTube
search results from Freebase

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:25.150
are tagged with things that
are in the video.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:28.150
And that's being more and more
rich as time goes on.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:30.307
We didn't have a chance to
integrate with Google+, which

00:44:30.307 --> 00:44:32.500
would have given us the
additional characteristics on

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.320
people's profiles.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.920
We've also found that almost
all these people who are

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.490
professional or
semi-professional have Twitter

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:40.060
profiles that expose those
characteristics as well.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.886
So the idea would be we expose
those social traits, like--

00:44:44.886 --> 00:44:45.880
NANEA REEVES: You need
something like

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.510
content ID for people.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.967
MALE SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:44:47.967 --> 00:44:48.881
NANEA REEVES: Right?

00:44:48.881 --> 00:44:50.710
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:52.695
PAUL CARFF: So just curious,
do you guys know each other

00:44:52.695 --> 00:44:54.317
from before here?

00:44:54.317 --> 00:44:55.740
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we do.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:56.230
MALE SPEAKER: We've
worked together

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.765
before on another project.

00:44:57.765 --> 00:44:59.433
MALE SPEAKER: And Howard, who's
over there, raise your

00:44:59.433 --> 00:45:00.495
hand, Howard.

00:45:00.495 --> 00:45:02.320
MALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.290
PAUL CARFF: It's fun to see
people come together at an

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:06.393
event like this that don't know
each other and look at

00:45:06.393 --> 00:45:07.130
the fun things you can do.

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:08.165
And I think you're a good
example of that.

00:45:08.165 --> 00:45:10.020
MALE SPEAKER: But just for
everyone's benefit, this is

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:10.500
all Brian's work, too.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.973
He's the only hacker
on our team, too.

00:45:11.973 --> 00:45:13.937
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:13.937 --> 00:45:15.910
and testing apps.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:17.230
MALE SPEAKER: This is
a one-man job here.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:19.130
MALE SPEAKER: Nice work.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:28.580
KRISPY: OK, let's get team
number seven, YouTube Manager

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:29.830
for force.com.

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:35.120
MATT KAUFMAN: Hi, I'm Matt.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.590
And my cameraman over
here is Mike.

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:40.420
We work for MK Partners, a
Salesforce consulting firm

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.790
based in north Hollywood.

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:45.230
And Monday through Friday,
most of our time is spend

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:48.830
implementing custom apps on
force.com, as well as

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:55.320
integrating with other systems
and platforms, such as Google.

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.870
What we built this weekend--

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:58.610
thank you--

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:02.140
was an integration between
Salesforce and YouTube for

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:07.540
businesses that use Salesforce
to be able to monitor their

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:11.460
YouTube uploads and get the
statistics on them and kind of

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.045
gauge the ROI on their videos.

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.190
And so I'm logging into
Salesforce right now.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.370
And Mike, while we were
talking, just

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.780
took a video of me.

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.940
And I'm his manager here
in Salesforce.

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.590
So I'm going to the Videos tab,
and I'm going to go ahead

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:32.810
and look at the pending
videos.

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:33.650
Let's see what we have here.

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:36.910
This looks like a video
from before.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:38.220
Let me just click on this one.

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.530
And I can approve it.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:42.200
And when I approve it, it's
actually going to change it

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:47.240
from a unlisted video
to a public one.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.850
I can also preview
this video here.

00:46:54.296 --> 00:46:57.750
Let me stop that.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:59.810
Coming down here, he submitted
this for approval earlier.

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:00.950
I'll go ahead and approve it.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:02.710
When he submitted it, I actually
received an email

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:05.590
with a little link, picture,
all that kind of stuff.

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:12.330
Come back here to the Videos tab
again, and I can show you

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.570
some other videos that
we might have.

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:16.910
We've been trying to upload as
many videos as possible.

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:18.330
So I can come here and
see all the different

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:18.985
videos that we may have.

00:47:18.985 --> 00:47:20.300
We actually have 10.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.180
We set up a schedule to run
every hour, to go and query,

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.840
from the data API, the things
like view count, like count,

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.160
et cetera, et cetera.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.380
Let me go ahead and
just pull one up.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.820
Let's see if we can find
this one here.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.540
MICHAEL: Recording demo.

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.520
MATT KAUFMAN: Which one,
recording demo?

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.060
Phone demo?

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:37.950
MICHAEL: No.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:39.810
MATT KAUFMAN: Recording
demo, sorry.

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:41.650
Gotta talk into the mic.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.720
So I'm just gonna do a search
for that one, and I'll find it

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.040
real quick.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:44.310
One second.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.096
There we go.

00:47:45.096 --> 00:47:46.630
Here we go.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:51.360
And what I'm gonna do is, let's
refresh the stats and

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.500
see what happens.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.220
Doesn't look like anyone's
watched it yet.

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.470
Maybe I should watch it.

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:01.700
If we were to go and go ahead
and go to YouTube and like it,

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.500
then we'd be able to record the
likes, a dislike as well,

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.920
comments, and so on
and so forth.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.870
What was the one
we did earlier?

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:12.250
Do you remember?

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:14.090
There we go.

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:16.650
So this one, we've been asking
other people to watch.

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:19.570
And so you can see there,
there's 13 views, one comment,

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.380
and so on and so forth.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.790
And we can actually see it.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:25.733
Here's the link if we want to
go to see more about him.

00:48:25.733 --> 00:48:27.050
We can actually see
that comment.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:29.270
There's the comment
down there.

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:31.990
Wonderful comment by me.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:34.260
Other features, reports and
dashboards are built into the

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.470
force.com platform.

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:38.464
So we can show you
that real quick.

00:48:38.464 --> 00:48:39.714
Here we go.

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:44.260
KRISPY: OK, that's time.

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.708
MATT KAUFMAN: Perfect.

00:48:45.708 --> 00:48:46.192
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:46.192 --> 00:48:47.442
MATT KAUFMAN: Thank you.

00:48:54.904 --> 00:48:56.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Questions
from the judges?

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:57.970
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: Yeah,
I have a question.

00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.860
What would you say is the--
can you give me the

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.030
hypothetical use case?

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:02.815
I can think of four or five.

00:49:02.815 --> 00:49:05.930
But what do you think is the
most straightforward use case.

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:06.210
MATT KAUFMAN: Sure.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.570
So the dashboard's off already,
but some of the

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:13.870
dashboard ones that we had up
there was listed videos by

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.480
owner, tallying up the view
count, the like count, stuff

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.195
like that, so you can actually
see which of the employees in

00:49:18.195 --> 00:49:20.410
your [INAUDIBLE] are better
at making the videos.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:22.145
We also had it based
on category.

00:49:22.145 --> 00:49:23.470
You could have it based
on channel.

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:25.430
Basically any of the data
that we can collect, you

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:26.210
can then see it.

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:27.790
So for our marketing department,
again, the whole

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:30.140
goal was, one of our customers
that already pays for

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:33.000
Salesforce can now manage their
marketing efforts from

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.940
Salesforce, and not just take
a guess, OK, we think that

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.005
people like this video.

00:49:38.005 --> 00:49:40.155
You could actually see it,
report on it, do AP testing,

00:49:40.155 --> 00:49:40.812
things like that.

00:49:40.812 --> 00:49:43.260
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: There's a
big market, too, in real

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.098
estate, and listing agents
having people make videos for

00:49:46.098 --> 00:49:47.076
them so they can sell
their properties.

00:49:47.076 --> 00:49:51.110
I can see that being a really
viable use case as well.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:51.465
MATT KAUFMAN: Sure.

00:49:51.465 --> 00:49:52.205
That'd be great, yeah.

00:49:52.205 --> 00:49:53.510
NANEA REEVES: Yeah,
I like the--

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:56.120
I mean, I can use it at our own
company for some of the

00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.940
video workflow that we have.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:01.810
And would I be able to add more
metadata beyond what is

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.270
coming from the YouTube API?

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:05.640
Because sometimes I think that
way I could customize it, the

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.490
aggregates to my business?

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:08.635
MATT KAUFMAN: Yeah, you could
add to our custom fields to

00:50:08.635 --> 00:50:09.110
the object itself.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:10.364
Plus, you could add child
objects if you

00:50:10.364 --> 00:50:11.272
wanted to as well.

00:50:11.272 --> 00:50:12.370
NANEA REEVES: Yeah, I like it.

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:14.630
I mean, I would buy it as
plug-in to our Salesforce.

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:15.590
MATT KAUFMAN: Oh, you
use Salesforce.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:15.860
OK.

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:16.300
NANEA REEVES: Yeah.

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.695
MATT KAUFMAN: I'll
give you a card.

00:50:17.695 --> 00:50:20.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:20.410
KRISPY: Congratulations.

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:22.380
You made a deal.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.120
PAUL CARFF: Yeah, I think it's
just a good integration, too.

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:24.810
It seemed very seamless.

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:25.875
I was very impressed with that.

00:50:25.875 --> 00:50:26.074
Nice work.

00:50:26.074 --> 00:50:27.565
MICHAEL: Yeah, and it's
mobile-ready too.

00:50:27.565 --> 00:50:30.305
MATT KAUFMAN: Right.

00:50:30.305 --> 00:50:31.270
Great, thank you.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:34.735
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:34.735 --> 00:50:37.640
KRISPY: All right, the
battery's gone.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.962
I think I switched--
oh, there we go.

00:50:38.962 --> 00:50:39.640
That works.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:44.425
All right, so next team, team
number eight, Dare and Do.

00:50:44.425 --> 00:50:45.675
Come on up.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.670
Your time starts now.

00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:59.040
JOEY: Hello, world.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.810
My name is Joey, and we are
Dare and Do, a crossfit

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:02.760
experience.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:06.220
So just by a show of hands, how
many of you actually heard

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.422
of crossfit?

00:51:07.422 --> 00:51:09.310
That's a good number.

00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:11.836
How many of you have actually
tried crossfit?

00:51:11.836 --> 00:51:13.380
OK, it's a little bit smaller.

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:16.260
One of the most intimidating
things about trying something

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.280
new is taking that first step.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.305
Thankfully, we live in
a YouTube world.

00:51:20.305 --> 00:51:25.060
Dare and Do allows our users to
explore, interact, and take

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.200
that first step.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.800
Juan will explain what
that first step is.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:41.480
what our app does is that,
instead of just trying to work

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.446
out on your own, because we all
know it's really boring to

00:51:43.446 --> 00:51:47.834
walk on a treadmill for 45
minutes, what you can do is

00:51:47.834 --> 00:51:50.250
you can compete against
different people.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.970
And all these different blue
marks are people who are ready

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:54.310
to take on certain challenges.

00:51:54.310 --> 00:52:02.070
And if we zoom in over here,
closer to Venice, these are

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:04.360
different challenges
that we have there.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.710
And after they look at the
challenge, the people who can

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:10.600
find the challenge most likely
are going to be the people who

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.780
are going to be on
the mobile app.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.910
And on the mobile app, they
can then at that point go

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:18.520
ahead, zoom in, and they
can take a look

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.870
at the actual challenge.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:23.567
So for example, I'll
demo this to you.

00:52:23.567 --> 00:52:24.817
If you want to take
a look at that.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:31.420
JUAN: So from there, you can
go ahead and zoom in on the

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:32.340
actual challenge.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.930
You can see either what it is
or you can watch the video.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:37.830
So for example, here I made
one where I'm challenging

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:39.960
everybody that walks over there
by the climbing wall to

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.750
do 10 push-ups.

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:47.273
So after this loads, it'll have
the dare that I made, and

00:52:47.273 --> 00:52:48.620
then I'll actually do it.

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.940
So that's why it's
Dare and Do.

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:50.660
So it's very interactive.

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:55.068
It's supposed to get more of a
community involved in working

00:52:55.068 --> 00:52:59.020
out, rather than just working
out on their own.

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.980
JOEY: One thing we did is we did
a little market research.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.690
We went down to Paradiso
Crossfit, and we talked to

00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:04.432
David, the owner.

00:53:04.432 --> 00:53:05.892
And I said, David, have you
ever considered putting a

00:53:05.892 --> 00:53:07.511
Google TV in your gym?

00:53:07.511 --> 00:53:09.820
And he said, no.

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.270
He said, what value is that
gonna add to my customer?

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:14.180
I said, David, have you ever
considered putting one in your

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.290
Venice gym and one in your
Marina Del Ray gym?

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:19.730
That would then allow you to
have a competition between

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:20.390
your two gyms.

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:22.850
So every Friday at 6 o'clock,
you could have an online

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:25.450
competition between your
Venice gym and your

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:26.590
Marina Del Ray gym.

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:29.200
And he said to me, now that is
something that improves my

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.470
customer experience.

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:33.020
So with Dare and Do, what we
are doing is we are taking

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:35.160
crossfit competition
to the next level.

00:53:39.624 --> 00:53:45.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.606
KRISPY: Questions
from the judges?

00:53:47.606 --> 00:53:48.800
PAUL CARFF: I kind
of like this.

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.025
How do I sign up to get
notified of these?

00:53:52.025 --> 00:53:53.296
What's the interaction there?

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:56.014
JUAN: There's a couple
different ways.

00:53:56.014 --> 00:53:58.380
In the first version, it'll
just be exploratory.

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.720
You don't need an account
to log in for right now.

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.430
As you can see, this is a public
map, so you can view

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:05.160
any of this that I did
on a Google Map.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.500
Anybody can do that.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:11.930
Eventually what I'll do is I'll
add in login with your

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:12.975
Google account.

00:54:12.975 --> 00:54:13.990
That's how I'll do it.

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:15.720
And then I'll have
to set up all the

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.890
rest of the user interface.

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:19.700
But I'll enable it to where you
can sign up for specific

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:21.830
notifications, whether it's by
area, whether it's by your

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:23.320
circles, however you want--

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.050
PAUL CARFF: Yeah, I could
imagine if I happened to walk

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:27.400
by the wall that it would know
that I just walked by the wall

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.080
and that one of these
is there.

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:32.306
And then I get an alert on my
phone to tell me, hey, you're

00:54:32.306 --> 00:54:35.720
signed up for this, here's
a Do or Dare, go for it.

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.090
JUAN: Right, so you would
set that one and off.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:39.250
That way you don't get
notifications all day.

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:39.575
JOEY: Yeah.

00:54:39.575 --> 00:54:42.230
And you can send stuff
to circles.

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:45.610
You could have, like, Crossfit
LA, or you could have just

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:48.940
buddies that you want to
challenge, and therefore you

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:50.880
can go as big or as
broad as you want.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.600
And we feel one of the
interesting things about

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:56.450
crossfit is that, in order to
compete in the Olympics, you

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:57.450
have to be verified.

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.710
So you have to have your scores
verified and so forth.

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:01.640
So what we were thinking of is
doing integration where people

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.470
could upload their verifications
online.

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:05.620
So if you're not near a crossfit
gym, you could be

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:07.780
certified to compete.

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:10.580
We also think that we could take
this and the challenge

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:12.040
aspect and apply it to
different verticals.

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.890
So maybe something we could do
in the action sports world.

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:18.230
And so, really, just a way for
people to consume, create, and

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:20.340
curate content.

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:22.060
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: Nice job.

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.940
There are a couple other
products out there in the

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.120
market which do similar
things.

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.778
ibeatyou, recordsetter.com.

00:55:29.778 --> 00:55:31.849
I think what really
differentiates what you guys

00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:33.124
are doing is the integration
with the maps.

00:55:33.124 --> 00:55:35.036
Nice job on that.

00:55:35.036 --> 00:55:38.382
Making it geo-aware is obviously
a huge opportunity.

00:55:38.382 --> 00:55:40.090
You just kind of alluded
to this.

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:43.452
Crossfit seems like one
application, but really any

00:55:43.452 --> 00:55:46.149
competitive or comparison-based
activity, I

00:55:46.149 --> 00:55:48.105
think, if you--

00:55:48.105 --> 00:55:48.594
JUAN: When I first came
up with the idea--

00:55:48.594 --> 00:55:49.572
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: Next
group is ready.

00:55:49.572 --> 00:55:50.061
Yeah?

00:55:50.061 --> 00:55:52.995
JUAN: --I had such a bad idea
of, it was a truth or dare,

00:55:52.995 --> 00:55:54.951
you're going to appear
to do stupid things.

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:56.907
[INAUDIBLE].

00:55:56.907 --> 00:56:00.790
So at first, it was supposed
to be a truth-or-dare type

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.830
app, where kids were gonna do
Jackass-style type things.

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:05.295
But thankfully, the
ladies came in and

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:05.880
said, you know what?

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.895
NANEA REEVES: The Jackass
version would be more popular,

00:56:07.895 --> 00:56:08.600
though, I'm sure.

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:09.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.670
NANEA REEVES: I think that you
might want to consider

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:15.470
building up the platform
and having an open API.

00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:16.340
It's a good idea.

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:20.190
And I think it could lend itself
to a lot of innovation

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:23.055
in the just public space.

00:56:23.055 --> 00:56:24.987
It's kind of interesting.

00:56:24.987 --> 00:56:25.961
KRISPY: OK, that's time.

00:56:25.961 --> 00:56:32.292
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:32.292 --> 00:56:36.250
KRISPY: Team number nine.

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:38.070
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And it's
a Google TV application?

00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:38.930
Is that right, Krispy?

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:39.250
KRISPY: Yes.

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:40.750
So we're switching gears now.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:44.270
We're gonna start looking at a
bunch of applications that run

00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:47.788
on Google TV.

00:56:47.788 --> 00:56:51.724
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:51.724 --> 00:56:53.200
KRISPY: So what was
your app doing?

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.644
We have to look up there,
so direct [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:56.644 --> 00:56:57.136
yourself.

00:56:57.136 --> 00:56:58.120
BRETT STATUM: OK
Well, Raphael.

00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.596
I'm pointing to Raphael
behind you there.

00:56:59.596 --> 00:57:00.955
Hi, welcome.

00:57:00.955 --> 00:57:04.580
My name's Brett Statum, my
teammate Raphael Velasquez.

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:06.360
And we were team number nine.

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.840
The app that we created
is called ToonTube.

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:12.130
So we had a few goals when
we created this app.

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:16.390
Both of us are .net heads, so
we wanted to kind of take a

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:19.050
dive and try doing
some Android.

00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:21.515
We also love the Google TV
devices we got when we walked

00:57:21.515 --> 00:57:23.180
in, so we wanted to
write something we

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:24.530
could run on that.

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:27.376
And we wanted to try and exploit
some of the APIs, the

00:57:27.376 --> 00:57:32.050
search APIs, the player APIs,
that kind of stuff.

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:34.300
So Raphael had a great idea of--
he's got a two-year-old

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.352
son, wanted to be able to create
an app that his son

00:57:36.352 --> 00:57:41.650
could play, either on a tablet
device or up on the Google TV,

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:44.780
and basically get a reward when
he accomplished a task

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:46.870
int he game, get to
watch a video of a

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:48.700
character that he loves.

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:51.670
So we basically came up with
this game, where if he's

00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:54.860
playing on the tablet, he can
tap a character, or if he's

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.110
playing on a Google TV, he click
on the character using

00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:59.330
the TV remote.

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:01.590
So why don't we go ahead
and try to play there.

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:04.450
Now, playing it the TV itself
is a little more.

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:06.900
You can see it's playing down
here on the tablet.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.590
We have some characters bouncing
around on the screen.

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:12.350
Playing on the TV was a little
more difficult coordinating

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:14.955
the mouse interactions there.

00:58:14.955 --> 00:58:17.305
But we've got some characters
just randomly bouncing around

00:58:17.305 --> 00:58:18.900
the screen there.

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.700
And if we go ahead and
click on one of them.

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:21.100
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:23.052
-Everybody, Snuffy, Big Bird.

00:58:23.052 --> 00:58:25.004
Come see what Elmo did.

00:58:25.004 --> 00:58:25.980
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.080
BRETT STATUM: We get
the video to play.

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.270
Now, we know kids have short
attention spans, so we didn't

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:30.920
want the video to play
all the way through.

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:33.405
So we go ahead and cancel the
video after a few seconds and

00:58:33.405 --> 00:58:35.150
then return them back
to the game.

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:36.100
Try to grab one up there.

00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:36.470
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:37.080
-Ready.

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.850
Everybody, Snuffy, Big Bird,
come see what Elmo did.

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:43.120
-Oh, what have you done, Elmo?

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.420
-Well, well, Elmo--

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:44.790
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:58:44.790 --> 00:58:46.220
BRETT STATUM: Oh, there we go.

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:49.090
So anyhow, opportunities for
this, of course right now

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:50.950
we're limited to the characters
we have on screen,

00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:52.680
but you could extend that to
additional characters, maybe

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:57.120
even licensing opportunities,
tying the search APIs to pull

00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:01.200
back videos rated by popularity
relative to that

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:05.955
character, and take
it on from there.

00:59:05.955 --> 00:59:06.945
KRISPY: Are you guys done?

00:59:06.945 --> 00:59:07.440
BRETT STATUM: Yep.

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:07.935
KRISPY: Awesome.

00:59:07.935 --> 00:59:09.420
And now time for questions.

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:10.905
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:10.905 --> 00:59:11.895
KRISPY: All right, judges.

00:59:11.895 --> 00:59:13.145
We'll hand it over to
you for questions.

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:21.296
NANEA REEVES: I think
it's a very cute UI.

00:59:21.296 --> 00:59:24.690
I'm wondering about the
viability of it as it relates

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:28.890
to licensing, and how you
would work with the

00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:30.990
IP owners on it.

00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:32.350
BRETT STATUM: Yeah, so
definitely from a licensing

00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:35.240
perspective, that's a big
question mark out there, of,

00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.190
A, who would want to do that?

00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:38.280
How could they control the
quality of the video that's

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.830
coming back through that?

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:42.780
So that's really digging more
into the search APIs to see

00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:45.580
how tightly we can control
the result set that

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:46.580
comes back from that.

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.820
But if nothing else, stirring it
around and using characters

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.970
that were non-branded,
characters that you create

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:55.672
yourself-- the puppy, the cat,
the dog-- and pulling back

00:59:55.672 --> 00:59:58.278
content-related videos, not so
much character-related videos.

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:04.450
NANEA REEVES: How do you
restrict the content to be

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:06.500
child-safe as well
in the return?

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.625
BRETT STATUM: And that is
definitely an issue

01:00:07.625 --> 01:00:08.160
right now as well.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.040
So what we have right now is
hard-coded videos that are

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:11.500
coming in there.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.850
And that was our biggest concern
there, was ratings are

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:18.320
one part, but it was making sure
that, A, you were getting

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.900
videos that didn't have
advertisements in them that

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.725
you were uncomfortable with your
child seeing, and then

01:00:21.725 --> 01:00:22.572
also the content there.

01:00:22.572 --> 01:00:25.125
So there were a few question
marks around that, being able

01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:26.560
to control that.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.548
Maybe some pre-curated
content through that.

01:00:30.548 --> 01:00:32.440
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: I think you
created something really cool,

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.860
a simple way to discover
and consume content.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:40.090
I think actually programming
sets of videos would be a

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:41.230
really simple way to go.

01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:43.670
I could Imagine our company,
for instance, we have

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:44.560
different verticals.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.080
Kids vertical is one we haven't
attacked, but if we

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.360
had 10 videos we produced here,
it was just an easy way

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.790
for your child to interact with
it, I think that'd be

01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:57.190
fantastic, and a much more
intuitive way than searching

01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:59.064
and browsing through maybe
YouTube sites.

01:00:59.064 --> 01:01:00.555
Very cool, nice job.

01:01:00.555 --> 01:01:02.550
BRETT STATUM: Thank you.

01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:04.420
PAUL CARFF: So you demonstrated
clearly here the

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.647
difference between-- even though
they're both Android,

01:01:06.647 --> 01:01:09.839
it's an Android app-- is the
interface on the TV and an

01:01:09.839 --> 01:01:11.440
interface on a tablet.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.120
And we talked about it
briefly earlier.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.920
So what are your thoughts at
this point about what you

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.804
would do to make the interface
and the TV work given the

01:01:17.804 --> 01:01:18.924
constraints that you have?

01:01:18.924 --> 01:01:20.200
BRETT STATUM: Well, some of the

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.010
difficulties there are the--

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:25.790
well, as a positive on the
Google TV side is the

01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:27.240
diversity of hardware
that you have.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.940
But that makes it difficult for
you as a developer to know

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.940
what that remote has in terms of
an interaction paradigm for

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.130
the end-user there.

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:37.640
When we first started this--
again, we're brand-new to

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.480
Android as well.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.080
So we first had buttons.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.040
And with the remote, you could
easily just step through them.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.840
But that kind of took the
challenge out of the game.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.600
So we decided right now we're
using images, and you have to

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.800
target them with the device.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.376
So an accelerometer-based remote
would be great, where

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:56.450
they didn't have to use the
touch pad, or a mouse that was

01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:59.610
a little more responsive to
the taps would be nice.

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:02.007
But that is definitely a
question mark in terms of

01:02:02.007 --> 01:02:02.110
[INAUDIBLE].

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:03.615
PAUL CARFF: Something that just
came to my mind is, you

01:02:03.615 --> 01:02:05.372
know, you think of a ball, kids
playing with a ball, and

01:02:05.372 --> 01:02:07.210
you could use the D-pad to drive
the ball around to get

01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:08.730
and intersect with it.

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:10.200
BRETT STATUM: Yeah,
definitely.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.180
Good idea.

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:12.710
KRISPY: All right,
that's time.

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:14.129
BRETT STATUM: All right,
thank you.

01:02:14.129 --> 01:02:16.021
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:16.021 --> 01:02:18.710
KRISPY: So next up, we
have the Giggle team.

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:19.940
Where's Giggle?

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.190
Giggle on the way.

01:02:26.347 --> 01:02:28.285
And are you guys doing it on the
Google TV, or are you just

01:02:28.285 --> 01:02:29.535
doing web browser?

01:02:47.767 --> 01:02:48.260
JEN: Hello.

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:51.218
KRISPY: Too soon.

01:02:51.218 --> 01:02:52.697
JEN: OK, I'm gonna go ahead.

01:02:52.697 --> 01:02:54.000
My name is Jen.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:54.615
This is Ryan.

01:02:54.615 --> 01:02:57.545
And we represent Team Giggle.

01:02:57.545 --> 01:03:02.050
I'm a big music fan, and I hate
when I miss shows, either

01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:04.470
because I didn't know the band
was coming, or because I

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:06.810
didn't know I liked that band.

01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:11.300
So we built an application that
mashes up the Songkick

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:15.840
API, which is a data provider
around concert calendars, and

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.800
the YouTube API.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.990
So it allows users to
continuously stream videos to

01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:23.870
see and hear artists who
are coming soon to

01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:26.360
a venue near them.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.560
So Ryan's gonna demonstrate
how this works.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.260
What you do is you run the app,
and you type in where you

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.070
are and what kind of
music you like.

01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:36.130
And then it will continuously
stream these videos, and you

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:39.240
can just watch them.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.640
You can watch videos until
something catches your ear.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.832
You can skip through them if
you don't like something.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:03:55.718 --> 01:03:57.331
JEN: Yeah, that doesn't
work for me either.

01:03:57.331 --> 01:03:57.822
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:03:57.822 --> 01:04:00.277
-What would I-- would I do?

01:04:00.277 --> 01:04:00.768
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:04:00.768 --> 01:04:01.690
JEN: That's kind of cool.

01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:02.450
I don't know, I might
check it out.

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:04.970
So if I see something that I
like, I can click the Buy

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:06.390
Tickets button.

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:08.350
And that provides an
action for me.

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:09.885
I can make plans
for my weekend.

01:04:09.885 --> 01:04:10.210
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:14.566
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:04:14.566 --> 01:04:15.050
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:16.990
JEN: Cool.

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:20.580
So we came together at the
beginning of the weekend.

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.870
None of us had ever met.

01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:26.290
And we tried to build this
application that would create

01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:30.100
awareness around artists and
events and allow you to take

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.460
action on them and get
out in the real

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.380
world and do something.

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:35.940
And I think we succeeded.

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:39.650
Technically how it works,
it's all JavaScript.

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:43.220
First we're calling the Songkick
API, and we're

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:48.520
finding matches for venues and
upcoming events in your town,

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.810
the city that you enter.

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:51.980
And then we're matching that
with the YouTube API and

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:54.190
finding popular videos for those
artists and allow users

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:55.440
to stream them.

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:03.450
So I think that the way that
we would extend this is to

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:07.310
probably add a few more fields
to add a level of granularity

01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:09.360
around maybe your neighborhood,
a venue, an

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.800
artist search.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.520
And there are several
ways that we think

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.990
that it could be monetized.

01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:18.260
One, there's an affiliate
program for Songkick.

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:20.570
So if you're selling tickets
through this app, you buy

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:23.800
tickets, we take
a cut on that.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.910
There's also, I think, an
awesome opportunity for

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:32.040
musicians, labels, managers,
venues to place their content

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.160
here, to sort of promote
their content through

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.410
the app that way.

01:05:41.022 --> 01:05:42.450
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:43.700
JEN: I would definitely
go see that.

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:46.270
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:48.466
JEN: And that's Giggle.

01:05:48.466 --> 01:05:55.920
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.750
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: It's
really cool, guys.

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:58.390
I'm a huge music fan, too.

01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:01.795
I'm always wondering what I'm
gonna go do on Saturday night.

01:06:01.795 --> 01:06:05.424
And if this helped me discover
new bands and quickly buy the

01:06:05.424 --> 01:06:06.850
tickets, I would use
the app for sure.

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:11.240
What did you do to try to
avoid irrelevant videos

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.380
showing up in the results?

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:17.340
JEN: So we found that
there was some

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.900
challenge around genre.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:23.330
Neither of the data services had
really awesome information

01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:25.100
about the genre for a band.

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:27.160
It's just hard to get.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.010
Songkick does this
professionally, and they have

01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:30.450
a really hard time with it.

01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:34.810
On the YouTube side, we had a
challenge around whether we

01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:39.010
wanted to show highest view
count, most recently published

01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:42.480
content, whether we wanted to
show content from official

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.530
channels, fan-generated
content.

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:51.310
What we decided to do was just
search for the keywords and

01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:53.260
show the first video
that showed up.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.070
We did a ton of looking
around.

01:06:55.070 --> 01:06:57.740
And the stuff from the official
channels wasn't

01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:58.840
always the best.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.270
The most recent wasn't
always the best.

01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:02.840
The most, most highest view
count wasn't always the best.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.420
So we decided to go with
the YouTube default.

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.122
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: Did you
restrict results to music and

01:07:08.122 --> 01:07:08.520
entertainment?

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.850
Or are you going for
other categories?

01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:15.520
JEN: So we started by working
with the Freebase API to zone

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.360
in on the music category.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.380
We ran into a little bit of
trouble with it and backed out

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.210
and decided not.

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:25.320
But that would be a great
future enhancement.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.720
NANEA REEVES: I liked
it as well.

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:35.340
And I was wondering, would you
consider possibly allowing

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:40.350
people to embed it on their
blog sites, et cetera?

01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:41.950
A web version of it?

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:42.630
JEN: Sure, why not?

01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:44.346
NANEA REEVES: Yeah.

01:07:44.346 --> 01:07:46.525
I like the fact that you
tie in the commerce to

01:07:46.525 --> 01:07:48.170
it, and it's not--

01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:50.670
they've already stated an
affinity for something.

01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:51.420
It's right there.

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.470
JEN: Yeah, particularly if
we were allowing content

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.965
producers to place their
content, it would still make

01:07:56.965 --> 01:07:58.020
sense for that to be embedded
somewhere else.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:58.780
NANEA REEVES: Yeah,
definitely.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:07:59.500
It's a good idea.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.620
I like it.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:01.440
I like the simplicity of it.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.919
JEN: Thank you.

01:08:02.919 --> 01:08:03.412
KRISPY: OK, next.

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:04.910
PAUL CARFF: OK, I want
this on my phone.

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:07.517
I want to be able to have it
just know where I'm at and

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:09.080
then just start telling
me, hey, there's

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:09.492
stuff there for me.

01:08:09.492 --> 01:08:10.892
I don't want to have to
go look for it, just

01:08:10.892 --> 01:08:12.704
have it tell me.

01:08:12.704 --> 01:08:14.186
KRISPY: All right,
thanks, guys.

01:08:14.186 --> 01:08:15.174
JEN: Thank you.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:17.644
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:17.644 --> 01:08:24.899
KRISPY: OK, team number
11, TVUS.

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:26.271
TVUS coming up.

01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:32.441
MALE SPEAKER: Who's driving?

01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:44.952
KRISPY: OK, time starts now.

01:08:44.952 --> 01:08:46.440
CHERI: Hi, I'm Cheri.

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:49.770
And I'm going to tell you about
a new Google TV app

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:50.950
called TVUS.

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:53.819
It puts the social
back into TV.

01:08:53.819 --> 01:09:00.470
What we have is a program that
embeds a screen into your TV

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.724
while you're watching
anything.

01:09:01.724 --> 01:09:04.750
It can be a TV show, it can
be reading a magazine.

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:07.109
You could be checking
out a game.

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:10.920
It's putting it so that you have
a live streaming image

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.430
with someone, and you're able
to talk to each other, see

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:14.880
each other, and interact.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.689
It's a lot of fun, and
it's really cool.

01:09:21.393 --> 01:09:22.782
MALE SPEAKER: So we
opened the app.

01:09:22.782 --> 01:09:25.850
It's basically, as you can see,
if you have opened the

01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:29.616
Play store, it's basically an
app that will open up a screen

01:09:29.616 --> 01:09:30.790
to a previously loaded video.

01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:31.280
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:31.606
-About a year ago,
we introduced

01:09:31.606 --> 01:09:32.750
something called Hangouts.

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:34.220
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:34.613
MALE SPEAKER: Can you
lower the volume?

01:09:34.613 --> 01:09:34.715
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:09:34.715 --> 01:09:36.932
-In the beginning, people
were using it to just--

01:09:36.932 --> 01:09:36.950
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:39.860
MALE SPEAKER: As you can see,
there's not much UI involved,

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.285
because you want it to
get as [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:42.285 --> 01:09:44.710
as possible to [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:44.710 --> 01:09:44.952
But--

01:09:44.952 --> 01:09:45.195
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:09:45.195 --> 01:09:47.377
--take people on a photo walk
in a Hangout, and all of a

01:09:47.377 --> 01:09:49.075
sudden people were cooking,
dog-training--

01:09:49.075 --> 01:09:49.560
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.530
MALE SPEAKER: There you go.

01:09:50.530 --> 01:09:55.930
And so as you see, the main
novelty and aspect of our idea

01:09:55.930 --> 01:10:01.450
is the ability to overlay
content onto any screen,

01:10:01.450 --> 01:10:04.270
whether it's TV, app, or any
other applications, with the

01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:08.142
size and feature quality
of HD TVs.

01:10:08.142 --> 01:10:10.320
And so what we've done is we've
used the new YouTube

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.918
Android player API to
embed videos into

01:10:14.918 --> 01:10:16.380
our transparent app.

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.403
So you can actually overlay
on top of any app.

01:10:18.403 --> 01:10:22.680
So if I were to open Google
Chrome, and I were to then

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.370
open up this app on top
of that, it would

01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:26.750
still show a video.

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:29.510
And what we've also done
is we've used the

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:30.620
Google Hangouts API.

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:36.000
And using the Hangout On Air
capability, we're allowed to

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.030
show Hangouts, actually,
as if they were

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.920
live-stream YouTube player.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.690
So you can actually interact
with web cam through that.

01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:46.400
And we've done that before,
but for the purpose of the

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.250
demo, we've just gone
with the video.

01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:50.860
But yeah, you can show video
on top of YouTube videos as

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:54.510
well, and the possibilities
really are endless.

01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:59.540
And so in the 30 hours we were
allotted over this hackathon,

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:00.960
we've come up with
this prototype.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.300
And we feel like it's the
foundation for a really big

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:10.310
idea that can be augmented with
a variety of features and

01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:11.780
appealing UX design.

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:16.380
So some of the things we have to
work on now that we felt we

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:19.290
might not have enough time to
implement fully here is

01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:22.640
working on how are we gonna get
multiple people to be able

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.180
to come together in a room to
chat about these, about the

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.720
videos that they're watching,
about the live TV, and connect

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.590
people through our app to see
the same experience on top of

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:35.875
whatever they're viewing through
their Google TVs.

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:41.710
And though it's a small step,
we feel if we do embed more

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:44.020
features, create more features
for it, that it can really--

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:45.500
KRISPY: OK, that's time.

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.464
MALE SPEAKER: --change
how we use TVs.

01:11:46.464 --> 01:11:47.910
KRISPY: Let's pass it
over to the judges.

01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:49.356
Judges, take it away.

01:11:49.356 --> 01:11:54.190
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:54.730
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: Nice work.

01:11:54.730 --> 01:11:56.665
I just wanted to talk about
a practical application.

01:11:56.665 --> 01:11:58.510
So you may have heard
of the Streamys.

01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:02.190
It's sort of like the Oscars
for web series and original

01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:03.210
web content.

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:06.810
It's happening in February,
so next month.

01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:09.390
If people have Oscar parties
at their home, they host

01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:11.038
little parties with their
friends, and they have

01:12:11.038 --> 01:12:14.100
cocktails and things, and they
watch the Oscars together.

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.610
So we've been looking at ways
to have people watch the

01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:21.840
Streamys on a global basis and
be able to host a little party

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.850
and show yourself interacting
with your fans

01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:26.570
and things like that.

01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:29.144
So we would use this.

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:33.100
So very cool, and
nice execution.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:34.350
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:39.510
NANEA REEVES: It kind of reminds
me a party mode on the

01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:43.670
Xbox, which I really like, and I
guess got wiped out with the

01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:44.980
Metro update.

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:50.710
So there definitely is an
audience who wants to trash

01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:52.790
talk during certain events.

01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:56.240
And I think it'd be interesting
to see how you

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.030
could do public versions
of that as well

01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.870
as the private ones.

01:12:59.870 --> 01:13:01.470
I think it's a great idea.

01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:05.060
Is it allowed on--

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:06.310
is this a ToS violation?

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.372
PAUL CARFF: I just want to say,
good persistence on your

01:13:10.372 --> 01:13:13.790
side for figuring out how to do
the overlay, because it is

01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:16.040
a challenge on how
to do that on TV.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.040
I really can't comment on
the other side of it.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.504
You did mention being able
to do a Hangout, though.

01:13:22.504 --> 01:13:24.809
How did you do that?

01:13:24.809 --> 01:13:27.440
MALE SPEAKER: I said there's a
Hangout On Air capability.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.915
And what it's actually doing
is that when you broadcast

01:13:29.915 --> 01:13:32.500
your Hangout, you can just show
people a YouTube link,

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.760
and they're able to see your
Hangout from YouTube, because

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.970
it shows on any YouTube player
like a live stream.

01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:40.530
Like, if you want to view
Swedish House Mafia concert on

01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:41.790
YouTube, and you could
live-stream, it's kind of like

01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:43.080
that, but with [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.660
PAUL CARFF: But your current
version, you weren't

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:46.062
participating in the Hangout,
you were just

01:13:46.062 --> 01:13:47.034
watching the Hangout?

01:13:47.034 --> 01:13:48.660
MALE SPEAKER: No, no, we were
actually participating.

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.065
PAUL CARFF: OK, and where'd
you get the camera?

01:13:50.065 --> 01:13:51.655
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, from any
other Android device.

01:13:51.655 --> 01:13:53.920
So what we were gonna talk about
also is that hopefully

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.715
you can initiate a Hangout
and join from any

01:13:55.715 --> 01:13:56.758
other Android device.

01:13:56.758 --> 01:13:57.704
NANEA REEVES: That's smart.

01:13:57.704 --> 01:13:58.650
I like that.

01:13:58.650 --> 01:13:59.130
KRISPY: OK.

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:00.380
MALE SPEAKER: And some
TVs also have it.

01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:01.890
KRISPY: That's time.

01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:03.683
Please bring the remote.

01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:08.980
Thank you very much.

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:12.300
OK, so team number 12 is
actually gonna go.

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:33.353
Let's take Team of Five,
team number 13.

01:14:33.353 --> 01:14:34.820
MALE SPEAKER: Who's
driving this one?

01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:41.010
KRISPY: OK, your time
starts now.

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:42.670
GEORGE: All right.

01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:43.025
Hello, everybody.

01:14:43.025 --> 01:14:44.190
My name is George.

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:48.810
And the people in my team
are Kenneth, Mandra,

01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:50.640
Prasana, and Sharon.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.550
And we have created
the Swanky app.

01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:56.010
So what is the Swanky app?

01:14:56.010 --> 01:14:59.070
The Swanky app is a smart remote
control that allows

01:14:59.070 --> 01:15:07.120
Google+ users with smartphones
to discover, share, and enjoy

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.550
extra content right in your
phone, tailored to enhance

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:14.310
your Google TV experience.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:21.435
So how many people here have
smartphones or smart tablets?

01:15:21.435 --> 01:15:22.740
Raise your hands.

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:26.230
And how many of you guys
actually use your smartphone

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:29.810
or smart tablet while watching
television to search for

01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:32.150
something that looks interesting
or sounds

01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:33.480
interesting?

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:37.300
So what we have done is we've
created this really cool app

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.380
that we thought it would be
really cool if the app would

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:46.770
know who you are, know what kind
of things you like, and

01:15:46.770 --> 01:15:50.210
pushes all the information
straight into your phone.

01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:53.820
So let's pull up the slides, and
I'll show you guys here on

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.050
this screen what it does.

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:59.090
So as you can see, when you're
watching a video, it displays

01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:02.970
the information right on your
phone, what the title of the

01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:08.030
video is, and the information of
the video, along with other

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:10.690
information that has to do with
the video, like what kind

01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:13.720
of music it was played, what
kind of items they use on the

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.300
video, and where the
video was shot.

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:17.800
But why don't I show
you guys slides.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.815
Let's show you guys how
it actually works.

01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:27.440
So you're sitting on your couch
with your phone, and

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.010
you're watching Google TV and
you start playing the video

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:31.260
that you're watching.

01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:34.970
So can we turn on the--

01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:37.560
OK, so you're watching the
video, and as you're watching,

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.960
it's pushing information.

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.390
And right now, you
can't really see.

01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:44.110
But it's pushing information
right into your phone with the

01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:47.990
title, the information
of the video.

01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:50.790
And from your phone, you can
actually purchase the music

01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:51.770
right from your phone.

01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:53.380
You can download it
in your phone.

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:55.592
Everything is makeable.

01:16:55.592 --> 01:16:58.990
And as you're watching, without
interrupting everyone

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:02.300
else who's watching the same
video, you're getting it

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.100
pushed right to your phone.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:10.270
So you have the capability of
clicking and going to see what

01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:12.840
song is playing, downloading it
to your phone, if there's

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.610
any extra content, like a link
to a Amazon website where you

01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:20.220
can actually purchase, for
instance, for this video, the

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:23.920
sunglasses, it takes you right
to the site in Amazon and you

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.970
can do all your purchases within
your phone without

01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:29.430
affecting everyone else who's
sitting on the couch watching

01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:30.720
the same thing you're
watching.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.360
And because it's connected with
your Google+ account,

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.530
it's tailored to what you like,
because as you like

01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:39.080
things and dislike things, it
starts to learn what kind of

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.890
things you like just from your
social media presence.

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.816
KRISPY: OK, that's time.

01:17:43.816 --> 01:17:45.728
Let's pass it onto judges.

01:17:45.728 --> 01:17:51.470
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:52.796
KRISPY: Judges?

01:17:52.796 --> 01:17:57.410
PAUL CARFF: So I'm curious how
you do the communication.

01:17:57.410 --> 01:18:01.180
How does the application know
that I'm in the room with my

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.712
phone at the time that you're
playing the video that I'm

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:06.220
probably gonna be interested
to send it to me?

01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:08.530
MALE SPEAKER: The way that it
works, it's an app that's on

01:18:08.530 --> 01:18:11.370
your Google TV and on your
phone, and it's synced.

01:18:11.370 --> 01:18:14.310
So whenever you're watching TV,
it recognizes what you're

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:16.300
watching in real time.

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:22.450
And through an app that he
created, Kenneth created, the

01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:26.350
content providers can actually
tag their videos with

01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:28.430
advertisements within
the timelines.

01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:30.800
So as you're watching and as it
starts to play, it starts

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.750
to send you information.

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:33.640
PAUL CARFF: So what was the
protocol that you used to sync

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.890
the two devices?

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.885
MALE SPEAKER: We basically
started off with UDP and

01:18:39.885 --> 01:18:41.560
integrated it on this network.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.060
But we are [INAUDIBLE]
discovery mechanism.

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.910
And I think the way forward
would be the Google

01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:48.160
[? DVD mode. ?]

01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:54.330
GEORGE: We also think that this
app would be great for

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.860
professors and teachers to
use, or how-to videos.

01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:59.150
As you're watching the videos,
instead of clicking or looking

01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:03.340
through what sort of items you
need in order to perform the

01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:07.340
tutorial, it's sent right to
your phone, so you can save it

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.290
as a wish list, or you
can purchase it

01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:10.890
right from your phone.

01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:14.060
NANEA REEVES: I like all of the
thinking that you've done

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:18.140
to connect the experiences, but
I think that there's gonna

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:21.610
be a lot of competition in this
very space, even at the

01:19:21.610 --> 01:19:23.446
platform level, like
SmartGlass.

01:19:23.446 --> 01:19:27.570
And I know a lot of people are
working on dongles that sync

01:19:27.570 --> 01:19:30.140
the two up, like the
player device.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:36.480
And I think the big challenge
for all of these applications

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.000
are going to be user adoption.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.740
What's the value proposition
to me to want to sync this

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:44.540
experience up?

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:47.300
So I like the execution.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:52.460
I think, though, the viability
of the concept might have some

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:52.800
challenges.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.960
So You might want to think
about, what's the one hook

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.700
that'll make it stand out?

01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:00.480
Because I think this is an area
of innovation to come up

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.500
with these multi-screen.

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.840
But we're going to get assaulted
by e-commerce

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.420
buttons everywhere.

01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:07.190
So it's just something
to think about.

01:20:07.190 --> 01:20:10.350
Like, what's the one
hook with that tab?

01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:13.230
KRISPY: OK, we're
over time now.

01:20:13.230 --> 01:20:13.860
Thanks, guys.

01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:18.261
Let's go with team number 14.

01:20:18.261 --> 01:20:21.610
Glassroom, working title, make
your way to the podium now.

01:20:32.926 --> 01:20:33.910
ALI: Is this working?

01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:35.890
Anybody taking a remote?

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:38.010
KRISPY: All right, your
time starts now.

01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:38.190
ALI: OK.

01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:38.710
Well, hey, everyone.

01:20:38.710 --> 01:20:40.900
My name is Ali, and
I'm a teacher.

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:43.680
I'm a high school math teacher,
to be more specific.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.140
And one big problem that me and
my colleagues face every

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.690
day that we always talk about
is the fact that we have

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:51.950
difficulty getting honest
feedback throughout the lesson

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:53.880
as we're teaching
our students.

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.850
And that is why we've decided
to create Glassroom.

01:20:56.850 --> 01:20:59.240
Glassroom is a simple tool that
allows teachers to create

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.680
lesson plans using the YouTube
API, and then use Google TV to

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.825
get good real-time interaction
and feedback from their

01:21:05.825 --> 01:21:07.092
students as they're
giving the lesson.

01:21:07.092 --> 01:21:08.140
So here's a good demo.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:09.995
So I search for math lesson.

01:21:09.995 --> 01:21:11.400
It brings me up a
bunch of videos.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.514
I can just go through, click
whichever ones I want, now it

01:21:14.514 --> 01:21:15.480
gets added to the lesson plan.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.760
I can search for another
thing if I want--

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.570
whatever, algebra-- and
then add those to my

01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:21.120
lesson plan as well.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.500
Now, after this is done,
we get to starting

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:24.527
and playing the video.

01:21:24.527 --> 01:21:26.006
Now, this is where the
feedback aspect

01:21:26.006 --> 01:21:28.380
of it actually starts.

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:30.380
So there's three screens
involved.

01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:32.810
This is the view that
the student gets.

01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:36.000
They can pull this up on a
smartphone, any smartphone, a

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.380
tablet, or a laptop.

01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.190
It's just a unique URL that they
can go there, and it's

01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:40.610
responsive and it works
well in all of them.

01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:45.415
Then there is a second view
that the teacher has that

01:21:45.415 --> 01:21:47.270
gives them this live feedback
from the students.

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:49.790
And a third view, which is
the Google TV itself.

01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:50.580
Now, how it works--

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.818
I actually have this for
you guys here, if you

01:21:52.818 --> 01:21:54.260
want to try it out--

01:21:54.260 --> 01:22:00.670
is as I'm giving the lesson, you
can basically provide live

01:22:00.670 --> 01:22:02.940
feedback by tapping that Review
button that you see

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:05.740
right there, and I can
see the result of it

01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:08.320
happen on my screen.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.940
So when I give the lesson--

01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:11.280
oh, you can see it up there.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.711
So, you guys, as you tap
it, it affects that.

01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:17.110
So after the video is over, I
can look and seem hey, I have

01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:20.540
10 students, and seven of
them requested a review.

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:22.230
Maybe I should do this
again, or maybe

01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:23.030
I'm just a bad teacher.

01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:26.720
But anyway, it's just I need
to redo this lesson.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:30.260
And I can also use the
color-coded aspect of it.

01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:32.710
So I can ask them a multiple
choice question and have them

01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:34.505
all answer and to this
anonymously.

01:22:34.505 --> 01:22:37.760
So they don't have to worry
about impending progress of

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.800
the class, or being a little
bit embarrassed in front of

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:40.795
their friends.

01:22:40.795 --> 01:22:42.830
So that is, in essence, what
Glassroom is about.

01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:44.490
It's about bringing transparency
to the

01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:46.686
relationship between students
and their teacher and creating

01:22:46.686 --> 01:22:49.300
a positive feedback loop
that helps all of them.

01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:52.660
And in the future, we can have
a clog aspect to this, where

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:55.480
you search through and find
other teachers' lesson plans.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:59.740
You can find analytics on when
and where issues popped up for

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.640
students and where they
had difficulties.

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:05.330
And all of this is done using
simply a $99 Google TV, a

01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:08.470
monitor or a TV that anybody
could use, and the devices

01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:09.794
that the students
themselves have.

01:23:09.794 --> 01:23:10.768
Thank you.

01:23:10.768 --> 01:23:17.110
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:19.265
PAUL CARFF: So I work with a
school system of San Diego,

01:23:19.265 --> 01:23:23.287
and one of the things they're
doing is starting to use a lot

01:23:23.287 --> 01:23:25.364
of the, like the Khan Academy,
for example.

01:23:25.364 --> 01:23:28.240
So this is exactly the video
content you're looking for.

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.950
I would really be interested to
see what you'd do with the

01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:35.020
analytics, in the sense of,
you're getting all this

01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:38.290
feedback, you can identify what
the, quote, good videos

01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:41.190
are, and then provide that
feedback to the teachers, or

01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:43.310
even into your products to
say, only recommend these

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.700
videos for them to
select from.

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.040
Very, very interesting idea to
discover the content and

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.625
figure out what's good.

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:51.985
ALI: We actually had the idea
of also giving that to the

01:23:51.985 --> 01:23:54.800
video providers themselves,
possibly giving it to them.

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.050
And I'm sure that's information
they'd want, if

01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:58.470
people keep getting stuck at
certain points throughout

01:23:58.470 --> 01:24:00.715
their video, because we can
even pinpoint where in the

01:24:00.715 --> 01:24:03.340
video they're having
difficulty.

01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:05.670
MALE SPEAKER: And the fact that
the feedback is provided

01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:07.560
anonymous, it makes [INAUDIBLE]
feel comfortable

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:11.517
so that they would provide it
without getting scared, also

01:24:11.517 --> 01:24:14.378
getting honest feedback.

01:24:14.378 --> 01:24:15.940
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: I can see,
like, a bar trivia kind of

01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:18.851
game being built on the same
platform for sure, which I

01:24:18.851 --> 01:24:21.580
would love to play sometime.

01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:24.204
Also, I was wondering if you
guys gave any thought to the

01:24:24.204 --> 01:24:25.172
distraction to students.

01:24:25.172 --> 01:24:28.076
So would it actually be
distracting from the actual

01:24:28.076 --> 01:24:31.222
lesson itself to be looking down
and pushing buttons and

01:24:31.222 --> 01:24:32.795
things like that when you're
supposed to be

01:24:32.795 --> 01:24:34.380
focusing on the lesson?

01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.620
ALI: Well, in my personal
experience, they usually have

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:38.050
their phones to be distracted
anyway, because they're

01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:39.510
texting each other.

01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:41.540
So hopefully this will actually
be better, because

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.530
their phones will be there for
something that's actually

01:24:43.530 --> 01:24:44.835
pertaining to the class,
and they can

01:24:44.835 --> 01:24:45.690
use it for the lesson.

01:24:45.690 --> 01:24:48.300
MALE SPEAKER: And that's why we
kept the UI very minimal.

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:52.280
So they just press one button,
not too much interaction.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.150
NANEA REEVES: I like it.

01:24:53.150 --> 01:24:56.830
And I think you guys get an A
for great presentation and

01:24:56.830 --> 01:25:01.060
clarity, in that I think a lot
of great ideas don't happen

01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:03.220
because they don't know how
to present the idea.

01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:07.585
And so I think you did
a great job on that.

01:25:07.585 --> 01:25:10.010
ALI: You guys can't
keep the phones.

01:25:10.010 --> 01:25:11.465
[LAUGHTER]

01:25:11.465 --> 01:25:12.920
KRISPY: All right,
free phones?

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.315
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:16.315 --> 01:25:19.595
KRISPY: OK, team number 15.

01:25:19.595 --> 01:25:20.710
MALE SPEAKER: I have a
question for George.

01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:23.385
George, does it mean you work
in the video industry, you

01:25:23.385 --> 01:25:25.100
never use your phone while
watching videos?

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:25.850
That's just something you do.

01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:27.332
KRISPY: [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:27.332 --> 01:25:28.814
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: Do
it all the time.

01:25:28.814 --> 01:25:30.064
MALE SPEAKER: OK, thanks.

01:25:32.766 --> 01:25:34.248
KRISPY: Who took my remote?

01:25:37.706 --> 01:25:39.682
Ah, OK, hidden.

01:25:39.682 --> 01:25:40.176
That's great.

01:25:40.176 --> 01:25:41.658
And so those guys.

01:25:46.104 --> 01:25:49.068
Oh, all right.

01:25:49.068 --> 01:25:50.550
NANEA REEVES: Which
one are you guys?

01:26:02.406 --> 01:26:03.656
KRISPY: My bad.

01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:11.500
OK, your time starts now.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:11.760
JORDAN: Hello, everyone.

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.981
My name's Jordan Samora.

01:26:13.981 --> 01:26:15.745
SEAN: I'm Sean.

01:26:15.745 --> 01:26:18.970
JORDAN: And today we're gonna
present to you Vid Socially.

01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:23.200
So there's a current problem
with video-watching right now.

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.370
Video-watching isn't
social at all.

01:26:26.370 --> 01:26:28.475
Video-sharing is social.

01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:30.460
You can share links
on Twitter.

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.360
You can share links
on Facebook.

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.820
But when you're watching the
video, you're really watching

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.400
it by yourself.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.730
It's not a live content.

01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:39.330
It's content that's
been there before.

01:26:39.330 --> 01:26:44.240
So it's kind of like, how do you
get all those past viewers

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:47.110
involved with watching
the video with you?

01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:52.740
What we plan to do is have a
video commenting timeline.

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:56.200
So as a video's playing, people
can come at specific

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:59.180
time points, intentionally when
they wanted their comment

01:26:59.180 --> 01:26:59.695
to be displayed.

01:26:59.695 --> 01:27:03.480
The thing with videos is,
there's only so many different

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.500
emotions during videos.

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:06.390
There's high and low points.

01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:08.810
And this way, you can actually
comment exactly when you

01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:11.585
wanted, and that comment makes
sense to the current video

01:27:11.585 --> 01:27:14.395
playing content.

01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:17.180
See comments kind of pop up
as they come in there.

01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:23.845
SEAN: Yeah, so actually one
example is, Google actually

01:27:23.845 --> 01:27:25.670
has live commenting
for live streams.

01:27:25.670 --> 01:27:27.420
So this live stream right
now is having comments.

01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:31.390
So on the right side, people are
commenting as people are

01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:32.025
presenting this.

01:27:32.025 --> 01:27:34.450
But when you go home, you watch
this, you're not gonna

01:27:34.450 --> 01:27:38.000
know who's commenting about
your presentation.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.220
So with this method we have,
you'll actually be able to

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:43.520
scroll through and look at
where people commented at

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.880
which time in the video in past
videos, so not just live

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.490
videos, but also past videos.

01:27:48.490 --> 01:27:52.360
And so another thing
we have is--

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:55.643
so popular videos have
a lot of comments.

01:27:55.643 --> 01:27:56.845
You wouldn't want just comments

01:27:56.845 --> 01:27:57.450
popping up all the time.

01:27:57.450 --> 01:27:59.580
We want it to be non-intrusive,
which is why it

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.350
slides up very small.

01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:05.360
And we wanted it to work on all
videos, so we could put

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.680
any video in here.

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.930
And then we can actually see
which parts of the video are

01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:09.980
more popular.

01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:11.200
So in this example,
you can see that

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.210
there's three lines here.

01:28:12.210 --> 01:28:13.760
So maybe you just want to skip
to that video to see what

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.137
people are talking about,
because this

01:28:15.137 --> 01:28:16.680
is a very long video.

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:19.476
I'm sure people have seen
this video before.

01:28:19.476 --> 01:28:22.190
So you can actually see what
are people talking about in

01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:22.680
this video.

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:24.921
So you can see where
they developed.

01:28:24.921 --> 01:28:27.045
I think this is the most popular
part of this video, so

01:28:27.045 --> 01:28:31.668
that's one thing that this
application brings.

01:28:31.668 --> 01:28:33.162
Thank you.

01:28:33.162 --> 01:28:40.140
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:41.180
JORDAN: Questions?

01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:42.881
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: I've seen
some folks do this poorly, and

01:28:42.881 --> 01:28:46.250
I think you guys actually did a
really nice execution of it.

01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:49.382
Keeping the single-line
comment, I

01:28:49.382 --> 01:28:51.240
think, is really smart.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:55.500
You could potentially integrate
with the circles G+

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:58.385
API to do it within a close
group of friends.

01:28:58.385 --> 01:28:58.868
Nice job.

01:28:58.868 --> 01:28:59.834
Very cool.

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:02.740
JORDAN: Thanks.

01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.015
NANEA REEVES: I saw this in
another company in Kentucky

01:29:05.015 --> 01:29:06.292
about a year ago.

01:29:06.292 --> 01:29:10.750
And they had actually layered
over the friends commenting,

01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:12.590
which I thought had
a good use case.

01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:15.140
But I haven't seen that
deployed yet.

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:17.670
So I think there's
an opportunity

01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:20.430
here if you move quickly.

01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:23.322
JORDAN: Thanks.

01:29:23.322 --> 01:29:24.286
Thanks, guys.

01:29:24.286 --> 01:29:28.142
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:28.142 --> 01:29:32.540
KRISPY: OK, now we have team
number 12, with a kind of

01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:34.930
unique demo, something we
haven't seen yet tonight.

01:29:34.930 --> 01:29:39.220
So team number 12, please make
your way to the podium.

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:40.910
And don't forget your
remote control.

01:29:53.858 --> 01:29:56.910
MALE SPEAKER: This is the last
presentation, right?

01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:59.320
KRISPY: Yes, you guys do have
the privilege of being the

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.710
last ones to go.

01:30:00.710 --> 01:30:02.410
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
for hanging out.

01:30:02.410 --> 01:30:03.690
Maybe take a deep breath.

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:06.680
I know we've had a long day,
but you guys are great--

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.090
amazing products, creations.

01:30:09.090 --> 01:30:10.990
And now's the time for us.

01:30:15.265 --> 01:30:17.165
KRISPY: So why don't you
describe what you're doing

01:30:17.165 --> 01:30:20.700
while we're seeing things
going on on the screen.

01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:23.930
MALE SPEAKER: We are
cross-platform mobile app

01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:25.722
developers.

01:30:25.722 --> 01:30:30.185
We like playing with phones and
creating games and putting

01:30:30.185 --> 01:30:32.680
phones up into the market,
and just hanging out.

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.200
But anyways, we're ready?

01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:39.310
All right.

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:44.110
By raise of hands,
who here likes to

01:30:44.110 --> 01:30:47.038
chat online with friends?

01:30:47.038 --> 01:30:48.380
OK.

01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:52.262
Now, who here would like their
own personal robot that can

01:30:52.262 --> 01:30:54.490
scope out anything, even
in the most dangerous

01:30:54.490 --> 01:30:56.650
places in the world?

01:30:56.650 --> 01:30:58.610
All right.

01:30:58.610 --> 01:31:02.720
Well, we created the app, Video
Warrior, which is for

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:04.410
you who raised your hands.

01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:08.030
Video Warrior is the ultimate
low-cost video conferencing

01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:11.140
and surveillance system
utilizing Google technology

01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:14.976
systems, YouTube, and Hangout.

01:31:14.976 --> 01:31:19.520
And the Arduino board and our
robot friend, Harvey.

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.750
Here's how it works.

01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:23.510
Open the Android app from
your phone, and

01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:24.890
welcome to Video Warrior.

01:31:32.682 --> 01:31:37.690
All right, so look at that.

01:31:37.690 --> 01:31:41.590
Actually utilizing the camera,
your pretty face or our little

01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:45.130
frame here now is live on
Google TV as a streaming

01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:47.660
YouTube broadcast to your
selected friends.

01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:49.710
The broadcast can be recorded.

01:31:49.710 --> 01:31:54.120
Be the next Simon Cowell and
produce your own YouTube Idol

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:57.235
sing show, where you can view
on Google TV various talents

01:31:57.235 --> 01:32:00.180
singing on Hangout and broadcast
it to the world of

01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:01.860
YouTube users.

01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:02.950
Now here's the cool part.

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:05.490
And you're seeing right now
is the cambot mode, which

01:32:05.490 --> 01:32:09.730
instantly turns your robot into
your own robot who's your

01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:11.030
second set of eyes.

01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:14.740
Use Harvey to help you babysit
while at work by placing our

01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:17.370
robot in the baby's room,
alerting you of a cry and

01:32:17.370 --> 01:32:19.640
perhaps recording their
first word.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:23.060
With the power of Harvey,
Arduino, and Google, we can

01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:26.570
send Harvey to dangerous areas
like nuclear-infested areas to

01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:30.650
scope out any possible lives to
save, watched over Google

01:32:30.650 --> 01:32:35.880
TV, and control Harvey by your
Google remote anywhere with

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.290
internet connection.

01:32:37.290 --> 01:32:39.850
Video Warrior will be a free
download in the Play store and

01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:44.780
other markets for Hangout users
and $49.99 with Harvey.

01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:48.910
Be a great dad, cool friend,
or awesome superhero with

01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:50.185
Video Warrior.

01:32:50.185 --> 01:32:55.950
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:58.176
KRISPY: Judges?

01:32:58.176 --> 01:32:59.300
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: Can you
talk about some of the

01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:00.868
technology behind what
you built here?

01:33:00.868 --> 01:33:02.118
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

01:33:04.212 --> 01:33:07.030
So basically what we're doing
is we're using the Android

01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:11.840
Google API with YouTube to
communicate as a Wi-Fi camera

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:13.903
between Google TV and
the Android phone.

01:33:13.903 --> 01:33:15.270
AUDIENCE: Louder.

01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.980
MALE SPEAKER: Sorry.

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:18.670
And basically the Arduino board
is connected to the

01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:21.013
Android phone, and the Android
phone communicates with the

01:33:21.013 --> 01:33:21.540
Arduino board.

01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:23.770
Unfortunately, we didn't get as
much functionality into the

01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:25.220
Arduino board as we wanted.

01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:27.845
We're hoping to get the remote
itself to actually control it.

01:33:27.845 --> 01:33:29.220
But that's gonna be a future
implementation.

01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:32.400
MALE SPEAKER: If you turn your
head, we have the Hangout back

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.290
there on that computer.

01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:34.440
That's recording.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.220
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
unfortunately the live

01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:38.330
streaming Hangout thing didn't
seem to be functioning.

01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:41.260
But we do have the Google
Hangouts broadcasting this

01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:42.510
from [INAUDIBLE].

01:33:48.150 --> 01:33:49.550
NANEA REEVES: Just one
question, how do you

01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:52.700
differentiate from a lot of,
like, the X10 cameras out

01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:53.790
there, et cetera?

01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:56.630
I mean, I'd have to give
my phone to this.

01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:57.870
MALE SPEAKER: We were picturing
this to be more

01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:59.825
targeted for kids or something
like that, where they could

01:33:59.825 --> 01:34:01.863
hang off their-- it doesn't
even have to be a phone.

01:34:01.863 --> 01:34:05.490
It could be a iPod that
connects to a device.

01:34:05.490 --> 01:34:09.510
And it's more modular, because
typical encapsulated projects

01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:12.729
like this can run around $250,
whereas we're doing this in

01:34:12.729 --> 01:34:14.427
something of a low market--

01:34:14.427 --> 01:34:15.361
$49.99.

01:34:15.361 --> 01:34:18.020
You can interchange the base
kit, so you could get a

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:19.086
rotocoptor.

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:20.190
MALE SPEAKER: This is
the Arduino board we

01:34:20.190 --> 01:34:21.480
were talking about.

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.920
For anything to a
computer input--

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.790
KRISPY: Talk into the mic.

01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:27.800
MALE SPEAKER: This is the
Arduino we were talking about.

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:30.460
And you could input your phone
or anything and you have an

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:32.880
instant computer with Wi-Fi.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.862
There you go.

01:34:33.862 --> 01:34:35.335
You have a movable computer.

01:34:35.335 --> 01:34:37.630
And with the camera, you have
a movable own robot.

01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:39.160
NANEA REEVES: I just keep
imagining trying to

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:42.345
put it on my cat.

01:34:42.345 --> 01:34:43.820
MALE SPEAKER: Don't put
it next to water.

01:34:47.490 --> 01:34:49.600
KRISPY: OK, so that's time.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:53.956
And that brings us to the
end of the demos.

01:34:53.956 --> 01:34:55.892
[APPLAUSE]

01:34:55.892 --> 01:34:58.526
KRISPY: So, Jarek, I think
you have a few

01:34:58.526 --> 01:34:59.110
things you want to say.

01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:00.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Here's what
we're going to do next.

01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:03.390
We're gonna allow our judges to
deliberate for about 15 to

01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:04.890
30 minutes.

01:35:04.890 --> 01:35:10.422
And while we wait, we'll play
Krispy's long-form video from

01:35:10.422 --> 01:35:11.000
the hackathon.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.360
So he actually made two edits,
because as I said, he is a

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.240
very talented video editor.

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.510
KRISPY: This one's
a bit longer.

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:18.580
It's about, I think,
13 minutes longer.

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:19.900
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: If you'd like
to take a break, get a

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:23.260
drink, snack, please
help yourself.

01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:26.190
I would like to also take this
opportunity to thank

01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:28.970
Fullscreen for producing
the live-stream show.

01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:30.440
Thank you very much,
judges for Google.

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.890
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:32.890 --> 01:35:34.360
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: [INAUDIBLE]

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.670
live-streaming is a
tricky business.

01:35:36.670 --> 01:35:39.170
KRISPY: So what else is still
coming up today, Jarek?

01:35:39.170 --> 01:35:41.088
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So after
this, we'll have awards

01:35:41.088 --> 01:35:42.016
ceremonies.

01:35:42.016 --> 01:35:44.800
KRISPY: Let's talk about the
prizes for a second, because

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.420
we're pretty proud of
what we brought.

01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:50.268
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So
we have drinks.

01:35:50.268 --> 01:35:51.580
KRISPY: Drinks rock.

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:52.580
Drinks are awesome.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:53.340
What else have we got, Jarek?

01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:54.120
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Let's see.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.040
We have toys.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.610
KRISPY: What kind
of toys, Jarek?

01:35:56.610 --> 01:35:57.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
We have tablets.

01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:59.400
KRISPY: Tablets are
pretty good.

01:35:59.400 --> 01:35:59.960
Nexus 7s?

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:01.352
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh,
we have Nexus 7s

01:36:01.352 --> 01:36:02.765
for the winning teams.

01:36:02.765 --> 01:36:04.950
And then the grand
prize tonight--

01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:08.030
KRISPY: Well, I think the grand
prize is for Google TV

01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:10.770
applications.

01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:13.280
Now we did kind of state
that at the beginning.

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:17.790
So some of you might have
noticed the rather large

01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:22.510
55-inch LG Google TV sitting
in the front.

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:25.210
Now I should note, there's
only one of them.

01:36:25.210 --> 01:36:28.600
So teams of five, I
don't know, buy

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.980
a chainsaw or something.

01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:33.960
You guys will have to decide
amongst yourselves

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:37.194
who would get that.

01:36:37.194 --> 01:36:39.020
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
well, let's watch Krispy's

01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:41.266
videos and wait for the
judges to come back.

01:36:41.266 --> 01:36:43.030
KRISPY: So this one's a little
longer, like I said.

01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:44.521
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Let's
play the long one.

01:36:48.994 --> 01:36:56.449
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:36:56.449 --> 01:37:25.275
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:37:25.275 --> 01:37:26.766
-We're going to have
a lot of fun today.

01:37:26.766 --> 01:37:29.251
All right, we got a lot of you
don't know what you're getting

01:37:29.251 --> 01:37:30.245
from Google.

01:37:30.245 --> 01:37:31.736
And we're gonna talk about
them in a second.

01:37:31.736 --> 01:37:34.718
But we're here to help you,
answer your questions, so that

01:37:34.718 --> 01:37:37.203
this becomes a fairly enjoyable
event and you guys

01:37:37.203 --> 01:37:39.191
can walk away feeling like
you've accomplished something.

01:37:39.191 --> 01:37:41.179
That's what we really
want to see.

01:37:41.179 --> 01:37:42.173
--onto player API.

01:37:42.173 --> 01:37:44.326
So you're building a [INAUDIBLE]
app, whether it's

01:37:44.326 --> 01:37:46.646
a mobile app or a
Google TV app.

01:37:46.646 --> 01:37:48.882
And you want to integrate video
playback capability in

01:37:48.882 --> 01:37:51.119
your application.

01:37:51.119 --> 01:37:55.960
-On average, about 300 million
people in the US watch about

01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.414
five hours of TV per day.

01:38:00.318 --> 01:38:01.286
Interesting?

01:38:01.286 --> 01:38:02.254
You know what that is?

01:38:02.254 --> 01:38:05.400
That's 166,000 years
of television

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.188
watched in a single day.

01:38:07.188 --> 01:38:09.678
That's more than the entirety
of human history.

01:38:09.678 --> 01:38:11.670
-People ask me whether
this is a real photo.

01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:17.895
And the answer is, it
is a real photo of

01:38:17.895 --> 01:38:19.140
me with a fake sign.

01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:20.136
[LAUGHTER]

01:38:20.136 --> 01:38:25.116
-So how many people know what
[INAUDIBLE] does at Google?

01:38:25.116 --> 01:38:27.606
OK, all you guys in the
red shirts know.

01:38:27.606 --> 01:38:30.594
So we're about close to 200
people in the company.

01:38:30.594 --> 01:38:32.586
We're a pretty good-sized
team.

01:38:32.586 --> 01:38:35.076
And we're literally around
the globe We're

01:38:35.076 --> 01:38:37.068
on all but one continent.

01:38:37.068 --> 01:38:39.060
Nobody's gone to Antarctica
yet, as I'm aware of.

01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:40.803
I think we've been there,
but nobody's actually

01:38:40.803 --> 01:38:43.044
working there yet.

01:38:43.044 --> 01:38:46.530
And we are here to reach out
and work with you guys.

01:38:46.530 --> 01:38:49.518
You guys have questions about
the APIs, the different

01:38:49.518 --> 01:38:51.012
products, that's what we do.

01:38:51.012 --> 01:38:53.502
We help you, and then
we listen to you.

01:38:53.502 --> 01:38:56.988
And this is the more fun for us,
is that we get to go back

01:38:56.988 --> 01:38:59.727
to the engineers that work on
these individual products and

01:38:59.727 --> 01:39:02.715
say, we missed something, or we
[INAUDIBLE] something, and

01:39:02.715 --> 01:39:03.965
we give them feedback.

01:39:21.275 --> 01:39:24.287
-We don't want any conflict
between us and Google and

01:39:24.287 --> 01:39:27.375
their advertisement, because
our app has to do with

01:39:27.375 --> 01:39:30.520
enhancing the user interface
while you're watching content

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:32.066
through your Google TV.

01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:48.930
-We're here with my friend,
making the applications.

01:39:48.930 --> 01:39:49.922
We compete.

01:39:49.922 --> 01:39:51.410
We like to compete
because it's fun.

01:39:51.410 --> 01:39:55.130
We learn from evangelists, and
we learn from companies how to

01:39:55.130 --> 01:39:57.858
use your API in technologies we
implement, and eventually

01:39:57.858 --> 01:40:00.338
use them for applications
in the future.

01:40:00.338 --> 01:40:04.802
So we're here today at the
Google TV YouTube competition.

01:40:04.802 --> 01:40:09.514
And we're learning about the
Google APIs and how to build

01:40:09.514 --> 01:40:11.870
apps in a couple hours.

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:35.956
-Sure.

01:40:35.956 --> 01:40:38.810
We're working on an app that'll
be based inside

01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:41.590
salesforce.com with the
force.com platform that will

01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:45.250
allow companies to upload videos
to YouTube and then

01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:47.760
automatically receive the stats
of how many people have

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:49.010
watched that video, liked
it, et cetera.

01:41:15.155 --> 01:41:16.549
-What you fixing up
there, Jeremy?

01:41:16.549 --> 01:41:17.527
-I don't know.

01:41:17.527 --> 01:41:19.483
-That looks like
a lot of guac.

01:41:19.483 --> 01:41:20.950
-I hate to disappoint you.

01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:24.364
I'm here supervising three
different people for other

01:41:24.364 --> 01:41:24.861
teams.

01:41:24.861 --> 01:41:25.358
-OK.

01:41:25.358 --> 01:41:26.849
And what are they building?

01:41:26.849 --> 01:41:29.002
-You know, one of them
was the cat videos

01:41:29.002 --> 01:41:31.322
that you saw up there.

01:41:31.322 --> 01:41:35.795
The other one was connecting
with the Ed tech students.

01:41:35.795 --> 01:41:37.783
We're interested in
furthering that.

01:41:37.783 --> 01:41:39.771
And then the last one is
gonna surprise me.

01:41:39.771 --> 01:41:41.759
So we'll see.

01:41:41.759 --> 01:41:43.009
-Cool.

01:42:35.435 --> 01:42:38.970
-I think it's one, if we
complete this-- actually,

01:42:38.970 --> 01:42:40.350
phase two is mostly done.

01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:42.650
So we'll just go through
this one more time.

01:42:42.650 --> 01:42:44.205
You said, which video--

01:42:44.205 --> 01:42:48.934
-It's a cool hackathon combining
YouTube and Google

01:42:48.934 --> 01:42:51.750
TV technologies.

01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:57.910
They've so far welcomed
everyone, talked a little bit.

01:42:57.910 --> 01:43:00.599
And folks are putting up all
their ideas, and teams are

01:43:00.599 --> 01:43:01.577
trying to form.

01:43:01.577 --> 01:43:05.000
And we're looking forward to one
hell of an event tonight.

01:43:38.518 --> 01:43:41.150
-They're doing the hardcore
stuff, and I'm just getting

01:43:41.150 --> 01:43:41.960
the presentation ready.

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.920
So it's coming along
swimmingly.

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:45.880
-Hey.

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:46.860
-We're doing good.

01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:48.330
We're coding.

01:43:48.330 --> 01:43:49.580
We're at the beginning.

01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:54.332
We all understand what
we're doing now.

01:43:54.332 --> 01:43:57.982
And our goal is clear, so I
think everyone is focused and

01:43:57.982 --> 01:44:02.490
everyone's working on their
own piece of the puzzle.

01:44:02.490 --> 01:44:07.035
-We're working on some
HTML/CSS-based modules that'll

01:44:07.035 --> 01:44:10.015
be the building blocks of our
pages, while our partners are

01:44:10.015 --> 01:44:11.883
working on our database
schema.

01:44:11.883 --> 01:44:14.342
And hopefully within the hour or
so, we're gonna be able to

01:44:14.342 --> 01:44:17.258
start merging together.

01:44:17.258 --> 01:44:17.744
-Cool.

01:44:17.744 --> 01:44:22.120
-I think we won't have any
trouble making deadline.

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:22.835
-Awesome.

01:44:22.835 --> 01:44:26.420
-We've got a bunch of it
designed and coded.

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:29.475
And we're just gonna smush the
two together, and everything

01:44:29.475 --> 01:44:31.570
will be magical.

01:44:31.570 --> 01:44:32.820
-Awesome.

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:46.239
-It's 4:10 PM, and we're able
to record from our webcam

01:44:46.239 --> 01:44:50.730
using the upload widget, up to
YouTube, and pull some stats

01:44:50.730 --> 01:44:52.726
on that video.

01:44:52.726 --> 01:44:53.976
-Cool.

01:45:47.117 --> 01:45:56.880
-Right now, just adding on a
little page where we can

01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:58.650
expand on the search.

01:45:58.650 --> 01:45:59.600
It is good.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.075
-You were up too late
last night.

01:46:00.075 --> 01:46:01.025
-No, no.

01:46:01.025 --> 01:46:02.450
To expand on the search.

01:46:02.450 --> 01:46:05.345
There's a tool bar for the
more popular searches.

01:46:05.345 --> 01:46:08.425
And now I'm naming categories to
put as examples of what we

01:46:08.425 --> 01:46:08.920
see.

01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.472
-You ready for another exciting
day of hacking?

01:46:11.472 --> 01:46:11.958
-Yes.

01:46:11.958 --> 01:46:12.930
-Good.

01:46:12.930 --> 01:46:14.388
-As ready as ever.

01:46:22.650 --> 01:46:24.108
-We're doing pretty good.

01:46:24.108 --> 01:46:25.955
-Yeah?

01:46:25.955 --> 01:46:27.980
-We're where we wanted to be.

01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:29.695
We had a late night, till
2:00 in the morning.

01:46:29.695 --> 01:46:32.310
But--

01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:34.840
-You look a little sleep-weary,
a little like, I

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:35.650
don't know where I am.

01:46:35.650 --> 01:46:36.900
-That's usually how I am.

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.900
-So where are we at?

01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:45.385
-We're doing good.

01:46:45.385 --> 01:46:51.246
We have a application that lets
teachers use Google TV in

01:46:51.246 --> 01:46:54.615
the classroom and get feedback
from the students by having

01:46:54.615 --> 01:46:57.320
the students anonymously
engage when they don't

01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:57.802
understand.

01:46:57.802 --> 01:47:02.559
And we have the view that lets
teachers set up the videos and

01:47:02.559 --> 01:47:06.152
prepare the class, and also
the interface that the

01:47:06.152 --> 01:47:07.500
students will see.

01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:10.675
Right now we're planning to make
a bring-your-own-device

01:47:10.675 --> 01:47:13.585
interface, so that students with
computers, cell phones,

01:47:13.585 --> 01:47:16.495
tablets can engage with
the application.

01:47:16.495 --> 01:47:17.950
-Fighting timers.

01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:19.200
-Fighting timers?

01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:26.870
You all set for another
day of coding?

01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:29.000
-[INAUDIBLE].

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.070
-I had this awesome trick
I was gonna do to you.

01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:37.970
It's gonna take me a little
while to build it, though.

01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:39.523
-Day number two.

01:47:39.523 --> 01:47:42.491
How are you guys doing?

01:47:42.491 --> 01:47:42.990
-Coding strong.

01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:46.310
-Coding strong?

01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:50.000
All right, so tell me
where you're at.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.770
-Well, we've done the
basic functionality.

01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:58.686
And we are building the
interface to get

01:47:58.686 --> 01:47:59.880
the aggregate now.

01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:01.249
That's where we are.

01:48:01.249 --> 01:48:03.744
-Anything you've
learned so far?

01:48:03.744 --> 01:48:08.235
-I've learned a lot with you
guys on using the new API,

01:48:08.235 --> 01:48:10.730
YouTube API.

01:48:10.730 --> 01:48:16.718
They are learning a lot about
the Google TV SDK.

01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:40.960
-Yes, I was.

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:43.150
-And did you stay up,
or did you sleep?

01:48:43.150 --> 01:48:45.540
-I'm not sure, actually.

01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:46.365
Both.

01:48:46.365 --> 01:48:48.080
-You think you're a hummingbird
of some sort at

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:48.530
this point?

01:48:48.530 --> 01:48:49.430
-Yeah, that's right.

01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:52.294
-So how far along are you?

01:48:52.294 --> 01:48:54.210
-Pretty much close.

01:48:54.210 --> 01:48:54.595
-Yeah?

01:48:54.595 --> 01:48:54.980
-Yeah.

01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:55.815
-You think you'll be
ready for demo.

01:48:55.815 --> 01:48:56.569
-Yeah, I think so.

01:48:56.569 --> 01:48:58.565
-OK, good.

01:48:58.565 --> 01:49:01.559
What time is it?

01:49:01.559 --> 01:49:02.557
-7:15.

01:49:02.557 --> 01:49:04.054
-Were you here all night?

01:49:04.054 --> 01:49:06.549
-Yes, I was sleeping up there.

01:49:06.549 --> 01:49:07.547
-Oh, OK.

01:49:07.547 --> 01:49:10.042
And how far along are you?

01:49:10.042 --> 01:49:11.539
-I'm pretty far along.

01:49:11.539 --> 01:49:13.535
We have just a few things
left to do.

01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.710
-OK, we're nearing the
end of the YouTube LA

01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:21.170
Hackathon at Google.

01:49:21.170 --> 01:49:24.440
And everyone's been working
really, really hard, trying to

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:26.600
get their applications
finished, get their

01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:27.750
presentations in order.

01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:30.120
A lot of them have gone
without much sleep.

01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:33.130
Some of them even spent the
entire night here, so they're

01:49:33.130 --> 01:49:34.460
very dedicated.

01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:37.090
I'm really excited to see what
everyone's put together.

01:49:37.090 --> 01:49:39.855
And hopefully everyone
had a great time.

01:49:39.855 --> 01:49:42.490
You guys think you'll
make the deadline?

01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:44.370
-They will, because I
believe in the guys.

01:49:44.370 --> 01:49:45.620
Go team.

01:50:04.582 --> 01:50:44.422
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:50:44.422 --> 01:50:47.534
-We're going to have a lot of
fun today, because you've got

01:50:47.534 --> 01:50:49.402
a lot of you don't know what
you're getting from Google.

01:50:49.402 --> 01:50:50.896
We're gonna talk about
them in a second.

01:50:50.896 --> 01:50:54.216
But we're here to help you,
answer your questions so that

01:50:54.216 --> 01:50:56.872
this becomes a fairly enjoyable
event and you guys

01:50:56.872 --> 01:50:58.366
can walk away feeling that
you've accomplished something.

01:50:58.366 --> 01:50:59.860
That's what we really
want to see.

01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:00.856
--onto a player API.

01:51:00.856 --> 01:51:02.682
So if you're building a
[INAUDIBLE] app, whether it's

01:51:02.682 --> 01:51:06.832
a mobile app or a Google TV app,
and you want to integrate

01:51:06.832 --> 01:51:10.318
video playback capability in
your application [INAUDIBLE].

01:51:10.318 --> 01:51:15.298
-On average, about 300 million
people in the US watch about

01:51:15.298 --> 01:51:19.282
five hours of TV per day.

01:51:19.282 --> 01:51:20.278
Interesting?

01:51:20.278 --> 01:51:21.274
You know what that is?

01:51:21.274 --> 01:51:24.262
That's 166,000 years
of television

01:51:24.262 --> 01:51:26.752
watched in a single day.

01:51:26.752 --> 01:51:29.242
That's more than the entirety
of human history.

01:51:29.242 --> 01:51:31.234
-People are asking me whether
this is a real photo.

01:51:31.234 --> 01:51:36.712
And the answer is, it is
a real photo of me

01:51:36.712 --> 01:51:37.708
with with a fake sign.

01:51:37.708 --> 01:51:39.700
[LAUGHTER]

01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:44.182
-So how many people know what
[INAUDIBLE] does at Google?

01:51:44.182 --> 01:51:46.174
OK, all you guys in the
red shirts know.

01:51:46.174 --> 01:51:49.660
So we're about close to 200
people in the company.

01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.652
We're a pretty good-sized
team.

01:51:51.652 --> 01:51:53.644
And we're literally
around the globe.

01:51:53.644 --> 01:51:56.134
We're on all but
one continent.

01:51:56.134 --> 01:51:58.126
Nobody's gone to Antarctica
yet, as I'm aware of.

01:51:58.126 --> 01:51:59.786
I think we've been there,
but nobody's actually

01:51:59.786 --> 01:52:02.110
working there yet.

01:52:02.110 --> 01:52:05.098
And we are here to reach out
and work with you guys.

01:52:05.098 --> 01:52:08.584
You guys have questions about
the APIs, the different

01:52:08.584 --> 01:52:10.770
products, that's what we do.

01:52:10.770 --> 01:52:12.702
We help you, and then
we listen to you.

01:52:12.702 --> 01:52:15.840
And this is the more fun for us,
is that we get to go back

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:18.140
to the engineers that work on
these individual products and

01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:21.430
say we missed something,
or we [INAUDIBLE]

01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:22.894
something, and we give
the feedback.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.204
-We don't want any conflict
between us and Google and

01:52:43.204 --> 01:52:46.376
their advertisement, because
our app has to do with

01:52:46.376 --> 01:52:49.800
enhancing the user interface
while you're watching content

01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:51.574
through your Google TV.

01:53:02.032 --> 01:53:03.028
-Hello.

01:53:03.028 --> 01:53:08.008
We're here with my friend,
making the applications.

01:53:08.008 --> 01:53:09.004
We compete.

01:53:09.004 --> 01:53:10.498
We like to compete
because it's fun.

01:53:10.498 --> 01:53:14.232
We learn from evangelists, and
we learn from companies how to

01:53:14.232 --> 01:53:17.221
use your API in technologies we
implement, and eventually

01:53:17.221 --> 01:53:19.462
use them for applications
in the future.

01:53:19.462 --> 01:53:23.944
So we're here today at the
Google YouTube competition,

01:53:23.944 --> 01:53:28.426
and we're learning about Google
APIs and how to build

01:53:28.426 --> 01:53:30.820
apps in a couple hours.

01:53:55.050 --> 01:53:55.210
-Sure.

01:53:55.210 --> 01:53:58.170
We're working on an app that
will be based inside

01:53:58.170 --> 01:54:00.440
salesforce.com with the
force.com platform that will

01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:04.420
allow companies to upload videos
to YouTube and then

01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:06.150
automatically receive the stats
of how many people have

01:54:06.150 --> 01:54:08.093
watched that video, liked
it, et cetera.

01:54:33.729 --> 01:54:35.469
-What you fixing up
there, Jeremy?

01:54:35.469 --> 01:54:36.387
-I don't know.

01:54:36.387 --> 01:54:37.764
-That looks like
a lot of guac.

01:54:37.764 --> 01:54:39.600
-I hate to disappoint you.

01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:42.210
I'm here supervising
three different

01:54:42.210 --> 01:54:43.646
people for other teams.

01:54:43.646 --> 01:54:46.136
-OK, and what are
they building?

01:54:46.136 --> 01:54:49.124
-You know, one of them was the
cat videos that you saw up

01:54:49.124 --> 01:54:50.120
front there.

01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:55.100
The other one was connecting
with the Ed tech students.

01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:57.092
We're interested in
furthering that.

01:54:57.092 --> 01:55:00.578
And then the last one is gonna
surprise me, so we'll see.

01:55:00.578 --> 01:55:01.828
-Cool.

01:55:53.070 --> 01:55:53.894
-[INAUDIBLE].

01:55:53.894 --> 01:55:57.448
The biggest one, I think
if we complete this--

01:55:57.448 --> 01:56:00.181
or actually phase two is mostly
done, so we'll just go

01:56:00.181 --> 01:56:01.424
through this one more time.

01:56:01.424 --> 01:56:03.270
You said which video--

01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:08.242
-It's a cool hackathon combining
YouTube and Google

01:56:08.242 --> 01:56:10.800
TV technologies.

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:16.371
They've so far welcomed
everyone, talked a little bit.

01:56:16.371 --> 01:56:19.686
And folks are putting up all
their ideas, and teams are

01:56:19.686 --> 01:56:20.844
trying to form.

01:56:20.844 --> 01:56:24.316
And we're looking forward to one
hell of an event tonight.

01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:59.802
-They're doing the hardcore
stuff, and I'm just getting

01:56:59.802 --> 01:57:00.630
the presentation ready.

01:57:00.630 --> 01:57:03.190
So it's coming along
swimmingly.

01:57:03.190 --> 01:57:05.022
-Hey.

01:57:05.022 --> 01:57:05.938
-We're doing good.

01:57:05.938 --> 01:57:06.854
We're coding.

01:57:06.854 --> 01:57:08.160
We're at the beginning.

01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:13.056
We all understand what
we're doing now.

01:57:13.056 --> 01:57:17.326
And our goal is clear, so I
think everyone is focused and

01:57:17.326 --> 01:57:21.480
everyone's working on their
own piece of the puzzle.

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:26.117
-We're working on some
HTML/CSS-based modules that'll

01:57:26.117 --> 01:57:28.900
be the building blocks of our
pages, while our partners are

01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:30.748
working on our database
schema.

01:57:30.748 --> 01:57:33.404
And hopefully within the hour or
so, we're gonna be able to

01:57:33.404 --> 01:57:36.296
start merging together.

01:57:36.296 --> 01:57:36.778
-Cool.

01:57:36.778 --> 01:57:40.634
-And I think we won't have any
trouble making deadline.

01:57:40.634 --> 01:57:41.598
-Awesome.

01:57:41.598 --> 01:57:44.972
-We've got a bunch of it
designed and coded.

01:57:44.972 --> 01:57:48.550
And we're just gonna smush the
two together, and everything

01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:50.002
will be magical.

01:57:50.002 --> 01:57:51.252
-Awesome.

01:58:00.170 --> 01:58:02.532
-It's 4:10 PM.

01:58:02.532 --> 01:58:06.334
And we're able to record from
our web cam using the upload

01:58:06.334 --> 01:58:11.314
widget, to YouTube, and pull
some stats on that video.

01:58:11.314 --> 01:58:12.564
-Cool.

01:59:06.094 --> 01:59:16.080
-Right now, just adding on a
little page where we can

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:16.540
expand on the search.

01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:17.343
-It's too early, or something.

01:59:17.343 --> 01:59:18.030
-It is.

01:59:18.030 --> 01:59:18.956
-You were up too late
last night.

01:59:18.956 --> 01:59:20.234
-No, no.

01:59:20.234 --> 01:59:22.085
To expand on the search.

01:59:22.085 --> 01:59:24.100
There's a tool bar for the
more popular searches.

01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:27.745
And now I'm naming categories to
put as examples of what we

01:59:27.745 --> 01:59:28.242
see.

01:59:28.242 --> 01:59:30.230
-You ready for another exciting
day of hacking?

01:59:30.230 --> 01:59:30.727
-Yes.

01:59:30.727 --> 01:59:31.721
-Good.

01:59:31.721 --> 01:59:32.971
-As ready as ever.

01:59:41.661 --> 01:59:43.152
-We're doing pretty good.

01:59:43.152 --> 01:59:44.660
-Yeah?

01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:47.070
-We're where we wanted to be.

01:59:47.070 --> 01:59:48.932
We had a late night, till
2:00 in the morning.

01:59:48.932 --> 01:59:51.420
But--

01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:53.580
-You look a little sleep-weary,
a little like, I

01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:54.309
don't know where I am.

01:59:54.309 --> 01:59:55.776
-That's usually how I am.

02:00:01.765 --> 02:00:03.734
-So where are we at?

02:00:03.734 --> 02:00:04.889
-We're doing good.

02:00:04.889 --> 02:00:10.302
We have a application that lets
teachers use Google TV in

02:00:10.302 --> 02:00:13.295
the classroom and get feedback
from the students by having

02:00:13.295 --> 02:00:16.220
the students anonymously
engage when they don't

02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:17.103
understand.

02:00:17.103 --> 02:00:21.450
And we have the view that lets
teachers set up the videos and

02:00:21.450 --> 02:00:25.314
prepare the class, and also
the interface that the

02:00:25.314 --> 02:00:26.280
students will see.

02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:29.890
Right now we're planning to make
a bring-your-own-device

02:00:29.890 --> 02:00:32.800
interface, so that students with
computers, cell phones,

02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:35.710
tablets can engage with
the applications.

02:00:35.710 --> 02:00:37.165
-Fighting timers.

02:00:37.165 --> 02:00:38.415
-Fighting timers?

02:00:42.985 --> 02:00:45.300
You all set for another
day of coding?

02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:48.062
-[INAUDIBLE].

02:00:48.062 --> 02:00:52.851
-I had this awesome trick
I was gonna do to you.

02:00:52.851 --> 02:00:56.760
It's gonna take me a little
while to build it, though.

02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:58.736
-Day number two.

02:00:58.736 --> 02:01:01.551
How are you guys doing?

02:01:01.551 --> 02:01:02.710
-Coding strong.

02:01:02.710 --> 02:01:05.041
-Coding strong?

02:01:05.041 --> 02:01:09.100
All right, so tell me
where you're at.

02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:13.532
-Well, we've done the
basic functionality.

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:17.196
And now we are building
the interface to get

02:01:17.196 --> 02:01:18.800
the aggregate now.

02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:21.220
That's where we are.

02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:22.983
-Anything you've
learned so far?

02:01:22.983 --> 02:01:26.680
-I learned a lot with you
guys on using the new

02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:29.392
API, YouTube API.

02:01:29.392 --> 02:01:35.308
They are learning a lot about
the Google TV SDK.

02:01:58.972 --> 02:02:00.230
-Yes, I was.

02:02:00.230 --> 02:02:02.050
-And did you stay up
or did you sleep?

02:02:02.050 --> 02:02:04.642
-I'm not sure, actually.

02:02:04.642 --> 02:02:05.420
Both.

02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:07.113
-You think you're a hummingbird
of some sort at

02:02:07.113 --> 02:02:07.140
this point?

02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:08.960
-Yeah, that's right.

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:10.900
-So how far along are you?

02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:12.820
-Pretty much close, yeah.

02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:13.300
-Yeah?

02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:13.780
-Yeah.

02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:15.130
-You think you'll be
ready for demo?

02:02:15.130 --> 02:02:16.320
-Yeah, I think so.

02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:18.156
-OK, good.

02:02:18.156 --> 02:02:20.790
What time is it?

02:02:20.790 --> 02:02:21.696
-7:15.

02:02:21.696 --> 02:02:23.100
-And we're you here all night?

02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:23.586
-Yes.

02:02:23.586 --> 02:02:26.016
I was sleeping up there.

02:02:26.016 --> 02:02:26.988
-Oh, OK.

02:02:26.988 --> 02:02:28.932
And how far along are you?

02:02:28.932 --> 02:02:30.390
-I'm pretty far along.

02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:34.764
We have just a few things
left to do.

02:02:34.764 --> 02:02:38.370
-OK, we're nearing the
end of the YouTube LA

02:02:38.370 --> 02:02:40.210
Hackathon at Google.

02:02:40.210 --> 02:02:43.480
And everyone's been working
really, really hard trying to

02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:45.670
get their applications
finished, get their

02:02:45.670 --> 02:02:46.870
presentations in order.

02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:49.180
A lot of them have gone
without much sleep.

02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:51.180
Some of them even spent
the entire night here.

02:02:51.180 --> 02:02:53.540
So they're very dedicated.

02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:56.230
I'm really excited to see what
everyone's put together.

02:02:56.230 --> 02:02:58.940
And hopefully everyone
had a great time.

02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:01.530
You guys think you'll
make the deadline?

02:03:01.530 --> 02:03:03.576
-They will, because I
believe in the guys.

02:03:03.576 --> 02:03:04.826
Go team.

02:03:28.772 --> 02:04:03.632
[MUSIC PLAYING]

02:04:03.632 --> 02:04:05.624
-We're going to have
a lot of fun today.

02:04:05.624 --> 02:04:07.450
You got a lot of you don't
know what you're

02:04:07.450 --> 02:04:08.612
getting from Google.

02:04:08.612 --> 02:04:10.106
We're gonna talk about
them in a second.

02:04:10.106 --> 02:04:13.426
But we're here to help you,
answer your questions so that

02:04:13.426 --> 02:04:15.584
this becomes a fairly enjoyable
event and you guys

02:04:15.584 --> 02:04:17.078
can walk away feeling that
you've accomplished something.

02:04:17.078 --> 02:04:18.074
That's what we really
want to see.

02:04:18.074 --> 02:04:19.568
--onto a player API.

02:04:19.568 --> 02:04:22.224
So if you're building a
[INAUDIBLE] app, whether it's

02:04:22.224 --> 02:04:25.793
a mobile app or a Google TV app,
and you want to integrate

02:04:25.793 --> 02:04:29.528
video playback capability in
your application, [INAUDIBLE].

02:04:29.528 --> 02:04:34.010
-On average, about 300 million
people in the US watch about

02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:38.492
five hours of TV per day.

02:04:38.492 --> 02:04:39.488
Interesting?

02:04:39.488 --> 02:04:40.484
You know what that is?

02:04:40.484 --> 02:04:43.306
That's 166,000 years
of television

02:04:43.306 --> 02:04:45.464
watched in a single day.

02:04:45.464 --> 02:04:47.954
That's more than the entirety
of human history.

02:04:47.954 --> 02:04:49.946
-People ask me whether
this is a real photo.

02:04:49.946 --> 02:04:55.673
And the answer is, it
is a real photo of

02:04:55.673 --> 02:04:56.918
me with a fake sign.

02:04:56.918 --> 02:04:58.412
[LAUGHTER]

02:04:58.412 --> 02:05:00.902
-So how many people know
what [INAUDIBLE]

02:05:00.902 --> 02:05:02.894
does at Google?

02:05:02.894 --> 02:05:05.384
OK, all you guys in the
red shirts know.

02:05:05.384 --> 02:05:08.870
So we're about close to 200
people in the company.

02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:10.862
We're a pretty good-sized
team.

02:05:10.862 --> 02:05:12.854
And we're literally
around the globe.

02:05:12.854 --> 02:05:14.846
We're on all but
one continent.

02:05:14.846 --> 02:05:17.336
Nobody's gone to Antarctica
yet, as I'm aware of.

02:05:17.336 --> 02:05:18.704
I think we've been there,
but nobody's actually

02:05:18.704 --> 02:05:20.822
working there yet.

02:05:20.822 --> 02:05:24.308
And we are here to reach out
and work with you guys.

02:05:24.308 --> 02:05:27.794
You guys have questions about
the APIs, the different

02:05:27.794 --> 02:05:29.288
products, that's what we do.

02:05:29.288 --> 02:05:31.778
We help you, and then when
we listen to you.

02:05:31.778 --> 02:05:35.015
And this is the more fun for us,
is that we get to go back

02:05:35.015 --> 02:05:37.580
to the engineers that work on
these individual products and

02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:40.500
say, we missed something, or
we haven't [INAUDIBLE]

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:41.964
something, and we give
them feedback.

02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:02.710
-We don't want any conflict
between us and Google and

02:06:02.710 --> 02:06:05.950
their advertisement, because
our app has to do with

02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:08.880
enhancing the user interface
while you're watching content

02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:10.158
through your Google TV.

02:06:21.136 --> 02:06:22.134
-Hello.

02:06:22.134 --> 02:06:27.124
We're here with my friend,
making the application.

02:06:27.124 --> 02:06:28.122
We compete.

02:06:28.122 --> 02:06:29.619
We like to compete
because it's fun.

02:06:29.619 --> 02:06:33.444
We learn from evangelists, and
we learn from companies how to

02:06:33.444 --> 02:06:36.106
use your API in technologies we
implement, and eventually

02:06:36.106 --> 02:06:38.601
use them for applications
in the future.

02:06:38.601 --> 02:06:43.092
So we're here today at the
Google YouTube competition.

02:06:43.092 --> 02:06:48.082
And we're learning about the
Google APIs and how to build

02:06:48.082 --> 02:06:50.230
apps in a couple hours.

02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:14.290
-Sure.

02:07:14.290 --> 02:07:17.700
We're working on an app that'll
be based inside

02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:19.790
salesforce.com with the
force.com platform that will

02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:23.670
allow companies to upload videos
to YouTube and then

02:07:23.670 --> 02:07:25.600
automatically receive the stats
of how many people have

02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:28.331
watched that video, liked
it, et cetera.

02:07:45.726 --> 02:07:47.714
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

02:08:02.630 --> 02:08:03.820
KRISPY: Check, check.

02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:05.070
OK.

02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:09.110
All right, guys.

02:08:09.110 --> 02:08:13.860
If you want to make your way
back into the main room, we

02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:16.680
have some winners.

02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:17.910
You don't want to miss this.

02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:19.470
You've all worked
very, very hard.

02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:24.460
So do make your way
back in here.

02:08:27.730 --> 02:08:28.600
Oh, everyone's gone silent.

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:29.475
Don't be shy.

02:08:29.475 --> 02:08:30.370
Come right on in.

02:08:30.370 --> 02:08:32.090
Grab a seat.

02:08:32.090 --> 02:08:35.111
Let's fill this room.

02:08:35.111 --> 02:08:37.830
There we go.

02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:42.390
OK, so I'm going to hand these
mics over to you guys.

02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:43.570
Please introduce yourselves.

02:08:43.570 --> 02:08:46.220
Tell us a little about
your companies.

02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:49.720
And I'll give it to you.

02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:50.720
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: Great.

02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:51.720
Thank you, Krispy.

02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:53.220
KRISPY: You're welcome.

02:08:53.220 --> 02:08:53.790
GEORGE STROMPOLOS: Hey, guys.

02:08:53.790 --> 02:08:56.126
Congrats on getting this far.

02:08:56.126 --> 02:08:58.391
I'm sure it was a lot of fun,
a lot of hard work.

02:08:58.391 --> 02:09:00.520
My name's George Strompolos,
by the way.

02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:03.785
I'm the CEO and founder
of Fullscreen.

02:09:03.785 --> 02:09:05.600
I actually used to work
at YouTube myself.

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:09.015
I was at the company for about
five and a half years.

02:09:09.015 --> 02:09:12.330
I was trying to solve a lot of
the same problems that folks

02:09:12.330 --> 02:09:14.250
were beginning to
look at today.

02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:18.260
I left YouTube two years ago and
started Fullscreen to help

02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:21.670
support creators and help brands
build audience, make

02:09:21.670 --> 02:09:24.490
money, and have fun
being YouTubers.

02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:25.900
We've grown pretty massively.

02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:28.770
We have about 10,000 creators
in our network.

02:09:28.770 --> 02:09:31.256
We do two billion
monthly views.

02:09:31.256 --> 02:09:36.180
We have 140 people here in
Culver City, about 26

02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:38.650
developers and product people.

02:09:38.650 --> 02:09:40.840
Actually, I think Matt
Danna, one of our

02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:41.070
product guys, is here.

02:09:41.070 --> 02:09:42.410
What's up, Matt?

02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:45.590
So wanted to let people know
that we're actively hiring.

02:09:45.590 --> 02:09:48.180
Saw a lot of smart stuff here.

02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:50.140
If you're interested in
a job in the YouTube

02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:51.412
space, hit me up.

02:09:51.412 --> 02:09:53.626
So thanks again.

02:09:53.626 --> 02:09:54.088
NANEA REEVES: Great.

02:09:54.088 --> 02:09:56.860
[APPLAUSE]

02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:57.939
NANEA REEVES: I'm
Nanea Reeves.

02:09:57.939 --> 02:09:59.860
I'm the CEO at Machinima.

02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:04.780
And Machinima, my goal with the
engineering team there is

02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:07.630
to make it one of the best
places in Los Angeles to work

02:10:07.630 --> 02:10:09.530
for engineers, so you don't
have to move up

02:10:09.530 --> 02:10:12.378
north where it's cold.

02:10:12.378 --> 02:10:13.310
[APPLAUSE]

02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:15.174
NANEA REEVES: I've a vested
interested in doing it.

02:10:15.174 --> 02:10:18.675
So we definitely have
open job recs for

02:10:18.675 --> 02:10:19.955
our talented engineers.

02:10:19.955 --> 02:10:22.050
I saw a lot of great
talent here.

02:10:22.050 --> 02:10:25.450
If you're interested, we're
working on some pretty cool

02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:26.450
stuff there.

02:10:26.450 --> 02:10:31.270
Send your resume to
engineers@machinima.com, or

02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:33.970
you can talk to Kim Pope right
over here, and she

02:10:33.970 --> 02:10:35.470
will hook you up.

02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:39.730
We would love to have you come
in, especially people who know

02:10:39.730 --> 02:10:44.030
the YouTube API and have also
worked with Google TV API as

02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:46.070
we look at extending
the new platforms.

02:10:46.070 --> 02:10:48.806
But really, I just want to
say congratulations.

02:10:48.806 --> 02:10:54.130
I saw a lot of great talent
here, very innovative.

02:10:54.130 --> 02:10:56.610
And we'd love to support
you, so please

02:10:56.610 --> 02:10:58.104
send us your resumes.

02:10:58.104 --> 02:11:00.936
[APPLAUSE]

02:11:00.936 --> 02:11:02.824
KRISPY: Thank you
guys very much.

02:11:02.824 --> 02:11:06.530
Appreciate you being here and
participating in this.

02:11:06.530 --> 02:11:10.320
All right, I'm gonna hand it
over to Paul at this point.

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:12.045
Paul is one of my colleagues.

02:11:12.045 --> 02:11:16.420
He's a developer advocate on
Google TV, and one of the

02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:18.560
special judges for this
evening's event.

02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:19.910
So, Paul, take it away.

02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:21.630
PAUL CARFF: So thank
you, Krispy.

02:11:21.630 --> 02:11:24.690
Thank you to everyone who's
been here this weekend.

02:11:24.690 --> 02:11:25.240
It's been a lot of fun.

02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:29.070
I like to do these events to see
the energy and such that

02:11:29.070 --> 02:11:32.630
comes up with all of you here,
working all those hours.

02:11:32.630 --> 02:11:35.210
I was here till 5:00 this
morning myself.

02:11:35.210 --> 02:11:37.340
And I know there was least three
to four of you that were

02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:39.950
actually awake all night long.

02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:42.150
And it was very good to see
that, so thank you to all.

02:11:42.150 --> 02:11:42.927
Let's give everybody a
round of applause for

02:11:42.927 --> 02:11:43.631
all their hard work.

02:11:43.631 --> 02:11:49.523
[APPLAUSE]

02:11:49.523 --> 02:11:51.150
PAUL CARFF: So it's time
for the awards.

02:11:51.150 --> 02:11:55.760
I want to first say thank you
to everyone for listening,

02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:58.240
because I thought the show
went very smooth tonight.

02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:01.565
It's one of the best that I've
seen as far as a hackathon.

02:12:01.565 --> 02:12:03.940
There wasn't very much in the
way of disruption once we got

02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:05.365
over the first big one.

02:12:05.365 --> 02:12:09.513
And the presentations, the
judges were very impressed

02:12:09.513 --> 02:12:10.280
with the presentations.

02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:13.500
You guys did very, very well
preparing and doing them.

02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:17.250
And some of you are going
to be noted for that.

02:12:17.250 --> 02:12:19.410
So thank you very
much for that.

02:12:19.410 --> 02:12:24.030
Also, there were so many good
apps that we decided to add an

02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:26.780
extra one that we hadn't
planned to do.

02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:29.225
The first one is going to
be an honorable mention.

02:12:29.225 --> 02:12:32.040
We're putting it in for the
execution in a short time. "Is

02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:33.680
short time?" Oh, I love typos.

02:12:37.268 --> 02:12:37.761
OK.

02:12:37.761 --> 02:12:39.240
[LAUGHTER]

02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:42.700
PAUL CARFF: We were hurrying.

02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:46.760
So this team, we were
impressed with it.

02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:49.650
They weren't the top team,
but they were very good.

02:12:49.650 --> 02:12:52.550
And we wanted to recognize them
for the work that they

02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:55.030
did-- again, given
the short time.

02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:59.810
And so in order to award them,
our judges here, their

02:12:59.810 --> 02:13:02.850
companies have offered to buy
a $50 gift card for each of

02:13:02.850 --> 02:13:04.090
the team members.

02:13:04.090 --> 02:13:06.466
And that team is Vid Social.

02:13:06.466 --> 02:13:15.738
[APPLAUSE]

02:13:15.738 --> 02:13:18.666
KRISPY: So you guys come
up on stage here.

02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:28.600
So I think what everybody wants
to know is, what are you

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:29.714
gonna do with all that money?

02:13:29.714 --> 02:13:31.610
[LAUGHTER]

02:13:37.310 --> 02:13:38.645
MALE SPEAKER: So it's
a Google Play app.

02:13:38.645 --> 02:13:40.350
I don't know, I'll probably buy
some apps off the Google

02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:40.810
Play store.

02:13:40.810 --> 02:13:43.880
MALE SPEAKER: Buy some music
with it, or some games, yeah.

02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:46.369
KRISPY: Very good.

02:13:46.369 --> 02:13:47.335
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks, guys.

02:13:47.335 --> 02:13:48.301
KRISPY: Thanks, guys.

02:13:48.301 --> 02:13:52.648
[APPLAUSE]

02:13:52.648 --> 02:13:56.180
PAUL CARFF: All right, the
next up is wow factor.

02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:59.690
This is one that, when we
listened to the presentations

02:13:59.690 --> 02:14:02.265
and thought about what it was,
what it could be used for, and

02:14:02.265 --> 02:14:05.140
just kind of knocked our socks
off, as you heard me say

02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:07.790
during the weekend.

02:14:07.790 --> 02:14:09.783
We were really happy with
this, excited for

02:14:09.783 --> 02:14:10.604
where it could go.

02:14:10.604 --> 02:14:12.949
And I think the judges alluded
to this when they were up

02:14:12.949 --> 02:14:15.240
there talking about it.

02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:18.267
And that team is TVUS.

02:14:18.267 --> 02:14:21.189
[APPLAUSE]

02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:22.163
KRISPY: Come on up, guys.

02:14:22.163 --> 02:14:26.059
So, Paul, what do they win?

02:14:26.059 --> 02:14:27.895
PAUL CARFF: Will all the team,
yeah, please come on up here.

02:14:27.895 --> 02:14:29.180
I think there was four
or five of you.

02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:30.100
Four of you?

02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:33.330
Each of these team members
coming up now will each win a

02:14:33.330 --> 02:14:35.046
Nexus 7 tablet.

02:14:35.046 --> 02:14:45.189
[APPLAUSE]

02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:47.212
KRISPY: So if you can just stand
there and hold them up,

02:14:47.212 --> 02:14:50.280
and face me.

02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:51.050
Yay.

02:14:51.050 --> 02:14:54.459
[APPLAUSE]

02:14:54.459 --> 02:14:55.433
KRISPY: Thanks, guys.

02:14:55.433 --> 02:14:56.894
Good job.

02:14:56.894 --> 02:14:59.200
All right, Paul, who
we got next?

02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:02.530
PAUL CARFF: OK, as I talked
about at the weekend, how

02:15:02.530 --> 02:15:04.970
quickly you can get something
done, how far you can complete

02:15:04.970 --> 02:15:08.185
during the weekend, and the
viability of your concept, the

02:15:08.185 --> 02:15:10.070
one that everybody was
real happy with

02:15:10.070 --> 02:15:12.376
there was Team Giggle.

02:15:12.376 --> 02:15:12.875
KRISPY: Yay.

02:15:12.875 --> 02:15:14.372
[APPLAUSE]

02:15:14.372 --> 02:15:18.863
KRISPY: Come on up here, guys.

02:15:18.863 --> 02:15:20.113
PAUL CARFF: [INAUDIBLE].

02:15:21.870 --> 02:15:25.070
KRISPY: All right, Nexus 7s
for these guys as well.

02:15:25.070 --> 02:15:31.440
[APPLAUSE]

02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:39.205
KRISPY: Nice, keeping it real.

02:15:44.986 --> 02:15:46.070
Has everybody got one?

02:15:46.070 --> 02:15:46.700
There we go.

02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:48.788
OK, hold them up high.

02:15:48.788 --> 02:15:53.180
[APPLAUSE]

02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:54.430
KRISPY: Thanks, guys.

02:15:58.060 --> 02:16:00.180
Oh, the suspense is building.

02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:01.820
The suspense is building.

02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:05.686
PAUL CARFF: OK, viability's
important to these guys, so we

02:16:05.686 --> 02:16:09.380
want to recognize this next
team for that as well.

02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:12.180
I noted that during the weekend,
I thought they had

02:16:12.180 --> 02:16:14.260
the best teamwork of
the teams, as I

02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:15.370
watched over the weekend.

02:16:15.370 --> 02:16:18.926
And we all agree that they did
the best integrated team

02:16:18.926 --> 02:16:19.894
presentation.

02:16:19.894 --> 02:16:22.986
And that team is Glassrooms.

02:16:22.986 --> 02:16:33.718
[APPLAUSE]

02:16:33.718 --> 02:16:34.702
KRISPY: There you go.

02:16:34.702 --> 02:16:37.180
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
very much.

02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:40.276
KRISPY: Which apps are you
guys gonna install first?

02:16:40.276 --> 02:16:41.572
MALE SPEAKER: Google Maps.

02:16:41.572 --> 02:16:42.320
KRISPY: Google Maps?

02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:45.170
I think it's already
on there actually.

02:16:45.170 --> 02:16:49.458
So other than Google Maps,
what might you install?

02:16:49.458 --> 02:16:51.994
MALE SPEAKER: This is
a great question.

02:16:51.994 --> 02:16:52.980
KRISPY: All right, hold
them up high.

02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:54.230
Let me get a shot.

02:16:56.250 --> 02:16:56.920
Great.

02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:57.980
Thanks, guys.

02:16:57.980 --> 02:17:05.836
[APPLAUSE]

02:17:05.836 --> 02:17:08.410
PAUL CARFF: All right, we really
liked this next team

02:17:08.410 --> 02:17:11.389
because of what we thought was
the best use of the technology

02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:13.770
that we showcased during
the weekend.

02:17:13.770 --> 02:17:16.760
This team, they're all gonna
get Nexus 7 tablets.

02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:20.045
We don't have them all here,
but you all will get one.

02:17:20.045 --> 02:17:23.021
And that team is Team of Five.

02:17:23.021 --> 02:17:24.013
KRISPY: Yay.

02:17:24.013 --> 02:17:31.949
[APPLAUSE]

02:17:36.909 --> 02:17:39.226
PAUL CARFF: So please don't
leave after the show.

02:17:39.226 --> 02:17:41.732
Make sure you tell us name,
address, phone number so we

02:17:41.732 --> 02:17:42.490
can ship these to you.

02:17:42.490 --> 02:17:43.740
KRISPY: They will arrive
in the mail.

02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:47.325
Great.

02:17:47.325 --> 02:17:47.909
Thanks, guys.

02:17:47.909 --> 02:17:48.686
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

02:17:48.686 --> 02:17:49.640
KRISPY: Good job.

02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:50.890
Very tough.

02:17:54.410 --> 02:17:59.760
OK, so now, if we do simple
math, that was four teams?

02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:00.740
That was four.

02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:04.760
OK, so I think there's one prize
we have left to give

02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:05.719
away, isn't there?

02:18:05.719 --> 02:18:06.330
PAUL CARFF: There is.

02:18:06.330 --> 02:18:08.120
KRISPY: And it's kind of big.

02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:10.410
You might have noticed
it when you came in.

02:18:10.410 --> 02:18:13.250
Maybe it's on the stage now.

02:18:13.250 --> 02:18:15.420
Who might we be giving
this to, Paul?

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:17.680
PAUL CARFF: OK, so this is going
to be one of the teams

02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:19.919
that has already won, because
this is the overall prize for

02:18:19.919 --> 02:18:21.709
the overall best app.

02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:26.539
And the team captain gets to
have a fun time figuring out

02:18:26.539 --> 02:18:28.550
who's gonna get this
on the team.

02:18:28.550 --> 02:18:30.690
it's team TVUS.

02:18:30.690 --> 02:18:32.650
[APPLAUSE]

02:18:32.650 --> 02:18:35.100
KRISPY: Come on up, guys.

02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:45.410
[APPLAUSE]

02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:46.850
KRISPY: OK, now lift
it over your head.

02:18:50.850 --> 02:18:52.100
I'm kidding.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.856
Nice, good job.

02:18:56.856 --> 02:19:03.304
[APPLAUSE]

02:19:03.304 --> 02:19:05.288
KRISPY: He's not wasting
any time.

02:19:05.288 --> 02:19:06.280
Woo!

02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:10.248
[APPLAUSE]

02:19:10.248 --> 02:19:12.232
KRISPY: All right.

02:19:12.232 --> 02:19:15.650
Let's just give everyone a nice
round of applause again.

02:19:15.650 --> 02:19:18.035
I think we've had an
amazing weekend.

02:19:18.035 --> 02:19:20.897
We've had some incredible
apps built.

02:19:20.897 --> 02:19:24.713
All of you put in a lot of time
to this, and I've been

02:19:24.713 --> 02:19:26.559
very proud to participate
in this.

02:19:26.559 --> 02:19:28.310
You guys have been awesome.

02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:31.090
And thank you to the
judges again.

02:19:31.090 --> 02:19:33.730
And that sort of concludes our
little hackathon here.

02:19:33.730 --> 02:19:36.130
Hopefully you'll join us
for future events.

02:19:36.130 --> 02:19:37.330
This was worthwhile.

02:19:37.330 --> 02:19:40.630
Tell your friends, tell your
family, tell other developers.

02:19:40.630 --> 02:19:42.130
Build, build, build.

02:19:42.130 --> 02:19:43.030
Thanks, guys.

02:19:43.030 --> 02:20:12.037
[APPLAUSE]
