00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.220
Well, I think there's a number of things we need to tease apart

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.860
when we think about Net Neutrality.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.480
There's the fundamental arguments about what that means

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.060
in a technical sense, we could look at that.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.360
And there's the context in which people legislate for Net Neutrality,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.040
which is done on a per-country basis,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.260
and the way it fits into each country's legislation which leads to some of the slightly weird arguments that you hear.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.280
So I think if we start with the technicals, that's where I'm safest.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.480
I mean, the idea of Net Neutrality is that you shouldn't discriminate on the basis of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.680
you know, where IP packets come from, so what server you're talking to or who the client is

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.000
and you shouldn't discriminate on the basis of the protocol being used.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.260
Now we've seen this a number of times, we've seen

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.820
certain sites getting slowed down because, well, we don't like what they're doing.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.920
and this is the argument that Net Neutrality advocates would have which is that...

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.140
it can't be at the whim of a commercial provider, a service provider, to favour some website over another.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.180
And it's particularly the case that there's a concern that

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.700
For example, ISP's might be able to favour

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.240
some websites over others by asking people to pay for preferential access.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.660
So, you know, 'Large Company A' pays the internet service provider to make sure that their websites fastest

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.420
and that's considered a disadvantage when it comes to innovation,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.140
because obviously small, new, interesting start-ups

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.460
wouldn't have the budget to be able to go in and pay those extra premiums.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.600
And, in fact, you know, there's good arguments here about

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.780
much innovation has happened on the internet.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.960
We have seen lots of small companies grow into really big companies on the internet in a short time,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.560
and, we do have to remember that Amazon and E-Bay used to be

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.100
minnows compared to what was out there.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.700
But things like WhatsApp and Instagram

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.960
you know, if the likes of Facebook

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.920
or even before that - If Myspace had been able to buy bandwidth

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.900
and hence discriminate

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.200
against Facebook, then Facebook wouldn't have risen

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.680
These are arguments that could be had about the importance for the openness of innovation.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.620
So that's about discriminating based on the service, or the IP address.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.760
There's also discrimination by protocol, and this was quite popular for a number of years

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.760
because certain protocols came to the attention of the service providers because

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.700
they were consuming lots of bandwidth, particularly file sharing.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.420
Now,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.440
whether the ISP's took a moral stance on this and said that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.020
file sharing is wrong because it can only ever be used for breach of copyright

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.520
or whether they simply took the view that, well,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.780
we don't have enough bandwidth to go around

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.260
and these are heavy users

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.500
and they are ruining it for everyone else.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.840
Um...

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.360
It didn't really matter, but they started discriminating against that and BitTorrent was the classic

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.420
where lots of people were discriminating against BitTorrent.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.400
And then, of course, it turns out that many people were using BitTorrent for perfectly legitimate reasons.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.960
Yes there were bit torrent file sharing, and there still is - there's plenty of it around

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.520
Um... and uh..

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.400
but then World of Warcraft uses BitTorrent

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.520
to update it's very big patches.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.100
Very useful it is too because that means that

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.860
in the days that my kids used to play World of Warcraft as well

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.480
we only had to download one patch to the host and then it replicated inside the host so

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.820
there's perfectly good reasons.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.640
Discriminating against protocols is a very blunt instrument

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.960
because you have no idea what people are using it for

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.240
in reality.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.760
So there's some of the arguments about Net Neutrality.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.100
There's always the case that service providers have the right to engage in certain

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.300
traffic management, even where there is strong Net Neutrality law

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.740
in order to keep the network operating.  So, for example:

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.500
during a distributed denial-of-service attack

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.800
one of the things that lots of the ISP's do

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.420
is they will shut down where the attacks are coming from,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.020
and they will throttle them.  So you couldn't say that that's a bad thing.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.860
And likewise, as we already know, it's only in the UK,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.620
but elsewhere,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.940
there are varying degrees of blacklisting of websites,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.080
some of it because the material is clearly illegal.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.740
Others, for example, certain countries have a list of

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.240
sites reckoned to have adult content

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.900
and while not illegal

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.000
many countries have put in place legislation that says

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.860
that consumers need to opt-in to see that

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.140
rather than opt-out.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.080
So, there is filtering going on.  There are times when ISP's need to do things.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.480
And so, it really is about getting a sort of rational balanced view

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.840
on the technical side about promoting innovation

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.120
and not allowing incumbents to basically just hold on to their business

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.780
because they're the ones with the deep pockets.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.960
I think many people would view that as being critical to the success of the internet.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.100
So that's sort of the technicals. And that the -

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.420
what these Net Neutrality don't discriminate based on protocols or sources.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.340
Um,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.840
but then we get into a lot of the arguments that are going on right at the moment

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.940
in particular with the F.C.C.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.160
is really about, previously, the way in which it was decided that they would try to enforce Net Neutrality.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.600
which was to use a particular piece of prior legislation

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.860
that had been used to regulate phone companies for many years.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.900
And this leads to lots of arguments

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.440
which, in a sense, are to do with the details of that legislation

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.200
and not to do with, really, this issue of Net Neutrality.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.780
Buried in the legislation is the requirement for universal service revision and the ability to essentially,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.780
tax all the consumers a small amount

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.440
in order to make sure you can deliver service everywhere.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.340
And that was very important.  The universal service revision for telephony

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.960
was a major thing,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.960
80 years ago or something.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.020
Which was to make sure everyone could get a phone since it was considered critical

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.400
especially since we started moving to emergency services available by phone

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.340
and the ability - in our case in the UK - to make 999 calls

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.420
at any time.  And indeed we see that today.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.560
You see it on your mobile phone. You can always make emergency calls.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.840
Embedded in that legislation, you know, things were there for a perfectly sensible reason,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.920
but it's now being used as a bit of a bogey man.  To say that well, in the future

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.820
under the current U.S. legislation in the U.S.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.800
government could decide that these ISP's,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.540
most of them being these enormous tax levies,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.160
and that's being used as to why we can't possibly have this legislation on the vote.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.600
'Cause that's got nothing to do with anyone else anywhere else in the world.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.100
There's a very specific argument within the U.S.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.580
And so we need to tease apart those issues

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.140
that are to do with the underlying philosophy of Net 
Neutrality

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.120
and its, you know, enabling innovation

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.440
from the very specifics of what happens in any given country.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.680
So, again, we look at some other countries

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.400
I mean, E.U. has put in place legislation on Net Neutrality.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.560
Although there are some people that are concerned there's like loopholes there

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:17.580
because in Portugal at least one provider is charging differentially for different services.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:24.260
And that's viewed as, perhaps, not in the spirit of what the legislation was meant to achieve,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.360
but on the other hand, it is legal,

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.560
so they can currently do it under E.U. law.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.280
And there's other, you know, other countries have looked at this in different ways

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.000
India certainly - I was very concerned at some of the proposals around

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.400
sort of, free internet access for certain websites sponsored by certain large companies

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.500
would essentially prevent any indigenous service provision.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.520
You know, social media provision in particular coming forward.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.460
So that's - we're going to look at each country in turn, try to understand what is really going on

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.160
And the question is of course, could the change in the position in the U.S.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.520
radically effect anyone else outside the U.S.?

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.120
I mean most of this really reflects around

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.380
the consumer internet service provider.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:19.300
I will not transit the U.S. consumer networks in order to get to the services

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.060
even if I'm in the UK or elsewhere in Europe

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.620
or anywhere else in the world.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.400
We're going to some large server farm somewhere.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.920
The chances are we don't necessarily traverse those networks

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.180
So far a lot of people it wouldn't make any difference

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.860
but then actually we need to look more generally

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.440
at the way in which large scale servers are deployed these days.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.640
Most of your streaming video comes from a content delivery network

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.060
where the content has been replicated all around the planet.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.920
And the fact that, you know, in the UK

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.480
large amounts of our content will be coming

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.400
across the very narrow pond to Republic of Ireland.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.220
We'll be getting all of our content from there, if it's not already in the UK.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.400
Then in fact, what the U.S. does, and what U.S. carriers do in the U.S.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.240
will have absolutely zero effect on us what-so-ever.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.000
The danger always is, though, that the U.S.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.600
even though the government structure and everything else for the internet has changed over the years

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.300
the U.S. is still seen as such a leader in this area

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.380
and one of the concerns that many folks have is that

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:26.320
if they start going down this path, how many other people will think it's acceptable to go down that path?

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.440
Although I have to say, given that the E.U. in particular has put in place legislation

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.160
then I don't see us doing a U-turn on that.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.100
If by us I mean those of us currently in Europe.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.280
Let's see where Brexit takes us

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.860
with that legislation in the future.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.920
(People pay for services they want, they usually pay more if they want a better service, right?)

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.260
(What's different about this rollback of Net Neutrality in those terms?)

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.040
Well,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.160
yeah, the world is full of, you know, first class seats in planes and business class

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.560
and primo-economy and economy, and people paying different prices for different things.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.980
And you have in the internet world you would say that

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.920
there are different tower of structures available.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.360
Primarily, and here I can only really speak for the UK,

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.800
primarily simply based on our volume

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.720
so it's not about discriminating one against the other,

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.680
one service against the other, but 
simply by volume, so people will buy

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.600
- I think I have -

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.760
4GBs a month on my phone at the moment

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.820
I have depending on my usage.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.780
I have to have no limits at home because I simply cannot

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.420
control what amount of content that,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.720
you know, knowing that I have two grown (laughing) -

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:45.100
grown lads at home streaming 
videos all the time and playing online games,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.320
we would blast through any cap that anyone would want to put on us.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.920
So there is that, differential pricing for different services,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.580
and it's viewed as

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.400
just a very un-internet thing to do.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.040
To differentiate between the services

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.740
I think that's slightly different from having

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.220
you know, tiered prices

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:10.160
which simply reflects the amount of resource you are using on the network,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.460
and perhaps that's where it really comes down to.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.240
Is that, you know, a packet is a packet.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.240
I mean,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.440
yes, many of the ISP's

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.320
would like to look at some of those packets

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.600
and go, "That content is of higher value,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.300
and someone is making money out of it.  Why aren't we getting a piece of the action?"

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.100
You know, that's a very natural commercial behavior.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.100
But, um,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.840
we don't charge deferentially for a kilogram parcel, depending on what the contents are.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.940
I mean, maybe you pay the insurance, but the actual carriage is the same.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.660
So, it's the same principle here:

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.680
it shouldn't be that the content is the thing,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.560
which is either the service or the protocol,

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.600
should dictate these things are different

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.880
'cause bits is bits is bits.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.540
It's like,  it's just like how many of them do I want to move?

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.080
And I think if we stick with that,

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.460
then - that general principle -

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:59.620
with the exceptions I mentioned about, you know, defending the network against attacks

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.100
and other scenarios that are perfectly valid

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.600
for, as I say, an operator to manage their network;

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.640
let's stick with that principle then.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.920
You know, that seems reasonably sensible.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.800
The basis on which many view the internet of having been a great success.
