[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:07.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All
right, now, it's time

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.570
to learn about all the new, cool
stuff with Google Play Console.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.917
And I'm here with Matt
to tell us all about it.

00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:13.750
MATT: Hey everybody.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.420
We're super excited to be here.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.490
I/O is a big moment for
us with the Play Console

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.560
because we're all
about developers.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.570
As you probably know,
the Play Console

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.020
is what developers use to
publish their apps to Android

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.690
devices through the Play Store.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.150
And what we've seen
is over the years

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.260
we've gone from a Play
Console, which was simply

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.300
about getting an
app from A to B,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.960
from the developer to
the end consumer's phone.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.550
Now, it's so much more.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.500
There's really a
hugely diverse set

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.870
of tools that enable
developers to be

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.860
more successful with their app.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.040
And what we've found
is that the user base

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.870
has diversified as well.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.200
In addition to our core
audience of Android developers,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.300
we have product managers,
marketing managers.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.060
Many other users
wearing different hats

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.860
in the organization are
starting to use the tool.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.090
At I/O this year,
we're announcing

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.130
a whole new set of
features, as well as

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.200
updates to some of our
popular existing features.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.430
In some cases, these
features are helping apps

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.030
to be higher quality.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.500
And so, we're launching
Android Vitals,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.020
which is a whole new set of
reporting about bad experiences

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.970
on the Android device.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.330
So these are a user experience
where your app may be crashing,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.170
or your app may be
rendering in a slow way

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.000
or you may have excessive wake
ups, stuck wake locks that

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.550
are causing excessive
drainage on batteries.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.930
So we're going to
start revealing

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.560
that reporting to developers
that can help them to debug,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.530
understand more about optimizing
their app for the variety

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.610
of devices that are out there.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.340
And that's one of many different
new features we're launching.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.520
Another one, actually
you can see on the screen

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.420
behind me is the device catalog.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.800
So Android's diverse ecosystem
has been a tremendous strength

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.889
and source of the scale
of the two billion Android

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.710
devices that are out there now.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.580
But that diverse
ecosystem can also

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.730
be hard to navigate and
understand for developers

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.210
until now because the device
catalog is a much easier way

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.100
to browse the more than
1,000 different Android

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.810
certified devices.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.060
You can search and explore
these devices by spec like ram,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.050
like system on chip, and you can
then see reporting information

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.930
about the number of
installs your app has

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.710
on that particular device
or on that group of devices,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.340
how much revenue you're getting,
how your ratings compare,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.610
which can really help you
to understand whether any

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.680
of the bad behaviors,
any of these problems

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.980
that users may be having with
your app are concentrated

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.840
in a particular
area, which can be

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.550
critical to
optimizing and making

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.380
your app super high quality.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.950
So we're finding-- even just
in the initial testing, which

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.490
we've now completed, this
feature is rolling out

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.850
to all developers-- we found
out early testers have really

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.130
embraced these tools.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.530
It's really helping
them to be much more

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.940
surgical in the way they think
about targeting their app

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.520
and making it a great
experience for the end user.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.480
In addition to the features that
help developers to build higher

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.970
quality apps, we've
also got a number

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.340
of features which
help to mitigate risk

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.060
during the release process.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.540
And so, when you're releasing
a new version of your app,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.800
you may have an install base
of millions, potentially

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.870
hundreds of millions of users.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.130
If you're pushing out a
new version of your app,

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.880
it can otherwise
be a worrying time.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.340
You don't want to know that
bugs are causing uninstalls.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.380
You don't want to know
that information late.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.830
So we have a new
release dashboard

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.690
with very low latency
reporting that

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.700
helps you to have visibility
of these metrics on the hour,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.920
every hour as it's
starting to roll out,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.470
to a potentially global
audience of hundreds

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.480
of millions of devices.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.160
And so, this can help you
to manage your release

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.130
with a lot more confidence.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.430
A third area where we are
launching new features right

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.430
here at I/O is in
the business area.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.926
And so, developers, in
addition to building

00:04:23.926 --> 00:04:25.800
amazing experiences,
they want to make money.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.830
They want to grow
their business.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.520
We have a lot of new
reporting including

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.880
for app developers that have
a subscription-based model.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.270
You can look at
subscription by tenure,

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.420
look at cohorts from
when they've started,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.030
when they've installed
the app, and how that

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.250
lifecycle trends over time.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.240
You can help to see how
different inflection points are

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.480
contributing to subscription
renewals or people

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.842
leaving a subscription.

00:04:53.842 --> 00:04:56.050
So it can really help you
to manage your subscription

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.440
business.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.050
And then, in general,
we have a lot

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.820
of statistics that are available
through the Play Console.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.690
In the past, they weren't
always easily navigable.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.240
We have a new configurable
statistics page.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.940
And with that page,
developers are

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.120
much more easily able to
slice and dice these metrics,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.220
much more easily able to
create custom configurations,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.010
to compare different time
periods against each other,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.460
to compare one metric
against another,

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.740
and to introduce benchmarks
of whole classes of apps

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.040
so they can see how
some of their reporting

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.530
compares to peers who
make similar apps.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.287
And so we think that
features like this

00:05:36.287 --> 00:05:38.870
will really help developers to
manage their apps as a business

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.197
as well.

00:05:40.197 --> 00:05:41.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Wow.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.170
That was a lot of stuff.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.280
Thank you so much, Matt.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.070
MATT: Thank you.
