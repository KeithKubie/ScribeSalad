1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,420
This is Jocko podcast number
25 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,040
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,360
And once again we have this evening Jody
Mitic and if you didn't listen to the

4
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:21,720
last podcast,
this is our first double guests.

5
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,580
He's been on the podcast twice.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,880
We went so long on the first podcast
that we had to break it up into two

7
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:33,450
podcasts, but Jody had a lot
of, been through a lot of stuff,

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,280
had a lot of stuff to talk about.

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,650
Canadian army soldier sniper,
served in Afghanistan,

10
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,630
member of the city council up in Ottawa.
He's been on TV.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,240
He wrote this book right here.
Boom.

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,190
It's called unflinching,
the making of a Canadian sniper

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,650
and he was wounded in Afghanistan,

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,790
lost d,
double amputee below the knees.

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,870
And uh, we talked about that on the
first podcast. If you haven't lived on,

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,570
on podcast number 24,
if you haven't listened to that one,

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,720
listen to that one first so you get the
context of what we're about to go into

18
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:17,010
tonight. But welcome to the show once
again, Jodi. Awesome man. Thank you.

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,640
Appreciate it. Echo Charles.
Good evening. Good evening.

20
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,453
So

21
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,970
or this one since we already talked
for a long time on the first one.

22
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,270
It didn't feel like a long time. No
it didn't. But this time we got some,

23
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:38,271
we did get some questions
from the interwebs and it
was now do you strictly pull

24
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:43,410
from Twitter or do you get emails?
Email. Get on Twitter. I get Facebook.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,110
And what about your Instagram?
Okay.

26
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:48,900
The problem with Instagram is you
can't copy and paste from Instagram.

27
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,280
Oh that's on my phone into the document
that I travel with. And you're going,

28
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,170
so Twitter is the one that Twitter is
the easiest one. Facebook's fine too.

29
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,430
But I primarily use Twitter to get the
questions from all the troopers out there.

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,660
That and it keeps the questions short.
Yes. You have 140 characters. Yeah.

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,500
And we know I've got now,

32
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,520
so I have something called the the
question podcast question bank. Right.

33
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,210
Which I've caught, captured every
question that anyone's ever asked me.

34
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,180
They're in there and I just,
every time I, you know,

35
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:24,280
you got a chance of coming up
in the lottery every time. Nice.

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,970
Cause I go through it and I go through
all from the beginning and just look for

37
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:28,140
questions that are pertinent.

38
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,500
Maybe the pertinent of the topic
that I'm talking about that night.

39
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,860
Maybe it's pertinent to something
that's going on in the world,

40
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,370
but I just pick them and say,
oh yeah that,

41
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:40,470
that's a question that people have or
I'll see repetitive question people,

42
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,370
a bunch of different people will ask me
the same thing and then that becomes one

43
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:47,520
of the questions. But that's kind of how
we've been doing it. Right. So do you,

44
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,170
do you find you get, cause you, you know,
we, I don't want to hash it out too much,

45
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:57,171
but like your podcast went
from nonexistent to number
one in a boat like six

46
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,010
days or something crazy

47
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,520
like that. Like you, you left
the Joe Rogan podcast, did,

48
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,520
you did started your own hit number one.

49
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,550
And like now like do you
get too much correspondence?

50
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:12,500
Like how do you keep up like I've
noticed you are, you're like,

51
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,610
you must make Twitter a daily

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,790
pass out.
And I'll be honest with you,

53
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,850
I don't know how long I'm going to be
able to keep it up for. Yeah, because,

54
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,350
so you're approaching critical mass.

55
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm approaching critical mass
where I'm going to have two more.

56
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:30,150
I'm not going to be able to cause
right now I read every single,

57
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,670
probably always read them all. I mean
unless it just gets crazy. But I,

58
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:37,810
I I at least read them and I'll try
and respond. If it's something quick,

59
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,180
if it's not something I
can respond to immediately,

60
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,780
I'll just put it in the question bank.
And

61
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,250
would you ever consider getting
someone to do it for, you know,

62
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,450
like not answer but like take it all in,
record it like,

63
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:53,830
so you don't have to check yourself

64
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,580
maybe. I guess that seems like something
Tim Ferris would tell me to do,

65
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,790
which is we just smart or
a kid in Pakistan, right?
For eight bucks an hour. No.

66
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,330
And maybe that's a smart thing to do.

67
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,200
The problem I find with
that is I wouldn't,

68
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,980
if I was wanting to talk to me and I was
one of the troopers out there, I'd want,

69
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,930
I'd rather have take the chances of
not hearing anything back from me,

70
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,900
but know that the guy that actually
read this thing was me. Oh,

71
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:23,690
I ran 100% with you.
I've had people,

72
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,120
well tell me to hand my stuff over.
And I'm like [inaudible] cause that's me.

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,330
Yeah. There one reason why I
interact with Jocko on Twitter,

74
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:32,500
it's because I know it's job.

75
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,870
Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's a
feeling most people would have.

76
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:36,670
I know I would have.

77
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,860
Yes. Who you and guess who I unfollow on
Twitter when I realize, oh that's not,

78
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,890
that's us of him or her. Oh, okay. So

79
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,353
yeah,

80
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,380
for me it's like if you're in a
leadership position and you lead,

81
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,060
you send someone else to do your
bidding. Ooh, that's to me is not good.

82
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,710
And I wouldn't like that if I
was a follower. Yeah. Well, yeah,

83
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:03,420
to the whole point of social media.

84
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,690
And the other thing is I get a lot of
good feedback from people and also people

85
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,380
are always like, oh you inspire me and
you when I say you would inspire me too.

86
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,880
Cause there's people that are out
there grinding it out in their worlds,

87
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:22,540
in their lives. And I say man the world
is filled with a bunch of [inaudible],

88
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,970
a bunch of Lazy slackers that I'm used to.
You get on the, you get on the Twitter,

89
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,160
the Jocko troopers, man, they're getting
after it. All of them are charging. Yeah.

90
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,740
They're not getting out there and saying
hey I don't feel like I'm going to get

91
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,420
after it today.
I think I'm going to say no.

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,480
They're like it's four oh seven and I'm
in the game and I go damn I got to keep

93
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,230
my game in check.
Yep.

94
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,360
I love, I love it when I
see like I'll see ya. Yah.

95
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,010
Cause you always put the picture of
your watch when you wake up. Yes I do.

96
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:52,880
And then I'll see like a
retweet with like, you know,

97
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,910
somebody else's watch and there's like a
thousand watches with like your picture

98
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:58,040
and there's right next to it.

99
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,270
And I'm like, oh, it's 6:00 AM where I
am all. Look at that. I love you man.

100
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:06,080
But I ain't getting up at four.
That's just me. I don't have any legs.

101
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:11,060
So I got an excuse. Right.
I don't, but uh, but it's,

102
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:15,710
I feel the same cause it's
like it's, it's a duty now.

103
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,330
Yeah. You, we've put ourselves in a
position where others turned to us,

104
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,550
so now we got to turn to them.
And if we don't show up, Oh,

105
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,560
who we let in down. I'm not, it's not
that I'm letting me down, you know,

106
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,100
it's that you're going to let down all,
what do you got?

107
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:35,510
Like 25,000 Twitter followers or
something like 40 40 40 something.

108
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah. That's 40,000 people that
are waiting for your 4:00 AM. Yeah.

109
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,820
You know, that's, that's
good. But it keeps you, keeps
you on. It keeps you sharp.

110
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,370
It keeps you on the days.
I say it,

111
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:49,250
I got days where I'll look at my
prosthetic legs and he'll be like, ah,

112
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,350
the last thing I want to do is put those
things on today and then I'll think

113
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:57,790
about it. Everybody else
that is my position and said,

114
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,320
and I get it cause I get the
same thing, right? All, hey man,

115
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:04,160
thanks for being who you are
and I'm thinking about them.

116
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,130
Well they're going to get
up. So who am I? You know,

117
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,140
and I love when I find like
when I following guys like
you though helps me go on

118
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,970
a lazy bitch. People see I get a
lot done. Look at this guy and then,

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,270
oh look at her, look at that kid. Oh Man,

120
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,780
I better step my game up to normal people.

121
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,680
I know a bunch of regular people with
regular lives are doing what they can to

122
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,240
get ahead and dig in and then something
happened and that does fire me up.

123
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,240
You know what? That does? Fire me up
to see people. It feels good. Yeah.

124
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,710
And wanting to, yeah, just had
someone today, this is this.

125
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:43,670
A woman came into the gym. To
my gym. Yeah. And she said,

126
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,340
they called me down. Oh,
there's someone here to see you.

127
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,150
I'll come down and it's a woman whose
daughter is fired up for the podcast,

128
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:53,000
fired up for the book.
They actually,

129
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,470
they actually named it and
I have a crossfit gym. It's
called crossfit Overwatch.

130
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,170
I like, yeah, you can't give me
tingles. Yeah. Yeah. And it go there.

131
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,370
Great Nouns of obviously because of,
you know,

132
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:09,320
Overwatch as we talk about in the book.
And so yeah,

133
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,240
here's this woman, she was
like, to be honest with you,

134
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,440
she was kind of tearing up a
little bit like that, fired up.

135
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,010
How humbling is it when somebody
feels like that around you? It's,

136
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,680
it's motivating to me.
Nobody,

137
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,700
it's today think that you can have that
you like in my case me that Jody Mitic,

138
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,410
the guy who just wanted to be a soldier
and somebody is that like fired up to

139
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,960

140
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,800
Well I gotta I gotta I gotta keep my
game up. Yeah. And it's weird too,

141
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:43,970
and we actually talked about this on the
podcast wants is like don't put me on a

142
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:48,971
pedestal as if I'm something
great cause I'm not man.

143
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,650
I'm not. I'm, I'm uh, I'm weak
and soft and do stupid things.

144
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,130
You know what I mean?
Don't put

145
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,420
me on a pedestal, but put
yourself on a pedestal, you know,

146
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:05,250
put yourself on a pedestal and rise
up yourself. Don't worry about me.

147
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,510
Spring board off my back
and go to a higher level.

148
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,850
That's what I want to see happen.
That's what I would want.

149
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,140
I don't want people to
put me on a pedestal.

150
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:16,860
I want them to stand on my shoulders and
go higher and further than anything I

151
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:18,720
could ever do.
That's what I like.

152
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,530
Did it, did it take you, this is
a personal question on my end.

153
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,300
Did it take you awhile to see
like when somebody would say,

154
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,960
you inspire me and thank
you for being who you are.

155
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,260
Did you accept that at first or did
you have to tell them like Donna,

156
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,790
now I don't it like you just said like,
I'm nothing special.

157
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,050
But how long did it take you before you
would, except that compliment without,

158
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:44,340
without dismissing it.
I literally,

159
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,600
right. The first person that's said that
to me, I said, no man, you inspire me.

160
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,680
You know, because your guess
what? I've had a great life.

161
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,330
I've had a great life and I'm
stoked. Right. Okay. But look at you.

162
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:01,110
You're saying I inspire you, look at
you or inspire me. You're a single mom

163
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,590
with two or three jobs getting after
it. And by getting after it, I mean,

164
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:08,930
waiting tables,
uh,

165
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,760
working in as an admin assistant and
then doing some babysitting at night.

166
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,570
Yeah. And helped me with homework and
making lunches and, and, and, right. Oh,

167
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:23,110
so Jocko is really, really, no, actually
you are. Yeah. You're fired up. Yeah.

168
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,620
I just, I asked because it
took me awhile because I, I,

169
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,970
I had a real hard time with people looking
at me like that and I actually would,

170
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:36,020
I would be like dismissive
of it. At first. I'd be like,
Nah, what are you doing?

171
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:38,880
What are you talking about? I'm just,
I'm nobody special. Like don't, don't,

172
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,753
don't say that.

173
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:45,310
And I realized I was being a bit of
a dick by completely dismissing their

174
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,070
feelings for, for, for the
situation. And then it was until I,

175
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,940
until I realize though, and then that's
when I realized I went, oh, this is,

176
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,910
this is real. These people
actually do feel this. And I'm,

177
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,390
who am I did to dismiss their feelings,
you know?

178
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,350
So I try to try to use it to be
stronger and realize like, you know,

179
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:08,840
like this is real.
Like people are looking up to me.

180
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:10,220
So now I've got to live up to that role.

181
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,920
I'll tell you another thing that I tell
people when they say something like that

182
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:16,050
to me, I tell them, look,

183
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,620
there's many people that have done way
more than me and sacrificed way more than

184
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:19,980
me.

185
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,980
100% and the fact that
you think that about me,

186
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,040
the only reason you think that
about me is cause you know me.

187
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,720
You know who I am because I
stepped out of the darkness and,

188
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,340
and into the public view.

189
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,370
But otherwise there's a bunch of

190
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,130
a bunch of warriors that they're
never going to know their name.

191
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,250
They're never going to be able
to say, hey, you inspire me.

192
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,940
So there's throwing that in my direction
and I tell them, look, you don't,

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,100
I don't inspire you. You get
inspired by what I stand for. And

194
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,100
what I represent is thousands and
thousands of servicemen seals.

195
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:04,570
Yes. Soldiers, yes. Marines.
Yes. All of them. Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,640
That's what, that's what you're saying.
And, and so on behalf of all of them,

197
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,490
I get it. Cause you know what, those
soldiers, those marines, those seals,

198
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,070
those guys in special operations,

199
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,020
they inspire me too.
And so I think there's,

200
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,340
that's kind of the, it's a give
and take. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, no,

201
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,510
I had to ask you,
because I went through such a with,

202
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,850
with the legs and everything, I was
just trying to accept not having legs,

203
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,660
nevermind that I had a woman
come up to me and say, uh,

204
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,530
I had to like add several actually. But
this, this was like maybe the first,

205
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:45,400
I think she said I lost a hundred
pounds because of you. And I'm like,

206
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:48,850
first of all, you don't even look like
you weigh a hundred pounds. And I'm like,

207
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,110
Huh, what did I do? I'm just being me.

208
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,610
And that was the one that really in my
mind, like at that moment I went, okay,

209
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,560
there's I gotta I gotta reevaluate
what's going on here. Yeah.

210
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,200
I can't just dismiss this as I'm
just Jody Mitic anymore. Clearly,

211
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,640
clearly there's something going on.

212
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,720
Well I think your story in particular
strikes a real chord with people because

213
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:14,680
you had to overcome some crazy adversity.

214
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,750
And by the way, your adversity,
while challenging as you know,

215
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:24,700
well there's guys with much
more challenging adversity
than you've had 10 fold,

216
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,150
a hundred fold. And so, you know,

217
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:31,660
for me it's a joke for you,
you at least get a sense.

218
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,130
But you and me both know and we've seen
guys and we know guys that have had it,

219
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:41,380
like I said, infinitely worse than
you. Unimaginable, unimaginable.

220
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,620
And so those guys that get up with
their issues and press on and drive on,

221
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,100
look to them for inspiration.
Absolutely look right past me.

222
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,390
Look right past Jodie, look at those
guys who are doing what they're doing.

223
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,010
And that to me is,
is where inspiration comes from.

224
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,740
And so I guess inspirations
around you everywhere. Yeah,

225
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,780
really is if you open your eyes to it
and you look at what other human beings

226
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:12,550
do, it's, it's amazing. Yeah.
It's amazing. I love, I love it.

227
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,560
I love humans. Humans are such, we're
such a species, that study, you know,

228
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,340
like, so anyway, I know we
wanted to get to the inner webs,

229
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:25,460
but I wanted to have that discussion
with you before we moved on because, uh,

230
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,580
it was just important to me to hear that
the discussion has been had Roger and I

231
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:35,380
think it's, yeah, I think it's a, I
think it's awesome. I think it's awesome.

232
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,590
And yeah, like I said,

233
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,170
I see why people are coming
up and telling you that. Yeah,

234
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,180
I agree with them actually. Well,
thanks buddy. All right. Make me blush.

235
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,880
We need to get to some questions from
the interwebs. No. Okay, now I get it.

236
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,823
All right,
here we go.

237
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,683
Okay.

238
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:58,450
Mental exercises to learn to control
one's pulse and breathing in really

239
00:14:58,451 --> 00:15:02,470
stressful situations or when very nervous.
What do you do?

240
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,700
Mental exercises.

241
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:10,701
So we touched on this very
briefly in the last episode,

242
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,620
which was on the book and
where I talk a little bit about

243
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,940
sniper training.
Um,

244
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,770
visualization is probably
your biggest tool and in what?

245
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:30,750
In my experience, train, train
the shit out of it. Train, train,

246
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:33,120
train. And when you think you've
trained enough to keep training,

247
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,210
but when you're not training,
think about it.

248
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,470
Think about it.
The more you think about it,

249
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:45,270
become in tune with yourself. Okay?
I'm going to get a little spacey here.

250
00:15:45,271 --> 00:15:48,870
Little earthy,
just sit there

251
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,780
because you know what you do when
your sniper, you fucking sit there,

252
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,450
you have a lot of time to yourself.

253
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,480
You can't really talk
cause you got a job to do.

254
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,780
And what you gotta do is you just got to,

255
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,990
okay,
I know my heart rate's gonna go up here,

256
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,330
but I got to do my best to make sure it
doesn't overwhelm my motor functions.

257
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,760
And you can control it pretty meant that
pretty easily if you prepare yourself

258
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:24,990
for that moment. But it's all about
preparation, training and visualization.

259
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,600
Um, even like even making
the shot, you know,

260
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:33,450
like Tim Kennedy was on here, right.
And you talked about dry firing,

261
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,910
consider dry firing that
this is your dry firing for,

262
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,070
for your, for controlling yourself, for
your brain, for your brain. Exactly.

263
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,930
And dry fire your brain
like that. And, and um,

264
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,880
it only comes from experience.

265
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,510
Now I guess there's probably
some exceptions of the rule
out there that are just

266
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,650
born to be cold blooded killers that
second they get behind a barrel. But,

267
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,360
but for me it was,

268
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,390
it was visualization and just preparing
to accept the feelings that were coming

269
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,490
and also overriding them cause
that they could still be happening,

270
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,090
but you can still control yourself
with the right kind of preparation.

271
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,740
And it's also a perishable
skill. Funny enough, I realized,

272
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,160
I don't know if that
answered the question.

273
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,960
No, I think that's, I think
that's good. And I think for me,

274
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,270
one thing that I, that I
know I do, and this is a,

275
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,570
I guess it's,
it may be considered a technique,

276
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,210
but it's like the technique creates the
solution. Let me explain this to you.

277
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,540
One of the things that I
do in stressful situations,

278
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,710
there's something that I always try and
do and that is no matter what's going on,

279
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,790
I try and remain calm in my voice.

280
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,280
So when things are going crazy, I try
and get on the radio and say, hey,

281
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:03,330
we need two more people over here.
Not, we need two more people over here.

282
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,530
So if you're gonna talk in a calm,
controlled voice,

283
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,970
then you can't be breathing hard.
You can't be excited,

284
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,570
you can't get angry,
you can't get frustrated.

285
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:20,571
You have to lock all that up and get it
under control before you open your lips

286
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,910
and start saying something.

287
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,980
And so I'm always very focused
on I am going to sound calm,

288
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,300
cool and collected when I opened
my mouth that way. And when,

289
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:34,500
and in doing that,

290
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,980
the only way to make that happen is
to do everything we just talked about.

291
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,280
Control your breathing, control
your pulse, control your emotions,

292
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,970
get all those things under
control, and then say, all right,

293
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:47,370
we need two more guys
down here immediately now.

294
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,230
And everybody goes, oh,
okay, let's make this happen.

295
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,190
And for coming from you, especially
you're the, in your, in your case,

296
00:18:57,191 --> 00:19:01,150
you are the boss. So if you're, if
you're calm, cool and collected,

297
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,260
that translates to your troopers.
It absent. Right. So when we win,

298
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,180
and it would for us as well, when we were
doing Overwatch, you know, six to six,

299
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:11,950
three you move into your left.

300
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,270
Well, no, no, no, no. Your
left. Right. Think about what
happens. What do you do that,

301
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,380
imagine if I went shit six there on
your left or on your left. Right.

302
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,120
I'm freaking out.

303
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,720
Uh, they would, it would all be,
it would be lost. But you're,

304
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:28,130
that you're that voice because we're
over snipers or Overwatch. We, they,

305
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:31,910
the troops feel better when
they know, okay, there's
snipers doing Overwatch. Okay,

306
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:36,470
we can, we're going to be okay. So if I
get on the radio and talked the same way,

307
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,390
so you know, nope. Okay. Yet a
justifier 400 meters north, you know,

308
00:19:41,391 --> 00:19:45,020
fire for effect. Roger that, you know,
like you got to, that's a good point.

309
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:45,854
I never even thought of that.

310
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,150
I think airline pilots trained that cause
you know when you hit the turbulence

311
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,640
and there, oh hey guys,
sorry about that term. Yeah,

312
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,620
just go ahead and put your seat and
I, yeah. Actually if you hear sully,

313
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,180
the guy that landed all may
river, he's like that. Yeah. Yeah.

314
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:03,014
We're going to have to write it down.

315
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:07,850
They have to teach them that because
that's where people are so apprehensive

316
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,750
when they're in the plane. Part
about that is he's like, yeah,

317
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:14,540
well we'll be in the river. And
the guy, he's like, uh, say again.

318
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,600
We'll be in the Hudson,
Roger out and like the plane,

319
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,260
it's like real time you're watching the
video and he's just like, yeah, yeah,

320
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,470
we're in the river. We're in the
room. It's like, Oh man, what? Oh,

321
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,650
by controlling these items,
in order to control his voice,

322
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:29,740
he's got to control his breathing.
He's got to control his temper.

323
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:34,160
He's got to control his emotions. And
so that's what I do in those situations.

324
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:36,170
And I'll tell you what,
if I haven't, if I don't,

325
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,000
if I'm not in a situation
where I need to talk,

326
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,080
I'll just talk to myself and be like,
okay, you know, just say that in my head.

327
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,970
All right,
what is the next book?

328
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,780
I know we're spending a lot of
time on the first question. That's,

329
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,160
that's what saved my life.

330
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,500
Oh hmm. Staying, if I had
gone into shock, dude,

331
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,680
I'd be dead. Right? Yeah.
And I say it in the book.

332
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:58,570
I say I did my best to go into the zone.

333
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,640
So I know I'm bleeding it and
I know this and I know that.

334
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:07,870
But in my mind it was let
the system do its job.

335
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,810
Okay. Everything's gonna be fine,
Jody. It's okay. And I just,

336
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,980
I just kept saying, talking to myself,
you know, visualizing what, okay.

337
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:19,660
So the chopper's going to come in,
you know,

338
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:22,990
and I just visualized each step and my,
my,

339
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,500
but the whole point to it was I
couldn't have my pulse, you know,

340
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,520
Jack Hammer or otherwise or bloods
lost more blood loss and then your,

341
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:31,660
and what happens,
right?

342
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:36,100
Blood gets sucked into your core when you
go into shock and that sucks it out of

343
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:39,610
your brain. I said I'd of
everywhere we were, you know,
I needed to stay conscious.

344
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:43,540
So No. Anyway, long long
answer for one question,

345
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:47,530
but this is also something, you
know, you got to learn. Practice,

346
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,030
keep practicing it.
You'll figure it out.

347
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,270
Yeah. And always, and we talk about
this again all the time on the podcast.

348
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,330
Inoculate yourself to these
stressful situations. That's right.

349
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,530
[inaudible] that's the guy's name.
Yes. Stress Inoculation. Yup.

350
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,660
Inoculate yourself to the stress so
that when you, you get used to it. Yeah.

351
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,400
The more stressful such, I mean training,
going through training, man, they,

352
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:11,650
they put all kinds of stresses at you
so that you learn to deal with it.

353
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,960
And if you want to learn how to cook,

354
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:17,320
that's your time to practice controlling
all those things. Absolutely.

355
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,370
And I'm not trying to go level
seven Zen Buddha on you all.

356
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:24,730
Like you need to get in the mind state
to control your breathing. Like no,

357
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,590
it's a practical thing. It's a real thing.
It's not a yoga thing. It's a practical,

358
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:33,640
real thing of, Hey, get calmed
down, take a deep breath,

359
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,880
get yourself under control.
Now it's time to talk and give clear,

360
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:38,690
concise orders that are calm.
Yeah.

361
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,600
Or make that shot or crack one
off if you're the sniper zone.

362
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:47,440
Lack of bad guy.
All right,

363
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,980
next question.

364
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:57,270
What does God think of the soldier first
principle in the Canadian armed forces

365
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,830
is expertise such as his
being lost due to this?

366
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:09,260
Oh, I think they're talking about the,
um, university ability of service,

367
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:13,940
which means, uh, everyone
must be able to deploy.

368
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,673
So

369
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:22,180
I didn't realize what it meant until
I lost my feet and instead in my mind,

370
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,900
you know, this was something else.
Okay, I can't deploy anymore,

371
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,670
but I can go to the sniper
school and teach the next
generation of snipers. Sure.

372
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:34,760
But you're not going to get promoted and
this and that no more. You know, like,

373
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,870
Huh, I was supposed to get promoted
to surgeon. Like, what do you,

374
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,720
what are we talking about here?

375
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,490
So university out of the service
says if you are not deployable,

376
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:48,350
you're not employable and you can't be
promoted and you can't get any courses in

377
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:53,270
this, that and the thing. So because of
it, we lose a lot of corporate knowledge.

378
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,680
Right. So I was, like I said, I was a,

379
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:57,500
what we call a master
sniper at advanced sniper.

380
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,310
And that doesn't mean I get access to the,
um,

381
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Canadian temple of sniper sniper down to
see the secret 13th scroll or anything.

382
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:10,070
It just means I'm allowed to do the
paperwork and handout qualifications and

383
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:10,904
stuff like that.

384
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,500
Now it is a very difficult qualification
to achieve and they spend a lot of

385
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:20,501
money getting me there and that value
is completely erased with my injuries.

386
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,760
So soldier first is,
if you're not deployable yet,

387
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:31,040
then you're going to, you're unemployable.
Yeah. Okay. So under that system,

388
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:35,690
you get however many years to recover from
whatever your injury is at that point,

389
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,750
if you're not recovering
or going to recover,

390
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:42,600
they will then begin the process
to release you from the force. Acto

391
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,710
they're convinced that it's required
because of the size of our military.

392
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:56,180
Where my take is,
I believe that the opposite,

393
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,830
because of the size of our military.
You want guys like me doing the training,

394
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,330
the guys with the experience,

395
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,900
the guys who want to be there to train
the guys and can't deploy for as long as

396
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,411
possible.
Now,

397
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:12,590
I'm not saying put me in a spot and
leave me there for 15 years to become a

398
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:13,424
dinosaur,

399
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,810
but allow me to pass on the
knowledge I have and remain useful.

400
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,410
Right. But, but they, and
they say you can for the,

401
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,270
for the limited number of years,
and they,

402
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:28,490
they offer these things that
they call extensions in that,

403
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,210
but you're not going to get promoted.
So forget about a better pension.

404
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:35,030
You're not going to do this and
you're not gonna do that. Um,

405
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,350
and the dichotomy as the word that I,

406
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,280
I never used to use that word as much.
I used it.

407
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,360
I was one of the few people use it,

408
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:48,830
but not nearly as much as since I started
listening to the Jocko podcast. Um,

409
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,120
the dichotomy of it is that
we,

410
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:54,440
our version of the Pentagon,

411
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,540
and I'm going to get a lot
of trouble for saying this,

412
00:25:56,541 --> 00:26:01,541
but there's a whole lot of people whose
physical fitness probably keeps them

413
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:05,180
from being able to do anything
and they're not being,

414
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,880
they're not getting least suited now.

415
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,050
And it's one of those like open secrets,

416
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,010
you know what I'm saying? And, uh,

417
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,520
and I'm sorry if people get mad
at me for that and stuff, but

418
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,510
I'm willing to run half marathons and,

419
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,390
and do crossfit without
legs and stuff like that.

420
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,640
And you still don't want to
promote me or keep me? Well,

421
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,210
I'm going to point out a few
issues with your system and I,

422
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,650
I don't blame the military, right? Like
in the military as a system, like we said,

423
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:40,750
the big green machine or roll on with
or without you at some point you gotta

424
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,070
worry about you.
And that's at some,

425
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,160
I just started worrying about more about
me than a boat, then the boat, mommy,

426
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,880
the big mommy military.
And, but then I, you know,

427
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:52,230
when I look back over my shoulder,

428
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:55,890
every now and then I go tell me
that guy over there is deploying,

429
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,200
show me what, show me his Med med
show. Many pull ups. Can he do? Yeah.

430
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,620
And so anyway, it's, um, I believe it,

431
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,390
I'm sure someone somewhere thinks it's
a good idea, but I think the millet,

432
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,460
the Canadian forces should reexamine
what it actually means because it's very

433
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:18,630
black and white. Yeah. That's, and
there's no room for, um, oh, walk. Okay.

434
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:23,010
So here's an example, real quick example
and we can move on. We used to have, um,

435
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,480
we're in no rush,
Jodi.

436
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,200
We used to have a thing
we call acting lacking.

437
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,130
So you are acting as sergeant lacking
qualification and it would be a way to

438
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:38,460
like promote guys that maybe
can't quite get, you know,

439
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:41,880
maybe they did have an
injury or something and um,

440
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:47,350
and they got rid of it as we
went back into combat basically.

441
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:47,850
Yeah.

442
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,850
So you had all these guys getting
smashed in combat now getting told like,

443
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,100
oh yeah, we can't make an exception
so you can't get promoted.

444
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:59,280
So I was one of them.
I was on the cusp of being promoted.

445
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:03,000
Sergeant just had to come home and do a,
what we call,

446
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,300
it's called a small arms course and it
makes you an expert in all small arms in

447
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:09,810
the infantry and how to train
with them to train troopers.

448
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,520
And then you get promoted surgeon and
when you learn some surgeon leadership

449
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:19,110
stuff as well. But um, I was number
one in my regiment to go do it.

450
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,360
And when I got, after I got
wounded, they're like, yeah,
sorry man. I'm like, well,

451
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:27,960
can I just be acting lacking so my
pension is better? Like, Oh yeah,

452
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:32,220
we don't do that anymore. Yeah,
that's, I can see why. I mean,

453
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:34,830
we're only in combat.
Guys are getting smashed all the time.

454
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:39,831
So why would you want to promote them
and let you know like the administrative

455
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:44,020
side of the military? It can be
very a heartless sometimes. Yeah.

456
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:49,470
I remember when I was in San Antonio
telling this to some medical colonels and

457
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:54,210
she was like, Huh. She's like, I promoted
a guy who's in a coma the other day.

458
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,740
We don't, we don't give a shit down here.
No. If you, if we think you deserve it,

459
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:02,730
you get your promotion because we know
it makes things better for you when you

460
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:03,564
get out.

461
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,370
So should I be bitter about
not getting promoted? No,

462
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,270
I'm, I'm, I'm over it, but I'm bitter.

463
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:15,240
You didn't get promoted how you like them
apples. Yeah. Thank you. But you know,

464
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:19,330
at the same time, there's a lot
of amazing people in a lot of, uh,

465
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,310
difficult spots in of
leadership and you know,

466
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:27,200
you gotta pick your battles too.
Yeah. Right. So anyway, I'll tell you,

467
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,920
as you pointed out,
yeah, that's really good.

468
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:34,350
What you said about the guys getting
promoted that or Tacoma. That's awesome.

469
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:38,940
I can't speak to the whole military.
I can say in the seal teams we did a,

470
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,190
we do an outstanding job of
taking guys that get wounded. And

471
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,760
as a matter of fact,
one of my guys who was real bad Ryan job,

472
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,240
who is awesome,
big goals.

473
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,050
Then he got shot in the face,
got blinded,

474
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,300
and he was like,
I'm staying in.

475
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,600
He's telling me I'm staying in. I mean,
you wanted to come back to Iraq. When he,

476
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,280
before he found out he was born there,
he was blind.

477
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:06,490
He still wanting to come back. But, um,

478
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,090
then like when we came home
from deployment and everything,

479
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:16,030
and you know, he's, he's
blind and he says, yeah,

480
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:19,300
I want to stay in the teams.
And I talked, I was, uh,

481
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,530
I was friends with the admiral that was
in charge of all the seals. And I said,

482
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:27,430
hey, sir, I know this might sound
crazy, but, you know, running job,

483
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,020
he wants to stay in the teams
and just keep being a team guy.

484
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,450
And he's like, we'll find a
job for him, which is awesome.

485
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,970
It is awesome.
But was he going to get promoted?

486
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,090
He would've given where he would just,
they would have put, found a job for him.

487
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,430
And he actually ended up saying,
you know,

488
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:48,550
what kind of became to the same
conclusion that you made, which is like,

489
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:53,470
you know what, I can't do like the
actual job of being a seal. Now.

490
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:56,230
He had tons of lessons. He
could have passed on, passed on,

491
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:59,530
which would have been awesome. Uh, but he,
he made a decision, hey, you know what,

492
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:04,280
I'm gonna move on. Okay. And
so he got out. So what would
have happened? Don't know.

493
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,740
There's, he, I, he have stayed
in and I would hope, you know,

494
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,600
that was one admiral who was a great guy,

495
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:14,940
who had a great attitude and
supporting and supporting the teas.

496
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,440
And that's the one thing that,
that admiral always said to me.

497
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,020
This is an admiral I worked
for for about 13 months.

498
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:23,950
I was the aide to the admiral in charge
of all the seals. Outstanding Guy.

499
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,910
But one of the things that he would
say during meetings and you know,

500
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:30,040
he'd be all these politicians
that you're talking about,

501
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,170
all these administrative people
that you're talking about,

502
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:34,420
all the big bureaucracy
that you're talking about.

503
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,840
And he would see what asked them. They'd
go through their big presentation about,

504
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:39,640
we're going to cut this, we're going
to do that, we're going to buy this,

505
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:41,770
but we're not gonna buy that.
And he'd say,

506
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,190
how does this affect the platoons?

507
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,530
Oh like,
cause cause people would forget that.

508
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:52,270
The whole reason you're there.

509
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,660
The whole reason to any
of that infrastructure or
anything is there is how does

510
00:31:55,661 --> 00:31:59,260
it support the platoons?
How has it helped the seals?

511
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,500
How's it help the machine gunner?
How does it help the sniper out there?

512
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,220
The radio man, the guys that are
actually doing the job that we have,

513
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,930
and I say this to businesses sometimes
when I work with businesses and I see

514
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:15,610
that there are infrastructure's getting
super big and they're starting to impose

515
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,870
plans and and restrictions and I say,
Hey,

516
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,190
remember what you're here for.

517
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:25,240
You're here to support that this guy
that's on the manufacturing floor or this

518
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:29,320
guy that's out there selling or this this
woman that's working with the patients

519
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:30,610
or whatever business it is,

520
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,820
because it's very easy to
be in a leadership position
and forget about what the

521
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:40,580
ground troops are doing.
No debt and that's a horrible thing.

522
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,941
That's a horrible thing.

523
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:44,660
And then this thing that you're
talking about soldier first,

524
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:47,330
which sounds to me like
soldier last because they
don't want to take care of the

525
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:52,190
soldiers if they want to do that
because there's nobody better to prepare

526
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:55,250
soldiers for combat then soldiers
that had been in combat. Yeah.

527
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,300
If I want to learn sniper, you know
how I want to learn it from in Canada,

528
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,170
Jody Mitic, you know, I want to learn
it from someone that's like you.

529
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,420
If I were to learn how to patrol
and one wonder for someone like you,

530
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,460
I don't want to learn it from a guy that
theoretically understands it. Right.

531
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:13,400
That's not the same thing.
I want the real deal.

532
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,170
Yeah. It's, it's a policy.
Again, they defended,

533
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,050
they think it's necessary.
What are you gonna do?

534
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,940
Big Green machine just keeps on rolling.
All right.

535
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,790
This is a similar question
to what we've already had,

536
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,080
but I'm going to do it again.

537
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,520
How do you silence distraction no matter
how important to achieve your number

538
00:33:40,981 --> 00:33:41,970
one priority.

539
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:48,000
Hmm.
On op,

540
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,760
when I was still a sniper, I actually
had a much easier time of this. Um,

541
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,770
I'm, I'm, I'm add in a lot of ways and,

542
00:33:58,771 --> 00:33:59,604
uh,

543
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,070
whatever I want to focus on add doesn't
mean that you can't focus on stuff.

544
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:07,770
It just means like when the teacher
tells you to focus on something,

545
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:12,290
you're busy doing other
stuff. And so, right,

546
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,340
it's not a deficit disorder.

547
00:34:14,341 --> 00:34:16,590
It's that I don't give a shit
what you're trying to show me,

548
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,450
but that right there, that's
what I want to look at. So I, um,

549
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:26,340
I had a way of just, I would like
if I had to watch a crossroad,

550
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I've watched that crossroad was my whole
world and it wouldn't matter what we've

551
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,500
now done. It doesn't mean I
wasn't situationally aware,

552
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:40,910
but I would watch that crossroad like my
life depended on it or somebody's life

553
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:45,990
depended on it, which, which had
a lot of times it did. And, um,

554
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,650
if I have enough,
what I found actually,

555
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,670
and this is one of the reasons why
I'm starting to meditate again,

556
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,080
I'm seeing a therapist again.
Um,

557
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,630
I'm listening to Jocko podcast
and reading extreme ownership.

558
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,153
Um, no, I'm,

559
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,240
I'm being serious is that I appreciate
in my civilian post-military post wounded

560
00:35:09,121 --> 00:35:12,420
post addiction,
um,

561
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:18,270
phase world. I've, I've lost
a little bit in my ability to,

562
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:22,440
to, to, to push out the
input. I don't want,

563
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,170
I have a hard, I used to read a
book a month at the, at the minimum,

564
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,420
and I'm not talking like I'm talking
like a book, you know, that I showed you,

565
00:35:33,421 --> 00:35:36,780
I had the 33 laws of war in my suitcase.

566
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,080
I've been reading that for three
months and I'm maybe half done.

567
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,440
I have a real hard time now,
um,

568
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,320
achieving that,

569
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:51,620
that zone of zero distraction and I'm
trying to get it back because it's really,

570
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,140
I get a lot done. You
know, I have, I have my,

571
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:02,800
my politics, I have the book,
I do keynote speeches. Um,

572
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,740
I have my kids. Um, I have
all my hobbies. You know, I'm,

573
00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:11,741
I'm trying to support veterans support
charities that support veterans and uh,

574
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,080
and I still get a lot done,

575
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:18,081
but I could get so much more done if I
could turn off some things in my mind

576
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:20,880
sometimes.
And I don't know what,

577
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,780
what's happened or what if this is
what an addict's brain is lake now,

578
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:28,830
or if it's just, I'm always seeking
something, I get bored easily.

579
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,380
That's part of the EDD.
I've always had that.

580
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,540
But when I found something and latched
onto it, I used to be like just,

581
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,890
I was 100% focused until I became,
you know,

582
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,760
I got as much of that as I could and
then I would move on to the next thing.

583
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:50,040
And, um, yeah, I, I, I
gotta be honest. I've,

584
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,350
I've visualization though,

585
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:55,830
going back to the first question
is one way that you can do it.

586
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:01,670
And I've started meditating to
get my mind back into that state.

587
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:07,320
I used to do a lot of yoga and I
used to do a lot of mindfulness, uh,

588
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,660
not training.
I don't know what people see now.

589
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,370
It's called mindfulness
training back then.

590
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:15,390
I think it was just called reflection
or something. I call it Jujitsu.

591
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:20,340
Yeah. Well, when I'm done the
bodybuilding show in November,

592
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:24,030
I will start Jujitsu. Oh, you, you might
actually be starting to do two tomorrow.

593
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,340
My Bro just don't hurt me.

594
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:31,440
Doesn't hurt everyone I know who
starts Jujitsu hurt something.

595
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,870
That's why I'm holding off.
But I would,

596
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,630
I will definitely come
let you a ragdoll me.

597
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:41,631
But my point is that I've lost it and
I'm probably the last guy to give you

598
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:47,810
advice right now on how to lock out
the world because I have to put on

599
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:52,590
headphones and crank music to
get through a workout right now.

600
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,920
And I know this, I didn't know I'm
detrimental in it and I, and I,

601
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:59,340
and I'm aware of it and I'm
trying to correct it and uh,

602
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,850
and it bugs the shit out of me.
They really does.

603
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,770
It makes me feel like less of a person.

604
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,370
So let me tell you about a transition
that I went through. Yes. First of all,

605
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,400
before the war I,
than military sent me to college.

606
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,660
So I had to go to college and I, as
I said earlier, or as I said before,

607
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,430
I was super focused.
When I went to college,

608
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:22,170
I'd been in the seal teams for 10 years.
I was a go getter. I was a hard charger.

609
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,180
I was like, Oh, you want
me to read this book? Boom.

610
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:29,130
I would sit down and just force myself
to read it and then got back to the seal

611
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:32,490
teams and like,
like when I went to college,

612
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,520
I literally read every single thing that
I was assigned and nobody does that in

613
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:39,610
college.
Nobody does that.

614
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:43,480
I read every single page of every single
thing I was assigned during college.

615
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:47,020
That's ridiculous. It's almost a waste
of time. It's almost embarrassing.

616
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,500
Echo definitely thinks
it's a waste of time, but,

617
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,490
but it was because I just could just
go lock my brain down and get it done.

618
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,630
Get back to the teams and the
teams officer in the teams,

619
00:38:58,631 --> 00:39:02,830
you have a lot of administrative paperwork
to do evaluations and after actions

620
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:04,660
reports and all these things.
And I would do the same thing.

621
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:07,360
I'll just go into lockdown mode in my,
put my brain on it and boom,

622
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:11,020
I'd go through it and just get it done.
I would just be able to focus.

623
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:15,490
So they each thing, laser focus.
These are folks that report done. God,

624
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,600
give me that. Oh, come on.
Report done. Okay. Okay.

625
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:24,370
So I go to Iraq the first time, no big
deal. I go to Iraq the second time.

626
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,580
Do you know it's a much
tougher deployment.

627
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,140
It's guys are getting wounded,
guys, my guys are getting killed

628
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:39,300
and I come home and I get put into a
run in the training and with running the

629
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:41,260
training all of a sudden,
yeah,

630
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:43,480
there's administrative requirements and
there was administrative requirements

631
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,480
overseas as well. And you know what? We
did locked him down and got them done.

632
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,950
I get home and I remember
the first time I get to do,

633
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,410
I think it's evaluations, which in
the military and the Navy anyways,

634
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,690
doing evaluations is a real pain.

635
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:59,290
It's a real big administrative
administration of or a
v value shopping of all

636
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,260
the troops. So at this place I
was at huge running training.

637
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:06,430
I had a hundred guys and every one of
them is like a little mini term paper or

638
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:10,150
something. It has to be perfect. It's
in a person's military record forever.

639
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:10,984
That really stressful about it.

640
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,680
And I used to have no problem just
to hammer on those things out.

641
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:19,210
So I get back from that deployment and,
and I'm sitting down in and you know,

642
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:23,260
I start doing it. I'm like, ah,
this is stupid. This doesn't matter.

643
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,090
I don't know why I'm doing this.
Right. Well how do I have to do that?

644
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:28,750
Kind of started saying the same things
that I would always brag on people for

645
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:31,180
saying like, this is stupid.
Oh, now your men are stupid.

646
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:33,640
You don't want to fill out the
report and take care of your guys.

647
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,600
You don't want to write a good [inaudible]
career isn't worth your five minutes

648
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:42,070
or five is okay. You know? So I,
I heard myself saying this right,

649
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,770
and what and what,

650
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:49,771
what the constant undertone of all this
was that this stuff doesn't matter.

651
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,300
Combat Wolves, what mattered. And,

652
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,180
and when you get back from
that situation where man,

653
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:00,670
your buddies are getting killed,
you're getting wounded,

654
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:04,060
your friends are getting wounded, this
piece of paper, it doesn't matter.

655
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,540
And you say to yourself,
I don't care about this.

656
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,090
And at some point,
and it didn't,

657
00:41:12,091 --> 00:41:16,840
it took me maybe two or three months.
I did what I had to do to get by.

658
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,940
But as I sit there and I looked at
myself and I said, you know what?

659
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,650
Combat doesn't matter anymore.

660
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,460
You're not in it. You're
not in it right now. Right.

661
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,030
This is now what matters. Your,
your mind was still there.

662
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,450
My mind was still there thinking
that that was all that matters.

663
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,910
And like I said on our last podcast,

664
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,740
actually it's in the past and
it doesn't matter anymore.

665
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,150
So you know what you have to do.

666
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:55,210
You have to be a man and you have to do
your job now and this is what matters

667
00:41:56,061 --> 00:42:00,650
now. And that to me made a
big transition for me and it,

668
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,540
you know,
I haven't even thought about this until,

669
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,550
until you were talking about it.
Cause I remember what it was like to,

670
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,720
to go from when I went to college and
what I was before I deployed Romani now

671
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,090
would just be sold, laser focused, be
to be able to just burn through things.

672
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,780
And then when I got back and it was not
there and it was all because I thought,

673
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,030
oh, this stuff doesn't
matter. This doesn't matter.

674
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,250
It doesn't matter what matters you,

675
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,440
there's guys getting killed overseas
right now. That's what matters.

676
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,220
And I had to say, you know what, no,
that stuff doesn't matter right now.

677
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,580
And you know, and also I was in
charge of training and I said,

678
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,150
well what matters is doing this,
getting guys trained to go overseas.

679
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:39,980
And I became obsessed with
that and slightly psychotic
about getting guys ready

680
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:44,120
for combat. I mean I was preparing them
for what they're preparing them for,

681
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:47,540
what they're going into. And you know,
you could, I'm sure there were many uh,

682
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,470
seals that went through the training
that I was overall in charge of and would

683
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:56,420
attest to the fact that I was probably
pretty borderline psychopathic at that

684
00:42:56,421 --> 00:43:01,220
point. But I think that that was a long
run in my training and it'll sense dude,

685
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:04,400
but I want to psycho running
my combat training. Yup. Yup.

686
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:09,950
So I go ahead. Okay. You were
just going to say you think,

687
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:14,720
I think that telling yourself
and recognizing to yourself,

688
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,030
why are you trying to do this thing?

689
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,420
Because you're trying to do something
because it does matter, right?

690
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,280
It has to matter in some way.

691
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,380
Even if it's just filling
out the paperwork to get
your license from the DMV.

692
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,080
Oh, that doesn't matter. Oh,
actually no. What? It does matter.

693
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,630
You're going to get arrested. If you
could pull it, you know, it's like, no,

694
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:35,330
it does matter. These little
things, these little stupid,

695
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:38,690
meaningless tasks in life, they actually
do matter. So you know what you do.

696
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,840
You line them up and you freaking
crush them. That's what you do.

697
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,160
That's what you do.

698
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,300
You line up these stupid meaningless
things and you crush them and you use them

699
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:51,500
as an exercise in discipline. They
become an exercise and discipline, oh,

700
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:54,980
this thing doesn't matter. Guess what?
I'm going to crush it now. Bring it to me.

701
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:59,210
Where's my DMV form? Watch me fill
this out. That's what I'm going to do.

702
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,110
So maybe I turned like some little
meaningless things into a personal

703
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:04,460
competition of discipline,

704
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,450
but maybe it's how consistent are
you making that happen though?

705
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,760
This is, I'm [inaudible] to
tell you. So for instance,

706
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:18,020
since we started the podcast,
I have to read,

707
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,770
you know, basically a book a
week and then once I read it,

708
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,910
I've got to go back into it. Yeah.
You do like a book report and,

709
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:28,880
and go back through it and say, and how
is this going to flow together? What part?

710
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:33,390
So I'm spending a lot of time on that
right now and I've been able to do it

711
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,280
every time so far.

712
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:40,010
Okay. Um, so I think my, cause I've
lost my ability to be consistent

713
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,830
and that's, that's what's really
bumming me out. Like when I, when I,

714
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,050
your book isn't,
I mean it's thick,

715
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:52,550
but I should have been able to read this
and two or three solid days of reading.

716
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:55,970
Yes. I told you how successful
I was. Yes. Not Very.

717
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,100
And that bugs the shit shit
at him and I, it's a, it's a,

718
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:06,110
it's a, uh, it's a fail. It says it's a,

719
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,290
you know what though? I think
this is a failure on my part. I,

720
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,010
I think that this is the same thing
that we were talking about on the last

721
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:18,990
podcast and I think echo said
when you say,

722
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,820
Oh, you know what? I'm not going to
finish this book right now. It's it.

723
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,450
I don't really want to. It's
sort of like when you say, Oh,

724
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:28,470
I'm not gonna quit too though.
That's what I'm saying. You say,

725
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,500
but I don't want to do it right now.
I can push it off a little bit.

726
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,770
You accept that you accept that answer.

727
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,350
You accept that answer.

728
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,600
The soldier Jodi wouldn't
accept that answer.

729
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,160
Would not do self-talk.
Not really.

730
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,640
Not really. I'm not a
guy that says, you know,

731
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:53,400
I'm going to do this or going
to do that. I just do it. Right.

732
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,940
I just go and do whatever that thing
is. I think because you're, you

733
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,360
kind of have become that.

734
00:45:59,361 --> 00:46:03,890
So it's more of like an input kind of
crudely that's habitual for you to just do

735
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:06,830
it in our member hall. And it was,
I think it was kind of funny where,

736
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,520
where I use this example like how you
said use it as an exercise of diff

737
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:11,360
discipline.

738
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,360
So I said this example one time where I
was in line at the grocery store and I

739
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:20,660
had a 12 pack of beer. Do we have
to relearn this story right now?

740
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,810
And I was standing in line and there was
maybe three, four people in front of me.

741
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,930
So I'm like all right, it's going to
be a while for me to get up there.

742
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:29,330
This beard is getting you decided
you're going to hold the beer.

743
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,930
I remember the story. I remember
this story. Yeah. So exactly right.

744
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:35,860
But it wasn't that okay.
And the reason I decided to hold the beer,

745
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:38,690
it wasn't because that
benefited me right then it,

746
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,250
it was an exercise in mental stuff. But
here's the create. Okay. We're good.

747
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:48,140
Way Off the question, but
physical tasks. Sure, no problem.

748
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,950
Yeah, cause it's, it's visceral.
It's real. I can feel it.

749
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:57,380
But to sit down and read the report on
the sewer charges that are going to be

750
00:46:57,381 --> 00:47:00,440
coming in on the tax report
for the city next year.

751
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:02,920
What's on

752
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,340
going on on Twitter. It all like kind
of the same thing though, really is,

753
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,180
but I'm wondering,

754
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,960
I'm wondering if my brain hasn't
replaced the oxycontin with social media.

755
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,660
Yeah.
Like I had to quit drinking

756
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:18,420
because okay. We now we're
way off the thing, but the,

757
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,160
the hardcover came out last
September and hardcover. Oh, sorry.

758
00:47:23,161 --> 00:47:24,270
I've unflinching uh,

759
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:28,710
the making of a Canadian sniper by Jody
Mitic printed by Simon and Schuster and

760
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:34,000
it available on Amazon through Jocko
store.com. Click the link to Amazon.

761
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,160
Um, but yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Well, I already said,

762
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:43,330
I already said it. I already said it. So
anyway, the hardcover came out drinking.

763
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,920
I drank every day from
the date came that day.

764
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:51,820
So we had 450 people at the
event. Uh, uh, Kevin Newman,

765
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:53,020
my buddy who's, who's, uh,

766
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:58,050
he's a well known news anchor and Canada
does an interview with me on the stage

767
00:47:58,101 --> 00:48:01,210
and we got standing ovation.
We go out, we celebrate me,

768
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,960
the president of the company, my editor,
wait, we have a good night, good night.

769
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:07,390
And the next day,
if I didn't have one drink,

770
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:12,690
I was having 10 and that
went from September to the
new year and I was getting

771
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:14,350
fat and I,
you know,

772
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:17,910
I was sleeping in because I'm hung over
and I'm not going to the gym. And I went,

773
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:20,770
oh hang on,
what's going on?

774
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:26,080
Because this is cause I have my job
as politician, I'm Daddy, you know,

775
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:30,550
I'm friend. You know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
advocate and then you know, the book is,

776
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:34,150
it's a job, right? You know, selling
a book's a job full time job.

777
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,390
I need nine days a week and
36 hours a day to do it.

778
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,420
And so I had to make,

779
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,880
that's one of the reasons why I decided
to do the bodybuilding thing cause I'm

780
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:46,900
like well you can't drink and it'll be
right until November cause I need that.

781
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:51,250
So I'm trying to figure out if my brain
is looking for a new habit because I was

782
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:55,780
diagnosed before, I was like auntie
addictive. If that's even a real thing,

783
00:48:55,781 --> 00:48:57,220
but I had a doctor tell
me when she was like,

784
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:00,820
you're pretty much an anti
addictive personality,

785
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,660
like you won't get addicted to stuff
and narrow was addicted. Doxy cotton

786
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,590
even though it's a physical
thing more than a mental thing,

787
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:13,060
but I still wouldn't trust me with
a pill right now. Yeah. Anyway,

788
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,490
I think we go way off track,
but I just

789
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,340
again, and I don't know what your
therapist is going to tell you.

790
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,290
I'm going to tell you what
Jocko would tell you though.

791
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:23,350
These little things are things that you,

792
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,260
I know you know how to do them.

793
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:29,500
You've done your whole
career in the military,

794
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,880
you are watching a crossroad and I know
that might sound exciting to people that

795
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:36,160
are out there that are thinking
how crazy that must be. No,

796
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:39,190
there's times where Jody was walking
watching a crossroad and there was nothing

797
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:44,191
going on for four days and he was watching
that crossroad and so you have that

798
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,650
in you. You just got to tell
yourself that, you know what,

799
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,370
this stuff now this is what matters and
how are you going to tell yourself that

800
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:52,204
this is what matters.

801
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:55,930
It's because this is how it
connects to the strategic picture.

802
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,160
You can't say that this matters because
of what it is right in front of me.

803
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,590
Just like when you're looking at
the crossroads, you're not thinking,

804
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:06,640
oh this crossroads is important because
the crossroads is important. No the car,

805
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:09,940
the reason it's important is because
you are supporting keeping guys alive,

806
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,850
which is going to help a mission out,
which is going to help the,

807
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:16,470
the overall strategy, wind commander's
intent, commander's intent,

808
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,740
the whole [inaudible] the commander.

809
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:21,010
Now you are the commander and
also what's your longterm mission?

810
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,780
And that's what I kind of,
you just said to yourself like,

811
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:25,750
oh I picked bodybuilding cause I there
you just gave yourself a mission. Right?

812
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:28,070
So what's your administrative,
you know,

813
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,450
Echo made some big advances lately cause
he started freaking reading books and

814
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:35,930
he wasn't doing that before, but he,
he got the longterm mission of like,

815
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:39,200
you know what, I'm going to
learn as much as I possibly can.

816
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,440
So you got a longterm mission with
your constituents to be the best city

817
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:49,040
councilman and represents. So when they
ask you a question you're like boom,

818
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,120
that's kind of the quarter psycho stuff
that I would say is like if anybody ever

819
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:55,460
asked me a question like
when I was going to college,

820
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,280
if it asked me any question about any
of the reading, I'm going to know it.

821
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:01,310
That's just a bizarre p uh oh.

822
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:05,330
What's that OCD thing to be like?
I'm going to know everything.

823
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:08,780
So you have four kids,
you train every day,

824
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,260
you get up at four in the morning.
I've got to get up at four in the morning.

825
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:17,790
That's my answer. Sorry to riff
on you guys on that man. Like,

826
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:21,340
I know you want to do the questions.
But when that guy, when that like the,

827
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,180
the first question was
easy cause I'm like, oh,

828
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:26,030
I'll just talk about what I used to
do. And then that one was like, well,

829
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:31,010
if I was to try and answer right now,
I'd be lying, I'd be a liar and I can't,

830
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,030
I have my moments still, don't get me
wrong. I'll have moments where I'm like,

831
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,080
this has to get done and I'll
fire through a speech or I'll,

832
00:51:38,081 --> 00:51:41,780
I'll write a report or whatever it
is and then a, and then I lose it.

833
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,120
And it's like, ah, ah fuck. It's gone.

834
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:47,150
And that's actually
reinforcing what I just said.

835
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:51,980
So when you have a near term mission
that you know what the outcome would you

836
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:53,480
know what the result is?
You know what the end state is.

837
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:54,980
You know what the commander's
intent is like, Hey,

838
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:58,670
you've got a speech in two days.
Okay now it's in one day.

839
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,320
You can sit down and
concentrate and get it done.

840
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,760
Which where you've missed the connection
now is the connection between these

841
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:08,720
menial tasks that don't mean anything.

842
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:13,220
And how can I put them to a long term
strategic goal and one of those longterm

843
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,700
strategic goals you can put into place.
If nothing else is,

844
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:20,870
I'm going to discipline my mind to
do these menial tasks like a soldier

845
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,310
and that's pretty cool.
Oh yeah, it's a tee shirt.

846
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:28,290
Yup.
Thank you Jocko.

847
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,530
Whoever asked that question
a thank you for asking it.

848
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,220
Although I went off and talked about me
for the most of the speaking of Tangents,

849
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,670
echoes can take it a little further out.
It's not attention. It's what you said,

850
00:52:38,671 --> 00:52:40,200
how you said that's what a soldier does.

851
00:52:40,201 --> 00:52:43,080
So that's like a little
exercise and I did this before.

852
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:45,780
I did this in a couple of times.
Okay.

853
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:50,700
Like one was how I quit
drinking was I figured out,

854
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,080
and you can do this
with your diet as well.

855
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:56,640
I figured out that basically through
all this stuff that I read that you're

856
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:59,460
wanting to eat junk food
or drink or whatever,

857
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,530
is your brain tricking
you because it's built to,

858
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,670
it's evolved for a certain environment.
That environment doesn't work,

859
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,430
isn't around anymore.
Yeah.

860
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:11,190
So now we're in an environment
of abundance has to do
with don't mean anyway,

861
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,460
come to the conclusion that it's
your brain falling for a trick.

862
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,880
Your physiology of the brain falling
for a trick makes you want this stuff.

863
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,680
How he says how Jocko says,
that's not what a soldier would do.

864
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,040
I had it in my mind, I'm not
going to for that trick. I'm

865
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,640
not a sucker. That's not, you know,
doing this is what suckers do.

866
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:33,180
I'm not a sucker and this is just
like self talking to yourself.

867
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:37,780
So I essentially shamed
myself out of drinking. Yeah.

868
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,870
Just like he's doing the,
basically the inverse into focusing,

869
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:45,720
you know, I just remember like I w
I'm the guy that we were in Kosovo,

870
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:50,610
I quit smoking in a day because I
couldn't run up the hill next to her camp.

871
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,720
I said, well obviously these
things aren't good anymore.

872
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:59,730
And I literally just, I just, I even
had a pack of my pocket for like a week.

873
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:03,330
I just like, Oh yeah, okay. Just
throw those out. I want that guy back.

874
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,810
And I'm in search. I think it's
been 10 years since I was wounded.

875
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:10,530
I think I'm going to find
them again probably on the
stage for this bodybuilding

876
00:54:10,531 --> 00:54:12,630
thing or something. But yeah, I just,

877
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:16,770
I just couldn't answer that question
without talking about that because I

878
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,860
wouldn't have been truthful
at this point in my life.

879
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:24,200
And that's what's cool is maybe that
question right there was something that is

880
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,910
forcing you to face that. I mean you
might've had at the back of your mind,

881
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:28,770
but now you're going, you know what,
I can't answer that and I want to see,

882
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:30,810
cause I'm not there right now.
I'm not,

883
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,920
but I'm going to get back there real
quick. My moments. So standby people,

884
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,870
standby soldiers coming back
online. Reboot Jody. 3.0

885
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,830
all right,
next question.

886
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,640
This is all, just read it.
How you prepared mentally,

887
00:54:49,641 --> 00:54:53,300
what kind of discipline you had.
Routines in and out of battle.

888
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,070
How I prepared mentally.

889
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:58,640
Yeah.

890
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,130
Routines in n out of battle.

891
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,460
Yup. What kind of discipline you had
and routines in and out of battle.

892
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,513
Um,

893
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,650
okay.

894
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:12,730
I'm going to fall back on

895
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,630
mental routine I think is probably your,

896
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:22,770
your your biggest cause the
physical one is easy. Okay. He,

897
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:27,300
he come back. So battle doesn't mean, you
know, you're in gun fights all the time,

898
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:31,460
you know, like, like we say w if first and
still we're patrolling. Right. You know,

899
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:34,890
which just a static patrol.
So you know,

900
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,560
you gotta make sure your gear's
good. You got to make, you know,

901
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:40,110
are your batteries changed? Right?
You guys like there's all the ways,

902
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:41,970
the checklist, checklist,
checklist, checklist.

903
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,890
As a leader it actually makes it easier
I found because now I have a reason to

904
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:51,540
check their stuff and check that their
routine. So my routine stayed solid.

905
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,760
Right. Cause I think I had
other guys I had to worry about.

906
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,620
Um,
so rest is a big one.

907
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,870
I used to have to order my guys to
go to ground because they were so,

908
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:07,230
cause there's only three of us and I used
to, my barrier, especially I'd be like,

909
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:11,100
Barry, you need to be
useful. I need you to sleep.

910
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:15,180
So my routine was like, make
sure enough rest. Make sure,

911
00:56:15,181 --> 00:56:17,970
because you know that the
saying mission before man,

912
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:24,340
sure. Except when the man is the
mission. So I my man to be good. Yeah.

913
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,260
And I'm going to say,
if you abuse your man too much,

914
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:29,070
you won't accomplish the mission.
So like, you know, you know,

915
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,210
the sacrifice the body. Well, let's wait.

916
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:34,990
Let's think about that because the
body is what needs to get this thing.

917
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:39,280
There's only, there's only three of us.
And in our case, you know, of your sniper,

918
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:42,370
you're, you might be alone, you might
be with a one or two other guys.

919
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,150
I can't afford to have a guy run head at
first through a doorway to get through

920
00:56:46,151 --> 00:56:50,770
it because I need him to be useful after,
you know, if you have a platoon, sure.

921
00:56:50,771 --> 00:56:54,820
You Sacrifice Smith, he runs through the
door. Hey, okay, you got 29 more guys,

922
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:59,110
I can go through the door. Um, so my
routine was always like, you know,

923
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:04,020
make sure everything's topped up.
Keep an eye out, you know, uh,

924
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,240
do the, do the mental checklist
and then visualize visually,

925
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:11,530
like out of battle. I would
try to, you know, I'd be on my,

926
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,680
I remember I'd lay on
my bunk and I'd have my,

927
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,850
and I'd always ended up with my right
foot crossed over my left foot and my am I

928
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:24,180
am my arms up here on my chest and I'd
have my head back and I would be going,

929
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:28,480
okay. So, okay if we go down and you know,

930
00:57:28,481 --> 00:57:32,950
and if contact left and I would try to
like, you know, visualize these things,

931
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,390
you know,
cause as the team leader,

932
00:57:34,391 --> 00:57:38,440
I had the radio and I was security
because my boys, when they're in position,

933
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:43,240
you know, my spotter is
spotting my shooters shooting,
so like they're 12 o'clock.

934
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:48,970
So I'm now everything, everything, the
rest of the clock for them and for myself.

935
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,250
So I was constantly rehearsing
mentally what would, what could happen.

936
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,760
I'm calling and I'm
practicing a call for fire.

937
00:57:57,761 --> 00:58:02,050
I'm practicing and calling in an
airstrike and practicing a nine liner.

938
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:05,800
I'm practicing, um, uh, just a grit.

939
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,390
What do you guys do you guys use that
turns the nine line four nine nine line is

940
00:58:10,391 --> 00:58:15,280
a casualty evac. Uh, call for
fire nine line. Yeah. Um, no, no,

941
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:19,480
but grit and I group range indication
during the fire. Yup. Yup. So my first,

942
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,220
even with all the visualization,

943
00:58:21,221 --> 00:58:25,830
my first actual grit in a battle was
did in bed to bed to, to tobacco.

944
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,550
There it's supposed to be six, three, uh,

945
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:35,230
300 by that tree, you know, all, you know,

946
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:39,820
um, a farm for a fact or at your
own time or something like that.

947
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:43,060
Calm, cool, collected
voice. But, you know,

948
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,630
the guy was like 40 meters away and
it was like in my sniper was actually

949
00:58:46,631 --> 00:58:50,140
looking over him. Waveys
like, I'm, you know,

950
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,990
I'm looking at that stuff and I was like,
fuck it, and I just shot on myself. But,

951
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:59,230
uh, but my point is that even with all
of that practice and visualization and

952
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:02,620
training, you know, that
was my first attempt. Um,

953
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,920
so I was always just trying to make sure
that my routine off off the battlefield

954
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:11,830
was putting my mind back,
but in a controlled setting,

955
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,110
you know, and, and all. And, and then
also, like I said, make sure, okay, yeah.

956
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:20,500
How much sleep did you get? K? Good,
good, good. And that's the routine that,

957
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:24,860
you know, that you got to get the
guys to relax. Especially like for me,

958
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:28,610
I had to,
I just had to make sure,

959
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:32,030
cause I only had me and two other guys,
I couldn't afford to lose one of them,

960
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:37,520
whether it was to exhaustion
or malnutrition or
dehydration or sprained ankles

961
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:41,420
or whatever, you know. So I
just, I just did my best to keep,

962
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:44,060
keep that checklist going and,
and visual.

963
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:48,230
And I would encourage them to
do the same. I'd be like, Hey,

964
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:51,330
what are you thinking about
over there? All, you know,
whatever. It'd be like, Hey,

965
00:59:51,331 --> 00:59:53,850
you want you to think about, uh, you
know, remember when you may like,

966
00:59:53,851 --> 00:59:58,100
or do make making that shot and you missed
or whatever. Like, try and visualize,

967
00:59:58,101 --> 00:59:59,450
try and think about what you did.
You know,

968
00:59:59,451 --> 01:00:03,350
there's a lot of steps that
go into pulling the trigger,
you know, and, and, um,

969
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,990
and then, you know, just think about that.

970
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:10,820
Think about how it happened and encourage
that. You know, I'm, I'm a big fan of,

971
01:00:10,821 --> 01:00:14,300
um,
of meditation and Yoga and all that stuff.

972
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:16,430
Like if any,

973
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:21,380
like I think an our side of the world,
we've lost a lot of that stuff.

974
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:25,370
And I know we tried to get it back and
got people that do it are tree hugging,

975
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,800
you know,
a spandex wearing Weirdos or whatever.

976
01:00:27,801 --> 01:00:32,801
But Yoga and meditation and stuff like
that's all warrior culture from the past,

977
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:40,100
you know, you know, like
Samurai meditate, you know,

978
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:44,090
ain't warrior monks a fasted and prayed.
That's just meditation.

979
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:48,530
And they looked inside themselves
a lot to try and you know,

980
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:52,370
a Samurai's job was pretty tough.
Call him a pussy for meditating,

981
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:56,590
make sure I'm there so I
could watch. And, and I,

982
01:00:56,591 --> 01:01:01,591
and I firmly believe that that type of
stuff keeps you functional for when you

983
01:01:02,301 --> 01:01:04,790
hit the battlefield. You
know, that self, you know,

984
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:08,870
as Grossmann calls it the self reflection,
self inoculation as well.

985
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,480
So that was my routine.

986
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:14,840
It was just a constant
rotation of thoughts and then,

987
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:19,130
but the actions were always
to prepare the, you know,

988
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,610
the situation for what was coming.
Does that make sense?

989
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:28,690
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. The one, uh, one
thing that I, that's actually a pro,

990
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:33,710
I like a really practical thing
that I did that and that is I had,

991
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,060
uh, this is again, this is
just a real practical thing.

992
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,710
I had two cots, right? Slept
in a cot, slept in one,

993
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:43,120
caught something,

994
01:01:43,121 --> 01:01:47,680
one caught the other cop was all my
gear and it was just laid out going body

995
01:01:47,681 --> 01:01:51,880
armor, you know, everything
was right there. And when I,

996
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:54,100
when I got dressed to go out,

997
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:59,440
all that thing was empty and
so never forgot anything.

998
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:03,940
When I came back, everything went
right back on the cop spot. Same spot,

999
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,480
everything squared away.
So those, that to me was,

1000
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:10,240
and I figured that out really
quickly. Okay. Just going to,

1001
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:12,760
I don't want ever want to forget anything.
Here's what I'm gonna do.

1002
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,970
I'm gonna put everything
that I need right here. Okay.

1003
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,940
That I had,
I didn't even think of it around my,

1004
01:02:18,941 --> 01:02:20,280
you know how he said I would sit there,

1005
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,480
right foot over the left. [inaudible]
all around me because we had a cot,

1006
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:28,560
we had a cot. We didn't, we couldn't
afford to Canadian army. Okay. Sorry. Um,

1007
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:33,140
but around I had, we all had two by
fours around us cause we were in like a,

1008
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:38,280
a fog. We built ourselves and
each nail had it. So I had my,

1009
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:42,750
my chest rig, my rifle, uh, my ammo
pouches and uh, you know, like,

1010
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:45,180
and then all around and,
but that was what I would,

1011
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:48,000
when I would go through my stuff. That's
what I mean. Like I would hang it up,

1012
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,810
open up the pouch. Okay. Everything's
there, close it next pouch,

1013
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:54,990
make sure top up my mags, all that
stuff. And I would make sure I'd make,

1014
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:58,440
get the guys who do the same thing
and when you're ready to go out or an

1015
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,770
operation, all your nails were empty.
That means you've got everything. Yeah.

1016
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:03,810
But the biggest thing with route,
like Peop,

1017
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:07,440
people call it a routine and they think
there's magic to it, right? There's not,

1018
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:11,370
it's just making sure you do the same
thing over and over and over again.

1019
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,780
You know, as, as, as magical as navy
seals and snipers want to be like,

1020
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:20,190
it's not really that, it's
not that mystical, I guess.

1021
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,740
Um, it's a, it's just a lot
of repetition, you know,

1022
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:27,510
the routine is that you repeat the
same actions because that was me.

1023
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,050
That's what makes you good
at them. Yeah. I was to,

1024
01:03:30,051 --> 01:03:31,500
I was telling you when
we were driving over,

1025
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:36,390
here are some point how we use
to try and do everything. Yeah.

1026
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:38,490
When you would fire up the hours together,

1027
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:41,670
five or six Home V's lined up for an
operation, they'd all be lined up,

1028
01:03:41,671 --> 01:03:45,540
ready to go.
And then everyone would like get the word,

1029
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:50,100
it'd be like load them up and then you
just see everyone would just get in the

1030
01:03:50,101 --> 01:03:50,970
zone,
boom.

1031
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
You'd see them getting the vehicles and
then we'd start the vehicles at the same

1032
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:56,370
time. There's no reason to
do that. No, but there is,

1033
01:03:56,430 --> 01:04:01,000
I know the have loves dog type.
There's no, there's no, um,

1034
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:06,000
definable reason why you would do that.
But our deal was,

1035
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,270
you know, okay. Starting up in three, two,

1036
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,390
one start up and then you hear all the
vehicles startup wants to and it's just

1037
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:14,670
like all those little things would the,

1038
01:04:14,671 --> 01:04:19,110
all those little disciplines would
lend themselves to the team being more

1039
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:19,710
disciplined.

1040
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:23,760
Those ignition switches might as well
have been the switch and each guy's mind.

1041
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:26,970
Yup. Yup. As the, as
that vehicle is starting,

1042
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:31,971
everyone's brain is going into combat
mode and we're together at the same time

1043
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:34,980
synchronized from the word go when that,

1044
01:04:34,981 --> 01:04:37,440
I love it when you told me that
that was, I was like, yeah,

1045
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:40,590
that'd be the most bad ass
thing to watch a bunch of navy.

1046
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,920
Imagine what's your navy seals load up
and they have vehicles all started the

1047
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,650
same time I'd run. I'd be like, I'm not
fucking with these guys. I'm out of here.

1048
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,720
It was a, it was an awesome
sight of that when my guys,

1049
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:51,720
when I was a task unit commander, you
know, I'd be sitting on basis, guys,

1050
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:56,721
we're rolling out and I'd stand out
there and salute him like just like old

1051
01:04:57,181 --> 01:05:00,810
school. Right. Cause. But it's, you
know, it was, uh, and they, I bet.

1052
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:04,740
And they loved you for it by, by
while I love those guys. But the,

1053
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:08,670
the,
those guys,

1054
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,470
I mean every time you rolled
out in the streets to Ramadi,

1055
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,850
there was a decent chance you
got to quit getting blown up.

1056
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,130
There was a,
a gunfight was almost

1057
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,030
guaranteed to happen.

1058
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:23,640
But the guys getting blown ids was
a real issue for you guys. A and,

1059
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:27,430
and I was thinking about this today,
the ids there was,

1060
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:32,170
we had statistically the most heavily id
road in all of Iraq was route Michigan

1061
01:05:32,171 --> 01:05:35,440
going from one end to the one
ended Ramadi to the other. Yeah.

1062
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:40,630
And there was ids all over the
place. It was, I mean it was,

1063
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:45,460
it was ridiculous.
And we didn't hit Amy.

1064
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:47,260
I edis while we were there,

1065
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:51,970
which I was thinking about that today
cause I was thinking about my EOD

1066
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:55,090
contingent had to,
or do you guys,

1067
01:05:56,050 --> 01:06:00,280
and I never told them like,
hey, we never hit an IED.

1068
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:04,840
Thank you. Never told him that.
So you credit them with that?

1069
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,020
I credit them with part of it.
Yeah.

1070
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:08,950
Part of the briefings that
they gave part of the,

1071
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:13,210
now there were some close calls, uh,
life's platoon. And matter of fact,

1072
01:06:13,211 --> 01:06:17,230
it's in the book when they,
the EOD guys were watching the front door,

1073
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:19,410
they couldn't quite keep an eye on it,
but they were,

1074
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,090
they did a really good inspection of it.
When they came back out there,

1075
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:22,990
like something looks different,

1076
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:27,130
they would gather there's 120 millimeter
mortar id that would've taken out,

1077
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,570
I don't know, four or five guys. Yeah. Uh,

1078
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,920
there was a time where we went over,

1079
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:35,410
we went over an IED will,
uh,

1080
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:40,150
the point man navigator in
the vehicles was like, Hey,

1081
01:06:40,151 --> 01:06:44,590
I think there's something
specific suspicious actually
got out of the vehicle to

1082
01:06:44,591 --> 01:06:47,380
look at it. And we're like,
hmm. Yeah. Looking back,

1083
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,660
what do you think about that
decision making process? You know,

1084
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:53,080
maybe that wasn't a good one. Anyways,
we decided, oh, I don't think it is.

1085
01:06:53,081 --> 01:06:57,640
We drove over it and about
half an hour later, the IED,

1086
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,850
a clearance team found a triple stack.
One 20.

1087
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,280
So that's everybody in
the vehicle dead. Um, if,

1088
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:08,200
uh, so yeah, ids were massive threat,

1089
01:07:08,201 --> 01:07:12,070
the number of guys that were killed and
wounded by ids and Ramadi was ridiculous.

1090
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:15,190
There was a hole, there was a
vehicle graveyard, you know,

1091
01:07:15,191 --> 01:07:20,020
vehicles that had been blown up
and then drag back in with, I mean,

1092
01:07:20,021 --> 01:07:21,700
it was, it was massive. I mean,

1093
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:27,930
I want to say 50 to 100 vehicles aren't
just piled up and including m wraps,

1094
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:31,330
which are the mine resistance vehicles.
Those things are, they're broken in half.

1095
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:34,390
Yeah. What kind of bombed you
got to put together to do that?

1096
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:39,950
Yeah. Ooh, we got real lucky
and I know this sounds weird.

1097
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:44,080
My rotation,
they had conventional minds,

1098
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:50,060
so any purse and any tank and
there was the occasional IED,

1099
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:54,530
but it was usually SV. Uh,
and uh, and in the city,

1100
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,880
s v means a suicide
vehicles. So, um, our, uh,

1101
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,810
our regimental sergeant major and his
driver were killed by a suicide vehicle.

1102
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:06,620
Borne IED. Yup. And I
stepped on a landmine.

1103
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:08,900
If I'd stepped on an IED,
I would've been vaporized.

1104
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,960
But the rotation that that replaced us,

1105
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:16,860
our sister battalion that's,
we lived the,

1106
01:08:16,861 --> 01:08:21,140
the intelligence says guys from
Iraq started showing up and uh,

1107
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,420
we went from losing a tire,

1108
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:28,421
maybe having one guy get killed through
a penetration in the hole or whatever to

1109
01:08:29,181 --> 01:08:29,391
a,

1110
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:34,340
we had a whole laugh go up and seven
out of the 10 guys in it were killed.

1111
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:35,803
And it was like,

1112
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:40,550
like that's how quickly it escalated
and suddenly it was an issue for our,

1113
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:41,540
for our guys as well.

1114
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:46,910
Almost every vehicle we had hit a landmine
on my tour and that was the only time

1115
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:50,870
I was ever really scared over there
when I was walking or in a helicopter or

1116
01:08:50,871 --> 01:08:53,300
even out on a four wheeler,
no problem.

1117
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:58,660
When I had to drive on the roads in a
vehicle, that's when I was like, my,

1118
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:03,320
that pucker factor was the highest
for me ever. Ids Man. Like the,

1119
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:05,990
and the guys that would go out
every day and deal with that shit.

1120
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:08,240
Like d clearance guys,
Fox man.

1121
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:11,450
Like my hat always came off to those guys.
Yeah.

1122
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:16,790
Like talk about a nerve
wracking job. Yeah. Yeah.

1123
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,650
What's that movie with the,

1124
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:25,220
with the EOD guy, I don't
know. Hurt, luck, hurt locker.

1125
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:29,660
Everybody who does that jobs is,
it's a total bullshit movie.

1126
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:32,030
But could you imagine
though that's your Gig?

1127
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:32,751
Well,

1128
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:37,751
like we had an embedded EOD guys with
us and those usually have a EOD navy EOD

1129
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:40,220
guys that are basically like the two guys.
Our guys were like,

1130
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,020
they go through our training with us,
they grow,

1131
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,140
but they don't go through the basic
training, the basic seal training,

1132
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:48,980
but they go through everything else. And
our guys are like supporters, the wall,

1133
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:53,560
once our guys, our guys were
like other seals, you know,
they were that good. Yeah.

1134
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:58,820
And but yeah, um, it's not,

1135
01:09:58,910 --> 01:09:59,743
it's amazing,

1136
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:04,490
but in the guys that are with us that
with us and so they're not quite,

1137
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:08,540
it's their primary job for us, but it's
not their primary job. Right, right.

1138
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:12,980
Whereas the guys that you're talking
about, the guys that did route clearance,

1139
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:19,700
if anybody's listening to this podcast
right now and you did route clearance in

1140
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:23,690
Iraq or Afghanistan,
you, Jocko and Jody say,

1141
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:28,220
thank you because you saved us so many
times because we drove down those roads

1142
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:29,990
all the time. My guys wrote
down those roads all the time.

1143
01:10:29,991 --> 01:10:32,240
And you found all those bombs that saved,

1144
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:36,000
saved our lives in so many lives.
Kept the

1145
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:39,650
applies rolling. Yep. Even
kept the local populace safe.

1146
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,340
And you know how much credit and
glory those guys get? None. Not a lot.

1147
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:48,450
None. And there was, in
Ramadi, there would be the,

1148
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:52,040
the big vehicle, like a buffalo,
buffalo is take a giant m wrap.

1149
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:53,540
You have to climb a ladder to get into it.

1150
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:56,810
So there'd be guys in there that would
disable the bombs from inside that a big

1151
01:10:56,811 --> 01:10:58,820
robotic arm and they would do that.

1152
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:04,090
But behind them would be a
contingent of marines in Home Viz.

1153
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,700
And I'd say, what do you guys,
Oh yeah, we're just support.

1154
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:13,980
Get some devil dogs.
Marine Corps doesn't play around.

1155
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,240
They're like, oh, you
need, you need support.

1156
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:16,980
Cool to getting home visa role behind it,

1157
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:19,770
but there's going to be big bombs blowing
up. Yeah. We're in the Marine Corps.

1158
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:24,570
Yeah, no factor. We'll do you love it.
I love Marines. Marine Corps. Awesome.

1159
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:28,980
Anyway, questions from the interwebs.
Questions for the Inter webs.

1160
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:38,150
Can you tell us about Jody,
can you tell us about your wife,

1161
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:43,240
the medic that helped save you then you
kind of talked about this a little bit

1162
01:11:43,371 --> 01:11:47,570
on the first podcast we did together.
So you know what I'll,

1163
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:50,930
I'll tell you about
her. So Atlanta is, um,

1164
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:56,510
so I say her dad was in the army
and he, he, he's from Ireland,

1165
01:11:56,511 --> 01:12:00,980
he immigrated to Canada,
join the military and uh,

1166
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,250
he was an airborne commando
and Canada back in the day.

1167
01:12:04,251 --> 01:12:07,520
Like that was pretty much,
you know, that was our,

1168
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:12,230
one of our most fierce units and he
commanded the jump school, which is like,

1169
01:12:12,231 --> 01:12:17,180
whoa. Wow, that's, that's pretty bad ass.
He did the American ranger course and 68.

1170
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,600
[inaudible]. Yeah, it's an old
Vietnam Rangers were running,

1171
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,800
run the show got old. They were young.
Sorry guys, I should have said that. The,

1172
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:28,790
these fresh combat experience rangers
were running the show, you know,

1173
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,590
they weren't playing around.
Yeah.

1174
01:12:30,591 --> 01:12:34,660
He got kicked in the spine
with a steel toe boot. Yeah.

1175
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:39,170
And finished with a broken
vertebrae and a, but you know,

1176
01:12:39,171 --> 01:12:44,171
so I always say she was drafted
into the military at birth and uh,

1177
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,930
cause she grew up on bases all
over the world. Germany, um, uh,

1178
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,970
I think South America and stuff or is
it her dad ended up being in a like

1179
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,180
embassy security and stuff.
Um,

1180
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,230
she became a medic at a high school.
Um,

1181
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:05,660
I think she joined at 17 as well. She's
a little bit older than me. Um, and then,

1182
01:13:05,661 --> 01:13:06,494
uh,

1183
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:11,930
she has more citations for
saving civilians than she
does receiving soldiers.

1184
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:17,450
She happens upon, she's like
one of those, uh, angels,

1185
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:21,500
I guess that just won a woman.
So here's one.

1186
01:13:21,501 --> 01:13:24,950
A woman had a heart attack behind
the wheel, drove into a ditch.

1187
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:29,390
Atlanta was right behind her, drove,
stopped her car, jumped in the car,

1188
01:13:29,391 --> 01:13:31,070
pulled her out dead.

1189
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:35,840
Alana brought her back to life right there
at the side of the road, no equipment,

1190
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:38,690
anything like that.
Just skill,

1191
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,040
skill and determination when and kept
her alive until the paramedics showed up

1192
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:46,820
and took over. She's got
a decoration for that. Um,

1193
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:51,790
you know, she helped
save my life and, and,

1194
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:54,380
and a lot of my friends and,
uh,

1195
01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:01,060
one time we were driving and
we came upon a scene and we,

1196
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:06,350
uh, we were in my truck and Ayla was
still a baby still in our baby seat.

1197
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:10,720
And so I look up and I,
and I see it, I think she,

1198
01:14:10,721 --> 01:14:12,430
she might have been on her phone,
I don't know what she was doing.

1199
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:17,080
And I see scatter cars,
car parts everywhere,

1200
01:14:17,081 --> 01:14:21,550
and one lone cop standing in the
middle of it, like a squirrel.

1201
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,420
And not because he's scared or
anything, he's just, he's the only guy.

1202
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:28,330
He's the first on the scene.
And I look and I'm like, okay,

1203
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:32,920
something bad happened here. And I see
one vehicle in the middle of it all.

1204
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:37,330
And I went to Atlanta, they need
you. And she went, Huh? I said,

1205
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:41,710
you see that van? They
need you. She jumped out,

1206
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,110
jumped headfirst through the,

1207
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,630
this van was crushed and she went in
there and there was a four year old,

1208
01:14:46,631 --> 01:14:50,530
little three year old little
girl, uh, that had been hit
with the car, was t boned.

1209
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,890
She stabilized the little girl's spine,
uh,

1210
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:58,330
kept her alive until the firemen
showed up. Uh, they extracted, she,

1211
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:02,260
she was in command of the
scene and they were like, they,

1212
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:07,530
I guess I was doing my best to help the
cop with traffic and stuff like this and

1213
01:15:07,631 --> 01:15:11,800
uh, and deal with some of the other
like minor injuries and the fireman,

1214
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:15,190
like the first guy to put his head and
he's like, I kind of heard like, well,

1215
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:18,850
who is this? And then all
I hear is Atlanta. Like, I
need this and I need like,

1216
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:22,300
just bark it out, all these orders.
And they go, Oh yeah, okay, hang on.

1217
01:15:22,301 --> 01:15:22,901
So they run in,

1218
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:26,080
they're getting all this stuff and they
get the board and they put the little,

1219
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:30,340
the girl, the girl ended up passing
away unfortunately, but, um,

1220
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,480
zero hesitation.
That's,

1221
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,760
that's my wife fucking hero. And, uh,

1222
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:38,960
you know,

1223
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,960
she retired from the military
last year and is going through,

1224
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:47,440
um, she probably gonna get mad at me for
saying this, but she's going through it.

1225
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:50,380
A lot of soldiers go
through the transition.

1226
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:50,761
Oh,

1227
01:15:50,761 --> 01:15:54,720
you mean the thing we've been talking
about for the all night and all last pod.

1228
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:58,510
Yeah. She just, she's just having
a tough time figuring out who,

1229
01:15:58,511 --> 01:16:03,130
who's Atlanta Gilmore or if she's not
a soldier and she's an amazing mom.

1230
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:07,510
Uh, she's an amazing wife and,
um, she's an amazing person.

1231
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,250
It's just in her mind,

1232
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:13,750
she needs to find the new
her and, uh, you know,

1233
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:16,660
and I'm trying to help her
the best I can, but, you know,

1234
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:20,680
I can only do so much and at some
point she'll figure it out. She's,

1235
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,020
she's coming around pretty good right now.
I think she's,

1236
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:26,950
she's starting to like volunteer a
little bit here and like get out, do

1237
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:30,340
some stuff and, you know, I'm pretty, you
know, I'm just, I'm just proud of her,

1238
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:32,290
you know, for the most
part. Yeah. You know,

1239
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:37,720
that's one of the things that makes
that transition so hard, um, is that,

1240
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:38,440
you know,

1241
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:43,440
before I was talking about like combat
matters and then beyond that you're doing

1242
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:47,560
this thing, you know, for your wife,

1243
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:51,940
like she's in charge of
saving people's lives,

1244
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:56,950
saving soldiers' lives, and that's going
to help this strategic mission. I mean,

1245
01:16:56,980 --> 01:17:00,670
what, what, what is going
to replace that for her?

1246
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:06,610
And the answer, Alana, is nothing.
Nothing's gonna replace that. Yeah,

1247
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,180
but you know what? You don't need to
replace it. You need to replace it.

1248
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:15,530
A whole stock replace that thing.

1249
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:20,150
That's a beautiful, beautiful
experience to have had in your life.

1250
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:26,150
But don't let it turn into a black hole,
right?

1251
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:30,050
Like, like the black hole, the mass
of a black hole is some insane number.

1252
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,760
Just like the mass and the,

1253
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:34,820
and the power of this combat
experience is the same thing.

1254
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:36,830
It's this super powerful experience,

1255
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:40,490
but don't let it suck all
the other experiences away.

1256
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:45,770
Don't let it do that. Don't let
it do that. So what's the, what's,

1257
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:48,680
what else?
What matters?

1258
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,610
Now we know what mattered in the
past, right? But what matters now.

1259
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:57,680
That's the question. And there's so many
things. I mean, you got two daughters,

1260
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,550
you got your dumb ass to
take care of and I am dumb.

1261
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:06,170
You can tell Ya. So what
is it? What does it,

1262
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:09,050
one of those things that
matters and what's the next
mission she's going to find?

1263
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,870
Maybe she's to end up being a paramedic.
Maybe she goes, you know, who knows?

1264
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:15,950
Maybe she'll end up being an artist. Maybe
she'll end up having her own podcast.

1265
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:17,960
Maybe she'll end up being a painter.
I Dunno.

1266
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:21,740
But what mattered in the past is awesome,

1267
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:26,690
but let's find out what matters now. Yup.
And grab hold of that baby. Listened,

1268
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,740
listened to Jocko.
Now

1269
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:34,850
hold on to that thing and let that
thing grow. Yeah. Let that thing grow.

1270
01:18:34,851 --> 01:18:39,500
Let that thing feed off of the
past and bring something new,

1271
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:45,260
something bigger. Something that
happening. Something that's happening now.

1272
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,690
But that's my wife. Yeah. That's awesome.
You should use the damn proud of her.

1273
01:18:51,691 --> 01:18:52,710
I could see it on your face.

1274
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,890
Like I don't have any
decorations for saving.

1275
01:18:55,891 --> 01:19:00,860
People yelled at either
do I life, you know? Uh,

1276
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:05,470
and you know,
and I think about what I,

1277
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:10,360
what I saw, I saw a lot of destruction,
but honestly it was mostly the enemy,

1278
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,110
you know, that I caused and I'm
like, it's easy to step over him.

1279
01:19:14,111 --> 01:19:17,200
Like he doesn't look like me. He doesn't
talk like me, doesn't dress like me.

1280
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,650
Like I don't even know that, you know,
I didn't know nothing about that guy.

1281
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:23,530
Step over him, carry on, she rolls up,

1282
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:29,320
let's just take my case. She knows
me. I'm Jodie, I'm her buddy.

1283
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:33,480
We watched a family guy together.
I used to, you know her,

1284
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,800
her ex husband and I used to,
we're, we're buddies, you know,

1285
01:19:35,801 --> 01:19:38,290
like you know all these
things in and she would,

1286
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:40,120
whenever she would roll up to a scene,

1287
01:19:40,121 --> 01:19:44,110
it was the clean up the mess the
enemy made of us. And she knew most.

1288
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:46,650
We're a tiny army. Yeah. And our,

1289
01:19:46,651 --> 01:19:51,640
or were brick at brigade for
us is like 3,200 guys, maybe,

1290
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,330
maybe,
maybe 2,500 in 2006.

1291
01:19:56,110 --> 01:20:01,110
So she knew most of the guys that she
put into body bags or like in my case she

1292
01:20:01,151 --> 01:20:05,650
says after they loaded me on
the helicopter and it flew away,

1293
01:20:05,651 --> 01:20:09,540
she was just sad because she knew that
what I was going home to because of my

1294
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:11,610
injuries. Right. She was like, she knew

1295
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:14,380
more about your future than you did.
Exactly.

1296
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:16,050
She knew what a nightmare you were about.

1297
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:16,510
Go through.

1298
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:21,280
She knew that what I was and who I
was and what I was now going to be.

1299
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:25,400
They have to become an except and
she says that she said that in an,

1300
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,690
she had never said that to me and I read
it in an interview she gave once and

1301
01:20:28,691 --> 01:20:29,850
she said, yeah, I just, I,

1302
01:20:29,851 --> 01:20:33,970
I was just devastated for him because
of what he was going to go home to.

1303
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:39,320
This big, tough, strong, proud
guy had to go home without feet.

1304
01:20:39,321 --> 01:20:43,450
She's just like, oh, and I guess
she said something like, you know,

1305
01:20:43,451 --> 01:20:47,590
if nobody else looks after him,
I guess I gotta God dammit she did.

1306
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:55,090
Next question prompts to, Alana,
you love your baby. Awesome.

1307
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:03,440
Kind of a next question which I paired
these two together because this one

1308
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:07,050
relates here. How do you deal with
being away from family and loved ones?

1309
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:14,190
Oh, I'm uh, I'm odd.
I'll always have been.

1310
01:21:14,191 --> 01:21:17,160
I think this might be where I
might be a little bit like you.

1311
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:21,510
Do you ever like,
I just,

1312
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:27,330
I don't really miss people.
Yes.

1313
01:21:27,331 --> 01:21:30,390
Does that make sense? Do you know what
I'm saying? I know I can see it. Okay.

1314
01:21:30,391 --> 01:21:34,850
You know I, I don't miss people
cause I know I'm going to see them.

1315
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,630
Even my dog.
I love my daughters,

1316
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:41,580
love my daughters and I'll walk in the
house and they're better than puppies.

1317
01:21:41,581 --> 01:21:43,780
Right. They jump on me
and I get Daddy, Daddy,

1318
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:47,400
it's the seven year old's still
does it. I get kisses, I get hugs.

1319
01:21:47,401 --> 01:21:49,350
I get where were you?
You were gone so long.

1320
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:54,690
But like today I haven't spoken to them
and I don't miss him.

1321
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:59,700
I know that they're out there like,
but on a, on a, on a certain level,

1322
01:21:59,701 --> 01:22:02,760
when I do get home I'm real
happy to be home. Yeah.

1323
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:05,250
Like you were saying to me on the phone,
like you just want to get home,

1324
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:10,630
but when I'm away from home
you're in the game. Yes.

1325
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,800
Especially for this I guess cause I'm
here to promote the book and I'm here to

1326
01:22:13,801 --> 01:22:17,250
hang out with you guys. So
I'm like, I'm looking forward.

1327
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:21,300
And it's like when my dad was crying
in the parking lot before I went on my

1328
01:22:21,301 --> 01:22:26,220
first mission ever. To me it was
like, what's the big deal dude?

1329
01:22:26,221 --> 01:22:30,780
I'll be back in six months and, and
you know, my best, my best buddies,

1330
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:35,730
you know, the, the guys that I
was happy didn't die in combat.

1331
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:40,410
I've talked to them every
three to six months. You know,

1332
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:44,250
I just talked to the leader of that Green
Brae team that I worked so much with

1333
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,760
just the other day after two years
of not actually speaking. You know,

1334
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:51,990
a couple of messages on Facebook in this,
it's weird for me.

1335
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,200
Yeah. I'm very similar. I don't,

1336
01:22:55,770 --> 01:23:00,770
I don't feel the need to continually
update people or talk to people.

1337
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:04,080
And my best example is the guy went
through seal training with did three

1338
01:23:04,081 --> 01:23:06,850
platoons within that seal team, wasn't
training cell with them at seal team one.

1339
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,580
And he was my roommate that entire time.

1340
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:14,410
So eight years or so we were, and
we, we did everything together,

1341
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:17,890
drank together, hung out together,
everything we did and I got,

1342
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,250
and then I got moved to Virginia Beach
for two years. Didn't talk to him.

1343
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,550
Not One single time, not a letter, not a
phone on a phone call, nothing came back.

1344
01:23:25,551 --> 01:23:30,040
It's almost like, hey, what's up man?
Oh yeah. Hey, you want a burger with us?

1345
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:32,590
You know what I mean? It was just like
nothing to write up. Picked it right up.

1346
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:35,620
And that's how I always feel. So, um,

1347
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:39,080
and I kind of do that with my
family, at least in it, you know,

1348
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:41,920
I'm assuming that this
person is a guy that's um,

1349
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:46,780
thinking about being on deployment
without his family. And so, yeah.

1350
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:47,531
And again,

1351
01:23:47,531 --> 01:23:52,240
when I talked about earlier is I'm going
to compartmentalize and say it and I'll

1352
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:53,090
tell you this is,

1353
01:23:55,270 --> 01:24:00,270
I didn't want to talk to my wife and
kids every day at all when I was on

1354
01:24:01,841 --> 01:24:05,890
deployment. I didn't want you could do it.
I mean, if you were, if you were on base,

1355
01:24:05,891 --> 01:24:07,960
you could do what I mean.
For those of you that don't know overseas,

1356
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:12,100
most places overseas right now, you
got Internet, you got satellite phone,

1357
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,270
you can call home.
You can,

1358
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:17,500
I did not want to do that with
my wife and with my family.

1359
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:22,450
When was your first deployment? Uh, 2003
2004 that was your first one ever? Oh No,

1360
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:25,890
no, no. I, my first
deployment was in 92 93 yeah,

1361
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:31,290
mine was a Kosovo 99 you called home on
a w you had one phone [inaudible] it was

1362
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,380
seven second delay and
you got 15 minutes a week.

1363
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:41,260
Maybe it was 42nd delay.
I just know like it sucked.

1364
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:46,480
There was no such thing as email,
email and 99 first of all,

1365
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:47,760
I didn't even have an email.
Yeah.

1366
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:52,300
And so there's one guy on base who is
the Geek and he would go back to the main

1367
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:56,950
camp where they had the Inter Inter web
and you had to give them your email and

1368
01:24:56,951 --> 01:25:01,951
the password and he would download your
messages onto a CD Rom com back with it

1369
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,990
and print it off on the
clerk's computer for you.

1370
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,300
I wonder if our type of
thinking about it is,

1371
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:15,540
is a response from the fact that we just
didn't have it the first time and then

1372
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:20,200
buy between 99 and 2006 and 2006 I had
a sat phone in my pocket for every,

1373
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:23,650
everywhere I went. I could have
called home all day every day,

1374
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:27,880
but I didn't because I was like,
well, first of all to treat.

1375
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,440
And second of all,

1376
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,680
I know a lot of work at a job to
do and I can't be worrying about.

1377
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:37,540
I one time I was on the phone and a shot
went over my head, Hey dad, I got to go.

1378
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,950
Hey, you know, when he's,
and then I think, uh, um,

1379
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,230
your Guy Chris Kyle in his book,

1380
01:25:44,231 --> 01:25:47,170
he talks about being on the phone
and then a gunfight starts. Yeah.

1381
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:50,710
And his wife listens to the gunfight
because you forgot to hang up the phone.

1382
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,490
Are you kidding me?
Putting your family through that?

1383
01:25:55,240 --> 01:26:00,240
But I think maybe our situation is that
we came from the generation where that

1384
01:26:00,611 --> 01:26:03,980
just wasn't an option anyway.
So I would love to talk to some of the

1385
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,330
newer guys. Yeah. About this,
about this subject. Um, my,

1386
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:11,810
I did two, I did three
shipboard deployments as a seal.

1387
01:26:11,811 --> 01:26:14,690
So we used to deploy on ships.
And the first one I went on the,

1388
01:26:14,691 --> 01:26:18,830
we didn't have internet, so it
was old school. You'd get mail,

1389
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,680
written mail,
but that was the norm.

1390
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:25,970
Once every 30 days or 35 days,
it'd be like mail call.

1391
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:28,940
Everyone would be all
excited. But um, yeah,

1392
01:26:28,941 --> 01:26:33,941
I think that that definitely conditions
you to not be addicted to having that.

1393
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:39,230
And I don't think you're helping the home
front either to call everyday and say,

1394
01:26:39,231 --> 01:26:40,500
I miss you so much.
I can't wait to,

1395
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:42,350
I don't know if it helps
the home front either.

1396
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:44,920
I think it actually is a little
bit painful for the Home Front.

1397
01:26:44,921 --> 01:26:48,440
I was talking to one of the wives the
other day of some of our guys that are

1398
01:26:48,441 --> 01:26:51,170
deployed,
don't get mad at me ladies,

1399
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:55,310
but I'm just saying a lot of ladies
that are deployed tents. That's true.

1400
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:58,940
But I was talking to a wife of
a guy I know and she says, Hey,

1401
01:26:58,941 --> 01:27:03,770
I haven't heard from so and so
for, for like four days. I'm like,

1402
01:27:03,771 --> 01:27:06,800
Huh? I'm like, he's probably on op.

1403
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:09,230
Like you know when he does for a living,

1404
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:13,700
you know exactly what he does for a
living. OPS can take awhile. He's like,

1405
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:17,090
it's like, yeah, but usually he
gets back to me and I'm like,

1406
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:19,430
obviously he's on a long up,

1407
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,040
but their condition now to always
hear back from you. You know what you,

1408
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:27,690
you talked about this in your book,
which is life's gonna go on. Yeah.

1409
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:31,640
And I think that that's something
too that will help, you know,

1410
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:35,450
if you're like for this guy that's going
to be gone for a long time and how's he

1411
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:38,810
going to deal with it except the fact
that life's going to go on and just be

1412
01:27:38,811 --> 01:27:43,250
cool with that. Things are gonna
change the things we can get remodeled.

1413
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,110
This is going to be some
new rugs in the house.

1414
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:46,490
It's gonna be a new piece of furniture.

1415
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:50,090
The fridge might break and
she'll go get a new one. Exactly.

1416
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:53,570
And there's nothing you can do both
and you can just be cool with it. Yeah.

1417
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,360
If you don't like the color she picks,
say thanks for getting the new fridge.

1418
01:27:56,361 --> 01:27:56,990
Yeah.

1419
01:27:56,990 --> 01:28:01,190
Thanks for taking care of that because
I was busy doing protecting freedoms and

1420
01:28:01,191 --> 01:28:04,400
democracy in the world.
All right,

1421
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:07,003
next one.

1422
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:11,300
What are your workout
slash training methods?

1423
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:16,390
I usually make it up as I'm
walking into that. No. Okay. Um,

1424
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,480
right now because I am
bodybuilding and I'm going like,

1425
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,780
I'm doing a, might be hearing
from echo here in a second.

1426
01:28:23,781 --> 01:28:28,490
He's the big time bodybuilder.
Do you buddybuild no. No. Okay.

1427
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:33,830
So I've worked out since, you know, I
was 16 with weights, right. But I always,

1428
01:28:33,831 --> 01:28:36,230
so my first mission in Afghanistan,

1429
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:42,070
because I was a driver slash bodyguard
and remember Animal Stak yes.

1430
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:46,670
Supplement, which was basically
steroids. Yes. So we would order,

1431
01:28:46,671 --> 01:28:51,050
we ordered a shit ton of animal stack
and because we had a lot of downtime,

1432
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,930
we watched, um, you know,

1433
01:28:53,931 --> 01:28:57,050
like 24 of the series on
DVD and we worked out,

1434
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:02,310
I came home like bench benching,
like whatever four plates aside is

1435
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:05,520
dead lifting. Like I was like
huge. We looked, looked awesome.

1436
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:09,390
What did you weigh to 40 or
something crazy like that.

1437
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,250
And then I tried to get behind my sniper
rifle because I was not operating as

1438
01:29:14,251 --> 01:29:16,650
this neighbor. Right. And
I was like, Oh God, okay.

1439
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:22,680
Two big tried, tried rucking through my
rucksack on and tried to go up a hill.

1440
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:27,030
Oh my God. Oh yeah. So I had to slim
back down. I've realized, I'm like, oh,

1441
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:30,930
being a meathead is not
conducive to being a sniper. Um,

1442
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,260
so I always tried to tailor
my body around being a sniper,

1443
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:39,370
especially after that.
And, um, but now, uh,

1444
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:41,580
like I said,
I'm going to be 40 in January.

1445
01:29:41,581 --> 01:29:44,520
It's going to be 10 year anniversary
of getting blown up in January.

1446
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:49,860
And I wanted to quit drinking and I needed
a new goal to move towards. So I said,

1447
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,580
I'm gonna get into bodybuilding and if
you know anything about bodybuilding,

1448
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,990
I don't want to look like Phil Heath.

1449
01:29:56,100 --> 01:30:00,660
I want to look like a Arnold
when he was in the 70s, sixties,

1450
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:05,370
when they still look humans. So you
picked a realistic goal. Yeah. Something,

1451
01:30:05,371 --> 01:30:09,330
something where I might not need
supplementation from another country. Um,

1452
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:14,170
and not that there's anything wrong
with it. Whatever man of, to me, my,

1453
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:17,790
my view on that stuff is if it gets you
to where you want to be and you're not

1454
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:21,840
hurting anybody, who cares, right. It's
your body. Do whatever you want with it.

1455
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:27,090
Um, so, but, but for
bodybuilding, you look good.

1456
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,010
So I'm doing the physique class,

1457
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:32,700
which means you wear board shorts and
you don't necessarily have a routine,

1458
01:30:32,701 --> 01:30:35,850
but they tell you how to pose.
They like, I want to see your abs.

1459
01:30:35,851 --> 01:30:38,130
We want to see your
glutes, whatever, whatever.

1460
01:30:38,130 --> 01:30:42,720
So you kind of just stand a certain way
and uh, and I take direction well, right.

1461
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:45,840
I'll be on the parade square basically.
So you look good,

1462
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:49,260
but you're not really good for much
know when you're in that condition.

1463
01:30:49,261 --> 01:30:53,010
So I want the picture of me
with a six pack. I'll be 40,

1464
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:56,070
I'll have a glass of water,
it'll all go away. Um,

1465
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:59,140
and then I'll celebrate
the 10 year anniversary of
getting blown up and I'll at

1466
01:30:59,141 --> 01:31:03,360
least I'll know that I've
got like somewhat of the
type of body I used to have

1467
01:31:03,361 --> 01:31:06,030
back. Okay. All that being said,

1468
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:09,210
my training now is being
directed by my buddy nick.

1469
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:12,480
And I do whatever he tells me.
And right now its

1470
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,000
chest and arms one day back and shoulders
and other day and legs and other day.

1471
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:24,380
Can you squat? No. How do you, what sucks?

1472
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:28,020
Because that was my favorite
exercise of course, of course. Um,

1473
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:31,890
but there's gotta be some like modified,
I do a hack squat. Okay. There,

1474
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:35,430
you know the machine. Yeah.
So I recently discovered it,

1475
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:40,560
like in the last six weeks I,
I discovered this machine hack squat,

1476
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:45,490
um, before I was doing leg press and, uh,

1477
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,870
curls.
I can't really do extensions cause the,

1478
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:53,900
cause the stumps are different length
and where the pad rests across my shins,

1479
01:31:54,011 --> 01:31:57,000
it tweets too much torque on my stumps.
So,

1480
01:31:57,001 --> 01:32:00,040
but then I found this hack
squat thing and it's, it's

1481
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:02,130
made all the difference. So I, you know,

1482
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:06,700
slap as much weight on it as I can stand
in and I just squat cause it's almost

1483
01:32:06,701 --> 01:32:08,350
like a squat. Yeah, it's pretty close.

1484
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:13,530
But I'm supported so my wife's has
noticed a firmer ass. There you go.

1485
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:16,200
Things like that, you know.
And so anyway, my, my,

1486
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:19,540
my routine is just that and you know,
the food is,

1487
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:22,420
I'm a big baby when it comes to food.
Um,

1488
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:26,310
I've never eaten my vegetables and I
don't care what nick says or what my mom

1489
01:32:26,311 --> 01:32:30,160
used to say. I'm not going to eat
him. That's what my food eats. Um,

1490
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:34,990
you know, I'm a meat and potatoes guy
pretty much. Um, and that's about it.

1491
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:39,250
I have the worst eater of food,

1492
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:44,020
like fear factor with Joe Rogan's old
show. I would be the worst contestant.

1493
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:45,150
I'll be such a low,

1494
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:48,130
well I might be able to pull
it off because I've eaten
some pretty gross things

1495
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:50,650
cause I had to write.
But um,

1496
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:55,060
like I just don't like a lot
of foods. I'm the same. Yeah.

1497
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:58,330
And I don't care what anyone tells you.
Oh come on. You just got to try it.

1498
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:01,870
I'm not, I'm not trying it. Yeah, I
just smelled it. I want to throw up.

1499
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,100
I just looked at it. It's something I
don't want my mouth. How about that? Okay.

1500
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:10,240
How about you just get me the steak
without any spices or sauces on it.

1501
01:33:10,241 --> 01:33:14,380
Like I asked for and the plain potato
I want next to it and I'll follow some

1502
01:33:14,381 --> 01:33:17,110
butter and some pepper on that bad boy.
That sounds like a good,

1503
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:21,190
it's like that's what food tastes like
and that's what I love. But you know,

1504
01:33:21,191 --> 01:33:23,680
Atlanta makes fun of me cause my
favorite ice cream is vanilla. I'm like,

1505
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:25,330
my life is exciting enough.

1506
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:30,490
I don't need no strawberry
sprinkle bubblegum ice cream.

1507
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,380
It's bringing my vanilla. Maybe a Brownie
on the side. Yeah, I don't know. I, I,

1508
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:38,410
I do go with the mint chocolate
chip milkshake, but Ooh,

1509
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,040
maybe release chocolates.
What about what,

1510
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:44,040
so you just literally see your
like steak and potatoes do you are,

1511
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,320
when you go to this bodybuilding yeah.
You're gonna have to drop a bunch of fat.

1512
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:52,270
Yeah. So I'm dropping the fat. You
got to do that by diet. That's diet.

1513
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:53,170
So what are you going to do?

1514
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:55,750
What do you know what Nick's going
to put you on for a program for that?

1515
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,760
We start that next week.
You think he's going to go like no carbs.

1516
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:01,803
All Fat.

1517
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:05,590
He's a proponent of the old school
bodybuilding where you never want to be in

1518
01:34:05,591 --> 01:34:10,540
Ketosis really? But he's a
body builder. We're going to,

1519
01:34:10,541 --> 01:34:14,410
I want to get them to re look at
the physique stuff because you know,

1520
01:34:14,411 --> 01:34:17,060
if you read Arnold's new update,

1521
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:20,730
more modern book on bodybuilding
or Encyclopedia of bodybuilding,

1522
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:25,390
which he rewrote the nineties
they still went by the whole fuel,

1523
01:34:25,391 --> 01:34:30,010
the muscle with the carb thing.
Right. But they looked amazing.

1524
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:31,140
So they,

1525
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:34,630
they might have been onto something
because you've got to think about we're on

1526
01:34:34,631 --> 01:34:36,460
the juice.
Well,

1527
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:40,460
Arnolds most of those guys and say in
the 70s they weren't juice. Actually,

1528
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:41,470
you're completely wrong.

1529
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:46,810
Those guys were absolutely
juicing 100% in the 70s, the 70s.

1530
01:34:46,811 --> 01:34:50,740
Absolutely. And it wasn't even
late today. Not like today,

1531
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:55,800
but Arnold was absolutely 100% on steroids
as we're all those guys back in the

1532
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:02,090
day. And they weren't illegal yet,
but they all spit in the book.

1533
01:35:02,091 --> 01:35:04,490
He says he didn't really, they didn't
really know what they were like,

1534
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:08,810
their affect, they knew they helped. Oh,
but they didn't have it down to a science.

1535
01:35:08,811 --> 01:35:12,660
You know what their effect was
27 inch arms or whatever. Yeah.

1536
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:14,320
They didn't have it to science,
but they were taking,

1537
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:18,400
they were absolutely 100% on the sauce.
Um,

1538
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:21,320
and it wasn't illegal at the time.
They know that. Yeah, that's right.

1539
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:26,030
So that might be where that
idea comes from of hey,

1540
01:35:26,031 --> 01:35:29,690
they weren't on anything.
They were absolutely and on that.

1541
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:33,640
So completely yoked nick. Yeah, they
did. It look pretty good. Pretty you,

1542
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:35,210
you said that earlier. They like, oh,

1543
01:35:35,211 --> 01:35:39,350
you don't want to be natural like scores
and Baker the 70s I they still looked

1544
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:42,480
human is my point. They looked
more human than they do now. Mike,

1545
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:45,050
did you have you watched generation iron?
Yeah.

1546
01:35:45,051 --> 01:35:49,190
I mean what is now or just mutants. Yeah.
And that's great. Good for them. Amazing.

1547
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:52,760
But I can't, I need to lose
weight to be on prosthetics.

1548
01:35:52,761 --> 01:35:57,170
Like I can't be putting on that kind of
way. Yeah. So next thing is, um, could,

1549
01:35:57,171 --> 01:36:02,171
ptosis is bad because you risk losing
muscle mass and that's kind of counter to

1550
01:36:03,141 --> 01:36:06,840
the whole body building thing.
So transitional period,

1551
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:11,280
you do risk that if you're not in ketosis.
So there's the of,

1552
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:14,540
and it varies from person to person.
Some people they go through,

1553
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:19,190
they switch over to ketosis right away.
Yeah. And you know, the risk, you know,

1554
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:22,220
they don't, they don't lose out, but
some guys it takes weeks and yeah.

1555
01:36:22,221 --> 01:36:26,930
You as Muslim that, yeah.
Like, I'm not that big yet at
all, but I mean we're still,

1556
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:31,640
we've got till November and
uh, as long as it's, you know,

1557
01:36:31,641 --> 01:36:36,050
it'll probably be a protein
heavy. Uh, with the normal curves,

1558
01:36:36,051 --> 01:36:38,690
rice and potato, sweet
potato, stuff like that.

1559
01:36:38,691 --> 01:36:42,440
Like little bit of olive oil
and coconut oil and stuff.

1560
01:36:42,441 --> 01:36:46,370
You just go lots of fat.
Pretty good amount of protein,

1561
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:51,410
no carbohydrates. The, yeah,
no, sorry. But this is my thing.

1562
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:55,580
This is after the bodybuilding.
Yes. That's how I eat anyway. I eat,

1563
01:36:55,740 --> 01:37:00,170
I do love me some pasta though.
And Atlanta and I will crush a pizza.

1564
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:05,000
Like whoa. Oh yeah, that's our
thing. Friday night we get a pizza,

1565
01:37:05,001 --> 01:37:08,240
we rent a movie on iTunes.
You know how to get the occasional pizza.

1566
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:12,680
It's understood. It's a taste good.
Yeah. Yeah. Um, but occasional,

1567
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,320
yeah.
But my,

1568
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:18,770
my general rule for myself is
that it's usually a high protein,

1569
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:23,720
low carb diet. And if, and I like
to eat, like if I'm not eating,

1570
01:37:23,721 --> 01:37:26,390
I like to be taking like
a shake or something,

1571
01:37:26,391 --> 01:37:30,920
like every three or four hours or I just,
you tried to intermittent fasting. Yes.

1572
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:34,010
Yeah. Have knocked that. Um,
it's okay. I don't mind it.

1573
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:38,450
I like it as far as convenience
goes, man, that's a convenient died.

1574
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:42,890
I'm not eating today. Yeah, I'm going
to want more. And I, I don't, I did a,

1575
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:46,220
I did a 48 hour fast a little while ago,
just out of randomness.

1576
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:49,160
Like one day I worked all day or
traveled or something and I didn't eat.

1577
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:52,040
And then the next morning I worked out
right away and then I had a phone call

1578
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:54,710
and then I did something and I was
like, Dang, it's been 24 hours,

1579
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:57,180
I'm just going to throw 48 on this thing.

1580
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:59,740
So I went 48 it was no facts could squat.

1581
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:03,560
So you have zero intake or do you have
a zero or a drink of water? Just water.

1582
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:07,080
Drink water. And you know what? I
did squats, roll Jujitsu both days.

1583
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:09,840
It was no factor. Okay. Yeah, I did. Um,

1584
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:13,800
I did a 48 hour,
but I had coffee.

1585
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:18,930
Did you feel all right? Oh,
it's fine. I feel fine. I like,

1586
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:23,250
I had a little bit of tightness forbid,
but they whatever,

1587
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:24,300
like in the stomach.

1588
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:28,200
And I'll tell you once you read the
forgotten Highlander or any of these books

1589
01:38:28,201 --> 01:38:32,090
where I'm talking about these people that
are just going months without food or

1590
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:36,420
they get the people up in North
Korea eating, uh, what is it?

1591
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,930
Route and salt water soup.

1592
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,640
That's your meal. God. Oh, we,
we found some weeds out there.

1593
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:49,760
Do you ever have the dichotomy in your
mind of if I was a caveman I'd be fine,

1594
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:56,220
but then you realize it's 2016 and why
are you depriving yourself of something

1595
01:38:56,310 --> 01:38:58,410
or why aren't you taking
full advantage of the,

1596
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:02,670
of the technology available to you,
whether it's protein shakes or, or,

1597
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:06,530
or supplements like on it. I feel
like, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah.

1598
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,360
I agree with you on those points,

1599
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:14,361
but a lot of people think that the
benefits of 2016 are a twinkie,

1600
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:20,220
you know? Oh yeah, no, I was
bag of potato chips or whatever.

1601
01:39:20,221 --> 01:39:24,270
And that's picking my kids up from
school yesterday and I was sitting in the

1602
01:39:24,271 --> 01:39:27,870
office waiting for me to come down and
then there's this young fella sitting

1603
01:39:27,871 --> 01:39:30,660
over there by the next,
the principal's office eating his lunch,

1604
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:34,250
I assume because he can't be trusted
around other kids in lunch or so.

1605
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:39,350
I don't know what the deal is and he
pulled a twinkie out of his lunch.

1606
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:45,330
I almost fell over who gives
their kid at twinkie at lunch.

1607
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:50,370
That's supposed to be Christmas, but
when we be, when we, when I was a kid,

1608
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:53,640
I don't know about you. When I was a kid,
oh, you're thirsty. Here's a coke. Oh,

1609
01:39:53,641 --> 01:39:56,730
you're still thirsty. Here's another
car. Oh, you're hungry. Potato chips.

1610
01:39:57,040 --> 01:40:00,270
Like my mom would read the
ingredients on stuff and be like, oh,

1611
01:40:00,271 --> 01:40:04,200
there's way too much sugar in this shit.
I got cocoa puffs for my birthday.

1612
01:40:04,201 --> 01:40:07,800
My parents. Oh, I was, I was rice crispies
and cornflakes the rest of the time.

1613
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:11,700
Yeah. Thank you, mom. Yeah,
I was lucky charms. I mean,

1614
01:40:11,701 --> 01:40:15,090
we just ate it and it wasn't like my
parents said, oh, this might be bad.

1615
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,940
That was just what people
bought. Yeah. When I was a kid.

1616
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,030
Now my mom was on top of that
stuff and I have that too.

1617
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:26,031
Like there's sugar in like a loaf of
bread now I give my daughters as to slice

1618
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:32,490
sandwich, that's like 12 grams of sugar.
If they eat the whole thing, I'm like,

1619
01:40:32,491 --> 01:40:36,390
why is your sugar in the
bread and and like I'll be,

1620
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,510
I'm not,
I'm like an 80 20 guy,

1621
01:40:39,511 --> 01:40:41,820
whatever that you know the
80% like 80 hours at a time.

1622
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,320
I pretty good 20% of the time I'm
getting after some crap. Right.

1623
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:49,440
I'm a lot like that. And most of the time
it's because like the other day I was,

1624
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:54,250
I was doing side was that film and I was
traveling and it, it wasn't the Pretzel

1625
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:57,400
wrapped hot dogs that we
are all so fond of. It was,

1626
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:02,410
but I was legit hungry and I knew I was
getting back early enough in San Diego

1627
01:41:02,411 --> 01:41:04,690
that I was going to be able
to get a workout in and train.

1628
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:07,950
So I had,
you know,

1629
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:12,060
had like a milkshake end up double meat.
Same,

1630
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:16,690
which have some guide where some
random place in the airport.

1631
01:41:17,190 --> 01:41:22,140
Oh, the airport. [inaudible]
dog. Yeah. Yeah. It was good.

1632
01:41:22,141 --> 01:41:26,150
Milkshake airport milkshakes,
milkshakes or tasting

1633
01:41:27,810 --> 01:41:30,360
milkshakes are tasty.
So do you make,

1634
01:41:30,361 --> 01:41:32,970
do you make that kind of stuff at home
though? To try and trick yourself?

1635
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:35,070
Makes what kind of stuff at home?

1636
01:41:35,071 --> 01:41:38,670
So to trick myself into thinking
I'm having a treat, right? I got,

1637
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:43,700
I get my Blendtec I'll put coconut milk
in sugar-free cause you got to actually

1638
01:41:43,981 --> 01:41:48,720
search for that one. You
can't just, Oh anyway, so,

1639
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:53,280
uh, put my coconut milk in a, I
throw in a couple scoops of protein.

1640
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:58,200
I throw in a couple of scoops of uh,
organic sugar free peanut butter,

1641
01:41:58,201 --> 01:41:59,850
which you got a search out again.

1642
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:03,300
Did you know they take the peanut oil
at a peanut butter now? That's insane.

1643
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:04,733
Why did they do that?

1644
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:09,110
They sell it off and then they put the
vegetable oil and so now you got to

1645
01:42:09,111 --> 01:42:12,210
search out real peanut butter.
Thanks. Thanks world. Anyway,

1646
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:15,690
so I put it in a couple of scoops of
real peanut butter that I get to the bulk

1647
01:42:15,691 --> 01:42:20,410
barn and I'm in a cup, a
scoop of glutamine. But uh,

1648
01:42:20,910 --> 01:42:22,650
when I, and then ice it, right.

1649
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:25,140
And then I spin it up and
it's kind of like a shake,

1650
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:27,090
like a milkshake sent me the recipe.

1651
01:42:27,091 --> 01:42:30,390
If it tastes good and I'll put a shot
of espresso in often. And it just,

1652
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:34,140
it makes me feel like I'm having a treat.
And so I'm like, oh, that's my sugar.

1653
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:38,750
Her tooth satisfied for
the morning or my tree is,

1654
01:42:38,751 --> 01:42:41,720
my treat that I give to
myself is a dark chocolate.

1655
01:42:41,721 --> 01:42:45,170
And by dark I mean 85%.
It's,

1656
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:50,030
it's almost bitter. Yeah. And I
dip it directly into coconut oil,

1657
01:42:50,090 --> 01:42:53,240
the Onnit coconut oil.
I dip it right in there and scoop that in.

1658
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:57,350
And that is money. Yes. It's so good.

1659
01:42:57,950 --> 01:43:01,460
So good. And the other thing
about if you, if you and I,

1660
01:43:01,461 --> 01:43:05,960
we like broke out some Hershey's bars
here, milk chocolate, you take one bite,

1661
01:43:05,990 --> 01:43:09,770
you want another bite immediately, you
want another bite, immediately don't,

1662
01:43:09,771 --> 01:43:12,770
but you do. And you do it. Yeah. You take,

1663
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:16,670
you take a couple of squares
of 85% chocolate and it's like,

1664
01:43:16,671 --> 01:43:21,380
it satisfies it and it doesn't make you
go, oh, that was good. And it takes the,

1665
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:25,880
it gives you the satisfaction.
It takes longer. That's my,

1666
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:28,280
that's my special
chocolate I find as well.

1667
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:31,490
Don't find that it stays in
your mouth along with the taste.

1668
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:36,560
It's just a little bit bitter. Get the
dark chocolate, coconut oil. Coconut oil.

1669
01:43:36,561 --> 01:43:40,490
Makes it a little bit, just makes it
so by not heard this on your podcast.

1670
01:43:40,491 --> 01:43:41,324
But I don't,
I don't know

1671
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:43,980
why coconut oil,
by the way that I love on it,

1672
01:43:44,450 --> 01:43:47,110
but use it on it before it was called
on it. But they're cool. Coconut

1673
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:51,260
oil. That's the one he does. It's
the virgin coconut oil. Yeah.

1674
01:43:51,261 --> 01:43:52,400
It's really

1675
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:55,880
high quality coconut oil,
which is what I do.

1676
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:58,760
And actually it's good
too in supporting on it.

1677
01:43:58,820 --> 01:44:03,040
I actually do support this podcast.
Yeah.

1678
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:08,660
So, uh, whoever asked about
nutrition, it's um, ah,

1679
01:44:08,661 --> 01:44:12,230
you know, one thing I will,
that was me that asked about
nutrition wasn't that, no,

1680
01:44:12,231 --> 01:44:16,850
the question was about working out. We
kind of delved into nutrition. Okay.

1681
01:44:16,851 --> 01:44:19,610
Well Jocko, um, the other thing,

1682
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:24,700
my guts got destroyed by the antibiotics
in my recovery and it took me figuring

1683
01:44:27,231 --> 01:44:30,950
it out on my own. Like why was I
constantly having like, um, diarrhea.

1684
01:44:30,951 --> 01:44:34,850
Why was ed constantly not like just an
upset stomach? And then I started reading,

1685
01:44:34,851 --> 01:44:39,140
okay, what causes it? Do I have
IBS or blah blah blah. Oh No,

1686
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:43,050
I was on six months worth
of, of antibiotics, killed
everything in your gut.

1687
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:46,730
I've had staph infections like
I wanted a year, one year Rad,

1688
01:44:46,731 --> 01:44:50,330
like for staph infections
and my stumps in a row.

1689
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:52,480
And it just like just hand,
you know,

1690
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:56,090
just hammers cause I was getting sick
and like, so I'm like, what's wrong?

1691
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:59,590
And then I realize, oh okay.
So now every morning I like,

1692
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:03,230
I keep a bottle of Kombucha in the
fridge every morning. I just shake it up,

1693
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:06,740
take a Swig, have a probiotic
pill that I take with that swig.

1694
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:08,990
And that's made a huge difference.

1695
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:12,750
And I'm always seeking out
different ways to keep the, the,

1696
01:45:12,751 --> 01:45:17,540
the gut flora happy, you know,
so like apple cider vinegar,

1697
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:22,310
apple cider vinegar and Kombucha and
the probiotics, those three additions,

1698
01:45:22,311 --> 01:45:26,690
I've made a huge difference,
uh, in my, in my system, Mike,

1699
01:45:26,691 --> 01:45:28,790
my immune system alone.
And then I like,

1700
01:45:28,791 --> 01:45:32,660
I just started jack and massive amounts
of vitamin D and C and in my body.

1701
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:37,910
Um, and then I've, I've kept
a real close eye on like,

1702
01:45:37,911 --> 01:45:40,670
so as a kid, like, you know,
when we were eating lunch,

1703
01:45:40,671 --> 01:45:45,671
I didn't want onions and mushrooms
because as a kid I didn't like them and I

1704
01:45:46,191 --> 01:45:49,070
found out later as an adult while I'm
actually slightly allergic to them.

1705
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:53,480
So whatever your body tells you,
pay real close attention, you know,

1706
01:45:53,481 --> 01:45:57,380
because nothing will screw with your
gains are your workout routine more than

1707
01:45:57,381 --> 01:45:59,660
feeling like shit. Right. And,

1708
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:04,490
and so if you eat something
and you feel like shit after,

1709
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:05,061
you know,

1710
01:46:05,061 --> 01:46:09,110
pay attention to that because that can
take a lot of energy away from your

1711
01:46:09,111 --> 01:46:11,930
workout and just from your date,
you know,

1712
01:46:11,931 --> 01:46:14,720
like you go roll into work with a headache
because you ate something that you're

1713
01:46:14,721 --> 01:46:19,250
actually allergic to, like that can really
mess with your mood. So I pay super.

1714
01:46:19,530 --> 01:46:23,450
So one of the reasons why I'm such a
basic eater is cause I've learned that

1715
01:46:23,451 --> 01:46:28,370
that's how I feel best and I function
best when I have minimum sub like minimum,

1716
01:46:28,371 --> 01:46:33,200
like additions to like, you
know, when you, when you go
to the get breakfast, right?

1717
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:37,550
Nothing better than bacon and eggs in
the morning until they bring your home

1718
01:46:37,551 --> 01:46:40,070
fries and they're covered with Paprika,

1719
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:44,870
Montreal spice shit all over them.
And I'm like,

1720
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:47,330
why would you do that to my potatoes?

1721
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:50,010
Potatoes are delicious
with a little bit of butter

1722
01:46:50,530 --> 01:46:53,490
and salt.
All they come like that.

1723
01:46:55,860 --> 01:47:00,330
Can I have some without it? Ooh. Yeah.
Okay. You know what, keep it potatoes. Um,

1724
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:03,870
because I've learned that if
I have that go in my system,

1725
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:09,000
I'll spend a good half hour on the can
and that's time I don't can't afford,

1726
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:11,640
you know? So if anyone
who's like, you know,

1727
01:47:11,641 --> 01:47:14,100
when you're a big part of your routine is,

1728
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:18,270
is the fact that you have to have the
energy and like just not feel like shit

1729
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:22,560
when you, when you go into the gym.
Yeah. So that's why, by the way,

1730
01:47:22,561 --> 01:47:26,190
just so everybody knows
the probiotics and there's,

1731
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:30,660
there's bacteria in your stomach that's
supposed to be there that's good for you.

1732
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:34,380
Yeah. And that's what Jody's talking
about. That's why he drinks Kombucha.

1733
01:47:34,381 --> 01:47:38,580
It has the probiotic. Right.
Because it keeps those things alive.

1734
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:42,750
And what he was referring to earlier than
that, that when you take antibiotics,

1735
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:43,050
yeah.

1736
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:47,090
It actually kills all that bacteria and
then that makes your stomach not be able

1737
01:47:47,091 --> 01:47:51,090
to, that's why they came out with
the, um, the yogurt a few years ago,

1738
01:47:51,710 --> 01:47:55,470
uh, whatever it was called, the dot. Yeah.

1739
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,210
And I don't know,

1740
01:47:57,211 --> 01:48:00,360
there was that yogurt and they started
selling it cause it'll replenish your,

1741
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:05,430
your good flora. Yeah.
Whatever. Whatever. Yeah. Um,

1742
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:08,013
all right.

1743
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,100
A few more interwebs.
We got one more question.

1744
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,930
Do you ever have doubts?
If so,

1745
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:23,740
how do you handle them?
Yeah,

1746
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:28,060
I talked about the doubt I had
answering that second question.

1747
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:29,313
Um,

1748
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:34,860
if you don't have any doubt,

1749
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,920
I'm going to be real
suspect of you as a person.

1750
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:42,000
So do we all have doubts?
Hey folks,

1751
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:45,870
sorry to break it to your
Jocko occasionally has
doubts. He'll never admit it,

1752
01:48:46,350 --> 01:48:47,010
right?

1753
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:51,630
But doubts are part of being human and it,

1754
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:56,190
if you're not doubting yourself,
you're not challenging yourself either.

1755
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:58,350
I believe this.
This is just what I think.

1756
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:06,350
So I try to approach my doubts
head on unflinching you know,

1757
01:49:06,530 --> 01:49:10,670
did I have doubt this third time
I got sent into battle school?

1758
01:49:11,690 --> 01:49:14,330
Yeah. Big Time. But

1759
01:49:17,170 --> 01:49:21,220
put on the best uniform. Put on,
you know, getting the best shape.

1760
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:23,440
Polish your boots to the highest standard.

1761
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:27,190
Be prepared to get shit on and,
and,

1762
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:32,260
and bulldog your way through and smile
while you're eating that shit sandwich.

1763
01:49:32,290 --> 01:49:33,610
You know,
like the doubt is,

1764
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:38,103
yeah.

1765
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:39,600
You ever heard that?

1766
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,550
Like you ever talked to someone
and they talk about what they want,

1767
01:49:42,551 --> 01:49:45,850
they really want to be doing.
Okay. So I have a, I have a
buddy of mine, he's a cop,

1768
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:47,890
but he really wants to t shirts

1769
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:51,640
and he's like, ah, well, you know, I'm
just waiting on, well there's, you know,

1770
01:49:51,641 --> 01:49:52,211
there's a time,

1771
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:55,720
there's a time he even made a t shirt
for me and he's probably going to listen

1772
01:49:55,721 --> 01:49:59,560
to this and he knows who he is. And Bro,
I told you this at the time. He said,

1773
01:49:59,561 --> 01:50:03,400
Oh loud, let's sign a contract
for 12 months and this, I'm
like, you know, I don't,

1774
01:50:03,490 --> 01:50:08,260
um, six months tops and you know, if that,

1775
01:50:08,390 --> 01:50:10,090
and he's like, why? What's the
matter? I'm like, well, I just,

1776
01:50:10,091 --> 01:50:14,380
I just don't think you're going to, this
is it, this is where your are. He's like,

1777
01:50:14,381 --> 01:50:18,190
why? And I'm like, cause you're
not putting the f like you're cop,

1778
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:21,610
you're not a t shirt
cellar. And he see, you see,

1779
01:50:21,611 --> 01:50:25,360
he's doubting himself to take that leap.
You know?

1780
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:29,590
Did I have a doubt when I put my name
in for the election? Hell yeah, I did.

1781
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:33,220
I've never had been a politician.
I was a gunfighter. I was a sniper,

1782
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:38,410
but the ideal with doubt by
dealing with the situation.

1783
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:41,500
Does that make sense?
Yeah.

1784
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:46,930
Because I want to know that I can
a get through this, through it.

1785
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:50,620
And if I fail, I fail. It's,
hey man, I fail all the time.

1786
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:53,830
I've failed a reading your book.
You know,

1787
01:50:53,831 --> 01:50:56,560
I failed Megan to the airport
in time yesterday, but,

1788
01:50:58,330 --> 01:51:00,010
and I have doubt all the time,

1789
01:51:00,011 --> 01:51:05,011
but I also have enough confidence in
myself that I'm willing to try almost

1790
01:51:06,431 --> 01:51:07,264
anything.

1791
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:11,470
And I don't know if that's really
the question that was asked,

1792
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:16,990
but the answer is the same because fear
is the thing that holds you back from

1793
01:51:16,991 --> 01:51:18,160
almost anything in your life.

1794
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,880
That was I nervous when I put my hand
up to volunteer to go on sniper course.

1795
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:27,040
Hell yeah, I was, but where did I want
to be? I wanted to be on sniper course.

1796
01:51:27,470 --> 01:51:28,450
Um,
it was,

1797
01:51:28,451 --> 01:51:32,500
I nervous the first time I was in charge
of a sniper team going into combat,

1798
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:37,030
but guess what? There was
nowhere else I wanted to be. Um,

1799
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:40,910
doubt is your doubt. Is your
mind telling you, you know,

1800
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:44,260
to think about the things you
need to think about anyway, right?

1801
01:51:44,261 --> 01:51:45,640
Like the doubt is there for a reason.

1802
01:51:45,641 --> 01:51:50,641
It's a self preservation mechanism and
you need to use that doubt to put the

1803
01:51:51,131 --> 01:51:54,550
thoughts into your mind to
visualize the successful outcome.

1804
01:51:55,690 --> 01:51:58,990
Like we talked about earlier,
visualization, you know,

1805
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:02,140
I picked your failure all the
time and then I picked her.

1806
01:52:02,141 --> 01:52:03,070
How will I deal with it?

1807
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:06,300
Yeah,
no doubt.

1808
01:52:08,230 --> 01:52:10,330
Doubt to me is just a question to ponder

1809
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:16,030
and then move on, you know?
So that's, that's how I do it.

1810
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:20,030
I'm going to say for me,
I

1811
01:52:22,670 --> 01:52:27,670
agree that doubt is really how I know
that I'm pushing myself into a zone that

1812
01:52:30,921 --> 01:52:31,810
I'm not used to,

1813
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:36,770
but like the enemy,

1814
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:44,570
I respect my doubts. I'm
not afraid of them, right?

1815
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:45,950
But I them

1816
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:49,790
I'm going to watch them.
I'm going to listen to them.

1817
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,500
I'm going to understand my doubts,

1818
01:52:57,550 --> 01:52:59,110
but I'm not going to be afraid of them

1819
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:02,680
and I'm going to destroy them.

1820
01:53:05,470 --> 01:53:06,980
I get chills when he talks like that

1821
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,240
and I think that's

1822
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:14,120
bout all we've got for tonight.

1823
01:53:17,590 --> 01:53:22,170
Echo Charles, how can everybody just
step on up and support this pod?

1824
01:53:22,171 --> 01:53:23,200
Kashi, Bro. Huh?

1825
01:53:25,420 --> 01:53:26,253
Um,

1826
01:53:28,030 --> 01:53:31,840
well there's a few ways as we
were talking about earlier,

1827
01:53:32,130 --> 01:53:35,410
if you want to do some Amazon shopping,

1828
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:39,020
click for a book called unflinching.
Sure. Unflinching and what,

1829
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:43,210
what we do in this is no exception,
is we all the books that we talk about,

1830
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:46,720
we list them on Jocko, podcast.com
we have it listed, what kind of,

1831
01:53:46,721 --> 01:53:49,720
what they're about and what episode
they're from and stuff like that.

1832
01:53:49,721 --> 01:53:52,150
There's a link on there. You Click on
it, boom. You can buy for them. Right?

1833
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:54,040
That's the paper back.
Write their paper. Ben.

1834
01:53:54,041 --> 01:53:56,020
Also one of the coolest
pictures ever taken of me.

1835
01:53:56,650 --> 01:53:57,483
Yeah,
bitch.

1836
01:53:57,790 --> 01:54:00,910
I was checking out your picture here
and you have that little fun meter patch

1837
01:54:01,030 --> 01:54:04,240
you had that thing pegged.
Those of you that don't know,

1838
01:54:04,241 --> 01:54:06,970
that weren't in the military.
That was the one that guys were different.

1839
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,610
Random patches and some of them are,
you know,

1840
01:54:10,690 --> 01:54:15,000
proud historical patches of their unit.
And some of them that if you get this, uh,

1841
01:54:15,001 --> 01:54:17,650
if you, if you ordered the hardcover,
it looks like that you can't see it.

1842
01:54:17,651 --> 01:54:21,220
But on the soft cover you can see Jody's
got the little and everybody in the

1843
01:54:21,221 --> 01:54:25,730
military knows what this is a little fun
meter patch and the fun meter is paved,

1844
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:30,280
meaning, oh, I'm having all
kinds of fun here. Time.
That's awesome. There they are,

1845
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:35,380
a paperback hardcover. I like
hardcover. Me. That's what I do.

1846
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:40,210
That's good. But yeah, do that.
So I'll list Allen obviously. Oh,

1847
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:44,620
I can get through Amazon.
And then if you guys like the shirts,

1848
01:54:44,650 --> 01:54:45,850
discipline equals freedom.

1849
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:46,950
Okay.

1850
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:50,460
And the one with Jack was
hit on it because you want
to, by the way, thanks. Know,

1851
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:53,670
get one of those if you want to support.
And then of course,

1852
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:54,930
do your shopping at on it.

1853
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:59,040
In the event of you wanting supplements
that actually work because you gotta

1854
01:54:59,070 --> 01:55:01,680
watch out for supplements
and bodybuilding and stuff.

1855
01:55:01,681 --> 01:55:03,630
A lot of supplements not regulated.

1856
01:55:03,631 --> 01:55:08,130
They can put anything they want in them
and sell them to you. So get on it.

1857
01:55:08,131 --> 01:55:12,000
Supplements my opinion.
jacada.com/jocko Jocko,

1858
01:55:12,270 --> 01:55:14,550
get you percent off.
Get your shroom tech.

1859
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:18,180
I think shrink depending on what you're
doing. If you're doing high intensity,

1860
01:55:18,181 --> 01:55:21,570
sustained exercise,
shroom tech, Alpha brain.

1861
01:55:21,571 --> 01:55:23,880
If you want to think better and Krill oil,

1862
01:55:23,881 --> 01:55:27,540
if you want your joints still
hold up with the passage of time.

1863
01:55:27,870 --> 01:55:31,050
Do they still have the
shroom tick immune? Yes. Yes.

1864
01:55:31,350 --> 01:55:34,710
I love that one there. You find that
one good for when you're traveling,

1865
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:37,130
you are into on it. Even before. Yeah.

1866
01:55:37,131 --> 01:55:41,520
I forget what it was called but Andre
because he was on Rogan right like years

1867
01:55:41,521 --> 01:55:44,670
ago before they started on it
and he had these two supplements

1868
01:55:44,890 --> 01:55:47,190
because Andre used to like to party.
Huh?

1869
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:50,610
Take out from that statement whatever
you want. But that's what he,

1870
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:51,391
how he would put it in.

1871
01:55:51,391 --> 01:55:56,370
He had a supplement called roll roll on
I believe and it was meant to like roll

1872
01:55:56,371 --> 01:56:00,540
onto the next day. Oh you take it
when you're hung over. And I started,

1873
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:02,460
I ordered it and cause when,

1874
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:07,290
when I was very sluggish and all that
from the stuff from my addiction and just,

1875
01:56:07,291 --> 01:56:10,500
you know, the whole immune
cell, like I would look in
for anything. Yeah. So anyway,

1876
01:56:10,501 --> 01:56:14,760
that's why I started using it. They have
one, it's called new mood. It's for like,

1877

It's been a pleasure. Likewise, it's
a Mike continued seek. You know,

1898
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:39,700
I have a thing I call it,
I seek knowledge. You know,

1899
01:57:39,701 --> 01:57:44,560
I'm seeking the knowledge to continue
to grow as a human and learn, keep,

1900
01:57:44,561 --> 01:57:48,100
continue to learn who I am and it's
experiences like this that make it,

1901
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:53,590
that make it happen, make it possible
and just thanks man. This is,

1902

1903
01:57:55,810 --> 01:57:57,610
Well again,

1904
01:57:58,420 --> 01:58:01,030
thanks for coming on yourself
and as I said before,

1905
01:58:01,031 --> 01:58:03,940
most importantly thank
you for your service.

1906
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:09,960
The world is a better place for what you
did in the army and for what you have

1907
01:58:11,741 --> 01:58:14,110
done and are doing with your life.

1908
01:58:15,010 --> 01:58:18,850
It's an inspiration to everybody
that hears it and knows it.

1909
01:58:21,070 --> 01:58:25,560
And everybody else that's out there
listening, all those troopers,

1910
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:29,520
I tell you,
go do the same thing.

1911
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:36,710
Go follow the example set by Jody Mitic
and so many other brave veterans and

1912
01:58:39,631 --> 01:58:44,260
brief people in the world
that face their demons,

1913
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,090
whatever those demons are,
they face them and overcome them.

1914
01:58:50,330 --> 01:58:51,100
Okay?

1915
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:56,100
And make the world a better place
by making themselves better people.

1916
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:57,993
Cool.

1917
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:02,490
So go out there.
Make yourself better.

1918
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:07,800
Look that demon in the eye

1919
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:14,610
and get after it.
And until next time,
