00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.780
If you look at the shadows in this scene
you can see they're completely black.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.680
This is typically not
what reality looks like.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.623
As an example, the floor under your
desk is typically not completely black

00:00:12.623 --> 00:00:16.794
even if no light from any specific
lamp is hitting it directly.

00:00:16.794 --> 00:00:18.026
The classic hack for

00:00:18.026 --> 00:00:22.243
working around completely black
shadows is the flat ambient light.

00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:26.276
It basically means adding
a constant color to all pixels.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:30.991
As you can see, the shadows are no
longer black but still they look flat.

00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:35.866
As an example, you can't even see
where the edge between the wall and

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.810
the floor is in the shadow.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.962
Having a constant color like this
doesn't simulate how light behaves in

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:42.580
reality.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.668
You wouldn't be able to buy a lamp
like behaving like this at Ikea.

00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:48.800
Let's see if we can do better.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.479
So how do light behave in real life?

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:54.918
When you look at the point in the scene,
what is it you actually see?

00:00:54.918 --> 00:00:59.258
It's the light from the light source
being reflected into your eyes.

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:04.045
But only a fraction of the light
reflected from the surface

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:06.886
is actually going into your eyes.

00:01:06.886 --> 00:01:11.469
This bounced or indirect light is a big
contribution of light in a scene.

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.464
Let's enable simulation of it.

00:01:14.464 --> 00:01:16.809
Now the shadows looks
much more interesting.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:21.273
What's really going on is that light
hitting a surface is being reflected

00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:22.577
back into the scene.

00:01:22.577 --> 00:01:26.500
This light can then be
reflected back again and again.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.590
Since the walls absorb
light with each bounce,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.228
each secondary bounce is
weaker than the previous one.

00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:38.941
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:42.931
You can also see how the light hitting
the red wall is being reflected back

00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:45.170
into the scene as red light.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.538
This is what we call color bleeding and
it happens because the red wall absorbs

00:01:49.538 --> 00:01:52.640
all but the red component of
the light bouncing off it.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.035
To properly simulate
indirect lighting for

00:01:55.035 --> 00:01:58.110
complex scenes can be
very time consuming.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.530
Single frames of high quality rendering
can literally take hours and even days.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.780
This wraps up the ambient and
indirect like part.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.590
Thanks for listening.
