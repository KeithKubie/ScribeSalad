00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:14.260

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.700
Today I'm very happy
to have Chef Sven

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.930
Mede from Santa Monica's
Casa del Mar hotel.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.620
Sven has worked all
over the country.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.703
He's worked with some
greatts, like the late great

00:00:25.703 --> 00:00:29.200
Charlie Trotter, Bradley
Ogden, as well as Michael Mina.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.960
He was named Rising Star Chef by
the the Star Chef's foundation.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.330
Originally hailing from Germany,
now living in a Marina del Ray.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.050
And he's here to make a
delicious seared shrimp

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.430
and vegetable salad for us.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.930
So thank you guys.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.780
SVEN MEDE: Thank you.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.860
Hello, everybody.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.510
Welcome.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.100
Just to take all
the confusions away,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.350
I'm the chef for Casa del Mar.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.780
On your own little vouchers
there on the recipes,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.580
it says By the Blue Sea.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.480
Just to take this
right out there.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.620
By the Blue Sea, it's
a group of restaurants.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.790
I'm also in charge of the
restaurants at Shutters

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.930
On the Beach.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.430
Some of you guys are familiar
with Casa del Mar and Shutters

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.971
On the Beach.

00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:08.710
You guys been
there, some of you?

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.251
So at Shutters On the Beach, we
have a few restaurants-- Casa

00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:13.130
del Mar, obviously
Catch and Lobby,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.070
and we're in the progress of
building a new restaurant there

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.216
which will be a terrazza,
which will open in May.

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:19.590
So we're very
excited about that.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.090
But today we're
talking about Catch,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.690
and some great seafood
and some great vegetables.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.520
And obviously with
the location here,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.010
farmers markets
all over the place,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.530
every day of the
week and the ocean.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.430
And so that's what
we're trying to focus

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.200
on today, some light seafood.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.374
And you guys, please questions,
keep going questions,

00:01:37.374 --> 00:01:38.290
come up to look at it.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.660
I will do a lot
of stuff up here,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.243
so please walk up there if you
want to see something up close.

00:01:42.243 --> 00:01:43.570
And keep asking questions.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.930
OK so today we are
doing a shaved vegetable

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.050
salad and some seared shrimp.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.340
So it sounds pretty simple.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.530
It's really simple.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.120
There's a couple steps to it.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.040
First of all, we will start with
making a little vinaigrette.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.840
So the great thing about
this recipe I picked today,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.360
you can change these things out.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.070
So right now it's citrus season.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.340
I picked some tangelos.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.810
Anybody knows what a tangelo is?

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.600
It's a mixture of two citrus.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.070
Anybody knows?

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.270
Tangelo.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.770
No?

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.080
So it's a tangerine
and a grapefruit.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.960
So you get the sweetness
from the tangerine,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.890
but you also get the
acid from the grapefruit.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.510
OK, so we're using
that, and then we

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.960
got these great Meyer lemons.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.170
Meyer lemons-- they're
a little bit sweeter,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.586
they have a little bit more
flavor than the regular lemon,

00:02:27.586 --> 00:02:28.580
just being just sour.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.390
There's a little bit something
else to it, just lemon flavor.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.377
So using these two,
and then we just need

00:02:33.377 --> 00:02:34.710
a little bit olive oil for that.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.120
So we starting with
citrus right here.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.472
So I just-- you guys
should come up here,

00:02:41.472 --> 00:02:43.180
and you can see actually
what's going on.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.560
You guys want to come around,
a couple left, a couple right.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.950
So I feel like I'm in the
classroom otherwise here, not

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.350
in a kitchen.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.360
It's much more fun.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.010
So citrus right here.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.044
I just press some
of that juice here.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.460
If you really like
the citrus, you

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.162
can also use the inside of them.

00:03:02.162 --> 00:03:03.870
I'll get a little bit
more tangelo juice.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.670
OK, and then the Meyer lemon.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.790
What I do normally, I
just roll the citrus,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.920
as it loosens up inside
the flesh a little bit,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.669
and you get more juice
out of your citrus.

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:18.880
You see the color is also
a little bit different.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.110
It's a bit more yellow
actually than a regular lemon.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.610
All right.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.651
We get some more of that.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.540
OK.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.190
So we have the acid now.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.137
So now what we need
now it's our olive oil.

00:03:34.137 --> 00:03:36.470
So what we do normally, we
just always add the olive oil

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.440
slowly into the citrus.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.480
If you do a champagne
vinaigrette, same thing,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.620
you take your oil,
and you slowly

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.680
add it into your vinegar.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.647
New bottle?

00:03:47.647 --> 00:03:48.230
Here it comes.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.350
So very important
seasoning, always everything

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.390
gets seasoned.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.190
And next step is everything
needs to be tasted.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.271
So a little salt and pepper.

00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:15.020
And then we get some
tastings spoons here.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.560
You want a great
balance in that.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.018
You want a little
bit of acid-- you

00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:23.602
want a little bit
of the sweetness.

00:04:23.602 --> 00:04:24.850
AUDIENCE: You moved over
this way and that way.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.270
SVEN MEDE: Oh, we screwed
up the camera system?

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.580
Sorry.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.070
And you want a little bit of
the richness of the olive oil.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.663
SVEN MEDE: OK.

00:04:34.663 --> 00:04:35.969
There we go.

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:36.510
A touch more.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.630
So we're good on that.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.562
That's our first step.

00:04:40.562 --> 00:04:41.520
That was pretty simple.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.517
Simple vinaigrette.

00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:44.350
And you can exchange
with anything you like.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.397
If you just want to
use pomegranate juice,

00:04:47.397 --> 00:04:49.480
if it's like winter season,
you do the same thing.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.790
Use some fresh
pomegranate juice,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.748
you add some olive oil,
little salt and pepper.

00:04:52.748 --> 00:04:53.770
Very simple.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.270
Basic ratio is normally
like one to one,

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.467
if you use fresh juices
and some olive oil.

00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:00.550
OK that's the first thing.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.420
The next thing what we want
to do, we do a simple pickle.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.810
What I will use for that,
we use these Fresno peppers.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.290
So you can do anything you want.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.750
The basic recipe is champagne
vinegar, sugar, and water.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.010
So what we do
normally, we just use

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.385
equal parts of sugar and water.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.580
You will bring
that up to a boil.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.674
OK, let's see if
this thing works.

00:05:29.674 --> 00:05:30.430
It does.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.590
OK, and then after
this comes up boil,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.420
I'm adding the same
amount I have in here.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.570
I add the same amount
of vinegar to it.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.260
That's your basic
pickling liquid.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.780
You can use that
to pickle radishes,

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.436
peppers, onions, cauliflower,
anything you want to do.

00:05:44.436 --> 00:05:45.560
It's always the same thing.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.434
You have a recipe on
your little cards there.

00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:48.230
It's very simple.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.460
You make your liquid,
you put your vegetables,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.350
you slice them thin.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.340
You add them in to it,
just bring up to a boil,

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.840
let it cool down in the liquid.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.460
If we have this going here,
it will take a second.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.380
And you can use all
kinds of vegetables.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.550
You can hold them in that liquid
for four weeks pretty much.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.179
Just like you would
buy your pickles,

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:05.970
you can hold them in
the fridge, same thing

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.350
with your homemade pickles.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.630
It will hold for long time
because of the vinegar inside.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.650
But this comes up to a
boil, we'll just hold on.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.920
I will start getting
these peppers cut.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.810
So the peppers here, I'm
starting from the end here,

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.360
and just cut the
little end off here.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.590
And then we just want to
slice them on the mandoline.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.650
Kitchen tools.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.295
Favorite kitchen
tools-- mandoline

00:06:31.295 --> 00:06:33.040
is a great kitchen tool.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.880
You can buy these fancy,
metal, gigantic things

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.340
for hundreds of dollars.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.800
These are my favorite ones.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.150
They're great, adjustable.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.629
You can run them
through a dishwasher.

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:45.670
They're not as expensive
and they work perfectly.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.068
They stay nice and sharp also.

00:06:47.068 --> 00:06:48.817
They come in a smaller
size, and they also

00:06:48.817 --> 00:06:50.210
come in this larger size.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.050
It's a great kitchen utensil.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.990
But they're sharp,
so be careful.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.929
Don't cut yourself on this.

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:56.970
So this comes up to boil.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.660
When this comes up, I just
add the vinegar to it.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.910
Do a little stir around, here.

00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:08.670
Let's make that's all
the sugar resolves.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.200
OK.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.590
So these peppers make sure
you hold, what I do here,

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.740
if you see that I hold onto
the bowl and the mandoline

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.040
at the same time so
it doesn't slide.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.760
And just slowly go
back and forward.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.330
And watch your fingers on that.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.585
Same here.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.290
If you get more to the end, the
slices get a little bit larger

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.190
and you have a little
bit more seeds.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.025
What you want to do then,
is just pick the seeds out,

00:07:42.025 --> 00:07:44.483
because the seeds already spicy,
don't have as much flavor.

00:07:44.483 --> 00:07:47.640
It just adds extra spice to
it you don't really need.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.630
Because you want the flavor
of the peppers, really.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.330
That's what it looks like, you
have nice little slices here.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.652
You see those?

00:07:54.652 --> 00:07:56.620
OK, we don't need all these.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.474
There you go.

00:08:00.474 --> 00:08:02.140
So see this liquid
is coming up to boil,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.140
what I do now, I just
at these peppers to it.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.780
And since I have a lot of
liquid, it boils right away.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.740
That's it, and I
just turn it off.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.780
If it turns off.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.350
It does.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.284
Perfect.

00:08:24.284 --> 00:08:25.450
Any questions at this point?

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.533
AUDIENCE: What kind of
ratio-- how many vegetables

00:08:27.533 --> 00:08:28.960
do you want to put in?

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.610
SVEN MEDE: You just need enough
liquid to cover the vegetables.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.902
I probably could add another
10 peppers here, probably,

00:08:34.902 --> 00:08:36.151
cause we have a lot of liquid.

00:08:36.151 --> 00:08:37.510
But you can reuse that liquid.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.289
It actually picks up more flavor
if you use it the next time.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.169
So if you finish eating
all your peppers,

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.127
you can take that liquid,
bring it up to a boil

00:08:44.127 --> 00:08:46.080
again, and just slice
fresh peppers into it

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.810
and do it again.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.930
Actually the flavor gets better
every time you're using it.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.802
So we just reserve this here.

00:08:51.802 --> 00:08:54.270
All right, I'll
put them over here.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.240
OK, let's start working on
all our vegetables here.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.240
So what I have here, about
to shave vegetable salad.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.870
I picked a bunch of random stuff
from the market-- baby carrots,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.870
radishes.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.226
Anybody know what that is?

00:09:10.226 --> 00:09:10.680
AUDIENCE: Daikon, I think.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.901
SVEN MEDE: Daikon, very good.

00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:13.400
They're used a lot
in Asian cooking.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.980
I like it because
you can eat it raw,

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.790
it's not as spicy as a reddish.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.180
It has a great texture,
especially in salads.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.650
Cucumber, red
onions, we're using

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.156
all of these in our salad.

00:09:23.156 --> 00:09:24.980
Give us a little space here.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.480
There we go.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.980
AUDIENCE: Do you go to the
local farmer's markets?

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.100
SVEN MEDE: Yeah,
mostly on Wednesdays,

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.770
cause it's the largest one
in downtown Santa Monica.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.850
AUDIENCE: Is that the best one?

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:36.740
SVEN MEDE: I don't know
if it's the best one,

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.115
but I think it's
the largest one.

00:09:38.115 --> 00:09:40.850
It has the biggest selection,
I think, of product.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.959
And it's all
together on that day

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:45.500
so I don't have to go to smaller
markets throughout the week,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.370
actually.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.120
Everybody's there, all
the larger vendors,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.250
smaller vendors.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.833
It's the best selection
I would think.

00:09:53.511 --> 00:09:55.010
Let's start with
our vegetable here.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.634
Let's start with
using these cucumbers.

00:10:01.122 --> 00:10:04.820
So we just cut the ends off.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.652
You can change it up, any
vegetables you want to shave.

00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:11.410
You can use fennel,
if you like fennel.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.830
You don't like daikon,
use fennel instead.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.410
As long as you slice
them very thin,

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.490
you can use all kinds
of different vegetables.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.962
You even could use squash
or butternut squash,

00:10:20.962 --> 00:10:21.920
or something like that.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.927
It all works.

00:10:22.927 --> 00:10:24.510
What I do here, just
peel the outside.

00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:37.670
Just want to get
the skin off here.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.480
The skin is a little bit bitter,
so you don't want to us that.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.070
And again, there's
different cucumbers

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.790
at the farmers markets.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.880
Right now, this one is
the best tasting one.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.620
So what I do then, after
I'm done peeling the skin,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.190
I just go over my bowl here.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.655
I just keep peeling
these ribbons.

00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:58.060
So we end up with these.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.570
See that?

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.094
Nice thin ribbons?

00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:02.010
And it's same thing I
would use the mandoline.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.445
It's just easier
with the peeler,

00:11:03.445 --> 00:11:06.026
actually less dangerous.

00:11:06.026 --> 00:11:07.150
So we just keep going here.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.550
Just keep turning.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.820
You don't wanna use the seeds.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.340
You just keep
turning the cucumber.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.830
Just keep peeling
them down, until we

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.730
get enough for a salad.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.370
I think that's a good amount.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.060
Let's put this aside.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.540
Next vegetable,
let's use the daikon.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.965
Same thing with the daikon.

00:11:35.965 --> 00:11:38.610
I cut a nice big chunk of it.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.039
Again, start
peeling the outside,

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:45.080
just get rid of the skin.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:56.310
And then, same-- let's get
this nicely cleaned up here.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.137
OK, same thing.

00:11:58.137 --> 00:11:59.470
So now we have this peeled side.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.030
I go over my bowl
here, and just keep

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.360
peeling, again, these
nice beautiful ribbons.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.709
You just have to keep turning.

00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:20.000
The daikon's pretty wide and
your peeler's not as wide.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.930
You just have to keep
turning it to make

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.114
sure you get the
same size of ribbons.

00:12:25.114 --> 00:12:27.030
OK that's a good amount,
about the same amount

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.030
as the cucumber.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.120
Next up, let's do baby carrots.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.685
I have two different carrots
here, yellow and red.

00:12:37.177 --> 00:12:38.760
You can use large
carrots if you like.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.510
Like I said, you can use fennel.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.857
You can even use cauliflower
or something like that,

00:12:43.857 --> 00:12:45.690
there's nice different
colors of cauliflower

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.064
at the farmer's
market right now.

00:12:47.064 --> 00:12:48.980
It also works.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.085
The same process, I start
peeling the outside.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.320
Go over here, and just
keep peeling it down.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.270
That's good.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.620
Let's do the red ones too.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.860
All right.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.030
Who goes to the farmer's
market of you guys?

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.270
Anybody goes on a regular basis?

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.558
What's your favorite
thing to buy there?

00:13:37.558 --> 00:13:38.516
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:43.785 --> 00:13:45.820
SVEN MEDE: Yeah, I
mean that sounds great.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.316
Right now the time for
greens is fantastic.

00:13:48.316 --> 00:13:49.440
There's great greens there.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.430
Citrus is really
popping right now.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.530
So it's very exciting.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.160
It's always something new,
that's the best thing about it.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.255
OK, we have carrots.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.890
See that's nice
different colors too,

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.460
because you get dark red
carrots, there's yellow,

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.420
there's white.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.230
Just pick different colors up
and just peel them in there.

00:14:15.379 --> 00:14:16.920
You can use it all
the way down, Just

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.427
keep peeling until there's
no carrot left pretty much.

00:14:19.427 --> 00:14:21.760
I'll just stop right here,
because we don't have all day

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.780
and I know you guys
want to go back to work.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.430
Or not.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.560
All right, got carrots.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.846
Next thing, let's
use some red onions.

00:14:30.846 --> 00:14:32.970
Again you can use red
onions, you can use shallots,

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.050
you can use cipollini onions.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.295
I just like to put some sort
of onion product into it.

00:14:38.295 --> 00:14:42.330
It gives a nice little spice
to it, nice little kick.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.380
Take the skin off here.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.570
Here we go.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.022
So now, here's the difference.

00:14:53.022 --> 00:14:54.730
It doesn't work with
the peeler any more,

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.180
now we have to
use our mandoline.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.820
I just cut the
end of it off so I

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.670
have a nice flat surface here.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:07.720
Let's get this wiped
off a little bit.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.360
So onion, right over here,
hold it together like this.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.626
There we go.

00:15:22.626 --> 00:15:25.270
We have these nice
beautiful thin little slices

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.349
of red onions.

00:15:27.349 --> 00:15:29.640
Everybody always like, how
you do this with your knife?

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.330
How sharp is the knife you use?

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.620
There's no knife, I
don't use a knife at all.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.080
Just a mandoline and a peeler.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.310
It's all you need for that.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.560
Let's do some radishes.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.780
I like radishes because it
has a little spice to it.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.321
There's lots of
different types, they

00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:45.050
have yellow ones, red ones.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.380
The English breakfast
radish is what that is.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.670
This a medium spicy radish.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.480
Works great for
salads like that.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.919
Let's grab a nice one here.

00:15:54.919 --> 00:15:56.335
I already washed
these vegetables,

00:15:56.335 --> 00:15:58.810
so we don't have to
worry about that.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.433
I actually did.

00:16:00.433 --> 00:16:01.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.565
I prepared before
you guys came here,

00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:04.880
and I actually washed them.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.470
OK, so slice the end off again.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.250
And then thin slices.

00:16:14.727 --> 00:16:16.810
And you gotta make sure
you keep looking and that.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:21.085
I can look away, but I wouldn't
recommend doing that at home.

00:16:21.085 --> 00:16:22.930
There we go.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.680
So you end up with
these nice slices here.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.770
Nice and thing again.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.760
You see, end of
the day, everything

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.718
has the same thickness.

00:16:27.718 --> 00:16:30.735
So if you eat your salad,
you have different textures,

00:16:30.735 --> 00:16:32.110
different flavors,
but everything

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.026
is the same thickness.

00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:35.960
So the salad marinates
really well like that.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.990
OK what are we missing?

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.610
We got this, we got
radishes, carrots, cucumbers.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.620
Very good.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.610
So all there.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.780
So now just clean
some of it up here.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.320
Done with this, and that.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:55.070
So next, let's
talk about shrimp.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:17:01.667
What I have here, is
called a blue prawn.

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:02.750
That's what it looks like.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.484
So when it comes
to shrimp, there's

00:17:04.484 --> 00:17:06.650
a lot of different types
of shrimp obviously around,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.619
some good ones, and then
some not so good ones.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:13.880
I prefer to buy shrimp
inside the shell, not peeled.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.670
Because you have
more possibilities

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.950
in how you want to use them.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:18.750
Same as with meat.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.069
If you cook meat on the
bone, that more flavor to it.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.100
A bone-in rib-eye
always has more flavor

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.099
then a boneless rib-eye.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:26.435
Same comes to seafood.

00:17:26.435 --> 00:17:27.810
If you cook a
whole fish, there's

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.018
more flavor to a whole fish
because you're cooking it

00:17:30.018 --> 00:17:32.220
on the bone, than
a filet of fish.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.510
Same goes with shrimp and
lobster and other crustaceans.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:39.201
So cooking a shrimp inside the
shell, in some applications,

00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:40.450
has much more flavor, you see.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.052
Like with the live spot
prawns and things like that,

00:17:43.052 --> 00:17:44.010
you just cut them half.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.420
That's what they
do at a restaurant.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.795
You just split
this whole shrimp,

00:17:46.795 --> 00:17:48.879
put them on the grill,
salt and pepper, olive oil,

00:17:48.879 --> 00:17:50.878
and you serve them in the
shell, because there's

00:17:50.878 --> 00:17:52.012
a lot of flavor for that.

00:17:52.012 --> 00:17:53.970
Now for our application
today, since we're just

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.010
doing a simple
salad, you don't want

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.145
to start peeling the
shrimp with your salad,

00:17:58.145 --> 00:17:59.610
it's kind of getting messy.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.220
So what we did here,
we just peeled them.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.120
We cut them in half,
pretty much like this.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.710
So we just get this
pan going here.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.130
Catching up?

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:17.821
You ready to go?

00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:19.320
Because these people
are hungry, OK?

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.945
So you better be ready.

00:18:22.945 --> 00:18:24.580
So get this nice and hot.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.430
Real simple, just a little bit
of olive oil, salt and pepper.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.209
What I do normally, I just
season my meat or fish

00:18:32.209 --> 00:18:34.500
in a separate bowl instead
of just putting too much oil

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.830
inside.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.547
The balance is better if you
season your things in the pan,

00:18:38.547 --> 00:18:41.130
season it in a separate pan, and
then put it in the frying pan

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.610
so you don't end up
with lots of excess oil.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.970
Salt and pepper.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.470
We really like using sea salt.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:56.803
Much more flavor, it's a
little bit healthier too.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.386
And it's a nice thing cause it
has a nice little texture to it

00:18:59.386 --> 00:18:59.510
too.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.160
Especially if you finish things,
finish meat, finish fish.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.710
It has a nice
little crunch to it,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.630
and it has much more
minerality and flavor than just

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.290
regular kosher salt.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.455
And then pepper.

00:19:09.455 --> 00:19:12.100
We always use pepper
mills at the restaurant,

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.030
because it's fresh ground
instead of just buying

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.200
pepper ground all ready.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.630
It's nice to have a pepper mill.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.080
What we do normally, we
toast the peppercorns.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.080
What it does, it brings
a little bit more flavor

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.060
out of the spices.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.520
A lot of spices, especially
in Asian cooking,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.590
you always toast the
spices before using them.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.190
Same we do with the peppercorns.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:33.121
Just a little pan over heat,
toast the peppercorns, and then

00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:35.120
put them into the pepper
mill, so it's much more

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.010
flavor out of the peppercorns.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.150
OK we'll season that.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.596
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a
question about the oil?

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:41.146
SVEN MEDE: Yeah.

00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:42.437
AUDIENCE: So you use olive oil.

00:19:42.437 --> 00:19:44.452
I know that some people
use more neutral oils.

00:19:44.452 --> 00:19:46.740
Is the olive oil flavor
going to stay with the shrimp

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.574
after it has cooked?

00:19:47.574 --> 00:19:49.323
SVEN MEDE: It stays a
little bit in there.

00:19:49.323 --> 00:19:50.910
And I think it fits the concept.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.885
AUDIENCE: Repeat
the question, sorry.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.570
SVEN MEDE: The question
was, why using olive oil?

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.350
I really like using
olive oil for things

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.490
like that, because it
goes with the salad.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.370
If I just want to cook
something separately

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.090
but nothing to do this,
I may use grape seed oil.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.700
If I need to fry
something very hot,

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.530
you use a peanut oil
or something like that.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.327
For this application where I
don't use a very high heat,

00:20:15.327 --> 00:20:17.910
I just want to have a little bit
carmalization on the outside,

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.784
and then adding it to
a salad and decide also

00:20:19.784 --> 00:20:20.910
to have olive oil.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.760
I think it fits better using
olive oil for that application.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.206
This pan should be good.

00:20:26.206 --> 00:20:27.330
So let's get these in here.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.690
When it comes to
cooking shrimp, meat,

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.240
anything like that, the
worst thing that can happen

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.130
is that the pan is really
too hot or too cold.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.300
You can hear it normally
on the sound of your pan.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:51.900
If it starts to explode
and getting really, really

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.496
loud when you put
this meat in the pan,

00:20:55.496 --> 00:20:56.674
it means the pan is too hot.

00:20:56.674 --> 00:20:58.090
If nothing happens,
you can't hear

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.700
anything, that means the pan
is probably too low in heat.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.934
You want to have a
little sound of it.

00:21:05.934 --> 00:21:07.350
Let's turn this
down a little bit.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.058
I started with a little
bit higher heat ,

00:21:09.058 --> 00:21:10.444
you get to see on it.

00:21:10.444 --> 00:21:11.860
And now I've turned
the heat down.

00:21:14.699 --> 00:21:16.240
Let's see if I figure
out this stove.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.067
I do.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:20.070
Here we go.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.370
If it smokes too much, then
you can add a touch more oil.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:29.074
What it does, pretty much,
is cooling the pan down.

00:21:29.074 --> 00:21:30.990
And don't be scared, you
can take the pan off.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.380
I don't need heat right now.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.600
Obviously the pan is hot so
I just take it to the side.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.556
You see the shrimp curled up.

00:21:40.556 --> 00:21:42.180
In this application,
it doesn't matter.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.980
In some other
applications, sometimes

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.960
what they do with the shrimp,
they put skewers inside.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.090
They make a little
wooden skewer.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.090
With whole lobster, they
put the skewers inside,

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.392
and tails stay straight.

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:52.600
Only if you want to have a
perfect plate of something

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.116
like that.

00:21:53.116 --> 00:21:54.490
This application
where we're just

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.270
doing the salad, the shrimp
like that is perfectly fine.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:58.720
Let me flip these over again.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.412
Next thing you want
to keep an eye on,

00:22:03.412 --> 00:22:07.872
there's nothing worse
than overcooked meat.

00:22:07.872 --> 00:22:09.775
I know people are always
scared to undercook

00:22:09.775 --> 00:22:11.144
it, don't wanna have it raw.

00:22:11.144 --> 00:22:13.310
But I think it's much better
to just take one piece,

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.412
and cut in half and look
at it, and then check

00:22:15.412 --> 00:22:16.620
if it's cooked or not cooked.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.036
Instead of just cooking it and
you say, no another minute,

00:22:19.036 --> 00:22:21.300
another minute, next thing
you know, it's just dry

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.900
and you can't go
back from this point.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.554
So you always want to
just stop it and say,

00:22:25.554 --> 00:22:26.470
hey is it done or not?

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.680
Just take one piece, cut
it in half, look at it.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.870
If it's done, it's done.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.690
If not, just put it back in the
pan for another minute or two.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:38.020
So that's pretty much done,
let's turn the thing off.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.850
Let's push them aside.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.190
There we go.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.730
Let's put our salad together.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.320
First I have the
vegetables here,

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.445
let's get them all in here.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.385
And now our dressing.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.680
And the ratio is only
about a tablespoon

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:13.390
per serving of the
salad, as a basic recipe.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.760
I used a teaspoon, so I
use a little bit more here.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.780
There we go, that's good.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.490
Again, we mix it
around a little bit.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.341
And very importantly,
you want to taste it.

00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:31.590
Just take a little piece here.

00:23:36.812 --> 00:23:38.020
this needs a touch more salt.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.810
Start putting it together.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.690
Are you ready over there?

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.820
I'm going slow for you.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.540
So salad right in the middle.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.380
That's a nice,
fresh, summer dish.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.920
With the citrus,
but like I said,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.170
you can server this in winter.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.440
Use butternut squash and
pomegranate vinaigrette

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.465
and now you have a
great winter salad too.

00:24:07.465 --> 00:24:09.960
Let's do some of the
pickles on top here.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.880
Great kitchen tool, by the way.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.615
I don't know if I
said that already.

00:24:22.615 --> 00:24:24.420
Every chef's new
favorite, I know

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.820
it didn't exist until 10 years
ago, but now everybody has one.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.980
It's the tweezers.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.360
You can do stirring,
you can take things our,

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.490
you use it for frying,
turning over your steaks.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.720
I use it at home
for barbecue, it

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.490
did do them in small,
large, anything.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:42.470
It's just a perfect
kitchen tool by the way.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.970
Shrimp.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.952
And then let's--
something nice and fresh,

00:24:55.952 --> 00:24:57.410
let's add a little
cilantro leaves.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:04.589
The reason you had nice cilantro
flowers at the farmer's market.

00:25:04.589 --> 00:25:06.380
Unfortunately we couldn't
get them anymore.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.880
But like I said, you can
exchange these things.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.800
Cilantro flowers,
arugula flowers.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.360
If you want a more
substantial salad,

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.985
you actually could add a little
bit arugula to your vegetables,

00:25:15.985 --> 00:25:18.160
too, and make it more
like a composed salad too.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.840
So we added some cilantro here.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.050
Just to finish, can just put a
little more vinaigrette on top,

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.136
like that.

00:25:26.136 --> 00:25:27.760
That's it, we have
a nice, fresh salad.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.049
Now for anybody who
wants a little more

00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:32.340
kick to it, because these
are more like sweet and sour.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.610
There's a little spice
to it, but not a lot.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.443
At the restaurant, what
I use sometimes too,

00:25:36.443 --> 00:25:38.290
it's this pepper. it's
called an espelette.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.990
It's a Spanish pepper.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:44.930
It has a little bit more citrusy
notes and a little more flavor

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.136
to it than just regular
chili flakes, for example.

00:25:47.136 --> 00:25:48.510
It just gives a
nice little kick.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:52.420
If you like food a little
more spicy, nice little spicy

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.950
pepper on top, you can
finish a dish like that too.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.210
That's it, very simple.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.610
Was it difficult, easy?

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:01.568
Fairly easy, no?

00:26:01.568 --> 00:26:04.750
Any questions, anything else?

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.489
No?

00:26:06.489 --> 00:26:08.280
Who comes back now and
does the same again?

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.263
Anybody wants to do
this whole dish again?

00:26:10.263 --> 00:26:10.763
No?

00:26:10.763 --> 00:26:11.750
No?

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.380
All right.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.200
We have someplace ready
for you guys here.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.706
Let's try it, and if any
more questions, let me know.

00:26:17.706 --> 00:26:19.494
AUDIENCE: So roast
the peppercorns

00:26:19.494 --> 00:26:20.660
before I put it in the mill?

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.990
SVEN MEDE: Uh-huh.

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:23.052
Just toast them.

00:26:23.052 --> 00:26:25.260
AUDIENCE: You have to do
this just before you use it?

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.990
Or can you just do it once
and then keep it for months?

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.656
SVEN MEDE: Yeah.

00:26:27.656 --> 00:26:29.820
AUDIENCE: You toast
and then you put away.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.980
SVEN MEDE: Not months, but
I refill it once a week.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.070
Normally we go through it.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.350
But I mean you don't
have to fill your pepper

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:36.620
mill all the way.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.910
You can just toast us a handful,
and put them inside the mill,

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:42.110
and it's enough for like
two weeks, or three weeks.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.010
And then just don't fill
the pepper mill all the way.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:48.120
But you get much more
flavor out of them.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.470
AUDIENCE: Where'd
they get this shrimp?

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.140
SVEN MEDE: This shrimp, its
from Santa Monica Seafood.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.230
There's a storage
here in Santa Monica.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:57.400
This one is a frozen shrimp.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.365
The thing with shrimp, it's
always like getting fresh.

00:27:00.365 --> 00:27:02.110
In supermarkets it
says fresh shrimp,

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:06.400
but if you read the small print,
it says previously frozen.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.460
So it's better to
buy some of this one.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.200
It's a sustainable shrimp, and
it's frozen right on the boat.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.070
It's been frozen the whole time,
it's not like frozen defrosted.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.230
So it's really
consistent that way.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.020
A lot of chefs going
that direction now.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.975
It's very hard to get
really fresh shrimp which

00:27:21.975 --> 00:27:23.554
was fresh from the catch.

00:27:23.554 --> 00:27:25.970
You can get some of them, but
you only get it once a week,

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.160
or every second week.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.920
So it really depends
on the weather.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.964
So a lot of chefs
can't depend on that,

00:27:30.964 --> 00:27:32.380
if you have a
restaurant where you

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.140
need to have consistent product.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.320
That's a really good shrimp.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:36.950
It's soft.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.200
It has different applications.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:38.970
You can fry it.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.716
You can sear it or grill it,
it always stays kinda moist.

00:27:42.716 --> 00:27:45.662
AUDIENCE: What do you think
the biggest challenge is

00:27:45.662 --> 00:27:46.745
when working with seafood?

00:27:51.016 --> 00:27:53.750
SVEN MEDE: I think first you
have to pick good product.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.810
Like we just talked
about the shrimp.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.920
Using the right
product, good product.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.194
Just kind of handing it right.

00:28:00.194 --> 00:28:02.360
Make sure we don't leave
it three days in the fridge

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.210
before you cook it.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.320
You want to make
sure it stays fresh.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.250
And just don't overcook it,
make sure you season it well.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.010
That's pretty much as you get
in our restaurant catch too.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.420
A lot of different
seafoods made raw.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.280
Make sure all the
stuff stays fresh,

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.730
and keep focused on
the cooking techniques.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.300
And make sure it's
not overcooking.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.270
You don't want to server
overpowering things

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.310
with your seafood,
just more like this.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.260
Because it highlights
the seafood.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.200
If you could do a
really heavy risotto

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.535
with a delicate piece of
fish, what's the point?

00:28:32.535 --> 00:28:36.205
You don't taste
the fish anymore.

00:28:36.205 --> 00:28:38.089
AUDIENCE: Do you come
across unusual things

00:28:38.089 --> 00:28:40.444
at the farmer's
market and think,

00:28:40.444 --> 00:28:42.150
how am I going to use this?

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:43.402
SVEN MEDE: Yeah, sometimes.

00:28:43.402 --> 00:28:44.610
There's some tropical fruits.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.420
Something I have
no idea what it is.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.670
I just take one
and just Google it.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.430
And then find out about it,
and then just try it out,

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:54.450
if you like it or don't.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:54.900
Yeah.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.691
That's what's fun about
the farmer's market

00:28:56.691 --> 00:28:59.227
here, because there
are these farmers that

00:28:59.227 --> 00:29:01.435
have stuff you only see for
two weeks out of the year

00:29:01.435 --> 00:29:03.070
or something like that.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:04.896
Which is exciting.

00:29:04.896 --> 00:29:07.086
AUDIENCE: Are there any
significant differences

00:29:07.086 --> 00:29:09.715
between making one
serving and [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.462
SVEN MEDE: It's the same
thing, because the preparation

00:29:16.462 --> 00:29:17.420
are basically the same.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.110
You just made a bigger batch.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.285
Obviously you shave lot
of vegetables separate,

00:29:21.285 --> 00:29:23.610
so you had a bowl
of shaved radishes,

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.450
and a bowl of shaved carrots,
and things like that.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.430
Depends on many
people you just saw,

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.690
mix it all in one big salad.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.490
Make a salad, and instead of
searing four pieces of shrimp,

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.202
you sear 20 pieces of shrimp.

00:29:35.202 --> 00:29:36.868
AUDIENCE: If you're
you're entertaining,

00:29:36.868 --> 00:29:39.434
how far ahead of time do
you preslice the vegetables?

00:29:39.434 --> 00:29:40.850
And then I guess
you assemble it--

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.475
SVEN MEDE: These vegetables, you
can slice them the day before.

00:29:43.475 --> 00:29:45.570
Some vegetables you
can keep it in water,

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:48.570
and some vegetables you just
put a moist paper towel on top,

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:50.440
so make sure they don't dry out.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.190
The cucumber, the
radishes just stay nice

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.950
if you put it in a
little cold water.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:57.076
The radishes normally I like to
just put a paper towel on top

00:29:57.076 --> 00:30:00.264
so you don't lose the
spiciness of them.

00:30:00.264 --> 00:30:01.680
But you can prep
that a day ahead.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.680
You have the vinaigrette
done a day ahead.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.380
The pickles, like I said, you
can make them two weeks ahead.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.260
So you only have to
really mix it together

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.389
when you sear the shrimp.

00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:13.430
AUDIENCE: What was that
last pepper called again?

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.378
The Spanish one?

00:30:14.378 --> 00:30:15.753
SVEN MEDE: It's
called espelette.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.095
if you guys want to try a
little bit here, just to see.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.330
But also if you just
want to try a little bit.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:36.702
You can see it's actually--
it has more notes to it

00:30:36.702 --> 00:30:37.850
than just spice.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:41.150
There's a little citrons, a lot
of different components to it.

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:42.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.080
SVEN MEDE: Yeah.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.320
I'm sure Whole Foods probably
has it or somebody like that.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.710
Any questions, anything else?

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.100
Thank you everybody,
thanks for coming.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.900
Hope to see you soon
at the restaurant.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:55.800
Thank you.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.650
Thanks a lot.
