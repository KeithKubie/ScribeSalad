00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So we are in our application.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We've been rendering that front_HTML form, that's what we've been editing.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's go ahead and add our

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
post function to deal with

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the user types list.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Okay, so we add the post function.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The first thing we need to do is get the parameters out of the request.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Self.request_get ('title')

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and self.request_get ('art'),

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and that will get those values from the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
posts from the form submission.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's go ahead and add some basic error handling.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Okay, so I've added the shell of our kind of error handling.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So if we have both the title and art,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
for now, we're just going to say thanks, you know, that's just a stub.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If we don't have a title in art,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we're going to say--we're going to set this error variable,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and then we're going to render the form with our error message.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So I'm going to pass the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
error variable I made into this function render,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
which is going to pass it to our template,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and so we need to add a place for our error in our template.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's put this right at the bottom of the form.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Okay, so I've made a basic div.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm going to call it class error, because I have

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
intentions of styling this later to make the text red,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and classes are how we attach CSS styles to things.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now what I want to do is I'm going to say

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
{{error}},

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and then I'm going to close this div.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now what this does, this is part of our template language.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This includes the--any variables that the template is rendered with.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It will render them right in place here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So this is a little bit nicer than the string substitution thing we were doing before,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and while I'm in here, I'm going to go ahead and add

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
a submit button because we forgot that before.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So we're going to give this a test, here we are in our form.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If I click the submit button without submitting anything,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
we render our form and see our error message, that's perfect.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If I type in just the title, and I click submit,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
again the form with the error message.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Just the art, perfect,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and now if I type in both, I see thanks.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Okay, so it looks like this thing is working.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
One thing I want you to notice is when I type

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in text in the text field and I hit submit

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and we get our error, we lost our text.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Remember we've dealt with this before,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
so let's go ahead and fix that bug while we're sitting here.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
pull out the rendering of the front page into

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
it's own function because we are going to be calling it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
from both get and post, and I don't want to have

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
some of this logic that we're about to write duplicated.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So let's go ahead and add a new function to our class.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So let's create a new class called render front,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and this is going to render out front page.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's going to take in a few parameters, how about the title,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
which will default to nothing,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the art work, which will also default to nothing,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and the error message, which also will default to nothing,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and all this function is going to do right now is it's

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
going to call self.render front.HTML,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and we're going to pass in title equals title,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
art equals art, and error equals error.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
All we're doing here, and you should remember this

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
structure I hope from the previous lesson,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
we're just taking this variable title and passing it in

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
to the template and so we can use these variables

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
in the template when we're rendering our form.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now what I'm going to is I'm going to replace

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
this call of self.rendered to self.render_front.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
That will draw the blank form, and them going to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
replace this call to self.render to self.render_front,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and this will render our form with the error message,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and one final thing we need to do is actually make use of these variables

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so let's go ahead and do that.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Here we are in our input for the title.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Let's preserve the title

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
so I'm going to do--I'm going to include the title variable passed in from the other function,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and then in our text area, I'm going to include

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
any art that was passed in.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Okay, let's give this all a test.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Reloading this page doesnâ€™t break anything.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
If I type in a title, and we're testing--

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
we're going to test our error submission,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and I click submit, we should see our error message,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and we should see title still in the title box.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Hmm, okay, we see her error message but we don't see title in the title box.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Let's go investigate why.
