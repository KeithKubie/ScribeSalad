how they grow how long they take and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199
how they grow how long they take and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.130
mature and in particular one that
concerns many of us and that is how long

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140
concerns many of us and that is how long
 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.559

we live you know what determines our

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:37.569
we live you know what determines our

longevity and in fact that's what got me

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949
longevity and in fact that's what got me
 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.799

into this work originally was I became

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809
into this work originally was I became
 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.879
into this work originally was I became
very intrigued in my fifties about the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:50.889
very intrigued in my fifties about the
 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:54.149
very intrigued in my fifties about the
phenomenon of aging and of dying that I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159
phenomenon of aging and of dying that I
 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.579
phenomenon of aging and of dying that I
became again Kant became more and more

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589
became again Kant became more and more
 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.299
became again Kant became more and more
conscious that things have been changing

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309
conscious that things have been changing
 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.520
conscious that things have been changing
in my life in terms of my body and my

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530
in my life in terms of my body and my
 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.539
in my life in terms of my body and my
physiology and that you know already I'd

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549
physiology and that you know already I'd
 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.450
physiology and that you know already I'd
had friends died and so I became

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460
had friends died and so I became
 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.609
had friends died and so I became
intrigued as to what is that and I also

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619
intrigued as to what is that and I also
 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.219
intrigued as to what is that and I also
became intrigued very much as a

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229
became intrigued very much as a
 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.920
became intrigued very much as a
physicist not asking what is the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930
physicist not asking what is the
 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.160
physicist not asking what is the
mechanism and the systematics about

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170
mechanism and the systematics about
 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.319
mechanism and the systematics about
aging and mortality but the very

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329
aging and mortality but the very
 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.410
aging and mortality but the very
question what determines a hundred years

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420
question what determines a hundred years
 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.450
question what determines a hundred years
for the lifespan of human being why is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460
for the lifespan of human being why is
 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.209
for the lifespan of human being why is
it a ruffler of order 100 years not a

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219
it a ruffler of order 100 years not a
 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.980
it a ruffler of order 100 years not a
thousand years or million years and and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990
thousand years or million years and and
 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.120
thousand years or million years and and
and also related to that why is it that

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130
and also related to that why is it that
 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.590
and also related to that why is it that
a mouse which you know is made of pretty

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600
a mouse which you know is made of pretty
 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.630
a mouse which you know is made of pretty
much the same stuff as we are we were

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
much the same stuff as we are we were
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.569
much the same stuff as we are we were
almost identical really and some you

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579
almost identical really and some you
 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.249
almost identical really and some you
know kind of coarse-grained level

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259
know kind of coarse-grained level
 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.830
know kind of coarse-grained level
looking at things how come mouse only

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840
looking at things how come mouse only
 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.510
looking at things how come mouse only
institute of three years so what is

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520
institute of three years so what is
 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.919
institute of three years so what is
determining all this and if you have

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929
determining all this and if you have
 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.249
determining all this and if you have
this theory of networks underlying these

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259
this theory of networks underlying these
 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.380
this theory of networks underlying these
scaling laws manifesting themselves of

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390
scaling laws manifesting themselves of
 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.110
scaling laws manifesting themselves of
scaling laws you first ask you know is

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120
scaling laws you first ask you know is
 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.360
scaling laws you first ask you know is
there a scaling law for lifespan you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370
there a scaling law for lifespan you
 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.160
there a scaling law for lifespan you
know so

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170
know so
 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.339
know so
this is work that had already been done

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349
this is work that had already been done
 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.280
this is work that had already been done
by many people was to look at lifespan

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290
by many people was to look at lifespan
 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.839
by many people was to look at lifespan
as a function of size for a bunch of

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849
as a function of size for a bunch of
 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.430
as a function of size for a bunch of
mammals in particular but organisms in

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440
mammals in particular but organisms in
 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.510
mammals in particular but organisms in
general just as we looked at you know

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520
general just as we looked at you know
 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.940
general just as we looked at you know
how metabolic rate scales across these

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950
how metabolic rate scales across these
 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.670
how metabolic rate scales across these
animals and what was discovered what had

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680
animals and what was discovered what had
 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.510
animals and what was discovered what had
been discovered was that lifespan also

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520
been discovered was that lifespan also
 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.550
been discovered was that lifespan also
increases following these quarter power

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560
increases following these quarter power
 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.710
increases following these quarter power
scaling laws that it increased

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720
scaling laws that it increased
 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.860
scaling laws that it increased
systematically the one difference by the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870
systematically the one difference by the
 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.199
systematically the one difference by the
way and maybe I'll say a few words about

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209
way and maybe I'll say a few words about
 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.140
way and maybe I'll say a few words about
this in a moment is that there's much

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150
this in a moment is that there's much
 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.640
this in a moment is that there's much
more scatter among the data for lifespan

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
more scatter among the data for lifespan
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.530
more scatter among the data for lifespan
compared to things like metabolic rates

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540
compared to things like metabolic rates
 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.100
compared to things like metabolic rates
so even though there is a kind of

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110
so even though there is a kind of
 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.270
so even though there is a kind of
predictability that is you give me the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280
predictability that is you give me the
 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.690
predictability that is you give me the
size of a mammal I will tell you on the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
size of a mammal I will tell you on the
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.870
size of a mammal I will tell you on the
average how long that mammal will live

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880
average how long that mammal will live
 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.330
average how long that mammal will live
there's much more variance around that

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340
there's much more variance around that
 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.059
there's much more variance around that
number than there is for saying you suck

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069
number than there is for saying you suck
 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.280
number than there is for saying you suck
tell me the size of a mammal I will tell

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290
tell me the size of a mammal I will tell
 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.640
tell me the size of a mammal I will tell
you what its metabolic rate is what the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650
you what its metabolic rate is what the
 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.560
you what its metabolic rate is what the
length of its aorta is how many children

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570
length of its aorta is how many children
 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.330
length of its aorta is how many children
it should have and so on where there's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340
it should have and so on where there's
 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.440
it should have and so on where there's
much less variance very much tighter

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450
much less variance very much tighter
 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.870
much less variance very much tighter
lifespan has much more variance now what

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880
lifespan has much more variance now what
 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.520
lifespan has much more variance now what
so but where does that number come from

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530
so but where does that number come from
 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.190
so but where does that number come from
so you have this theory that the scaling

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200
so you have this theory that the scaling
 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.870
so you have this theory that the scaling
and metabolic rate and these many other

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880
and metabolic rate and these many other
 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.000
and metabolic rate and these many other
quantities and by the way there's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010
quantities and by the way there's
 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.310
quantities and by the way there's
probably 50 or 75 such measurable

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320
probably 50 or 75 such measurable
 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.990
probably 50 or 75 such measurable
quantities these are determined by the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000
quantities these are determined by the
 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.900
quantities these are determined by the
constraints of flows in networks such as

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910
constraints of flows in networks such as
 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.130
constraints of flows in networks such as
the surgery system so one of the things

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140
the surgery system so one of the things
 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.569
the surgery system so one of the things
you immediately realize about those

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579
you immediately realize about those
 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.640
you immediately realize about those
flows is that they are what we call

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650
flows is that they are what we call
 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.979
flows is that they are what we call
dissipative which simply means they

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989
dissipative which simply means they
 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.970
dissipative which simply means they
involve wear and tear just as you know

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980
involve wear and tear just as you know
 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.500
involve wear and tear just as you know

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.940
roads wear out they have to be repaired
the railways have to be repaired and the

the railways have to be repaired and the
 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.710
the railways have to be repaired and the
subways have to be repaired they wear

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720
subways have to be repaired they wear
 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.150
subways have to be repaired they wear

that causes damage and that damage is

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280
that causes damage and that damage is
 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.920
that causes damage and that damage is
calculable because you have a theory

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930
calculable because you have a theory
 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.660
calculable because you have a theory
there is telling you what the flow rates

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670
there is telling you what the flow rates
 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.820
there is telling you what the flow rates
and so on and all the sizes are and so

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830
and so on and all the sizes are and so
 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.030
and so on and all the sizes are and so
on of this so these are calculable so

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040
on of this so these are calculable so
 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.440
on of this so these are calculable so
you can calculate the rate of which wear

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450
you can calculate the rate of which wear
 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.320
you can calculate the rate of which wear
and tear is occurring and you can also

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330
and tear is occurring and you can also
 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.120
and tear is occurring and you can also
calculate something else that is going

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130
calculate something else that is going
 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.380
calculate something else that is going
on and that is while it's being damaged

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390
on and that is while it's being damaged
 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.660
on and that is while it's being damaged
there's also repair going on and we do

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670
there's also repair going on and we do
 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.840
there's also repair going on and we do
repair ourselves but that repair is also

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850
repair ourselves but that repair is also
 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.850
repair ourselves but that repair is also
determined by metabolism that's where

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860
determined by metabolism that's where
 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.590
determined by metabolism that's where
the energy comes from to do repair so

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600
the energy comes from to do repair so
 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.830
the energy comes from to do repair so
you can determine all these things and

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840
you can determine all these things and
 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.530
you can determine all these things and
then you can postulate that the system

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540
then you can postulate that the system
 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.110
then you can postulate that the system
will become non viable that is it can no

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120
will become non viable that is it can no
 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.530
will become non viable that is it can no
longer be sustained when a given

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540
longer be sustained when a given
 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.610
longer be sustained when a given
fraction of unrepaired damages occur so

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620
fraction of unrepaired damages occur so
 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.730
fraction of unrepaired damages occur so
the system eventually just cannot be

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740
the system eventually just cannot be
 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.760
the system eventually just cannot be
sustained and so that gives you a

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770
sustained and so that gives you a
 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.030
sustained and so that gives you a
calculation of maximum lifespan you know

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040
calculation of maximum lifespan you know
 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.730
calculation of maximum lifespan you know
this is the you know if you were to do

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740
this is the you know if you were to do
 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.620
this is the you know if you were to do
the best you possibly could this is as

the best you possibly could this is as
 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.260
the best you possibly could this is as
long as you could possibly live for a

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270
long as you could possibly live for a
 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.500
long as you could possibly live for a
given size of mammal and if you do that

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510
given size of mammal and if you do that
 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.270
given size of mammal and if you do that
you can understand where roughly

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280
you can understand where roughly
 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.110

being comes from but more importantly or

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410
being comes from but more importantly or
 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.770

equally importantly you can determine

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780
equally importantly you can determine
 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.030
equally importantly you can determine
what the parameters are the knobs that

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040
what the parameters are the knobs that
 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.700
what the parameters are the knobs that
you could conceivably turn to change

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710
you could conceivably turn to change
 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.990
you could conceivably turn to change
that lifespan what could you do

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000
that lifespan what could you do
 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.630
that lifespan what could you do
to make that go from 100 to 200 for

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:40.640
to make that go from 100 to 200 for
 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.530
to make that go from 100 to 200 for
example and there's two pieces of that

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540
example and there's two pieces of that
 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.750
example and there's two pieces of that
one is you could decrease of course the

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760
one is you could decrease of course the
 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.680
one is you could decrease of course the
wear and tear or you can increase the

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690
wear and tear or you can increase the
 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.870
wear and tear or you can increase the
repair so those are the two obvious

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880
repair so those are the two obvious
 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.430
repair so those are the two obvious
things and there are parameters that

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440
things and there are parameters that
 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.870
things and there are parameters that
determine that so if you think about the

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880
determine that so if you think about the
 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.090
determine that so if you think about the
damage that is occurring from metabolism

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.100
damage that is occurring from metabolism
 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.680
damage that is occurring from metabolism
so that means okay one way we could

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690
so that means okay one way we could
 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.670
so that means okay one way we could
there decrease damage is decrease the

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680
there decrease damage is decrease the
 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.060
there decrease damage is decrease the
amount of food we take it okay that

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.070
amount of food we take it okay that
 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.140
amount of food we take it okay that
would be one way and indeed by the way

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150
would be one way and indeed by the way
 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:25.090
would be one way and indeed by the way
the reason a large animal lives longer

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:25.100
the reason a large animal lives longer
 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.610
the reason a large animal lives longer
than a small one is because the

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620
than a small one is because the
 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.280
than a small one is because the
metabolic rate per unit mass or per cell

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.290
metabolic rate per unit mass or per cell
 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.580
metabolic rate per unit mass or per cell
gets systematically smaller the bigger

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:36.590
gets systematically smaller the bigger
 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.680
gets systematically smaller the bigger
the animal corresponding to these

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:38.690
the animal corresponding to these
 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.480
the animal corresponding to these
quarter power scaling oils so less

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:40.490
quarter power scaling oils so less
 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.390
quarter power scaling oils so less
damage is done at the cellular level the

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400
damage is done at the cellular level the
 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.150
damage is done at the cellular level the
bigger the animal in a systematic way so

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160
bigger the animal in a systematic way so
 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.050
bigger the animal in a systematic way so
the question is how do you decrease that

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060
the question is how do you decrease that
 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.560
the question is how do you decrease that
even further

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.570
even further
 

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.260
even further
one is you can eat less and that's

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:53.270
one is you can eat less and that's
 

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.060
one is you can eat less and that's
called caloric restriction so if you you

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:58.070
called caloric restriction so if you you
 

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.480
called caloric restriction so if you you
know put yourself on a starvation diet

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:00.490
know put yourself on a starvation diet
 

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.130
know put yourself on a starvation diet
you know it may not be so pleasant in

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:03.140
you know it may not be so pleasant in
 

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.760
you know it may not be so pleasant in
terms of your lifestyle but you know

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:06.770
terms of your lifestyle but you know
 

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.170
terms of your lifestyle but you know
this would predict that you live longer

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:08.180
this would predict that you live longer
 

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.250
this would predict that you live longer

agree with the the data that's been
taken on mice there have been some

this is still very much work in progress

this is still very much work in progress

this is still very much work in progress
but there's another way you could also

but there's another way you could also
 

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.350
but there's another way you could also
decrease your metabolism and that's a

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360
decrease your metabolism and that's a
 

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.220
decrease your metabolism and that's a
way that is very difficult for us but

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.470
temperature in their environment and
here's why it matters is because

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480
here's why it matters is because
 

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.100
here's why it matters is because
metabolic rate is derived from chemical

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:34.110
metabolic rate is derived from chemical
 

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.180
metabolic rate is derived from chemical
reactions and chemical reactions depend

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:37.190
reactions and chemical reactions depend
 

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.360
reactions and chemical reactions depend
exponentially on external temperature on

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:41.370
exponentially on external temperature on
 

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.699
exponentially on external temperature on
the temperature which they are operating

00:09:43.699 --> 00:09:43.709
the temperature which they are operating
 

00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:46.280
the temperature which they are operating
that means a small change in temperature

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:46.290
that means a small change in temperature
 

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.460
that means a small change in temperature
can have a huge effect so small change

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:49.470
can have a huge effect so small change
 

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.889
can have a huge effect so small change
of temperature small increase in

00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:51.899
of temperature small increase in
 

00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:53.870
of temperature small increase in
temperature increases your metabolic

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880
temperature increases your metabolic
 

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:59.570
temperature increases your metabolic
rate exponentially so that's why you

00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580
rate exponentially so that's why you
 

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.230
rate exponentially so that's why you
know if you look at insects in in the

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240
know if you look at insects in in the
 

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.380
know if you look at insects in in the
cold when they're cold in the morning

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:05.390
cold when they're cold in the morning
 

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.000
cold when they're cold in the morning
they can barely move they have to wait

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.010
they can barely move they have to wait
 

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.949
they can barely move they have to wait
till the Sun comes up to warm themselves

00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959
till the Sun comes up to warm themselves
 

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:12.170
till the Sun comes up to warm themselves
and then they can start flying around

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180
and then they can start flying around
 

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.120
and then they can start flying around
and moving around and so on that's true

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.130
and moving around and so on that's true
 

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.000
and moving around and so on that's true
lizards and so on essentially everything

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.010
lizards and so on essentially everything
 

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.730
lizards and so on essentially everything
that's around us we are immune from that

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:19.740
that's around us we are immune from that
 

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.960
that's around us we are immune from that
and that's been extraordinarily

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:22.970
and that's been extraordinarily
 

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.170
and that's been extraordinarily
tremendous advantage going back to

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180
tremendous advantage going back to
 

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.140
tremendous advantage going back to
lifespan that means that if you could

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:30.150
lifespan that means that if you could
 

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.680
lifespan that means that if you could
lower your body temperature you would

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:33.690
lower your body temperature you would
 

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.620
lower your body temperature you would
decrease your metabolic rate and you

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:36.630
decrease your metabolic rate and you
 

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.360
decrease your metabolic rate and you
would decrease therefore the damage and

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:38.370
would decrease therefore the damage and
 

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.850
would decrease therefore the damage and
you can live longer and that isn't true

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:40.860
you can live longer and that isn't true
 

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:46.760
you can live longer and that isn't true
indeed true of organisms that all other

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:46.770
indeed true of organisms that all other
 

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.980
indeed true of organisms that all other
organisms if you keep them at low

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:48.990
organisms if you keep them at low
 

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.040
organisms if you keep them at low
temperatures they live exponentially

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.050
temperatures they live exponentially
 

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.620
temperatures they live exponentially
longer they live much longer so it's a

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:54.630
longer they live much longer so it's a
 

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.120
longer they live much longer so it's a
fantastic effect it's a huge effect and

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.130
fantastic effect it's a huge effect and
 

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.030
fantastic effect it's a huge effect and
by the way one tangential remark to that

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040
by the way one tangential remark to that
 

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.660
by the way one tangential remark to that
and that is a critical one in our times

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:05.670
and that is a critical one in our times
 

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.160
and that is a critical one in our times
and that is to do with global warming

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:09.170
and that is to do with global warming
 

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.010
and that is to do with global warming
that you know one of the things that you

live the temperature often changes by 40

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040
live the temperature often changes by 40
 

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.150
live the temperature often changes by 40
degrees you know from from night today

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:37.160
degrees you know from from night today
 

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.980
degrees you know from from night today
so you know we have these huge changes

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:39.990
so you know we have these huge changes
 

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.840
so you know we have these huge changes
yet the ambient you know just this

average temperature has such a big
 

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.890
average temperature has such a big
effect the reason is that things like

temperature so one to two degrees change
has an exponential effect and some of

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:10.290
has an exponential effect and some of
 

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.950
has an exponential effect and some of
that is found from our viewpoint highly

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:12.960
that is found from our viewpoint highly

deleterious and some may actually be
advantageous but I think this is an

increases their lifespan and that's been

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:00.930
increases their lifespan and that's been
 

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.130
increases their lifespan and that's been
seen and it is an agreement with the
