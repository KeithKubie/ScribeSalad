is not top of mind so why do you think
 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:48.939
is not top of mind so why do you think
Pittsburgh should be included in the

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949
Pittsburgh should be included in the
 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:58.379
Pittsburgh should be included in the

know if that's promoted or celebrated

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289
know if that's promoted or celebrated
 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.589
know if that's promoted or celebrated
enough but that's you know that's your

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599
enough but that's you know that's your

advanced HVAC manufacturing and that
needs to be discussed more and I don't

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930
needs to be discussed more and I don't
 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.079
needs to be discussed more and I don't
think it needs to be competitive outside

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:35.089
think it needs to be competitive outside
 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:37.480

of the traditional oil and gas industry
that's that's that that's the present so

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279
that's that's that that's the present so
 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:43.360
that's that's that that's the present so
you know Pittsburgh and the region you

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370
you know Pittsburgh and the region you
 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.550
you know Pittsburgh and the region you
know is very strong as it relates to

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560
know is very strong as it relates to
 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.159
know is very strong as it relates to
energy and the investments and you know

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169
energy and the investments and you know
 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.659
energy and the investments and you know
where we're going I mean that industry

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669
where we're going I mean that industry
 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.089
where we're going I mean that industry
the clean energy industry has grown six

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099
the clean energy industry has grown six
 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.010

percent every year over the last five
 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.230
percent every year over the last five
years so it's it's really exciting where

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240
years so it's it's really exciting where
 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.360
years so it's it's really exciting where
we can go I just think it needs to be

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370
we can go I just think it needs to be
 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.790
we can go I just think it needs to be
celebrated and we need more advocates

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800
celebrated and we need more advocates
 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.129
celebrated and we need more advocates
for that right I think we whether you've

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139
for that right I think we whether you've
 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.059
for that right I think we whether you've
been a Pittsburgher or all your life or

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.069
been a Pittsburgher or all your life or
 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.129
been a Pittsburgher or all your life or
coming one and only been here for a few

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139
coming one and only been here for a few
 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.129

we rarely toot our own horn and I

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789
we rarely toot our own horn and I
 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.089
we rarely toot our own horn and I
believe that we have for a long time

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099
believe that we have for a long time
 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:26.469
believe that we have for a long time
been among cities that should have the

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479
been among cities that should have the
 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.139
been among cities that should have the

we have been known for that before at

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160
we have been known for that before at
 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.030
we have been known for that before at
least twice in the last 200 some odd

years and I think we're on the verge of

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580
years and I think we're on the verge of
 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.020
years and I think we're on the verge of
becoming known for that breadth of

becoming known for that breadth of
 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.580
becoming known for that breadth of
energy expertise again if a few more of

us tune our own horn and on that note

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610
us tune our own horn and on that note
 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.010
us tune our own horn and on that note
about the humbleness we really do have a

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020
about the humbleness we really do have a
 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.160
about the humbleness we really do have a
unique concentration of energy research

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.170

we're all aware probably of one little

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530
we're all aware probably of one little
 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.710
we're all aware probably of one little
slice of that pie but the fact that we

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720
slice of that pie but the fact that we
 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.110
slice of that pie but the fact that we
have two federal research labs that

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120
have two federal research labs that
 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.730
have two federal research labs that
bring a billion dollars you know

really energy related research

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380
really energy related research
 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.180
really energy related research
activities programs work force all these

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190
activities programs work force all these
 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.430
activities programs work force all these
things add up together to have a lot

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440
things add up together to have a lot
 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.320
things add up together to have a lot
more concentration here that has a

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330
more concentration here that has a
 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.360
more concentration here that has a
multiplying effect and so for that alone

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370
multiplying effect and so for that alone
 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.430
multiplying effect and so for that alone
if we can just take a look at that and

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440
if we can just take a look at that and
 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.230
if we can just take a look at that and
really think about how we promote that

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240
really think about how we promote that
 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.960
really think about how we promote that
out and how we coordinate it we

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:31.970
out and how we coordinate it we
 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.580
out and how we coordinate it we
absolutely should be part of the energy

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590
absolutely should be part of the energy
 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.370
absolutely should be part of the energy
conversation so Currier we just under

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.380
conversation so Currier we just under
 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.680
conversation so Currier we just under
market it from an energy perspective I

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:38.690
market it from an energy perspective I
 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.050
market it from an energy perspective I
think there's a the other part of the

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.060
think there's a the other part of the
 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.400
think there's a the other part of the
equation also has is that there's also

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.410
equation also has is that there's also
 

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.350
equation also has is that there's also
large users so think about for example

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360
large users so think about for example
 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.200
large users so think about for example
cadastro are conic you know just in

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.210
cadastro are conic you know just in
 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.030
cadastro are conic you know just in
North America we use nine figures in

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.040
North America we use nine figures in
 

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.190
North America we use nine figures in
electricity and so if you think about

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:51.200
electricity and so if you think about
 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.440
electricity and so if you think about
the side of the research and development

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.450
the side of the research and development
 

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.600
the side of the research and development
the other part of that equation is that

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:55.610
the other part of that equation is that
 

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.430
the other part of that equation is that
people to actually use the energy and so

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440
people to actually use the energy and so
 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.230
people to actually use the energy and so
there's a lot of large players in the

00:07:59.230 --> 00:07:59.240
there's a lot of large players in the
 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.380
there's a lot of large players in the
region that are ideal customers for

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:02.390
region that are ideal customers for
 

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.760
region that are ideal customers for
those technologies that were developing

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:03.770
those technologies that were developing
 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.220
those technologies that were developing
and we're actually not a slouch as a

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:06.230
and we're actually not a slouch as a
 

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.410
and we're actually not a slouch as a
state in terms of producing that energy

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:08.420
state in terms of producing that energy
 

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.330
state in terms of producing that energy
and electricity there were second in the

is that for the most part we take a
all-of-the-above approach to energy so

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:19.470
all-of-the-above approach to energy so
 

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.420
all-of-the-above approach to energy so
it's not necessarily as limited in scope

it's not necessarily as limited in scope
or in category and I think that the

or in category and I think that the
 

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.720
or in category and I think that the
innovation piece of that we're perhaps a

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:33.730
innovation piece of that we're perhaps a
 

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.810

that that we've got a Pittsburgh has a

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000
that that we've got a Pittsburgh has a
 

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.139
that that we've got a Pittsburgh has a
fairly high energy IQ but we still are

00:23:51.139 --> 00:23:51.149
fairly high energy IQ but we still are
 

00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:53.149
fairly high energy IQ but we still are
not necessarily where we should be I

00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159
not necessarily where we should be I

not necessarily where we should be I
think actually the first question that

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340
think actually the first question that
 

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.090
think actually the first question that
we got from from the audience

00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100
we got from from the audience
 

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.430
we got from from the audience
illustrate that and we do kind of

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440
illustrate that and we do kind of
 

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.820
illustrate that and we do kind of
question the impacts that energy have on

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:04.830
question the impacts that energy have on
 

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:09.499
question the impacts that energy have on
our communities and that is a sign of a

00:24:09.499 --> 00:24:09.509
our communities and that is a sign of a
 

00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:13.159
our communities and that is a sign of a
good high energy IQ but we've got to

00:24:13.159 --> 00:24:13.169
good high energy IQ but we've got to
 

00:24:13.169 --> 00:24:19.360
good high energy IQ but we've got to
start earlier we are an innovative

opportunities in this space to younger
 

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:27.980
opportunities in this space to younger
and younger audiences so we actually

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:27.990
and younger audiences so we actually
 

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.490
and younger audiences so we actually
have programs for high school-age kids

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:30.500
have programs for high school-age kids
 

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.320
have programs for high school-age kids
and I think we've got an opportunity

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:33.330
and I think we've got an opportunity
 

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.669
and I think we've got an opportunity
through that to boost the IQ and

00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679
through that to boost the IQ and
 

00:24:37.679 --> 00:24:41.600
through that to boost the IQ and
hopefully encourage more and more this

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:41.610
hopefully encourage more and more this
 

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:46.879
hopefully encourage more and more this
is also inclusion an innovation week

00:24:46.879 --> 00:24:46.889
is also inclusion an innovation week
 

00:24:46.889 --> 00:24:49.590
is also inclusion an innovation week
here in Pittsburgh and

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600
here in Pittsburgh and
 

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.299
here in Pittsburgh and
and if we continue to have other

and if we continue to have other
 

00:24:51.309 --> 00:24:53.039
and if we continue to have other
opportunities like that I think we'll

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:53.049
opportunities like that I think we'll
 

00:24:53.049 --> 00:24:58.159
opportunities like that I think we'll
start to see positive change to

00:24:58.159 --> 00:24:58.169
start to see positive change to

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.900
 
well I think it depends because from

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:07.910
well I think it depends because from

from a petrochemical standpoint it's

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:10.700
from a petrochemical standpoint it's
 

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.599
from a petrochemical standpoint it's
really looking at it going from those

00:45:13.599 --> 00:45:13.609
really looking at it going from those
 

00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:16.690
really looking at it going from those
fossil fuels to bio-based and that's a

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:16.700
fossil fuels to bio-based and that's a
 

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.849
fossil fuels to bio-based and that's a
huge challenge if that's if it you know

00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:18.859
huge challenge if that's if it you know
 

00:45:18.859 --> 00:45:22.180
huge challenge if that's if it you know
making that a reality would would would

making that a reality would would would
be a huge step forward in this this

renewables basically you're not going to

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240
renewables basically you're not going to
 

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.960
renewables basically you're not going to
use fossil fuels anymore I mean I think

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:37.970
use fossil fuels anymore I mean I think
 

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:41.620
use fossil fuels anymore I mean I think
we we know that at least from a

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:41.630
we we know that at least from a
 

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.380
we we know that at least from a
transportation fuel standpoint we are

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:44.390
transportation fuel standpoint we are
 

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:47.170
transportation fuel standpoint we are
not going to be as dependent on fossil

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:47.180
not going to be as dependent on fossil
 

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.470
not going to be as dependent on fossil
fuels as we have been now there's going

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480
fuels as we have been now there's going
 

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.010
fuels as we have been now there's going
to be a shift in in other areas as well

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:54.020
to be a shift in in other areas as well
 

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.599
to be a shift in in other areas as well
but I think it's I think it's clear that

00:45:57.599 --> 00:45:57.609
but I think it's I think it's clear that
 

00:45:57.609 --> 00:46:02.160
but I think it's I think it's clear that
evey will be the predominant

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:02.170
evey will be the predominant
 

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.200
evey will be the predominant

transportation technology within our
 

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:09.910
transportation technology within our
lifetimes for most applications and so I

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920
lifetimes for most applications and so I
 

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.440
lifetimes for most applications and so I
think that is driving unintended you

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:14.450
think that is driving unintended you
 

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:17.170
think that is driving unintended you
know driving us away from the dependency

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:17.180
know driving us away from the dependency
 

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.420
know driving us away from the dependency
at least in some areas of the energy

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:19.430

holding us back in a lot of ways for all
 

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:33.210
holding us back in a lot of ways for all
kinds of applications if you can right

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:33.220
kinds of applications if you can right
 

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:36.150
