BRADY HARAN: A little while
back, we spoke to Alex from

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.010
Bite Sci-zed about her
number/color synesthesia,

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.550
basically how she sees
numbers as colors.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.180
The video created a lot of
interest and a lot of comments

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.610
from you guys as viewers.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.315
One of the things you did was
you all sent in what color you

00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:18.490
think numbers are.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.830
We've taken that information and
done a bit of work with it

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.710
to create a few graphs
and other things.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.130
But I'll have more about that
at the end of the video.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.920
The other thing was
you had loads of

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.910
questions for Alex herself.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.540
Now, a little while
ago, I caught up

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.900
with her at an event.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.630
And I had all of
your questions.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.250
So I sat her down and
asked some of them.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.800
Now, one of the things a lot
of you said was you thought

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.050
she was making it up.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.510
So I asked Alex that.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.770
ALEX DAINIS: No.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.156
Why?

00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:48.000
BRADY HARAN: How do we know
you're not making it up?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.190
ALEX DAINIS: I guess
it's hard.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.150
I mean, as a scientist, I
encourage skepticism.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.270
And I want to be able to show
you in my head and show you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.080
data points.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.230
But I can't.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470
You're just going to have
to take my word for it.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.320
BRADY HARAN: Have you
been to a doctor?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.023
Has it been diagnosed?

00:01:00.023 --> 00:01:01.240
ALEX DAINIS: I haven't,
actually.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.120
That's a good point.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.620
I know that I make these
associations between numbers

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.220
and colors very strongly.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.600
And synesthesia is the best
word that I have found to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.760
describe that.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.680
BRADY HARAN: Do the numbers give
you the colors or do the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.620
colors give you the numbers?

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.050
ALEX DAINIS: The numbers
give me the colors.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.890
So if I see a color,
it doesn't back

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.890
translate into a number.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.070
But if I see a number, then
I can see the color.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.470
It helps me to memorize
things.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.300
It's really good for memorizing
phone numbers.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.000
BRADY HARAN: So another thing
that came up in the previous

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.320
video was that sometimes the
color of a number was created

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.940
by its factors.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.280
So some of you asked, could Alex
take a number, look at

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.010
its color, and then reverse
engineer the factors just by

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.820
using the color?

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.010
So I asked.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.270
ALEX DAINIS: No,
unfortunately.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.020
The factors influence the
color of the number if I

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.720
already know them.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.420
So for something like 14, 7 is
such a huge part of 14 to me

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.690
that that yellow is really
prominent in there.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.730
But if I see a giant number, I
unfortunately cannot see a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.810
color with it and
pull it back.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.020
BRADY HARAN: How do you
see prime numbers?

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.490
ALEX DAINIS: So it depends
really on what the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.260
prime number is.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.870
So something like 13, it's
really a 1 and a 3.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.420
It has a lot more to do
with their digits.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.500
Only the things, really, from
zero to nine have their own

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.520
specific colors if they're
prime numbers.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.450
One on its own is just white,
if it's just a single digit.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.126
But when it can be combined with
other things-- so in 10

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:24.370
and 100 and 1,000--

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.800
then it takes on that sort
of black flicker, almost.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.650
BRADY HARAN: If you see numbers
written down on a

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.650
piece of paper in black print,
which is the most common

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.460
thing, do they become
colorful for you?

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.820
ALEX DAINIS: No.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.030
So when they're still on that
page, they just exist in

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.940
whatever color they are,
whatever color that print is.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.450
But when I think about that
number, when it moves into my

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.950
head, then it takes
on the color.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.450
But the ink on the page
stays the same color.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.580
I, unfortunately, do not
think about numbers

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.160
and bases very often.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.330
And so I think because my brain
really works on a base

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.870
10 system, it's just the digits
zero to nine that have

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.460
their own colors.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.350
If I were to think in base six,
I would still just see

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.740
the digit one, five, and
not translate it.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.420
BRADY HARAN: Is mathematics a
sort of colorful, psychedelic

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.310
experience?

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.750
ALEX DAINIS: I don't think
I would consider to be

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.265
psychedelic.

00:03:14.265 --> 00:03:15.380
It is colorful.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.280
I mean, I am seeing these
colors in my mind.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.180
But because that's just the way
I've always experienced

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.230
the numbers, it's
not weird to me.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.480
It's not distracting to me.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.090
Just, they are numbers.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.100
BRADY HARAN: A lot of other
people who responded to this

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.240
video said that for
them, numbers have

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.680
personalities or genders.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.440
Do you associate personalities
or genders with any numbers?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.100
ALEX DAINIS: I do.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.810
So that's actually how I sort of
realized that I was seeing

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.620
these colors is that I had had
that gut reaction in class

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.190
that numbers have personalities,
not colors.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.150
And so I think the example I
gave before is that nine is a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.410
very dark red.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.550
And so it seems like sort of
an angry number to me.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.370
Whereas the two, four,
and eights are

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.150
sort of cooler numbers.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.320
And they seem a little
bit more chill.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.340
And they seem a little
bit more friendly.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.560
But that's really sort of
the realm of things are.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.240
Seven is not intrinsically
jealous because it's yellow,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.720
but sort of basic personalities
of nice or mean.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.680
BRADY HARAN: Gender?

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.200
ALEX DAINIS: No gender, no.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.700
BRADY HARAN: Can you give me
a color for these numbers,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.050
because these are just numbers
people asked for?

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.940
ALEX DAINIS: Sure.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.269
BRADY HARAN: 79.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.130
ALEX DAINIS: 79 is yellow,
and that nine,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.210
maroon at the same time.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.830
BRADY HARAN: So it's not like
you've mixed paints.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.000
It's two things?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.770
ALEX DAINIS: It is for
a much of the larger

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.600
digit numbers, yeah.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.920
So things that are, I would say,
probably below 40, is a

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.900
lot more mixing, I think,
because I do know those

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.780
factors and I've thought about
those numbers a lot more.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.170
But the higher ones is really
just the digits.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.620
It's as if you had two colored
sheets of cling film, one that

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.680
was yellow and one that was that
maroon, and sort of laid

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.020
them over each other.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.650
So it's not really like
you're mixing paints.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.310
I understand that they're
two separate things.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.470
But they're existing
in the same space.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.240
BRADY HARAN: 854,685,254.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.750
ALEX DAINIS: As you're saying
them, I can see the blue,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.040
black, blue.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.490
But it does not exist as one
whole number in my head.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.455
BRADY HARAN: And now I'll
show it to you.

00:05:09.455 --> 00:05:09.730
There you go.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.660
I'm showing it to you now.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.320
ALEX DAINIS: Oh yeah, still.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.060
So the digits all have
their own thing.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.930
But I think because I'm not
processing the quantity that

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.800
is that large number, just
the digits have their own

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.420
identities.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.350
BRADY HARAN: Fractions?

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.370
ALEX DAINIS: Fractions
just look like a

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.950
digit over a digit.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.950
Negative numbers, the negative
doesn't have any

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.840
impact on the colors.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.790
BRADY HARAN: Irrational
numbers.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.490
So how do you deal with pi?

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.300
ALEX DAINIS: With pi.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.440
So pi as a symbol doesn't
have anything.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.110
It's just a symbol.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.060
But if I think of 3.14, then
it does take on the red,

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.940
white, and blue.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.570
I can do pi to 22 digits.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.900
BRADY HARAN: Go.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.070
ALEX DAINIS: I hope
I still can.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.340
3.141592653589793238462.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.610
BRADY HARAN: Was anything
colorful happening

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.520
in your head then?

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.860
ALEX DAINIS: I mean,
as I say the digit,

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.240
I can see the color.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.220
But it's not cramming itself
all into one big color.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.970
BRADY HARAN: i, and
complex numbers,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.140
and imaginary numbers.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.900
ALEX DAINIS: Again, they don't
have digits to me.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.160
And so if I think of i as a
number, I guess, then it does.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.820
But i itself is just i.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.220
BRADY HARAN: The final thing is
a lot of people responded

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.010
to what you had to say in the
last video, and understood

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.480
what you were saying, but
completely disagreed about the

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.350
colors, said Alex is wrong.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.250
That's not that color.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.040
It's this color.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.640
And they even gave whole
sets of what they

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.950
think the colors are.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.830
What do you say to that?

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.180
ALEX DAINIS: I completely
understand that, because I've

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.690
seen people give me those
sets as well.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.020
And I have that same reaction
of no, that's wrong.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.110
It's such an intrinsic link to
me that I don't get that

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.710
people can--

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.230
I mean, I understand logically
that people

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.790
can see other colors.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.840
But no, three is red.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.810
I don't know what--

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.390
green is three, people
are saying.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.440
Three is red.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.650
BRADY HARAN: What
is five again?

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.900
ALEX DAINIS: Five is black.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.040
BRADY HARAN: So look at those
five chairs there.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.840
ALEX DAINIS: Yes.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.050
BRADY HARAN: What do you
feel about that?

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.350
ALEX DAINIS: It's funny
because if I don't--

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.860
I mean, it's fine.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.490
This does not impede my
life, but it is wrong.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.190
I think it's more with things
under 10, because you can see

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.660
the quantity and understand
at the same time.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.980
If I had to count every chair
in here, I wouldn't be very

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.120
upset that all the white chairs,
if there were 20 white

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.940
chairs and they were all white,
that would be fine.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.970
But now that you've brought
it up, it's not right.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.290
BRADY HARAN: So thanks so much
to Alex for talking to us more

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.300
about this subject which so many
of you find interesting.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.070
Now also, all of those comments
from last time and

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.410
all of the colors that you guys
attributed to numbers

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.640
have been analyzed by Dave
Wiley, our resident graph

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.990
number expert who
helps us out.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.890
And he's come up with this.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.270
This is a graph showing
the most popular

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.190
colors for each number.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.500
This is going to
be on my blog.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.960
So have a look at the link under
the video description if

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.700
you want to pore over
this in more detail.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.170
But also, Dave has put
this together.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.880
Based on the HSV Color Space,
this is the average color of

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.210
each number.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.200
So here we go.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.902
Zero, one, two, three,
four, five--

00:08:09.902 --> 00:08:12.310
a lot of greens you can see--

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.810
six, seven, eight.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.420
Again, more green.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:25.580
But then we go 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.840
And this is where Dave stopped
for now, because the data

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.810
started getting a bit
thin after that.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.409
19 of you said that numbers to
you seem to have genders.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:38.770
13 people said the days of
the week have colors.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.000
And the area of most agreement
amongst all of you as viewers

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.480
was that the number
27 is green.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.910
So there you have it.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.570
