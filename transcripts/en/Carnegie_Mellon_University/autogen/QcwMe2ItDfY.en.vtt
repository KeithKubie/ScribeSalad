better so it's kind of boring technical

00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039
better so it's kind of boring technical
 

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.529
better so it's kind of boring technical
work but it's not work that we're doing

laws one of the best ways to do it is to
 

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.799
laws one of the best ways to do it is to
hand out free permits to that industry

there's sort of a model for how to deal
 

01:07:18.339 --> 01:07:20.130
there's sort of a model for how to deal
with that and when the the problems

01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:20.140
with that and when the the problems
 

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.289
with that and when the the problems
emerged there were so significant

01:07:22.289 --> 01:07:22.299
emerged there were so significant

people began to see that there are a lot
 

01:07:39.609 --> 01:07:42.900
people began to see that there are a lot
of dollars that needed to be channeled

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:42.910
of dollars that needed to be channeled
 

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:44.730

was a pretty self-contained well
 

01:07:48.279 --> 01:07:51.049
was a pretty self-contained well

understood system and that sort of
 

01:07:51.059 --> 01:07:53.250
understood system and that sort of
called a lot of attention to the

from the financial sector so I think

01:11:29.729 --> 01:11:29.739
from the financial sector so I think
 

01:11:29.739 --> 01:11:33.630
from the financial sector so I think
there was real time feedback on what

actually doesn't it limit it to
financial institutions and so it's a big

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:07.170
financial institutions and so it's a big
 

01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:09.020

or business model could if it were to
fail cause systemic risk so for example

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:31.890
fail cause systemic risk so for example

the auto companies have financing arms
but the fact that they were rescued

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:35.489
but the fact that they were rescued

but the fact that they were rescued
wasn't necessarily because of the

wasn't necessarily because of the
 

01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.169
wasn't necessarily because of the
financing arms I think from it was

01:19:39.169 --> 01:19:39.179
financing arms I think from it was
 

01:19:39.179 --> 01:19:41.180
financing arms I think from it was
because they were so interconnected to

that the the administration the Obama

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:47.250

administration was worried about the
 

01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:50.899
administration was worried about the
systemic risk implications of that so

01:19:50.899 --> 01:19:50.909
systemic risk implications of that so
 

01:19:50.909 --> 01:19:52.160
systemic risk implications of that so
the question resting is a big question
