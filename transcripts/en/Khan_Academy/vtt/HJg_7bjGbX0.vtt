00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.590
- What I hope to do in this video is

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.220
to just read a SAT Reading
Comprehension passage with you.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.520
And when you're actually doing the SAT

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.990
you're obviously going to read it silently

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.530
and you're going to
try to read it quickly,

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.550
but with good comprehension,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.950
but it might be useful to just

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.320
read it out loud together,
and I might just kinda

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.250
think about how I think
about the different things

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.370
before I try to actually
answer the question.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.953
So let's start.

00:00:24.953 --> 00:00:27.723
"This passage is adapted from Ed Yong.

00:00:27.723 --> 00:00:31.523
"Turtles Use the Earth's
Magnetic Field as Global GPS.

00:00:31.523 --> 00:00:35.213
"Written in 2011 by Kalmbach
Publishing Company."

00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:36.443
Alright, this is exciting.

00:00:36.443 --> 00:00:39.493
How do turtles use Earth's
magnetic field as global GPS?

00:00:39.493 --> 00:00:41.293
And that's actually
something I like to do.

00:00:41.293 --> 00:00:43.843
I like to convince myself that I'm very

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.543
excited about what I'm about to learn.

00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:47.852
And in this case, I actually am.

00:00:47.852 --> 00:00:52.222
"In 1996, a loggerhead
turtle called Adelita

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:56.762
swam across 9,000 miles
from Mexico to Japan,"

00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:58.052
That's impressive--

00:00:58.052 --> 00:01:00.989
"crossing the entire Pacific on her way.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.303
"Wallace J. Nichols
tracked this epic journey

00:01:04.303 --> 00:01:05.803
"with a satellite tag."

00:01:05.803 --> 00:01:08.003
So they're using satellite
tags to track it.

00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:11.923
"But Adelita herself had no
such technology at her disposal.

00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:15.053
"How did she steer a
route across two oceans

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:16.753
"to find her destination?"

00:01:16.753 --> 00:01:19.253
So this seems like a pretty big question.

00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:23.253
How does a turtle, with
no GPS, without any

00:01:23.253 --> 00:01:27.323
navigation devices, go across 9,000 miles

00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:30.573
from Mexico to Japan?

00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:32.373
This is interesting.

00:01:32.373 --> 00:01:34.543
"Nathan Putman has the answer."

00:01:34.543 --> 00:01:36.043
Well that's good, someone does.

00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:38.793
"By testing hatchling
turtles in a special tank,

00:01:38.793 --> 00:01:42.453
"he has found they they can use
the Earth's magnetic field",

00:01:42.453 --> 00:01:44.428
so they're using the
Earth's magnetic field,

00:01:44.428 --> 00:01:47.988
"as their own Global Positioning System."

00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:50.668
Wow, so they're using the
Earth's magnetic field

00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:52.378
as their own GPS.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:55.078
"By sensing the field, they can work out

00:01:55.078 --> 00:01:56.918
"both their latitude and longitude

00:01:56.918 --> 00:01:58.578
"and head in the right direction."

00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:00.118
That's amazing.

00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:03.191
"Putman works in the lab of Ken Lohmann,

00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:05.251
"who has been studying
the magnetic abilities

00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:08.091
"of loggerheads for over 20 years.

00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:10.891
"In his lab at the
University of North Carolina,

00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:15.021
"Lohmann places hatchlings
in a large water tank

00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:19.021
"surrounded by a large grid
of electromagnetic coils.

00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:22.821
"In 1991, he found that
babies started swimming

00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:26.051
"in the opposite direction
if he used the coils

00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:28.321
"to reverse the direction
of the magnetic field

00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:29.481
"around them."

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:30.735
This is impressive.

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:32.424
So this is how they were able to tell

00:02:32.424 --> 00:02:35.074
that the turtles use a magnetic field

00:02:35.074 --> 00:02:37.224
as a way to tell what direction to go to,

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:39.284
because if they reverse
the magnetic field,

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.514
then the turtles swam in
the opposite direction.

00:02:42.514 --> 00:02:45.374
"They could use the field

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:48.084
"as a compass to get their bearing."

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:49.684
Let's keep going.

00:02:49.684 --> 00:02:51.284
I actually am interested in this.

00:02:51.284 --> 00:02:54.084
"Later, Lohmann showed
that they can also use

00:02:54.084 --> 00:02:56.174
"the magnetic field to
work out their position."

00:02:56.174 --> 00:02:57.694
So not just the direction,

00:02:57.694 --> 00:02:59.394
but they can also work out their position.

00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:02.012
"For them, this is literally
a matter of life and death."

00:03:02.012 --> 00:03:04.152
Yeah, if they go to the
wrong place they might die.

00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:06.352
"Hatchlings born off the coast of Florida

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:09.822
"spend their early lives
in the North Atlantic gyre,

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:12.392
"a warm current that circles

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.792
"between North America and Africa.

00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:17.872
"If they're swept towards the cold waters

00:03:17.872 --> 00:03:22.812
"outside the gyre, they die.

00:03:22.812 --> 00:03:24.992
"Their magnetic sense keeps them safe."

00:03:24.992 --> 00:03:26.552
So if they go a little bit off track

00:03:26.552 --> 00:03:28.242
into the cold waters, they'll die!

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:29.925
Outside of the gyre.

00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:32.122
"Using this coil-surrounded tank,

00:03:32.122 --> 00:03:34.692
"Lohmann could mimic the magnetic field

00:03:34.692 --> 00:03:37.122
"at different parts of
the Earth's surface.

00:03:37.122 --> 00:03:41.452
"If he simulated the field at
the northern edge of the gyre,

00:03:41.452 --> 00:03:43.192
"the hatchlings swam southwards."

00:03:43.192 --> 00:03:45.022
Yeah, they don't want to
go into that cold water.

00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:47.822
"If he simulated the field
at the gyre's southern edge,

00:03:47.822 --> 00:03:50.652
"the turtles swam west-northwest.

00:03:50.652 --> 00:03:53.382
"These experiments showed
that the turtles can use

00:03:53.382 --> 00:03:56.212
"their magnetic sense to
work out their latitude--

00:03:56.212 --> 00:03:59.452
"their position on a north-south axis."

00:03:59.452 --> 00:04:02.842
So they could work out their latitude,

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:05.292
their position on a north-south axis.

00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:07.322
If they had the magnetic
field at the south end

00:04:07.322 --> 00:04:09.192
of the gyre they go north, northwest.

00:04:09.192 --> 00:04:12.385
If they're at the north end
of the grye, they go south.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.685
They don't want to get out of that thing,

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:16.205
'cause then I guess the
water's gonna be too cold.

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.555
So that's how they can figure out

00:04:18.555 --> 00:04:21.125
how north or south they are.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:23.825
Now, where is my mouse? There it is.

00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:26.445
"Now, Putman has shown that
they can also determine

00:04:26.445 --> 00:04:29.345
"their longitude--their
position on a east-west axis."

00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:30.725
Well, how do they do that?

00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:33.425
"He tweaked the magnetic
tanks to simulate the fields

00:04:33.425 --> 00:04:35.625
"in two positions with the same latitude",

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:38.625
so, the same latitude, latitude
is how far north-south,

00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:41.025
"at opposite ends of the Atlantic.

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:43.785
"If the field simulated the west Atlantic

00:04:43.785 --> 00:04:47.385
"near Puerto Rico, the
turtles swam northeast.

00:04:47.385 --> 00:04:50.055
"If the field matched
that on the east Atlantic

00:04:50.055 --> 00:04:54.085
"near the Cape Verde Islands,
the turtles swam southwest.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:57.265
"In the wild, both
headlings would keep them

00:04:57.265 --> 00:05:01.325
"within the safe, warm embrace
of the North Atlantic gyre."

00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:03.685
This is amazing.

00:05:03.685 --> 00:05:06.925
"Before now, we knew that
several animal migrants",

00:05:06.925 --> 00:05:08.785
so animals that travel,

00:05:08.785 --> 00:05:12.992
"from loggerheads to reed
warblers to sparrows,

00:05:12.992 --> 00:05:15.492
"had some way of working out longitude,"

00:05:15.492 --> 00:05:18.352
longitude is how east-west you are,

00:05:18.352 --> 00:05:20.122
"but no one knew how.

00:05:20.122 --> 00:05:22.492
"By keeping the turtles
in the same conditions,

00:05:22.492 --> 00:05:25.322
"with only the magnetic
fields around them changing,

00:05:25.322 --> 00:05:28.292
"Putman clearly showed
that they can use fields

00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:29.552
"to find their way."

00:05:29.552 --> 00:05:31.692
So this is the crux of what they're doing.

00:05:31.692 --> 00:05:33.752
By keeping the turtles
in the same conditions

00:05:33.752 --> 00:05:36.552
with only the magnetic
fields around them changing,

00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:40.152
Putman clearly showed that
they can use these fields

00:05:40.152 --> 00:05:41.952
to find their way.

00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:45.992
"In the wild, they might
well also use other landmarks

00:05:45.992 --> 00:05:50.552
"like the position of
the sea, sun and stars.

00:05:50.552 --> 00:05:53.787
"Putman thinks that the
turtles work out their position

00:05:53.787 --> 00:05:56.357
"using two features of
the Earth's magnetic field

00:05:56.357 --> 00:05:59.487
"that change over its surface.

00:05:59.487 --> 00:06:02.687
"They can sense the field's inclination,

00:06:02.687 --> 00:06:06.157
"or the angle at which it
dips towards the surface.

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:09.477
"At the poles, this angle
is roughly 90 degrees",

00:06:09.477 --> 00:06:12.087
and if you imagine this is
the Earth right over here

00:06:12.087 --> 00:06:14.887
and if the magnetic
field is doing like this,

00:06:14.887 --> 00:06:16.487
this is what they're saying, the magnetic

00:06:16.487 --> 00:06:19.117
field is doing like
this, the magnetic field

00:06:19.117 --> 00:06:22.287
is looking like this,
I'll just keep drawing it.

00:06:22.287 --> 00:06:23.587
So they're saying that at the poles

00:06:23.587 --> 00:06:25.077
this angle is roughly 90 degrees.

00:06:25.077 --> 00:06:28.957
So at the poles, this angle is 90 degrees.

00:06:28.957 --> 00:06:31.247
"and at the equator, it's
roughly zero degrees."

00:06:31.247 --> 00:06:32.717
You see it right over here.

00:06:32.717 --> 00:06:36.417
The field lines are parallel
to the surface of the equator,

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:37.897
while they're going into the surface

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:41.131
of the earth at the poles.

00:06:41.131 --> 00:06:43.602
"They can also sense its intensity,

00:06:43.602 --> 00:06:45.288
"which is strongest near the poles

00:06:45.288 --> 00:06:47.718
"and weakest near the equator.

00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:49.498
"Different parts of the world have

00:06:49.498 --> 00:06:52.858
"unique combinations of
these two variables."

00:06:52.858 --> 00:06:54.808
Different parts of the world have unique

00:06:54.808 --> 00:06:57.018
combinations of these two variables.

00:06:57.018 --> 00:06:59.888
"Neither corresponds
directly to either latitude

00:06:59.888 --> 00:07:02.588
"or longitude, but together, they provide

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:06.689
"a "magnetic signature" that
tells the turtle where it is."

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:08.513
This is fascinating.

00:07:08.513 --> 00:07:11.343
So we have some diagrams
right over here that says,

00:07:11.343 --> 00:07:13.923
"Orientation", and it's
hard to read, it says,

00:07:13.923 --> 00:07:16.323
"Orientation of Hatchling Loggerheads

00:07:16.323 --> 00:07:19.023
"Tested in Magnetic Fields."

00:07:19.023 --> 00:07:22.784
So, West Atlantic, this
is their orientation.

00:07:22.784 --> 00:07:25.924
The East Atlantic, this
is their orientation.

00:07:25.924 --> 00:07:27.584
And then they have a description.

00:07:27.584 --> 00:07:29.654
"Orientation of hatchling
loggerheads tested

00:07:29.654 --> 00:07:31.554
"in a magnetic field
that simulates a position

00:07:31.554 --> 00:07:34.654
"at the west side of the
Atlantic near Puerto Rico",

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:37.214
on the left, so that's
that one, "and a position

00:07:37.214 --> 00:07:38.734
"at the east side of the Atlantic

00:07:38.734 --> 00:07:40.354
" near Cape Verde Islands", on the right.

00:07:40.354 --> 00:07:42.884
"The arrow in each circle
indicates the mean direction

00:07:42.884 --> 00:07:44.744
"that the group of hatchlings swam."

00:07:44.744 --> 00:07:46.621
So, they do the mean, 'cause
they might not all swim

00:07:46.621 --> 00:07:48.851
in the exact direction,
so the mean gives us

00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:50.621
kinda the central tendency.

00:07:50.621 --> 00:07:53.291
"Data are plotted relative
to geographic north",

00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:55.191
which would be zero degrees, and you see

00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:58.121
where on their east side, near Africa,

00:07:58.121 --> 00:08:00.881
they're going to swim away from that

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:04.491
to the south, southwest.

00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:07.291
And then when they're on the west side,

00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:12.446
they swim away from that, so they swim

00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:16.086
to the north, northeast, just like that.

00:08:16.086 --> 00:08:18.386
So this is fascinating, so
that's us reading the passage,

00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:21.826
and obviously I read it
much slower and outloud,

00:08:21.826 --> 00:08:23.056
which you wouldn't typically do

00:08:23.056 --> 00:08:24.756
when you're taking a standardized test,

00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:26.986
but I think we understood
what's going on there.

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:29.426
They were able to establish that the...

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:30.986
You know, it's a big question.

00:08:30.986 --> 00:08:32.826
How are these turtles able to go

00:08:32.826 --> 00:08:36.576
9,000 miles without a GPS device?

00:08:36.576 --> 00:08:39.186
And they were able to test
and they had the hypothesis,

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:41.366
"Hey maybe it's the Earth's
magnetic field, that they can

00:08:41.366 --> 00:08:43.496
"sense how it's different in
different parts of the Earth",

00:08:43.496 --> 00:08:46.086
and then they were able
to test that by simulating

00:08:46.086 --> 00:08:48.616
Earth's magnetic field at
different points of the Earth

00:08:48.616 --> 00:08:50.996
and seeing what the turtles
did, and the turtles did

00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:52.956
what you would expect them to do.

00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:55.286
They behaved in ways that would keep them

00:08:55.286 --> 00:08:57.586
in the right direction as they migrate.

00:08:57.586 --> 00:08:59.953
So, now that we, I think,
have really digested

00:08:59.953 --> 00:09:02.393
the article, let's see if
we can answer the questions.

00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:04.223
And actually, I haven't
seen these questions yet.

00:09:04.223 --> 00:09:06.913
I like to do this as fresh
as possible so it simulates

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:08.783
what you might go through when you're

00:09:08.783 --> 00:09:11.079
going to take a test.
