Hi I'm Linda Avey with 23andMe and I have
some information to share here on You Tube

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.340
which is great. We're here at the world economic
forum and one of the challenges we face within

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.120
23andMe and also a global problem is the patenting
of the human genome. And we're really interested

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.840
in hearing back from the community on thought
that how we can get around this problem or

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.710
creating almost like a quilt or a patch work
of ownership of the genome by companies and

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.870
institutions, universities. We just think
this untenable for the future. Especially

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.730
when we get to a point where we can sequence
the entire genome. How on earth is someone

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.750
going to get access to all of their information
if it's all a patch work. And people think

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.739
they claim an ownership of the genome. So
we would like to pose this question. And our

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.280
position is that we don't think that this
is right that some company or institution

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.890
can own a piece of your genome. It's ok for
them to make a drug against a piece of the

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.860
genome, or to innovate the genome, but simply
being able to read it and tell you what that

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.900
information means we think is just not the
wave of the future and is really gonna block

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.630
innovation in companies. So that's my challenge
to all of you. Thanks.
