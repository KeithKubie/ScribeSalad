&gt;&gt; Hi from Sudhir Narang, I'm from BT, BT
India.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.129
Yes, I do agree that India is going to be
a superpower.

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.880
We are on the road to being a superpower.
But let me explain how people talk about the

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.590
financial power, economic
power, yes, as people are saying that India

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.640
is going to be the third
largest economy in a few years.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.050
Are we going to be a military power?
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.000
But I would really appreciate if India keeps
its spiritual power, so

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.210
that our quotient of happiness goes higher,
much higher so then I would

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.140
say it's a really wholesome superpower in
the world.
