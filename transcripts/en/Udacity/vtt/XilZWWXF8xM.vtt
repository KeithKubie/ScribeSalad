00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.050
As an overview, three aspects of, of OCL to be aware of,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.100
is first of all it's declarative. It's not a procedural language, it's not

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.840
a programming language, it's a way of specifying properties. In programming

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.130
language terms it's a pure expression language, that is, it describes values,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.720
it doesn't, describe activities. It doesn't have any assignment statements,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.570
instead it, it specifies assertions or constraints or properties,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.170
usually with equal signs. The language is strongly typed and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.040
it comes with some primitive types that you might expect in terms of reals and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.010
integers and so on. And the neat thing about OCL is it only

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.280
has one key concept involved with it. And that's the concept of a constraint.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.610
A constraint is some formal assertion of system properties.
