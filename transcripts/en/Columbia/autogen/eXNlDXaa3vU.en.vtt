what worked and they knew that if there
was a challenge they would just pull out

00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039
was a challenge they would just pull out
 

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:37.039
was a challenge they would just pull out
their bag of tricks and that would take

00:23:37.039 --> 00:23:37.049
their bag of tricks and that would take
 

00:23:37.049 --> 00:23:39.350
their bag of tricks and that would take
care of it all of a sudden they

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360
care of it all of a sudden they
 

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.060
care of it all of a sudden they
discovered that the tricks didn't work

forced to shift and I think they lost
 

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.250
forced to shift and I think they lost
their nerve in many cases and then in

to work to Israel's benefit I think it's
 

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.630
to work to Israel's benefit I think it's
likely to work to Israel's benefit in

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640
likely to work to Israel's benefit in
 

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.730
likely to work to Israel's benefit in
the long run I think there's going to be

00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:12.740
the long run I think there's going to be
 

00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.670
the long run I think there's going to be
a lot of objection in the short run

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680
a lot of objection in the short run
 

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.370
a lot of objection in the short run
because a lot of the old assumptions and

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:18.380
because a lot of the old assumptions and
 

00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:19.740
because a lot of the old assumptions and
this is what I was talking about

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:19.750
this is what I was talking about
 

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:23.080
this is what I was talking about
basically that we have a bunch of

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:23.090
basically that we have a bunch of
 

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:25.180
basically that we have a bunch of
assumptions that we have just become

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:25.190
assumptions that we have just become
 

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:29.080
assumptions that we have just become
very accustomed to of what kinds of

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:29.090
very accustomed to of what kinds of
 

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:31.540
very accustomed to of what kinds of
things we can expect from Egypt or other

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:31.550
things we can expect from Egypt or other
 

00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:33.880
things we can expect from Egypt or other
countries and probably those are going

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:33.890
countries and probably those are going
 

00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:37.360
countries and probably those are going
to change and you know if we say oh they

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:37.370
to change and you know if we say oh they
 

00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:39.510
to change and you know if we say oh they
can't possibly we can't let them change

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520
can't possibly we can't let them change
 

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.820
can't possibly we can't let them change
I think talk about being on the wrong

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:42.830
I think talk about being on the wrong
 

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:44.770
I think talk about being on the wrong
side of history you really are going to

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:44.780
side of history you really are going to
 

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.780
side of history you really are going to
be on the wrong side of history and I

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:46.790
be on the wrong side of history and I
 

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:48.580
be on the wrong side of history and I
think that fits the United States as

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:48.590
think that fits the United States as
 

00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:50.410
think that fits the United States as
well as it does Israel that basically

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:50.420
well as it does Israel that basically
 

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:53.320
well as it does Israel that basically
and this goes to the second point about

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:53.330
and this goes to the second point about
 

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:56.560
and this goes to the second point about
the internationalism and the like the

00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:56.570
the internationalism and the like the
 

00:58:56.570 --> 00:59:00.250
the internationalism and the like the
United States you know we can talk all

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:00.260
United States you know we can talk all
 

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:03.280
United States you know we can talk all
we like about United States has to throw

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:03.290
we like about United States has to throw
 

00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:05.140
we like about United States has to throw
its weight around and show them who's

00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:05.150
its weight around and show them who's
 

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:07.690

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:10.720
intervene well tell the american people
then

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:10.730
then
 

00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:14.440
then
you know it's maybe it suits the

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:14.450
you know it's maybe it suits the
 

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:17.349
you know it's maybe it suits the
strategic interests of a number of

00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359
strategic interests of a number of
 

00:59:17.359 --> 00:59:18.940
strategic interests of a number of
parties both in this country and in

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:18.950
parties both in this country and in
 

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:21.010
parties both in this country and in
other countries in the Middle East but

00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:21.020
other countries in the Middle East but
 

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:23.230
other countries in the Middle East but
that doesn't make it doesn't make it

00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:23.240
that doesn't make it doesn't make it
 

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.599

01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:20.800
willner I want to ask a question about
the u.s. arms export economy and its

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:20.810
the u.s. arms export economy and its
 

01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:23.890
the u.s. arms export economy and its
role in the Middle East policy based on

01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:23.900
role in the Middle East policy based on
 

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.960
role in the Middle East policy based on
the recent level of uncertainty there

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:25.970
the recent level of uncertainty there
 

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:28.480
the recent level of uncertainty there
what do you see the future us arms

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:28.490
what do you see the future us arms
 

01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:31.270
what do you see the future us arms
export economy to look like and in

01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280
export economy to look like and in
 

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:33.790
export economy to look like and in
particular do you see any arms sales

01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800
particular do you see any arms sales
 

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.200
particular do you see any arms sales
increasing to any countries in the

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:35.210
increasing to any countries in the
 

01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:36.610
increasing to any countries in the
region based on the levels of

01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:36.620
region based on the levels of
 

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:45.220
region based on the levels of
uncertainty well armed sales I don't

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:45.230
uncertainty well armed sales I don't
 

01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:46.870
uncertainty well armed sales I don't
worry about that very much I think we

01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880
worry about that very much I think we
 

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.640
worry about that very much I think we
can probably survive with the with our

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:50.650
can probably survive with the with our
 

01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:54.430
can probably survive with the with our
economy it just relied on on the sale of

01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:54.440
economy it just relied on on the sale of
 

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.860
economy it just relied on on the sale of
arms and believe me uncertainty does

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:56.870
arms and believe me uncertainty does
 

01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:59.500
arms and believe me uncertainty does
breed arm sales and so I will not be at

01:19:59.500 --> 01:19:59.510
breed arm sales and so I will not be at
 

01:19:59.510 --> 01:20:01.900
breed arm sales and so I will not be at
all surprised if we have big arms sales

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:01.910
all surprised if we have big arms sales
 

01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:04.570

that's a long time it's almost 20 years
 

01:21:59.469 --> 01:22:03.209
that's a long time it's almost 20 years
and you know in that process they now

01:22:03.209 --> 01:22:03.219
and you know in that process they now
 

01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:05.370
and you know in that process they now
have more low-enriched uranium than they

01:22:05.370 --> 01:22:05.380
have more low-enriched uranium than they
 

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:08.370
have more low-enriched uranium than they
had before very true they've probably

had before very true they've probably
done some tabletop experiments we caught

them at it basically figuring out how

01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:13.540
them at it basically figuring out how

them at it basically figuring out how
you would build a weapon that would fit

01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120
you would build a weapon that would fit
 

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.900
you would build a weapon that would fit
on a missile but they don't have a

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:18.910
on a missile but they don't have a
 

01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:23.130
on a missile but they don't have a
weapon and you know the idea that

01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:23.140
weapon and you know the idea that
 

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:26.640
weapon and you know the idea that
somehow the only way one can deal with

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:26.650
somehow the only way one can deal with
 

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:30.060
somehow the only way one can deal with
this desperate urgent threat is for the

01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:30.070
this desperate urgent threat is for the
 

01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:31.680
this desperate urgent threat is for the
United States not anybody else for the

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:31.690
United States not anybody else for the
 

01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:34.290
United States not anybody else for the
United States to go in bomb them and

01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:34.300
United States to go in bomb them and
 

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:35.820
United States to go in bomb them and
then of course put some boots on the

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:35.830
then of course put some boots on the
 

01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:37.200
then of course put some boots on the
ground because you've got to determine

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:37.210
ground because you've got to determine
 

01:22:37.210 --> 01:22:38.910
ground because you've got to determine
what actually happened with the bombing

01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920
what actually happened with the bombing
 

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.920
what actually happened with the bombing
raids and that's the only way you can

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:40.930
raids and that's the only way you can
 

01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:45.920
raids and that's the only way you can
determine it that is you know there are

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:45.930
determine it that is you know there are
 

01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:48.570

put boots on the ground there I would

01:23:18.150 --> 01:23:18.160
put boots on the ground there I would

but I've been struck by the fact that
 

01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:33.570
