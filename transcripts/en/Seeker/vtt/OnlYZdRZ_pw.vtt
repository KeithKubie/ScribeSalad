00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.990
Have you ever looked out the window when you
should have been working or studying?

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.170
What if your whole job was to just to study
the sky?

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.970
Hey plasmids, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.990
Radar as we know it was invented in the mid-1930s
to detect airplanes before they could drop

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.990
their bombs.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.570
Basically, radar shoots radio waves out into
the world, and if those waves bounce off something

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.189
and make it back to the dish, engineers, or
now computers, could triangulate the position

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.480
and size of the thing.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.320
By the late 1970s, radar had gotten so sensitive,
that with the right equipment, scientists

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.579
could try to bounce waves off all sorts of
things, even, the smallest of things... electrons

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.270
and ions in the upper atmosphere.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.640
This is great, because scientists wanted to
know what exactly those beautiful auroras

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.910
we could see at night were made of, and what
the sun was doing to our planet all day, every

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.910
day.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.030
So the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific
Association built the EISCAT Svalbard Radar

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.930
in 1996.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.580
Its goal is to study the interaction between
the sun and Earth’s atmosphere… using

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.580
radar.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.580
built EISCAT, the European Incoherent Scatter
Facility on Svalbard in 1981.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.580
Its goal is to study the interaction between
the sun and Earth's atmosphere... using radar.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.030
This is a very potent radar system.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.390
We have at this site two big parabolic dishes.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.470
One dish is 42m in diameter, and the second
dish is 32m in diameter.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.040
The power amplifier that are using has a peak
power of 1MW.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.460
We need this because what we are studying
is these free electrons at 100km.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.460
First, they are far away, and these are just
free electrons, so they are very, very tiny.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.460
I'm the manager of the EISCAT Radar, and also
working at HQ.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.460
My title is Radar Systems Supervisor.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.270
These massive dishes sit on a Svalbardian
mountaintop just to measure the plasma surging

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.540
through our upper atmosphere.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.040
Plasma is ionized (or electrically-charged)
gas...

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.080
The ions we mostly looking at is oxygen, nitrogen
and so on.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.939
Looking at how many free electrons do we have,
and also what kind of ion species we actually

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.560
have up in the ionosphere.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.760
The plasma originates from the sun's corona,
and is pulled down onto the poles of Earth

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.870
by our planetary magnetic field.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.370
At that point, the ions and electrons interact
with the molecules in our atmosphere, exciting

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.930
them and causing the beautiful lights that
we call aurora.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.430
The principle is almost like an old television
screen, where you have the phosphorus and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.099
you have the electron beam that's impinging
on the phosphorus, and it starts to glow.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.650
In fact, they use old television components
to suck in all this information.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.650
As it stands now, their components are literally
"off the shelf" 100 kilowatt analog television

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.900
transmitters linked together!

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.850
They attach those to a giant, movable antenna
dish and Voila, aurora-sensitive radar.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.510
Mostly of the power that we are transmitting
is just going out to outer space, but we have

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.909
still some power that are reflected back,
and this power we can then detect with our

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:02.909
big antennas.

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.490
We are able to detect very, very small objects.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.770
In principle, just one thing in short, we
are able to detect a small ... like a ball

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.850
bearing at 200km, so the system is very, very
sensitive.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.379
Because they can detect these ball bearings,
the EISCAT dishes can be used to detect space

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.860
junk, too, but mostly they're looking for
space weather.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:37.349
Mostly what we can learn is how the solar
winds are interacting with our near atmosphere.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:46.799
A solar cycle is 11 years between the peaks
on the sun spots, so we have good data that

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.950
the scientists can use for this kind of ... looking
into models, and so on.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.239
Basically, EISCAT is just like your local
weather radar, but for SPACE.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.970
Scientists all over the world pay to access
this radar data and draw conclusions for their

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.050
own studies.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.750
See, EISCAT isn't studying the data themselves
per se, they're just taking measurements.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.410
We are pushing the technology and of course
this is one good thing, but again this is

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.470
basic research.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.180
When you do the research today, it's very
difficult to actually say what will be the

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.180
outcome.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.990
This is basic science on a planetary scale.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.180
Basic research, is also called pure research,
because they're not working under a hypothesis,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.790
just gathering information.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.120
EISCAT's datasets are massive, and comprehensive.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.180
Just like with early weather monitoring, more
data, more better.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.120
So EISCAT ran for a whole year, to provide
a baseline for what the sun does to our planet's

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.250
atmosphere EVERY.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.120
DAY. Because before that, we had no idea!

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.389
Today they are all talking about going to
Mars.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.639
When you're going to Mars, then you need to
know the space weather.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.160
Where this plasma [blobs 00:09:06] will heat
then and so on.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.090
If not then you're in big danger I should
say.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.550
This is one of this thing that actually you
can use this facility for, or the data set

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.810
we have accumulated for 35 years to be able
to make this space weather predictions.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.720
Basic research like this helps us understand
the world around us, or in this case, the

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.720
world above us.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.720
That's how it is.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.160
You have always to show that you have our
customers, the scientists around.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.620
If you can show that and show that they are
doing sensible research that has some value,

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.430
then hopefully you also will get them on this
to actually do it.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.810
We've been talking about our trip to Svalbard
for months, but if you missed it -- we went

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.870
to visit the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, also
called the Doomsday Vault.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.080
It was so.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.080
Amazing.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:06:06.580
Check out how we're going to secure the future
of our food, here.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.380
Have you ever seen an aurora?

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.380
I saw one once.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.410
