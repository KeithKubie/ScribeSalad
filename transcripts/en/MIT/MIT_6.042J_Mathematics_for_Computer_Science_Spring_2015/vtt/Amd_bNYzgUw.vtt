00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.040
PROFESSOR: So let's look now
at the mathematical foundations

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.100
of probability theory, the basic
definitions of which we've just

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.270
been doing examples
up until now.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.380
So a key concept is
a probability space.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.309
And that's what we're going
to talk about in this segment.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.370
So the abstract setting
of a probability space

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.460
is the first thing you start
off with is the set of outcomes,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.190
which is what we saw we
were doing with the tree

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.630
models in the previous videos.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.820
And the condition
that we require

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.720
is that there should be a
countable set of outcomes.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.670
So there's something
called the sample space.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.416
And the sample space
is designed to model

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:41.040
all the possible
things that can happen

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.510
as the result of your
random experiment, all

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.440
the possible outcomes.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.740
And we require that there
be a countable number.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.850
Now, the examples
that we've seen so far

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.320
have only had a finite number.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.680
But we will shortly
see a bunch of examples

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.120
where we really need
an infinite number.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.570
But only a countable
infinite number.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.490
That's part of the definition
of a probability space-- the set

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.140
of outcomes.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.780
The next thing is a
probability function

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.330
whose task is to assign
probabilities to the outcomes.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.770
So the condition is that the
probability function, Pr,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.860
gives every element
in S, every outcome,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.280
is going to be assigned a
probability of between 0

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.000
and 1 inclusive.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.890
So every outcome gets a
probability between 0 and 1.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.520
But the constraint on
the probability function

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.330
is that if I sum up
the probabilities

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.520
of all the outcomes-- omega is
an outcome in the sample space

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.450
S-- and I take the sum of all
of those probabilities of omega,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.510
they have to sum to 1.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.520
That's the crucial condition
that defines a probability

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.340
function on a sample space.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.560
And the two together are what
are called a probability space.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.800
A sample space with a
probability function

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.920
is a probability space.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.180
So the purpose of the tree
model that we were using

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.150
is really to figure out which
probability space to use.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.690
And the mathematics
doesn't really

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.030
start until you have
the probability space.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.930
Up until that, it's the
modeling part that's

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.260
very important mathematically.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.970
But you can't say that the
model is right or wrong.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.050
It's a model, and its
rightness or wrongness

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.490
is a matter of
judgment and comparison

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.360
to how it stacks up
against reality and things

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.519
that we care about.

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.060
When we're using
the tree model, it's

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.960
the leaves of the tree that
correspond to the outcomes.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.740
And the outcome
probabilities, which

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.910
are crucial for having
a probability space,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.010
we got by reasoning
about the probabilities

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.820
to assign to each possible
branch of the tree

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.560
as you worked your
way from root to leaf.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.030
So the other key concept
that we saw already

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.110
is the idea of an event.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.610
An event, formally, is nothing
but a subset of the sample

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.010
space.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.240
An event is some
set of outcomes.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.690
Presumably, the
event is an event

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.440
that you're interested
in, like winning.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.680
And the definition of the
probability of an event

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.630
is simply the sum of
the probabilities of all

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.260
the outcomes in the event.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.090
And we were using this
already for both Monty Hall

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.100
and for the poker hands.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.900
But this is the official
general definition--

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.010
that once we have a
probability function that

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.170
assigns probabilities
to outcomes,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.990
then we can use that to define
the probability of an event.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.950
This is the definition of
the probability of an event--

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.480
simply the sum of the
outcome probabilities.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.520
And as an immediate corollary
of this definition, what we get

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.230
is something that's central
to probability theory.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.080
It's called the sum rule.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.430
And it says that if you
have a bunch of events that

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.360
are pairwise
disjoint-- so there's

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.730
no outcome in common to A0 or
A1 or A1 or A2 and so on-- then

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.460
the probability of the union
of the A's, the probability

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.820
that one of these events occurs,
one or more of these events

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.850
occurs, is simply the sum of
the individual probabilities.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.260
And that is a rule that
we'll be using all the time.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.230
It's very convenient
for computing things.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.784
If you just break them
up into separate cases,

00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:22.920
then you can handle the
separate cases-- each A0,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.210
A1-- separately, and then
add up the probabilities.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.990
And in some approaches to
probability, more general ones,

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.130
this is actually
taken as an axiom.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.110
It's the axiom that defines
a probability space,

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.180
but where you start with an
assignment of probabilities

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.701
to events.

00:04:38.701 --> 00:04:41.200
But in the discrete case, we
don't have to worry about that.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.620
It's a corollary of the way
we define the probability.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.450
And that, of course, is a
crucial rule-- sometimes called

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.460
the countable sum rule.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.800
But we're just going to
call it the sum rule.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.420
Expressed in concise
notation, it's

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.050
the probability of
the union of the Ai's,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.340
as i ranges over the
non-negative integers,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.300
is simply the sum of the
individual probabilities

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.990
of those events.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.320
Now, why it's called discrete
probability that we're studying

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.100
is because we have a
countable sample space.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.840
And as we saw, that
discrete combinatorics

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.420
is the combinatorics
of countable

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.710
and even finite sets, really.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.820
The crucial reason
why we're sticking

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.820
to discrete probability
is that allows us to work

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.300
with sums instead of integrals.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.060
If you start allowing
continuous intervals of time

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.580
and the probability,
say, of throwing a dart

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.219
and it landing at a given
interval on the line

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:41.760
and a whole bunch
of other situations

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.530
where it's natural to want to
use continuous probabilities,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.090
you're forced into
defining a probability

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.880
in terms of integrals,
because every outcome

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.230
has probability 0.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.700
And the theoretical basis
of it is considerably more

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.130
complicated.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.270
And we don't need
it for, in fact,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.880
virtually any purposes that
come up in computer science.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.940
And so we will,
happily, not have

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.830
to study integral calculus
or measure theory, really,

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.880
and just get by with sums.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.810
So let's quickly point out some
rules that are now corollaries.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.420
They're really derived
rules of probability theory

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.060
that follow as a consequence
of the countable sum rule.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.230
And the first one is
the difference rule.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.460
The probability of
A minus B is simply

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.830
equal to the probability
of A minus the probability

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.030
of A intersection B.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.720
Now, notice how much this
looks like the difference

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.520
rule for cardinalities--
that the cardinality

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.500
of the finite set A minus B
is simply the cardinality of A

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.120
minus the cardinality
of A intersection B.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.900
And indeed, the
proof of this is just

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.150
like the proof of cardinality.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.290
It follows directly
from the sum rule

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.530
for probabilities, which
corresponds, of course,

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.840
to the sum rule
for cardinalities.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.980
Namely, by the sum
rule for probabilities,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.420
what we know is
that A is equal set,

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.350
theoretically, to A
intersection B plus A minus b.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.670
That is, A breaks
up into the points

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.040
that it has in common
with B and the points

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.410
that it doesn't have in
common with B. Since those

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.910
are disjoint, you can add them.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.640
So the probability of A is
equal to the probability

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.250
of A intersection B plus
probability of A minus B.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.440
And so I just transpose the A
minus B to the left hand side.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.080
And I get the
difference rule, which

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.550
is a rule that's
worth remembering.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.940
Similarly, we have
inclusion-exclusion.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.410
If A and B are not disjoint,
then the probability

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.320
of A union B is equal
to the probability

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.730
of A plus the probability
of B minus the probability

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.600
of the intersection.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.320
And the proof is,
in fact, exactly

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.140
like the corresponding rule for
cardinalities of finite sets.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.590
And of course, it
generalizes to more sets.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.090
This is an example of the
inclusion-exclusion for three

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.760
sets in terms of probability.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.420
Another useful, it
turns out, consequence

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.810
is that the probability
that A or B happens

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.560
is guaranteed to be less than
or equal to the probability

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.770
that A happens plus the
probability of B happens.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.950
And this follows as
a trivial consequence

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.070
of the inclusion-exclusion
rule for two sets,

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.510
because the probability
of A union B

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.650
is equal to this plus this
minus some probability,

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.757
namely, the probability
of the intersection.

00:08:16.757 --> 00:08:18.590
So you're taking away
something non-negative

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.470
from these two in
order to equal that.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:25.390
In particular, then, this must
be less than or equal to that.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.375
And the closely related
phenomenon is [? basi-- ?]

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:39.960
[AUDIO OUT] The probability
that A or B happens

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.600
is greater than or equal to
the probability that A happens.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.520
And finally, we
can generalize that

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.050
to a countable
collection of sets.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.500
If I have a bunch of events--
A0, A1, and so on-- then

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.070
the probability that at
least one of them occurs,

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.860
the probability of the
union of the Ai's, is

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.800
less than or equal to the
sum of their probabilities.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.920
This is, again, another kind
of obvious rule, not hard

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.560
to prove.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.800
We're not going to
bother proving it,

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.010
because it really is obvious.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.330
But we will get some
mileage out of it later on.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.520
So to summarize, the key concept
here is a probability space.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.900
It consists of a countable set
of outcomes, the sample space,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:27.180
and a probability function that
assigns values between 0 and 1

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.900
to every outcome such that the
sum of the probabilities is 1.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.570
And when we're using our
tree model and so on,

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.450
our objective is to construct
one of these things.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.600
Usually, the hard
part will be verifying

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.570
that, in fact, the
way we've assigned

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.390
probabilities has the
property that the sum of them

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.500
is equal to 1.
