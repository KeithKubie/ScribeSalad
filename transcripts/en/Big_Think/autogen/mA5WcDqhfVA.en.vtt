more money than it is to explain to
people who don't have a scientific

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
people who don't have a scientific
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.480
people who don't have a scientific
background why you need more money but I

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
background why you need more money but I
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.249
background why you need more money but I
think the latter is at least as

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
think the latter is at least as
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.859
think the latter is at least as
important and you know it's these days

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
important and you know it's these days
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.600
important and you know it's these days
of my opinion part of being a a

of my opinion part of being a a
 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.380
of my opinion part of being a a
