00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.500
Before our lunar landing, no one really knew what the physical and psychological effects

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.080
of space would be or whether the astronauts
would even survive.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.200
To prepare for the unknown, astronauts spent
years training in some pretty unusual places.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.800
They were pushed to dangerous and, in some
cases, deadly extremes.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.980
But without this training, the crew of Apollo
11 may never have made it to the moon.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.960
In the late 1950s, this is where NASA found
its first astronauts.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.930
The idea was that since military test pilots
were accustomed to flying advanced and powerful

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.750
aircraft, their skills would provide the most
useful transition.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.460
But there was a big difference between flying in
a sophisticated jet and being launched out

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.120
of Earth’s atmosphere in a tiny metal container.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.730
Out of over 100 candidates plucked from the
military, only seven were selected for NASA’s

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.180
first manned space program, Project Mercury,
and they had less than two years to go from

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.520
military pilots to astronauts.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.520
The first several months of training were spent in the
classroom, learning about the science of spaceflight.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.830
There were five other areas of focus during
Mercury training: vehicle operations, physical

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.689
fitness, ground activities, maintenance of
flight skills and space flight conditions.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.160
[Announcer] Alan Shepard as he takes the G load
of an emergency abort and landing.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.400
The astronauts referred to this particular
part of their training as “sadistic” and “diabolical”.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.360
With the ability to accelerate from 0 to 280
kilometers per hour in under seven seconds,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.409
the Johnsville human centrifuge, tested the
ability to remain conscious under the extreme

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.150
G forces that spaceflight would bring.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.670
In May of 1961, the training paid off with
the first manned mission of the Mercury Program,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.970
and a series of successful flights followed.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.300
NASA quickly announced Project Gemini, its next space program

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.700
which would prepare astronauts for Apollo.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.100
The Gemini and Apollo missions would require
astronauts to function in zero gravity for

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.540
up to two weeks and endure the harsh effects
of space.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.329
NASA’s biomedical staff conducted a series
of experiments that tested exposure to acceleration,

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.169
radiation, 100-percent oxygen and microgravity.

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:24.300
The astronauts were put on unusual sleep and
diet regimens to test their bodies’ limitations.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.370
They had to learn how to do seemingly basic,
but wildly inconvenient, tasks like going

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.560
to the bathroom in a specially designed space
bag.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.700
To prepare for spacewalks, the astronauts
took part in weightlessness training inside

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.459
an aircraft dubbed “the vomit comet”.

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.431
NASA later added an elaborate underwater training,
called neutral buoyancy, that required

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.960
astronauts to master diving techniques as
they worked on a spacecraft mockup.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.340
Outside of NASA’s facilities, the astronauts
were sent to the Panamanian jungle and the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.870
Nevada desert for survival training.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.260
In the event their spacecraft landed in a
remote part of the globe, the astronauts

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.460
needed to be prepared to live off the land.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.700
Training for Apollo required astronauts to
broaden their scientific knowledge in order

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.569
to conduct experiments on the lunar surface.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.189
So astronauts went to Iceland, Hawaii and
the Grand Canyon to learn how to recognize

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.920
and catalog geologic features on the moon.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.640
To simulate these experiments, NASA also recreated
a lunar landscape using dynamite and fertilizer

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.110
bombs in a Northern Arizona field.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.110
One of the most difficult scenarios to prepare
for was the lunar landing itself.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.620
These pure fly-by-wire aircraft were created
to emulate the flight specs of the Lunar Module.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.879
But these vehicles were risky and dangerous.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.300
During a training flight, Neil Armstrong lost
control, ejecting right before the vehicle crashed.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.980
An unrattled Armstrong was spotted at his
desk working about an hour after the crash

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.390
as if it had never happened.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.280
According to other astronauts, that’s just
how he was.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.120
And that calm, collected nature is what made
Neil Armstrong the perfect astronaut to pilot

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.549
the Lunar Module during the first trip to
the moon’s surface.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.029
Apollo 11 launched on July 16, 1969.

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:18.129
The crew: Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and
Michael Collins, followed the paths of the

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.070
astronauts before them.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.680
When it came time to descend to the moon’s
surface, Armstrong and Aldrin entered the

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.500
Lunar Module, nicknamed Eagle, and separated from the Command-Service Module where Collins remained.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.620
The dangers the astronauts faced were no longer
theoretical and all their training was about

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.840
to be put into action.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.220
The Lunar Module’s computer froze, reading
an error code neither astronaut understood.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.340
Despite the software failure, they continued
the descent.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.699
Aldrin called out navigation while Armstrong
took over manual controls.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.440
But by this point, they had overshot the predicted
landing zone and were now flying over crater fields.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.700
To make things more terrifying, the fuel supply
was rapidly diminishing and they had just

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.720
one minute until a mandatory abort.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.699
Using the skills he developed flying
the training vehicles and channeling his nerves

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.120
of steel, Armstrong leveled off and touched
down on a smooth patch of the moon.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.560
[Armstrong] Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.919
They actually did it.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.180
NASA made it to the moon with less than six
months until the end of the decade.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.220
While Apollo 11 got a lot of the glory for
this goal, there were dozens of astronauts

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.830
who helped get to this point.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.650
Hundreds more people back on Earth, women
included, were making the impossible happen.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.430
Throughout the Apollo missions, engineers
and ground control were faced with split-second

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.729
decisions that could either end in triumph
or tragedy.

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:01.889
And a lightning strike during Apollo 12 would
take that pressure to extreme heights.

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.160
