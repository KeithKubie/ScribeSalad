You just learned about some design principles that can enhance your

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.050
communication of your data story.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.950
Including pre-attentive processing, negative space, and color.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.290
&gt;&gt; But there's actually more that we can do.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.320
It's important to think about data visualizations as a cohesive whole, and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.650
how they might be perceived by the viewer.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.660
In this next section, we'll go over how to remove elements from

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.460
visualizations and also a few metrics to measure their effectiveness.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.610
Let's go over a few examples now.
