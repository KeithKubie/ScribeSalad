00:00:01.137 --> 00:00:02.883
- I'm Caroline Kennedy.

00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:06.876
May 29th would be my
father's 100th birthday.

00:00:06.876 --> 00:00:09.953
I've thought about him and
missed him every day of my life.

00:00:09.953 --> 00:00:12.319
But growing up without him was made easier

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.371
thanks to all the people who
kept him in their hearts,

00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:18.007
who told me that he inspired them to work

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:21.284
and fight and believe in a better world.

00:00:21.284 --> 00:00:23.208
To give something back to this country

00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:26.230
that has given so much to so many.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.934
I remember hiding underneath
my father's Oval Office desk

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:32.936
when I was little, and sitting
on his lap on the Honey Fitz.

00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:35.342
He would point out the white
shark and the purple shark

00:00:35.342 --> 00:00:37.556
who always followed the
boat, although I could never

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:39.112
quite see them.

00:00:39.112 --> 00:00:41.323
He said they especially
liked to eat socks,

00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:43.976
and would have his friends
throw their socks overboard,

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.878
which I loved.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:47.937
President Kennedy inspireda generation

00:00:47.937 --> 00:00:49.975
that transformed America.

00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:53.009
They marched for justice, they
served in the Peace Corps,

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.539
in the inner cities, in outer space.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.719
His brothers carried on that
work, fighting against poverty,

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.611
violence and war,
championing human rights,

00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.536
health care and immigration.

00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:08.453
As my father said in
his inaugural address,

00:01:08.453 --> 00:01:11.913
this work will not be
finished in our lifetime.

00:01:11.913 --> 00:01:15.232
It's up to us to continue
to pass these values on

00:01:15.232 --> 00:01:18.442
to our children and grandchildren.

00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:20.120
- One of the defining relationships

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.593
in my life is with
someone I have never met.

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:25.418
My grandfather, President John F. Kennedy.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.482
It's a little odd to be connected
to someone you don't know,

00:01:28.482 --> 00:01:30.453
especially when everyone
else has access to much

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:33.121
of the same information
about him that you do.

00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.114
Throughout my life, I
have been able to connect

00:01:35.114 --> 00:01:37.245
with my grandfather through
the study of history,

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:39.754
which I know he loved,
both studying his life

00:01:39.754 --> 00:01:42.922
and studying the eras and
patterns that fascinated him.

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:44.743
To me, that is where he lives,

00:01:44.743 --> 00:01:46.051
as a historical figure rooted in the past

00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:49.284
but also as a person connected to so much

00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:51.135
of what came after him,
through his writings

00:01:51.135 --> 00:01:53.894
and from the stories my
relatives have told me.

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:55.996
But while my grandfather
had reverence for the past

00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:58.175
and the lessons it could
impart, he also knew

00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:00.934
that America was a country
where change was possible,

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:02.733
where we aren't bound solely by tradition

00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:06.132
if we understand the past
with which we are breaking.

00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:08.649
- I'm inspired by my
grandfather's sense of equality,

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.163
his courage in naming the
injustices in American society,

00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:14.135
and his call for action.

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.630
His words and his ideals
mean so much to me

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.032
and to the world we live in today.

00:02:19.032 --> 00:02:21.264
But we are still faced
with tremendous inequality

00:02:21.264 --> 00:02:23.020
and injustice, from voting rights to our

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.880
criminal justice system
and mass incarceration.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.597
My grandfather would be
proud of how far we've come

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:30.229
as a nation since 1963, but
he'd have been the first

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:32.708
to tell us that we have a long way to go.

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:34.922
I hope everyone,
regardless of age or party,

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:36.477
will remember what President Kennedy

00:02:36.477 --> 00:02:38.404
told America decades ago.

00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:39.752
This nation was founded by men

00:02:39.752 --> 00:02:41.982
of many nations and backgrounds.

00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:43.617
It was founded on the
principle that all men

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:46.275
are created equal, and that
the rights of every man

00:02:46.275 --> 00:02:49.345
are diminished when the rights
of one man are threatened.

00:02:49.345 --> 00:02:51.026
- President Kennedy was
elected on a platform

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:53.250
of challenges and not promises.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.780
Not for what he would
offer the American people

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.133
as president, but what
he would ask of them.

00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:59.014
My favorite speech is the
one that President Kennedy

00:02:59.014 --> 00:03:01.373
gave at Rice University,
where he makes the case

00:03:01.373 --> 00:03:03.211
for sending a man to the moon.

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:05.423
He said that that challenge
was worthwhile not because

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:08.529
it would be easy but
because it would be so hard.

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.441
My generation will inherit
a complicated world,

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.292
with countless unsolved problems.

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:15.142
Climate change is just one of them,

00:03:15.142 --> 00:03:16.769
but it's the type of change
I think my grandfather

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.917
would have been energized
about and eager to solve.

00:03:19.917 --> 00:03:21.602
He cared deeply about the environment,

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:23.211
about science and technology,

00:03:23.211 --> 00:03:25.533
and he recognized that only
if America leads the world

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:27.605
in solving global
problems can we make sure

00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:29.391
that it's done right.

00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:31.726
From that speech at Rice,
and from the space program

00:03:31.726 --> 00:03:33.804
he helped launch, we can learn a simple

00:03:33.804 --> 00:03:37.252
but important lesson, great
challenges are opportunities,

00:03:37.252 --> 00:03:39.112
and it is each generation's responsibility

00:03:39.112 --> 00:03:41.732
to meet those challenges
with the same combination

00:03:41.732 --> 00:03:44.427
of energy, faith and devotion
that President Kennedy

00:03:44.427 --> 00:03:47.147
and his contemporaries
displayed decades ago.

00:03:47.147 --> 00:03:48.437
I know that we're up to the task,

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:50.349
but we have to demand
action from our leaders,

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.663
and we have to vote.

00:03:52.663 --> 00:03:54.835
- As his family, we're so
proud of what my father

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.982
stood for during his life,

00:03:56.982 --> 00:04:00.502
and how powerful those
values remain today.

00:04:00.502 --> 00:04:03.492
I hope that these reflections
on President Kennedy's life

00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:07.008
and his influence on those
of us who share his legacy

00:04:07.008 --> 00:04:09.721
will encourage people
across the United States

00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:13.017
to look at challenges in
their own corner of the world

00:04:13.017 --> 00:04:15.537
and seek solutions that heal,

00:04:15.537 --> 00:04:18.603
lift up the forgotten
and make a difference

00:04:18.603 --> 00:04:20.673
in the lives of others.

00:04:20.673 --> 00:04:22.340
Thanks for watching.
