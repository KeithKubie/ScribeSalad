[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:07.400
RAUL LEON: Well,
thank you, Dominic.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.560
Thanks for the opportunity
to be here at Google.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.930
Thanks for the opportunity
to be able to share

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.030
some space and time with
you at this lunchtime.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.670
I'm very excited
to be able to share

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.880
a little bit about my
experience and expertise

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.710
with chief diversity officers.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.440
And I'm really happy to
see that you're taking time

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.270
to really learn about a topic
that I'm very passionate about

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.540
and I think is very pertinent
for the work of colleges,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.980
universities, and
organizations today.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.980
To begin, I'd like to tell
you a little bit about what

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.409
I envision this
session could be or how

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:40.700
we are going to spend the time.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.699
So I would like to share
a little bit of insight

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.210
about my academic
journey, because I

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.350
think it will explain why
I'm interested in the topic.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.400
I would like to situate
the work of the CDO

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.610
to think about how they
are change agents in higher

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.390
education.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.040
I would like to share
my understanding

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.540
about the work of the CDO.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.850
And also, I will be more than
happy to welcome questions

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.100
in a lively discussion,
stemming from some of the facts

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.050
or some of the information
I'm going to present to you.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.440
My interest in the topic stems
from my time in grad school.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.810
As you might think
about grad school

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.630
or think about what
do you do in college,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.310
it's a time in which you
have to find something

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.630
that you're passionate about.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.500
In this case, I was pursuing
my master's and doctorate

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.660
at the University of
Wisconsin, Madison.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.320
And I was there roughly
from 2005 to 2010.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.540
And when I had the task to find
a topic for my dissertation,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.540
I had to figure out,
what topic will move me

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.610
into the next
stage of my career?

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.330
What topic will have me
interested for long enough,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.390
but yet will allow me to
complete a dissertation, which

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.220
is this large document,
to be able to say,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.550
I'm an expert in this
part of the field.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.130
And at that time, I
had worked in places

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.680
such as international
student services.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.660
I had worked in a study abroad.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.970
I had worked with
communities that

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.810
foster a sense of engagement
for international students.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.657
And I have also served
at pre-college programs.

00:02:11.657 --> 00:02:12.740
So that was my background.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.930
And that was sort of
my work experience

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.245
while I was in grad school.

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:18.620
So I was trying to find a
topic that sort of suited those

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.850
experiences and also was a good
choice for an academic pursuit,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.080
such as a dissertation or
a journal in the future.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.970
As I did that,
one of the aspects

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.160
that got me interested
in the topic

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
is that I had the opportunity
to sit in the committee.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.690
Many of you probably
have done that,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.840
in which you are tasked
to serve in a committee

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.200
and be able to do something for
the good of the institution.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.380
In this case, the committee
was the Diversity Committee.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.900
And this committee was
the wide campus committee,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.630
meaning it called
for representatives

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.670
of all areas of the campus.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.191
That would be faculty, students,
administrators, community

00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:56.690
members.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.280
And this was a
committee that was

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.370
tasked to sort of move the
diversity agenda forward

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.069
at the institution.

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.360
After being on the committee,
I believe, for two years,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.820
I think in my third
year, I volunteered

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.310
to co-chair the committee,
because not only I

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.720
was an eager student to be
able to undertake this task,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.140
but I also really had a
passion for the leadership that

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.760
had come into the institution.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.110
What occurred is that in
2008, Dr. Damon Williams

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.040
was appointed as the first chief
diversity officer at University

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.390
of Wisconsin, Madison.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.230
Maybe you recognize his
name, because he was just

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.140
recently recognized at
the bicentennial event

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.080
at the University of
Michigan, appointed

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.130
as the person that
gave the speech,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.920
and also has written
extensively about CDOs.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.750
So I was really happy
to have an expert

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.820
in the field in chief
diversity officers

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.250
and someone that was
starting as the first person,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.620
and also co-chair in
the committee with.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.340
At that time, you might
say, the topic finds you.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.671
So I was interested in writing
about chief diversity officers.

00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:00.170
Why?

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.900
Because I had an
extensive period in time

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.140
in which I was witnessing
how someone in that role

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.350
could move an
institution forward.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.040
As I think about or give a brief
definition to set our context,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.570
or just to set what a chief
diversity officer is--

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.250
as you think about
it in the context

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.120
of academic institutions, a CDO
would be a person or individual

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.570
that reports to the president of
the provost, has a direct line,

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.710
and also is a person that is
the highest diversity rank

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.680
administrator at
the institution.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.450
When we think
about what CDOs do,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.760
I think the timeline
of the talk does not

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.370
allow us to delve
into exactly how you

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.680
will define it,
describe it, and sort

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.940
of talk about the position.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.870
But roughly, it's a person that
coordinates, leads, enhances,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.360
and sometimes supervises
the formal diversity

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.130
capabilities of institutions.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.010
And by "diversity capabilities,"
you can include people,

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.260
you can include programs,
you can include centers,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.730
you can include resources.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.950
So everything that deals
with diversity, this person

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.060
could come in and integrate,
coordinate, facilitate,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.820
or bring together to be
able to maximize resources

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.620
when you are at an institution.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.099
When you think about your
work as a doctoral student,

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.640
the biggest thing
that you have to do

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.430
is, what question do
you want to answer?

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.591
And how do you create
a good dissertation?

00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:22.090
Meaning, you're
going to spend a lot

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.832
of time looking at this document
in front of your computer.

00:05:24.832 --> 00:05:26.290
You're going to
spend a lot of time

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.990
looking at this document
and pages and editing.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.730
So it has to be something
that catches your attention,

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.840
but also catches attentions
of others that are willing

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.550
or that will read this document.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.530
So when I was thinking
about what to do,

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.510
I knew I wanted to know a
little bit more about the CDO.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.080
And I also knew that I had
to add on what has already

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.715
been said about a CDO.

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:51.340
So those are the two things that
I was kind of keeping in mind.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.290
And what was
happening at that time

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.100
is, when I met Dr.
Williams, he was actively

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.732
working in publishing
these two books.

00:05:59.732 --> 00:06:01.690
You can see the "Strategic
Diversity Leadership

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.630
in Higher Education" and the
"Chief Diversity Officer."

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.970
So these two books were
projects that he was actively

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.060
working on while I was
also at the university.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.090
So I not only had to
add to the literature,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.620
but I was also sort of
competing to understand

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.992
what will I add to
what has been written

00:06:19.992 --> 00:06:21.700
if you're going to
publish two books when

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.350
I finish my dissertation?

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.710
And the timeline sort of
worked that he was kind enough

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.500
to share some of
the first print-outs

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.570
or the drafts of
the books for me

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.920
to sort of enhance
my understanding.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.270
But also, then I knew that I
needed to publish something

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.370
beyond that to further
my understanding,

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.660
given what he was going to come
up with the books, which today

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.340
are pretty much
the premier books

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.320
that people in
institutions have adopted

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.530
to understand the role of
CDOs in higher education

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.520
institutions.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.010
So as I did that, I
figured that there

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.010
was one aspect of the literature
that he presented that I

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.570
was really interested on.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.210
And that was the
organizational design

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.450
of the position of the CDO.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.180
So, so far when I heard
people talk about the CDO,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.800
they will mention
the CDO as a person,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.480
the CDO as an individual.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.770
But when you really
look at the literature,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.530
the CDO could be
an office, a unit.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.680
It could be a whole
team of people

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.597
that work under the
leadership of the CDO.

00:07:20.597 --> 00:07:22.930
So I was interested, then,
in discovering questions that

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.490
dealt with the organization.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.310
I was interested in
questions that deal with,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.970
how do you actually
do your work?

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.790
So what strategies
do you utilize?

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.310
And then today, I will
connect that to, how

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.530
is that important for
the work that I do today

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.300
and for the work that you
might do today at Google?

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.030
So for the first
one, when you think

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.150
about organizational structure,
you might think about roles.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.290
You can think about reporting
structures-- so who supervises?

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.360
What is your authority
over other people?

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.210
And I also think about
budget and resources.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.330
So the role of the
position is everything

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.970
that allows you to do the
work that you do, given who

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.640
is around you and who you
have as a team or team

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.220
member or supervision.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.890
One thing that was out
there that I benefited from

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.680
is that when people did
research about CDOs,

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.650
they had established that if
you looked at all the CDOs

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.720
that were present in
institutions of higher

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.720
education at that time,
you can roughly put them

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.660
in three models
and said, some CDOs

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.150
fall under the
collaborative CDO model.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.960
Some CDOs fall under the
unit-based CDO model.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.980
And some CDOs fall under the
portfolio divisional CDO model.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.740
So I will explain in a little
bit what those models mean.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.419
But roughly, if
you took everyone,

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.549
you could say, this
is the framework that

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:41.750
allows you to somewhat say, your
structure is similar to what

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.150
this model presents.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.800
As we talked about
that, this was

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.990
the breakdown in which, in
2007, those CDOs were organized.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:56.030
And you can see that roughly the
largest representation of CDOs

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.480
fell under the
collaborative CDO model.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.880
Then we have the unit-based
CDO model second.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.030
And then a very small proportion
of CDOs across the nation

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.920
were under the portfolio
divisional one.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.680
And that was based on a survey
that Dr. Williams conducted

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.660
and reached about 110 CDOs and
about 70 interviews with people

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.590
that were currently
in that role.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.960
So why is that important?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.770
At that point, I knew
that I wanted to explore,

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.130
what strategies do people
in the position of CDO

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.550
pursue to develop, maximize,
and manage diversity?

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.940
But also, I wanted
to know, does being

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.420
in one of these configurations
actually influence

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.590
how you do your work?

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.590
Does it influence how
you adapt strategies?

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.590
Does it influence how you
execute your diversity work?

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.270
All right.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.324
So when I was
doing my study, one

00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:47.990
of the things that I
had to keep in mind

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.510
is that when you
compare something,

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.120
it is beneficial at times
when you actually compare

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.530
things that are similar.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.660
So I could not pick
one CDO working

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.180
at a very small school
with 500 students

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.140
and then pick a CDO at a school
with 50,000 students in which

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.400
the configurations were
roughly super different

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.660
and would not allow
for a fair comparison.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.510
So what I thought
about is that I

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.450
wanted to find commonalities
about a sample for me

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.170
to allow me to do
that comparison.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.540
So I compare first
institutions that have adopted

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.380
a strategic diversity plan.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.290
Then I wanted a CDO
that was reporting

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.790
to the president of provost,
because at that time,

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.450
people were trying to
figure out what a CDO was.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.520
So there was different
configurations.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.730
They would call someone with
authority and diversity a CDO.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.230
But technically,
that person needed

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.240
to report to the
president or provost

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.580
when we're talking
about the role defined.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.700
And also, I wanted to
find representation

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.450
of models that actually
represented the characteristics

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.070
of each of the configurations.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.650
So add some fidelity
to, OK, I can

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.750
see you sort of check
all those things

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.350
that you are a good
representation of a CDO

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.580
model in this type.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:04.100
And then I found three
CDOs at three institutions.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.900
And I decided that I needed
to find the same institution,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.600
meaning that I picked
research universities that

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.010
had the three different models.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.560
So at the end of the day,
I had the three models

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.960
represented in
similar-sized institutions

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.020
with similar size and
population of students

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.850
with similar locations.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.340
And the difference was
that they had those three

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.120
different models.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.910
So I could also
do the comparison.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.250
So as I think about
what happened in 2013,

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.040
you see a little
evolution of models sort

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.590
of moving towards
developing more portfolio

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.380
divisional models, but
also reducing the number

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.360
of collaborative CDOs.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.030
And I will go into explaining,
what does that look like,

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.920
and why are they important
when you think about structure?

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.280
So this is what I found.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.230
So when I went and
did my research,

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.140
graphically, this is what
the CDO configuration

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.690
at the collaborative
level would look like.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:57.830
It's pretty flat.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.260
You will have the CDO
person or the individual

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.790
representing that position.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.190
And under that
person, that person

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.580
had three admin staff,
which could be someone that

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.530
helps them with
tasks in the office,

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:13.190
could be someone that
helps anywhere from payroll

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:17.240
to organizing events to
someone that does anything

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.820
that that person needs
to run the office itself.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.620
At that time, the
fourth position

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.050
was being negotiated
and requested

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.080
for that person to be able to
fulfill the duties of the CDO.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.802
So graphically, it
looked like that.

00:12:28.802 --> 00:12:30.260
But when you think
about the things

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.850
that I've been
mentioning, as to what

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:36.260
does a CDO do, so in this
model, this model basically

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.350
values collaboration and
lateral coordination,

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.510
meaning this person
is actively trying

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.840
to build partnerships
horizontally and vertically

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.430
in the organization.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:50.930
Two, they have various small
support staff, meaning they

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.590
probably have two or three
people that deal with f office.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.300
But they are responsible
for diversity

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.589
in the entire institution.

00:12:57.589 --> 00:12:59.630
Or at least, that is the
perception that you have

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.380
when you bring a chief diversity
officer to an institution.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.530
Two-- or three, they
have no reporting units.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:11.000
So no units across campus
reported to that person.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.020
And then there was no one, which
was a diversity officer perhaps

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.480
in a program or a school, that
actually reported to them.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.990
So when you think about your
organizational hierarchy

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.910
here in Google, so
this will be a person

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.740
that is a one-person office.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.020
And you maybe have two
or three support staff.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.620
And you do what you need
to do with your team.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.054
And that is how things get done.

00:13:32.054 --> 00:13:33.470
But there is very
little hierarchy

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.010
as to who reports to you to
be able to say, where are we

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:37.790
with this project?

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.690
It's more you try to convince
people that this is important.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.580
Thinking about the unit-based
CDO-- the second model.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.700
So in this model,
you see it's not

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.220
as flat as the unit-based CDO.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.760
In this case, you have
now program associates,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.340
which were not only
program administrators.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.120
So the people in both
in this configuration

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.230
also provided expertise to be
able to carry out diversity

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.530
work, having expertise in
the field, in the topics,

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.050
and being able to work
with the CDO directly,

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.650
beyond just supporting
administrative tasks.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.220
Also, at the time in which
I was exploring this,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.770
the institution where
I was exploring this

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.350
were thinking about moving
a couple units on campus

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.560
under the supervision
of this role.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.340
And as you might imagine,
some of the characteristics

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.570
are still the same.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.720
But what changes from model
to model is, in this one,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.810
you actually start supervising
other folks that deal

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.730
with diversity across campus.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.010
You actually have a
broader span of priorities,

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.470
because now you have your
program associates sort of

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.490
to [INAUDIBLE] specific areas.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.360
And one of the areas could
be faculty recruitment.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.840
Another area could be
diversity training.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.250
Another area could be
student success initiatives.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.460
So now you have people
appointed to specific areas

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.160
that might be associated
with what you do.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.120
And in this case, when you
compare a one-person office

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.880
to a person that has
program associates,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.100
in this configuration,
you're more

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.010
likely to be involved with
the day-to-day implementation

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.720
of the tasks of activities
that take place across campus.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.220
Why?

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.894
Simply, you have
three or four people

00:15:14.894 --> 00:15:16.310
that are actually
actively working

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.470
with those versus being
a one-person office

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.510
that you might need to
deal with everything

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.940
just in the little
time that you have.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.390
And then the third
model that I found

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.010
is the portfolio divisional CDO.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.740
So graphically, it's apparent
that the structure is not flat.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.460
It's apparent that there's a
lot more program associates.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.790
It's apparent that there is
assistant to those associates.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.340
There's also admin support.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.960
And there is also 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6 reporting units

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.140
to this person.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.950
So in this configuration,
all these units

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.950
with the staff that
they have and the admin

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.310
staff that they have, they don't
only do their work in a silo.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.860
But they also report
to the CDO, meaning

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.770
the CDO establishes
the strategic plan

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.320
for all these units
and for the people that

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.800
report to this person.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.380
So roughly, those three
models-- that's how they vary.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.910
And when you looked
at the CDO portfolio

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.910
divisional configuration,
you can see that now you

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.980
have administrative staff.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.450
You have program associates.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.900
You can have people deal
with technical or marketing

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.290
or other aspects of
the work that you do.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.970
You have reporting units.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.150
You supervise other diversity
officers in the institution.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.490
But you still value
collaboration.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.760
You still value being able
to get a lot of aspects

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.270
of diversity work done.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.050
But one thing that
occurs is that this model

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.800
was very uncommon across
colleges and universities.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.880
And you can have
your hints as to why

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.050
it might have been uncommon.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.758
Well, it might have
been expensive to run

00:16:47.758 --> 00:16:51.100
an office with that many units
or people supporting the CDO.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.700
And also, moving resources
under a CDO and saying,

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.610
you do the diversity work with
all these people under you,

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.860
might not have been the first
thing that people wanted

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.331
to do when creating a model.

00:17:01.331 --> 00:17:02.830
They might have
appointed one person

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.589
first as a CDO
collaborative officer,

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.470
rather than establishing
an entire division

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.210
from the get-go.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.210
So what did I find?

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.819
Because I wanted to find if
being one of those models

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.710
influenced what you
were able to do.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.880
So what strategies did
CDOs in this position

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.500
utilize to carry out work?

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.950
Well, when I looked at what
had been written about it,

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:35.610
I could see that CDOs broadly
focus in several areas

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.570
that deal with diversity.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.480
One of those areas was
educational strategies.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.540
So they were there
to educate the campus

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.520
about the value of diversity.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.110
They focus on
communication strategies,

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.935
which was communicate diversity
into the mission, vision,

00:17:50.935 --> 00:17:53.850
and goals with the
entire institution.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.330
They focused on entrepreneurial
strategies, which is basically

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.000
raising money or finances
devoted to the work

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.580
that you do pertaining
to diversity.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.800
They engage with
symbolic strategies,

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.860
which is, how do you influence
the campus culture in relation

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.070
to messages that
pertain to diversity?

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.850
They engage with
accountability strategies,

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.950
where it's establishing
indicators about how

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.260
you assess diversity progress.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.140
And also, they engage
with research strategies,

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.570
meaning they did
research to figure out,

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.820
what does diversity
look like, or what's

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.620
the interpretation of
diversity on their campus?

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.130
So this is what had been
written about CDOs when

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.830
I got to the point in which
I was doing my own research.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.570
And when I did my
research, I was

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.730
able to figure out that they
also do two additional things.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.060
One is, they engage
with diversity research,

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.990
meaning they actively
collaborate with faculty

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.290
and other people interested
in research in topics that

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.570
are associated with diversity.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:56.420
And also, they directly
sometimes focus

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.390
on recruitment strategies
for faculty and students--

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.610
so building
pipelines or students

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.500
building pipelines or faculty
to come into the institution.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.990
So when someone says, what
do diversity officers do?

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.990
These are the categories
that you could be like,

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.770
they focus on these seven
sort of types of strategies

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:13.970
to carry out their work.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.000
But I wanted to move it a
step farther to figure out,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.600
what does that actually mean?

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.300
What do you actually
do day-to-day?

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.500
When you say you educate
the campus, what do you do?

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.080
OK.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.850
So my goal was to sort
of create a chart that

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.840
will allow me to capture
the day-to-day activities

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.400
that these CDOs were doing.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.920
And remember that
when I mention CDOs,

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.620
I am mentioning the staff of
the CDO, the office of the CDO--

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.870
so the whole structure
that carries the work

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.370
that the CDO represents.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.590
So when we look at the
location of the strategies,

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.120
when I looked at
the three positions

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.370
that I was interviewing
or that I did research

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.320
on at the three
different institutions,

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.670
you can see one thing.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.870
Well, roughly, they were
doing similar stuff.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.480
It looks like all of them
were doing similar efforts

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.980
in educating the campus.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.010
So it seemed that educating
the campus about the role

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.780
of the CDO was pertinent.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.590
And it made sense.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.089
Why?

00:20:10.089 --> 00:20:11.490
Because the positions were new.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.060
They were just established
across many campuses.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.770
So not many campuses
have actually

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.270
seen a position like that.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.480
So they were asking, well,
what does this position do?

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.410
Or what is it supposed to do?

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.340
So it makes sense that all
of them began by doing that.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.340
Then we moved into
communication strategies.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.530
You see things like,
for instance, CDOs

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.260
spend time to develop a
website for their offices.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.620
They spend time to be
present at public events.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.680
They spend time soliciting
input from campus

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.570
to be able to draft
communications.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.580
And once again,
roughly, it appears

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.420
that the three configurations
were doing the same tasks.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.400
But as we move through
the configurations

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.260
and to the type of
strategies that they have,

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.250
then I found out that
some of the differences

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.370
started to emerge as to how
much these roles sort of had

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:03.000
accomplished while they have
focused on diversity work.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.070
And you can imagine that
at the time in which I

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:08.970
was interviewing the people in
these positions and the people

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.610
that reported to the
CDOs, they had roughly

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:15.270
been on the position
the same amount of time.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.850
And they had or
operated in institutions

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.990
that were of the same size.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.500
So for me, I was
curious as to, well,

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.930
what is different among
what you chose to do?

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.450
And this is where I started
seeing those differences.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:31.290
For instance, in this end, I saw
that accountability strategies

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.320
to be able to figure out if
the campus is making progress

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.860
towards diversity goals--

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.290
it started to be
a little bit more

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:41.550
of a priority for the portfolio
CDO and the unit-based CDO.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.950
And as I moved through
more strategies,

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:48.600
like research strategies, as
I moved through other aspects,

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.300
I think you can see now
that the differences were

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.410
pretty apparent.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.950
Like, the folks in the
collaborative model

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.720
or the folks in the
smaller more flat model

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.210
were not devoting
any time to fulfill

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.600
any other responsibilities of
the other type of strategies.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.620
And why was this important?

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.192
Well, I then figured
out that one, well,

00:22:11.192 --> 00:22:12.900
they were not moving
the diversity agenda

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.340
in those areas.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.680
I understood that often
it dealt with if you

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.390
have one person doing
this type of work,

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.850
it's unlikely you will
focus on those priorities.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.630
But I also start to discover
that the depth in which they

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:28.080
were moving these agendas
forward varied greatly.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.190
So even when we had
them all check education

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:35.700
on the strategies and they all
were, for instance, sending

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.420
a message to campus, the
depth of that message, who

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.750
was in charge of the message,
how often the message was

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.210
repeated, it just
varied greatly, also

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.950
because of the structure.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.820
So how is this relevant at
all for the work that I do

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.480
or for the work
that you might do,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.930
knowing that, for instance,
Google has a chief diversity

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.270
officer, that chief
diversity officers actually

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.140
emerge in the business sector?

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.310
So in higher education, they
might be a newer position,

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.650
but sort of copied from
the business sector

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.020
to be able to move
diversity forward.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.810
So when one thinks
about the CDO,

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.620
one criticism that you might
get is that when you hire a CDO,

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.740
this person arrives to
campus, and then guess what?

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.500
Diversity becomes a
priority once they're hired.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.080
Well, that is
definitely not the case.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.040
That is just--

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.060
I wish it was.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.100
But when you hire this
person or once you

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.040
have hired a unit,
a division, people

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.360
will assume that everything
related to diversity

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.790
now is awesome, or it
works, or it will now pave

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.630
the way for future generations.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.950
And I think one part that
we actually do not look at

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:46.500
is that we fail to consider, how
do you envision-- once you hire

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.350
this person, how are
they going to spend

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.220
their time at the institution?

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.930
So if you hire someone
as a CDO at Google,

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.760
what do you envision them to do?

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.370
Do you expect them
to sort of take

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.800
part in community leaderships?

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.600
Do you expect them to travel
around the office and Google

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.280
and communicate a message?

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.610
Do you expect them to sort of
focus on affirmative action

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:09.880
and compliance?

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.700
Do you want them
to produce reports?

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.670
So figuring out what priorities
have been established

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.480
for that person is something
that, it's important, but also

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.690
is, how are you going to support
that person as an institution

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.520
once they are
appointed in that role?

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.490
So when you think about other
divisions in the company--

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.360
like, most of your
units might have

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.010
a budget, might have
people in different roles,

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.110
might have a staff, they
have a reporting structure,

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:36.900
they have a buy-in
from the leadership.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.800
And in this case, what we ask
is, when you appoint a CDO,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.640
does this person have the same
buy-in as other executive level

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.270
people in the firm?

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.530
Because they have the C title.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:49.820
They're an executive officer.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.600
They report directly
to the provost.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.780
But do they have that same
budget or similar budget

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.240
than other units
or similar access

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.810
or similar support or
people or reporting units?

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:03.870
Well, this is where the
disparities start to emerge.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.630
So how is these work related
to the work that I do?

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.410
And I'm a faculty member.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.830
So today, if you know anything
about faculty members,

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.830
you might be like, what
do you do on campus?

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.100
Well, you often find
us or see us teaching.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.010
You see us or read or know that
we are often reading and doing

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:21.510
research.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:24.030
And that's why we are
looking at our laptops a lot.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.610
And then also, one part
that is not as visible

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.840
is that we take part into
service, meaning we devote time

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.290
to be in committees that
deal something with service

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.660
in the institution or
our peers or our programs

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.560
or our students.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.530
So roughly, this is how faculty
or professor life sort of

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:41.490
is divided.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.890
But as you think
about professor life

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.990
across the spectrum
of institutions,

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.530
it might look very different.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.750
In some institutions,
research might take

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.940
the biggest chunk of your time.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.880
Teaching might not be as
big, or it might actually

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.130
be more important than research.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:00.100
And service might actually
be considerably larger

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.431
than you expected, coming
into an institution.

00:26:02.431 --> 00:26:04.180
So when you think about
a faculty member--

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.250
and in my case, I'm
going to describe

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.840
to you what do I do
for research, teaching,

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.060
and service that could benefit
from the presence of a CDO.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.570
So I have been engaged with a
few things that, when listing,

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.790
I don't think these
things are that unusual.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.220
So I do think faculty members do
engage with this type of work.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.470
So on my campus, I have
published articles,

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.540
meaning that I have engaged
in producing a scholarship.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.530
Two, I have pursued grants
for funding those research

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:33.920
projects.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.910
Three, I have prepared
graduate students or my team

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.910
to be able to conduct research.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:42.580
I have also taught courses
and organized workshops

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.640
on campus for a topic that
I might have an expertise.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.980
I have also chaired
search committees

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.200
to be able to bring
new people to campus

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.720
and to be able to identify
diverse candidates.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.150
I have also support
local community efforts

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:01.110
or initiatives through or link
through my research or teaching

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:02.610
interest.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.350
I have mentored
junior faculty that

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.360
came into our
program or department

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.130
to be able to serve--
like, make sure

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.050
they are successful
when they move

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.070
into the next round
of their career.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.770
I advise student
organizations on campus.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.890
I have created
initiatives on campus

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.800
that are focused on
fostering student success.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.890
And I have also
contribute to create

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.560
what we will call a
pipeline of students that

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.090
can come in in institutions.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.640
And today I work at Eastern
Michigan University,

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.830
with a focus to come to Eastern.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.789
So as you think about all
those responsibilities,

00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:39.330
you might be able
to make connections

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.320
to the type of
activities that you do.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.890
And the reason that
I make that point

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.190
is that, when I think
about the work of the CDO,

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.760
I can see the CDO
sort of engaging

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.970
in these type of activities
or these type of roles,

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.380
supporting my work.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.470
So for instance, a
CDO can fund stuff.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.490
A CDO can serve as a platform.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.790
A CDO can offer leadership.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.690
A CDO can offer
visibility in the spaces.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.870
They can offer in
a strategic plan.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.660
They can be a partner.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.580
They can align resources.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.230
They can be a network
or part of a network.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.140
And most important, they can
drive sustainable change.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.610
But if I asked you to sort
of reflect in these aspects,

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.490
I think you might be able
to identify folks here

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:28.200
in your organization that are
tasked with these priorities

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.500
or with these roles.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.710
So when I move it
back to connecting

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:35.430
how does this impact my
work as a faculty member,

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:36.800
I think about this.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.160
A CDO could offer funding
for us to offer workshops

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.070
for the campus to
learn about a topic.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.620
A CDO could be a platform to
be able to share publications

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.730
of a scholarship
of faculty members

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.640
to be able to engage the
campus in conversations

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.970
pertinent to a new area
or topic of research.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.030
A CDO could offer
leadership to be

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.390
able to understand, how do
we foster student success not

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.340
only from the top
administrators,

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.600
but also from the units that
are engaged with this work?

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.030
A CDO could advocate for
visibility in spaces--

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.460
for instance, finding a
place in which a student orgs

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.810
can come, convene, and do the
work that they want to do.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.520
A CDO could remind
other administrators

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.020
that a pipeline of students or
crafting a path for students

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.700
that are underrepresented should
be part of the strategic plan.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.770
A CDO could be a partner, not
only with funding, but also

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.080
with the visibility, with
the campus community,

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.340
or with a local community
when you do a project.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.980
Also, a CDO could
align resources.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.900
If you have a new
research project,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.380
there could be someone
in the office of the CDO

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.770
that offers a start-up
funding to conduct research.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.270
And sometimes that
start-up funding

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.930
could be $500 to be able
to pay for transcriptions

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:55.370
of your interviews.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:59.580
The CDO could also be the person
in which a network of faculty,

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.270
staff, students that are
passionate about this work

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.370
revolve around this
person, meaning

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:07.100
that it could be a
place where we train

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.740
and mentor junior faculty
to be able to understand

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.290
their responsibility with
respect to diversity.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.630
And also, a CDO
could be someone that

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.050
fosters sustainable change.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:16.550
Why?

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.160
Because often that person
could be part of what?

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.270
Search committees.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.120
When you're bringing someone
new to the organization,

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.080
that is the biggest task
that we have in front of us.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.080
Who we bring literally
means that they

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.230
will shape and continue to
shape how our organization moves

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.990
forward.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:37.970
So thinking about the CDO and
thinking about what they do,

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:41.270
I find a lot of correlations
with what you do daily

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.980
around your work on campus.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.090
I am very pleased, for instance,
that you have convened here

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:49.430
over the lunchtime
to be able to access

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.650
a workshop or a professional
development opportunity.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.270
And today, sort of thinking
about Hispanic Heritage Month

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:59.720
just passed and being a person
that represents that heritage,

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.720
I'm really happy that
a focus or support has

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.430
been given to
bringing speakers that

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.040
might be able to talk about
a research in relation

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.950
to a topic as
important as diversity.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.440
So with that, I wanted to
leave some space for you

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:17.030
to ask questions and engage
in a lively discussion of how

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.820
do you think this role connects
with some of the things

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.190
that you're doing here at
Google or some of the things

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.320
that you are engaging in
your daily activities.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.120
And I'm going to leave
this slide up sort

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.040
of just to guide us in
the potential aspects

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.250
that I have identified as,
I saw connections of CDOs

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:35.780
actively working with this.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.210
But most valuable,
I saw connections

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.660
of actively people like
you in the institutions

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.630
doing the work, because,
as I mentioned it,

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.880
once we hire a CDO,
diversity doesn't

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.800
become a priority next day.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.940
It's when you, as an individual,
engage with that type of work.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.180
And having a CDO could be
beneficial to offer you

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.290
a platform for that.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.732
So thank you.

00:31:59.732 --> 00:32:04.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.110
AUDIENCE: Well, I can
start out with a question.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.030
Thank you, again, so
much for taking time out

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.540
of your day to be here.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.050
So in your research,
I'm curious to know

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:16.160
if there was a singular or
maybe a few of these categories

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.720
that maybe fell short that
had impacted most negatively

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.200
maybe the experience of
these units under a CDO

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.830
or then trickled down
to impacting negatively

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:32.670
the student body experience
at those particular campuses?

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.611
RAUL LEON: I think your question
is precise and is valuable.

00:32:35.611 --> 00:32:36.110
Why?

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:39.950
Because when you think
about each of the campuses,

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.050
each of those campuses
had a history.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.480
Each of those campuses
were deal with issues

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.220
that were pertinent to
that campus at that time.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.240
So for some campuses,
the symbolic aspect

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.270
of appointing a CDO
was very relevant.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.490
For other campuses to
have, for instance, worked

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.890
about enhances the
number of women

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.510
as a faculty member
in a discipline

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.420
was really important.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.340
So it was really context-based.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.190
So for those campuses,
one of the things

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.900
that was important
for them, it was

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:10.010
the presence of the CDO,
the visibility of the CDO,

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.500
but they also were
trying to grasp the,

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.850
how do we move forward, knowing
that this position might not

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.850
have everything that it needs
to do the work that they need--

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.430
so recognizing that,
yes, appointing a person

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.010
to do this work was
important, but how

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:28.430
do we move it to the next
level and make sure they have

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.000
the structure, the role, the
budget, the support staff

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.680
to make diversity priority?

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.610
So it depend.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.950
And it varied from
campus to campus.

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:43.310
But it also highlighted aspects
for all those different venues.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.430
What I will tell you is that
when we think about diversity

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:51.470
work, we should not identify
just one aspect and say,

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.480
this is what will
make diversity work.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.630
It's sort of like all these
wheels have to move forward

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:57.922
in the same direction.

00:33:57.922 --> 00:33:59.630
Otherwise, there will
always be something

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:03.110
important or important
to someone or to a unit

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:06.860
or to a group that we risk
leaving out if we just decide

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.170
to focus on certain aspects.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.287
AUDIENCE: Kind of
piggybacking off of that,

00:34:11.287 --> 00:34:13.370
a thought that was kind
of running through my mind

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:20.989
is, how does a CDO
potentially lift up or amplify

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:24.889
the voices of the most
underrepresented individuals?

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:27.199
And what I specifically
am speaking to

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:30.020
is intersections of identities.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:34.370
And so you were just
speaking to running

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.080
the risk of
potentially leaving out

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.300
some of those highly
specific groups.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.520
I guess I'm just curious,
how do you even begin

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.969
to amplify groups like that?

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:43.510
How do you begin to
learn about them?

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.800
How do you begin to bring
them into the organization

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.560
when they themselves, from
a physical standpoint,

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.823
might only be one person?

00:34:49.823 --> 00:34:50.989
RAUL LEON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:53.540
I think your question
is very real,

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.820
meaning I think
that is a question

00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:00.020
that many folks or individuals
or groups on campuses

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.359
or at organizations
might have today.

00:35:02.359 --> 00:35:04.900
And I think the best way for me
to answer that question might

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.630
be to give you some examples.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.590
So for instance, if I think
about the type of workshops

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.890
that are run on a campus, being
able to incentivize people

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.560
and support people
to explore topics

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.960
that deal within a
specific group of students

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.000
or faculty or staff
or individuals

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.180
might be a way in which you find
now a space for those people

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.420
to be able to be
present on campus.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.930
The other part is that when
you think about visibility

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:31.840
of spaces, it could be
anywhere from designating

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.090
a space in which you have
allies and advocates to be

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:37.280
able to designate
months or dates

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.860
or celebrations that
deal with recognizing

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.960
the valuable contributions
of people that

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.870
are identified with groups
on campus that are today

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.280
underrepresented.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.820
When you talk
about publications,

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.120
you could put a call,
as a CDO, supporting

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.030
areas of the literature that
they are underrepresented

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.800
and could say,
we're specifically

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.430
looking for scholars on campus
that focus on A, B, or C areas

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.560
that, you know what,
there are not journals

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.210
that really pushing that today.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.360
But you give them a venue to
maybe jump-start a journal

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.532
to start your own field.

00:36:09.532 --> 00:36:10.990
And you see that
in the literature.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:14.600
Today, you see many journals
that before didn't existed.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.290
I publish diversity work.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.190
And if you think
about 50 years ago,

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:22.180
there might not be a venue that
truly valued work on diversity.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.430
Today, you have the "Journal of
Diversity in Higher Education."

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.620
You have other journals
that are specifically

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.990
seek out to scholars that
are interested in that type

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:31.230
of work.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.840
Another way is network.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.790
You can create affinity groups.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:38.120
So as a CDO, you can really
connect people inside

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.180
of your institution that might
not see each other every day.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.400
As a faculty member, I will
tell you that we are in silos.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.980
We have a lot of
control about what

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.460
we do with our class, with
our research, with our time.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.980
And sometimes when you
even ask technology-- like,

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.310
the ability to
teach online or be

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.956
able to teach
through computers--

00:36:56.956 --> 00:36:58.580
you're not even
connecting to the folks

00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.621
that work in your office.

00:36:59.621 --> 00:37:01.650
So you might be a
little more distanced.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:03.930
So where are those
opportunities for me

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.450
to run into someone
that, in this case,

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.640
represents my same
identity on campus?

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.360
I think you can think about
my responsibility of finding

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.180
those folks.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:17.280
But also, what if the CDO
could have an affinity group

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.300
or support an affinity group
or provide a space or even just

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.690
add to the language in
which those type of groups

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:27.570
are valuable on campus and
give them a goal and a purpose?

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.070
So there's different
ways in which

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:31.170
I will say a CDO
could contribute

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.840
to connecting, giving
voices, providing

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.220
places for discussion.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.620
But also, how do you
integrate those things

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.970
to the bigger conversation?

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.280
When we think about
a strategic planning,

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.050
is there anything in
the strategic plan

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.590
that speaks to those needs,
that speaks to those wants,

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.530
that speaks to those
identity groups?

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.420
If there is not,
then where do we

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.520
see it reflected in the
day-to-day activities

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.842
that people on campus do that?

00:37:56.842 --> 00:37:58.800
And I think that's how
they can leverage and be

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.008
an advocate for those groups.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.790
AUDIENCE: So there's
a lot for a CDO to do.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.040
One thing at Google we've
worked really hard on

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.286
is not just
increasing diversity,

00:38:10.286 --> 00:38:11.910
but once people are
here, that everyone

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:15.627
feels they can be
successful and included.

00:38:15.627 --> 00:38:17.460
Have you found in your
research that there's

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.940
specific things a CDO, or
just groups in general,

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:25.590
that has the biggest impact
on that aspect of encouraging

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.575
inclusion throughout
the environment?

00:38:27.575 --> 00:38:28.200
RAUL LEON: Yep.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:35.520
So you hit the nail right on the
head, meaning a lot of people

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.460
talk about diversity and
inclusion and use the analogy,

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.750
invite people to the dance but
then actually dance with them.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.790
And one of the
analogies is that,

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.610
what makes people feel
valuable in your organization?

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.880
So I'll assure you that
hiring a CDO does not

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.700
make you feel valuable if you
have never contact that person,

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.160
you have no idea
what a CDO does.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.370
And I'm reflecting as
putting on my student hat.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.710
If I was a student,
it's unlikely I even

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:05.310
know the name of the president,
the provost, or the faculty

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.100
senate, or anyone that
deals with administration

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.060
in your institution.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.460
You're likely to know
maybe your advisor.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.320
But you are more
likely to know, who?

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.810
Leaders in other
student orgs, people

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.409
that live in your floor,
people that actually

00:39:18.409 --> 00:39:19.950
are connected to
the type of programs

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:21.240
that are offered to you.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.900
So my idea or my
research, what it tells me

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:29.130
is that, how do we trickle down
the actions and initiatives

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:31.950
that the CDO does
to parts of campus

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:35.650
that people might see
them as removed or silos?

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:40.350
So if you're a student living
in residential halls, as a CDO,

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.560
how could you
promote those spaces

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.690
to be spaces in which you
have a sense of belonging?

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:49.830
So for instance, you
could have a meeting,

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.470
or you could have a space
in which you actively

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.260
provide training to
resident advisors

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.940
to gain cultural competency.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:02.300
As a CDO, you could provide
funds for the community,

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.570
for instance, to
purchase a book that you

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:08.320
do a campus reading to really
bring that community together

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.820
over one topic.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.950
And all those examples,
you might be like, well,

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.360
anyone can do that.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.940
But also, if no
one is doing that,

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:20.200
someone with that vision, those
ideas, and that leadership

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.470
could jump-start that in
different pockets of campus.

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:25.765
And I think that resonates
with the previous question,

00:40:25.765 --> 00:40:27.640
is that there are going
to be a lot of things

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.170
that the CDO could do.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.340
Now, should they do
all those things?

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.190
Well, in an ideal world, yes.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.790
Can they do all those things?

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:39.190
Well, time has limited
number of hours.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:43.030
You probably will find not every
position looks like a portfolio

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.500
divisional CDO.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:48.360
Resources are not as available
in many of the institutions.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.360
But a CDO could be a person that
has the expertise and knowledge

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.110
to know where can I get the
most return for my buck,

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:59.800
meaning strategically leading
what we can accomplish,

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.061
knowing who we are-- so
maximizing who you are.

00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:04.810
And I think that's
part of the leadership.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.450
You have leaders that they
are brought to institutions

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.640
to be able to move
things forward,

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.110
because they know how
to move things forward.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:16.270
So when you bring someone with
an expertise in diversity, what

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.190
you're expecting is,
you hire a person

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.160
that is knowledgeable
about all these aspects

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.930
to be able to move the
institution forward,

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:29.920
even if it begins by purchasing
a book or organizing a talk.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.970
AUDIENCE: So in your experiences
and in your research,

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:38.120
how have you found is a great
way to measure the impact?

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.601
So for context, at Google, we're
in a lot of employee resource

00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:42.100
groups.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:46.180
And sometimes it's hard
to quantify impact.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.320
We use attendance numbers
and things like that.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.477
But what has been successful,
in your experience?

00:41:51.477 --> 00:41:52.810
RAUL LEON: Really good question.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.840
When you think about the
responsibilities of the CDO,

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.710
one of those was
accountability, in which you're

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.940
able to measure,
well, how do we know

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:04.420
that we are moving forward
in this diversity scale

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.190
or in this diversity platform?

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.090
And you're right.

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:10.060
Most of the times, what we
do is we refer to numbers.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:15.040
And we refer or really silo
diversity into representation.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.560
And I think representation
is important.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.260
Equity and being able to
have people that represent

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.470
society working for institutions
is extremely important.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.690
But then it jumps
to the next part.

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:27.970
Besides just taking
attendance, how

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:30.760
would you measure that the
contributions or the training

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:35.010
or what you're implementing
is really, actually emerging

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:36.650
in your day-to-day activities?

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:40.220
And one part in which I can
see that is by another example.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.130
So let's say that
you have training

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:47.020
that deals with cultural
competency and bias reduction.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.720
One of the best places in
which you could see that

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.900
is when you see people
advocating and really

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.740
understanding the search
process to bring new candidates.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.920
And you make decisions
like, hi, Nick, last year we

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.560
only brought 10 candidates.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.730
What can we do to enhance
our pool this year?

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:09.520
Two, are we advertising
in the right places

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.430
to be able to recruit
the right candidates?

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.820
Three, maybe we should spend
some time thinking about,

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.000
where is our pipeline of
candidates coming through

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.880
to be able to get people that
will be interested in working

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.330
in Google in the future?

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:25.950
So when I think about where
do you see those measurements,

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.940
you see them in the process.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.340
And that's why sustainability
is pretty important.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:33.580
If you don't have procedures
in which you have also

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:38.440
now embedded diversity, then
you keep just doing responsive

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.320
or work that deals with crisis.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.320
How do you actually create
process in which you now

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.420
embed what do you
know about diversity

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:50.560
and now it becomes a natural
aspect of the day-to-day things

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.800
that you do as a hiring
manager, as a supervisor,

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.820
or as a mentor?

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.560
Think about a new colleague
in your institution.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.220
How do you teach them
the culture here when

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.480
they come to your office?

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.130
You might be like, well, I
don't know, they just learn.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.330
Well, are there ways in
which they provide training?

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.700
Are there ways in which
they read about who we are?

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.040
Is there ways in which
they are socialized?

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.930
So I think having
those things and being

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:18.470
intentional about what is
provided is really critical,

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.180
because otherwise,
there is a fine line

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.880
between intentionality
and, well, we just do it

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.990
when someone tells us to do so.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:26.220
And if it works, it's great.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.710
If not, we just check the box.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.420
And those are very
two different things--

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.150
the quality of interactions
versus the quantity

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:33.080
of things that you do.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.420
Now, you can check all the
boxes for diversity training

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:36.300
that you have.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.770
But when you do the evaluation,
how valuable has it been?

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.190
What do people
report saying, this

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.940
is how my day-to-day activities
or role or leadership

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.980
has changed.

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.040
So how do we ask different
questions versus, did you

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.164
complete diversity training?

00:44:54.164 --> 00:44:55.580
AUDIENCE: I have
another question.

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.050
RAUL LEON: Absolutely.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:59.000
AUDIENCE: Is there
one thing that,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.540
in your experience with CDOs,
something that keeps them up

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.730
at night?

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:07.910
If you were to be voicing
maybe for a lot of CDOs,

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.090
do you think that there's
one topic or something that

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:13.164
might keep them up at night?

00:45:13.164 --> 00:45:14.580
RAUL LEON: Keep
them up at night--

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:18.920
I think by having been in a
few campuses as a student,

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:22.400
as a staff, as a faculty,
and by reading the news,

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:27.210
I think a lot of the CDOs are
kept at night by knowing that,

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:30.590
for instance, a racial
incident may occur at any time

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:35.060
in our campuses, knowing that
a graffiti or knowing that

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:38.660
message in a bathroom, or
knowing one that name-calling

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:42.170
on a campus road might be
something that totally triggers

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.230
the we-are-in-crisis response.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:48.060
And you're not prepared
to deal with that.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.740
And I think that that
could move back work

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.300
that you've done for years.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.630
It's something that probably
keeps you worried, because it's

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.580
sort of saying,
you know that you

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.340
have built a good foundation
with the institution when

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.650
you can respond to
these incidents in a way

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:07.580
that you truly know that is
not who the institution is,

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.260
but more important,
your students

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.860
know that, your faculty know
that, your staff knows that.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.520
If those things happen and
your students are not unsure

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.700
as to whether you even
support that or your faculty

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.800
are not unsure as to
whether you have devoted

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:25.340
enough time to that, a CDO
probably will be worried about,

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:29.900
how do I now spend time assuring
or reassuring the campus

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.260
that we care about this?

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.890
Well, campus or people
are going to need

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:36.530
evidence, are going
to need examples,

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.620
are going to need that, what
can I see in which I can

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.070
see this work has been done?

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.569
If they don't see that, I think
that's an area in which they

00:46:43.569 --> 00:46:44.570
will be worried.

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:47.630
And the other part is
that engaging people

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:49.340
beyond their staff.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.850
So we can have two things.

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.280
You have a very small office.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.930
So you need to
collaborate and try

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:57.080
to engage everyone around you to
move the diversity agenda, not

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.640
an ideal place.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.250
But also, if you
have a large office,

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:04.160
how do you engage those people
that now feel that, well, you

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.130
have a diversity officer
and a staff and teams,

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:10.020
diversity is no longer
my responsibility.

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.230
So how do you do
the dance between--

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:17.910
actually, it only works when
you take it as a priority,

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:20.940
whether there's a CDO or
whether there's no CDO.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.890
So I think those two
things are things

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:27.730
that all the campus that I talk
grapple with and sort of convey

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:29.800
and said, this is
happening today,

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.490
and it's totally causing--

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:38.160
not trouble, but just not moving
as fast as we would like to.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.980
And I will say that the purpose
of this presentation or sharing

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.400
this with you is that I
wanted to create the ability

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.077
or foster a little bit
of curiosity as to,

00:47:49.077 --> 00:47:51.160
how do you engage with
some of the activities that

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:55.420
were shown in the areas in
which you totally work today?

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.420
So if it's marketing,
if it's outreach,

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.790
if it's PR, if it's tours--

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.420
so I was really happy to see a
tour coming in the door today.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.850
But I'm thinking,
OK, how do you create

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:08.710
a pipeline from those tours?

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:12.000
What do those tours take back
once they go back to the places

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.480
or communities they represent?

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.970
It's sort of like actively
thinking about, well,

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:18.050
I am responsible
for doing tours.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:19.930
How do you move
it one more notch

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.570
to incorporate the
importance of diversity

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:25.820
when those tours are designed,
planned, implemented?

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:27.880
Who do they get to see
when they come here?

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.530
Who do they get to talk?

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.980
What do they get to talk about
once they reach these doors?

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.250
And I think being intentional
about our reflection

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.210
is powerful.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:39.160
And I think that's what
comes with leadership.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.870
And that's what comes
with experience.

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:43.000
And I think as you
move up, you realize

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.790
and start seeing spaces
in your organization

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:48.070
that you had a blind
side for before.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:50.110
You might be like, I
never considered this

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:51.520
as in this rank.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.450
But when you move
as a supervisor,

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.930
well, you should be able
to see those things.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.440
And now it's too
late to be like,

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.280
I never learned, so I'm just
going to go with what I know.

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.640
Well, this is the time in
which you build yourself

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.790
as a professional that
can truly build leadership

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:08.221
for those that come behind you.

00:49:08.221 --> 00:49:09.970
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming in.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:11.320
It was great to hear you speak.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.100
So a round of applause again.

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:13.600
Thank you.

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.290
RAUL LEON: Thank you.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:15.290
Thank you for having me.

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:18.000
[APPLAUSE]
