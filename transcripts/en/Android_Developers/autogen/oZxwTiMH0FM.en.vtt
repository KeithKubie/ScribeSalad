anyway so the Android auto soo framework
was designed to work out of the box is

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420
was designed to work out of the box is
 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.360
was designed to work out of the box is
the existing app without changing the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370
the existing app without changing the
 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.410
the existing app without changing the
apps to support it out of film we in

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420
apps to support it out of film we in
 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.230

fact for our Twitter demo we just get a

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240
fact for our Twitter demo we just get a
 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.850
fact for our Twitter demo we just get a
Twitter we just decided to it if you

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860
Twitter we just decided to it if you
 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.050
Twitter we just decided to it if you
can't read it app from the Google Play

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060
can't read it app from the Google Play
 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.640
can't read it app from the Google Play
Store and it just works without any

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650
Store and it just works without any
 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.740
Store and it just works without any
involvement for the Twitter developers

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750
involvement for the Twitter developers
 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.960
involvement for the Twitter developers
we hope it is going to be decades for

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970
we hope it is going to be decades for
 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.030
we hope it is going to be decades for
most apps but we still provide some

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040
most apps but we still provide some
 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.699
most apps but we still provide some
api's that you can use to make sure that

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709
api's that you can use to make sure that
 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.560
api's that you can use to make sure that
your app integrate integrates well with

these api's to make this work there's
 

00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:01.840
these api's to make this work there's
there's basically three steps involved

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:01.850
there's basically three steps involved
 

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.970
there's basically three steps involved
first thing you do is you request a

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:03.980
first thing you do is you request a
 

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.510
first thing you do is you request a
masked wallet and that shows the dialog

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520
masked wallet and that shows the dialog
 

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.100
masked wallet and that shows the dialog
similar to the one in the screenshot you

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:09.110
similar to the one in the screenshot you
 

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:10.930
similar to the one in the screenshot you
can see on the slide and this lets the

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:10.940
can see on the slide and this lets the
 

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.480
can see on the slide and this lets the
user pick a form of payment once they've

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:13.490
user pick a form of payment once they've
 

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:15.310
user pick a form of payment once they've
selected one you can handle the response

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320
selected one you can handle the response
 

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.169
selected one you can handle the response
from this and use that to present a

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:17.179
from this and use that to present a
 

00:22:17.179 --> 00:22:18.549
from this and use that to present a
final confirmation to your user

00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559
final confirmation to your user
 

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:20.470
final confirmation to your user
confirming the amount what they're going

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480
confirming the amount what they're going
 

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.330
confirming the amount what they're going
to be ordering and the method of payment

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:22.340
to be ordering and the method of payment
 

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.610
to be ordering and the method of payment
they selected and then once the user

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:24.620
they selected and then once the user
 

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.760
they selected and then once the user
confirms this you can request a full

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:27.770
confirms this you can request a full
 

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.250
confirms this you can request a full
wallet and what that does is that gives

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:30.260
wallet and what that does is that gives
 

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.110
wallet and what that does is that gives
you the credentials that you need to

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120
you the credentials that you need to
 

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.320
you the credentials that you need to
complete the transaction so that's it

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:35.330
complete the transaction so that's it
 

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:41.500
complete the transaction so that's it
for payment api's so in the first whole

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.210
back of in most cases rather than
extending backup agent directly you can

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:16.220
extending backup agent directly you can
 

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.910
extending backup agent directly you can
extend backup agent helper and use the

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:18.920
extend backup agent helper and use the
 

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.680
extend backup agent helper and use the
two included helpers that we've already

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:20.690
two included helpers that we've already
 

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.180
two included helpers that we've already
provided which are the shared

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.190
provided which are the shared
 

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:23.980
provided which are the shared
preferences backup helper for backing up

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:23.990
preferences backup helper for backing up
 

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.080
preferences backup helper for backing up
shared preferences and the file backup

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:26.090
shared preferences and the file backup
 

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.200
shared preferences and the file backup
helper for backing up files in the right

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:29.210
helper for backing up files in the right
 

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.970
helper for backing up files in the right
you can look at an example of what this

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:30.980
you can look at an example of what this
 

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.980
you can look at an example of what this
looks like basically in the oncreate

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:32.990
looks like basically in the oncreate
 

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.260
looks like basically in the oncreate
method of your backup agent helper you

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:35.270
method of your backup agent helper you
 

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.000
method of your backup agent helper you
can instantiate one of these helpers

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.010
can instantiate one of these helpers
 

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.320
can instantiate one of these helpers
with the name of the file that you want

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:38.330
with the name of the file that you want
 

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.970
with the name of the file that you want
to backup and then you call to add

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:39.980
to backup and then you call to add
 

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.490
to backup and then you call to add
helper method which adds this helper to

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:42.500
helper method which adds this helper to
 

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.950
helper method which adds this helper to
your backup agent helper if you need

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960
your backup agent helper if you need
 

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.990
your backup agent helper if you need
further control over versioning file

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000

portions or databases you can extend the
 

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:51.760

backup agent directly rather than using

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:51.770
backup agent directly rather than using
 

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:56.770
