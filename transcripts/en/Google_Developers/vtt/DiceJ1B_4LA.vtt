00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.940
We're excited to announce
Google's new Startup Launch

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.590
program.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.860
Our mission is to help
startups worldwide become

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.560
successful on the Google
Developers platform

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.781
and over open
source technologies.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.030
Startup Launch gives you all
of the tools and insights

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.140
you need all in one place.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.490
As a developer, it takes
a lot to build your app

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.910
and grow your business.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.510
But putting the
usual list aside,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.210
there's something more that
you might need-- a supportive

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.850
community built just
for you, an empowering

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.570
environment with global
events, supportive colleagues

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.766
and friends who
are here for you.

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.140
Learn everything
you need to know

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.650

app with free mentorships

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.470
and online training.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.230
Grow with UX reviews
from our team of mentors.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.950
And take advantage
of early access

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.490
to upcoming APIs, SDKs,
and product releases.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.690
With the right monetization and
distribution tools from Google,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.060
