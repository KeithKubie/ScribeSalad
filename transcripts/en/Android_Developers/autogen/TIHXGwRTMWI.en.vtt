hope you're right now so this talk is
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.249
hope you're right now so this talk is
all about themes of styles and we've

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
all about themes of styles and we've
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.630
all about themes of styles and we've
realized recently that there aren't that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
realized recently that there aren't that
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.789

many people who know it it's quite a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
many people who know it it's quite a
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.100
many people who know it it's quite a
dense topic and it there's lots of full

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
dense topic and it there's lots of full
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.420
dense topic and it there's lots of full
intricacies into it all

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
intricacies into it all
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.969
intricacies into it all
so before we drive this tour 2 won't

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979

give everyone like a level playing field

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
give everyone like a level playing field
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.240
give everyone like a level playing field
so before we actually go into like the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
so before we actually go into like the
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.190
so before we actually go into like the
guts of it all I thought we'd take a

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
guts of it all I thought we'd take a
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.660
guts of it all I thought we'd take a
quick refresher course and see what they

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670
quick refresher course and see what they
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.240
quick refresher course and see what they
actually are

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250
actually are
 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.770
actually are
so technically themes and styles are

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
so technically themes and styles are
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.169
so technically themes and styles are
exactly the same thing internally

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179
exactly the same thing internally
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.059
exactly the same thing internally
they're both declared using style tag so

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
they're both declared using style tag so
 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.440
they're both declared using style tag so
when your resources you create styles

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450
when your resources you create styles
 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.280
when your resources you create styles
and you'll notice that when you actually

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290
and you'll notice that when you actually
 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.690
and you'll notice that when you actually
create a theme you're still using the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700
create a theme you're still using the
 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.479
create a theme you're still using the
style tag the only difference between

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489
style tag the only difference between
 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.040
style tag the only difference between
them is how you use them in your

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050
them is how you use them in your
 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.550
them is how you use them in your
application and we'll talk about more

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560
application and we'll talk about more
 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.100
application and we'll talk about more
about that later so at the simplest

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110
about that later so at the simplest
 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.350
about that later so at the simplest
styles and themes good of the same thing

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360
styles and themes good of the same thing
 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.170
styles and themes good of the same thing
are just key value stores so here we've

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180
are just key value stores so here we've
 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.210
are just key value stores so here we've
got a very very simple style and you'll

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220
got a very very simple style and you'll
 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.280
got a very very simple style and you'll
notice that the actual key is the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290
notice that the actual key is the
 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.870
notice that the actual key is the
attribute so Android background in this

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880
attribute so Android background in this
 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.850
attribute so Android background in this
instance and then the value is color

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860
instance and then the value is color
 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.690
instance and then the value is color
blue so we've just mentioned the word

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700
blue so we've just mentioned the word
 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.280
blue so we've just mentioned the word
attributes there and they're the kind of

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290
attributes there and they're the kind of
 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.720
attributes there and they're the kind of
key to what themes the Styles are all

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730
key to what themes the Styles are all
 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.660
key to what themes the Styles are all
about now let's take a little quick look

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670
about now let's take a little quick look
 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.680
about now let's take a little quick look
at what they actually are and how they

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690
at what they actually are and how they
 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.800
at what they actually are and how they
work so as we mentioned attributes are

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810
work so as we mentioned attributes are
 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.710
work so as we mentioned attributes are
just keys they're declared in the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720
just keys they're declared in the
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.039
just keys they're declared in the
android framework and also in your apps

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049
android framework and also in your apps
 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.850
android framework and also in your apps
the important thing to know though is

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860
the important thing to know though is
 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.110
the important thing to know though is
that yes they are

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120
that yes they are
 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.000
that yes they are
keys but they also declare what type

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010
keys but they also declare what type
 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.220
keys but they also declare what type
that can be set against them and that's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230
that can be set against them and that's
 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.420
that can be set against them and that's
important because it affects how the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430
important because it affects how the
 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.400
important because it affects how the
data is stored so when the attribute is

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410
data is stored so when the attribute is
 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.380
data is stored so when the attribute is
read internally it can affect how the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390
read internally it can affect how the
 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.860
read internally it can affect how the
actual values read and it also affects

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870
actual values read and it also affects
 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.979
actual values read and it also affects
things like type conversion so the

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989
things like type conversion so the
 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.390
things like type conversion so the
system can actually convert between

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400
system can actually convert between
 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.680
system can actually convert between
types for you and because of that we can

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690
types for you and because of that we can
 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.479
types for you and because of that we can
do some XML linting based on this so

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489
do some XML linting based on this so
 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.890
do some XML linting based on this so
you're using an attribute with a wrong

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900
you're using an attribute with a wrong
 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.930
you're using an attribute with a wrong
type of value we can put that into lint

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940
type of value we can put that into lint
 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.400
type of value we can put that into lint
and we can store flag it to you and make

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410
and we can store flag it to you and make
 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.090
and we can store flag it to you and make
sure we're not going to shoot yourself

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100
sure we're not going to shoot yourself
 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.960
sure we're not going to shoot yourself
in the foot so these are types of

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970
in the foot so these are types of
 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.340
in the foot so these are types of
attributes that you can format types

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350
attributes that you can format types
 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.170
attributes that you can format types
that you can put on attributes the ones

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
that you can put on attributes the ones
 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.300
that you can put on attributes the ones
on the left are all resource types so

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310
on the left are all resource types so
 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.490
on the left are all resource types so
they directly map to a resource type

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500
they directly map to a resource type
 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.840
they directly map to a resource type
that you can set in your resources so

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850
that you can set in your resources so
 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.330
that you can set in your resources so
things like fraction flow string blah

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340
things like fraction flow string blah
 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.970
things like fraction flow string blah
blah the ones on the right are special

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980
blah the ones on the right are special
 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.530
blah the ones on the right are special
in that they are only used for

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540
in that they are only used for
 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.740
in that they are only used for
attributes flag is what exactly it

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750
attributes flag is what exactly it
 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.990
attributes flag is what exactly it
sounds like it's a bit all so you can

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000
sounds like it's a bit all so you can
 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.640
sounds like it's a bit all so you can
have multiple facts bit sort against

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650
have multiple facts bit sort against
 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.069
have multiple facts bit sort against
each other and then the second is enum

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079
each other and then the second is enum
 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.839
each other and then the second is enum
which is Zachary is it's an enumeration

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849
which is Zachary is it's an enumeration
 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.220
which is Zachary is it's an enumeration
of int you're going to get one value

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230
of int you're going to get one value
 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.890
of int you're going to get one value
back and then you've got the last one

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900
back and then you've got the last one
 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.809
back and then you've got the last one
which is reference and that's kind of a

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819
which is reference and that's kind of a
 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.030
which is reference and that's kind of a
catch-all for everything else so

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040
catch-all for everything else so
 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.530
catch-all for everything else so
drawable uses this it could be don't

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540
drawable uses this it could be don't
 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.180
drawable uses this it could be don't
have a drawable type but basically it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190
have a drawable type but basically it
 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.800
have a drawable type but basically it
just points to another resource it

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810
just points to another resource it
 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.879
just points to another resource it
points to a resource ID

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889
 
 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.069
 
so how you actually declare attributes

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079
so how you actually declare attributes
 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.649
so how you actually declare attributes
is like this using the actual tag again

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659
is like this using the actual tag again
 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.320
is like this using the actual tag again
in your resources so everyone's quite

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330
in your resources so everyone's quite
 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.059
in your resources so everyone's quite
inside each other and here you can see

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.069
inside each other and here you can see
 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.040
inside each other and here you can see
that there are two things you set the

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050
that there are two things you set the
 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.290
that there are two things you set the
first is the name so this is the actual

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300
first is the name so this is the actual
 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.480
first is the name so this is the actual
declaration for Android background using

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490
declaration for Android background using
 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.399
declaration for Android background using
the framework so it has a name of

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409
the framework so it has a name of
 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.959
the framework so it has a name of
background and then it declares its type

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:37.969
background and then it declares its type
 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.320
background and then it declares its type
its format it had it can accept two

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330
its format it had it can accept two
 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.290
its format it had it can accept two
types reference and color reference

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300
types reference and color reference
 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.749
types reference and color reference
occurs it expects a drawable and color

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759
occurs it expects a drawable and color
 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.010
occurs it expects a drawable and color
because as we said earlier it can do

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020
because as we said earlier it can do
 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.959
because as we said earlier it can do
type conversion so what will happen is

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:49.969
type conversion so what will happen is
 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:51.459
type conversion so what will happen is
it can accept a color in like an in

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:51.469
it can accept a color in like an in
 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:53.200
it can accept a color in like an in
value and then the system will

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210
value and then the system will
 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.820
value and then the system will
automatically change that into a color

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830
automatically change that into a color
 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.350
automatically change that into a color
drawable for you so that's the type

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360
drawable for you so that's the type
 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.159
drawable for you so that's the type
conversion we talked about earlier so

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169
conversion we talked about earlier so
 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.929
conversion we talked about earlier so
all attributes provided by the framework

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:01.939
all attributes provided by the framework
 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.089
all attributes provided by the framework
are in the android schema which is why a

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099
are in the android schema which is why a
 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:05.649
are in the android schema which is why a
type of all of your layouts you have to

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659
type of all of your layouts you have to
 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.559
type of all of your layouts you have to
declare this namespace

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569
declare this namespace
 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.300
declare this namespace
now the actual Android the name for the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310
now the actual Android the name for the
 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.740
now the actual Android the name for the
namespace in this case Android which is

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750
namespace in this case Android which is
 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.110
namespace in this case Android which is
in bold is just a convention you don't

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120
in bold is just a convention you don't
 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.490
in bold is just a convention you don't
have to use this you can name it

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500
have to use this you can name it
 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.980
have to use this you can name it
whatever you want but I advise you to

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990
whatever you want but I advise you to
 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.260
whatever you want but I advise you to
keep using this clear clearly sort of

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270
keep using this clear clearly sort of
 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.670
keep using this clear clearly sort of
separates what are your attributes and

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680
separates what are your attributes and
 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.420
separates what are your attributes and
what androids attributes you can also

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430
what androids attributes you can also
 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.490
what androids attributes you can also
declare custom attributes in your app

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500
declare custom attributes in your app
 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.769
declare custom attributes in your app
and indeed are you're probably already

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779
and indeed are you're probably already
 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.540
and indeed are you're probably already
using libraries which declare their own

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550
using libraries which declare their own
 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.999
using libraries which declare their own
attributes now it's important to know

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009
attributes now it's important to know
 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.950
attributes now it's important to know
that all attributes that are declared in

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960
that all attributes that are declared in
 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.930
that all attributes that are declared in
your app so even libraries or in like a

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940
your app so even libraries or in like a
 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.450
your app so even libraries or in like a
global namespace now what that

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460
global namespace now what that
 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.159
global namespace now what that
practically means is that if two

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169
practically means is that if two
 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.249
practically means is that if two
libraries or two basic that there are

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259
libraries or two basic that there are
 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.959
libraries or two basic that there are
two declarations of the same attribute

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969
two declarations of the same attribute
 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:48.730
two declarations of the same attribute
name in your app your app won't build

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740
name in your app your app won't build
 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.649
name in your app your app won't build
because you'll get a conflict so it's

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659
because you'll get a conflict so it's
 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:55.209
because you'll get a conflict so it's
something to be careful about and I just

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:55.219
something to be careful about and I just
 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:57.219
something to be careful about and I just
mentioned any attributes which are

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229
mentioned any attributes which are
 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.540
mentioned any attributes which are
created in your app or in your apps

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550
created in your app or in your apps
 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.089
created in your app or in your apps
namespace so instead of declaring the

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099
namespace so instead of declaring the
 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.740
namespace so instead of declaring the
Android namespace you declare your apps

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750
Android namespace you declare your apps
 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.800
Android namespace you declare your apps
one now you do that via this syntax and

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810
one now you do that via this syntax and
 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.439
one now you do that via this syntax and
you insert your package name now we know

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449
you insert your package name now we know
 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.269
you insert your package name now we know
that's slightly clumsy to use so the

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:10.279
that's slightly clumsy to use so the
 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.820
that's slightly clumsy to use so the
tools have a quick shortcut so instead

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830
tools have a quick shortcut so instead
 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.740
tools have a quick shortcut so instead
of actually putting the slash your

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750
of actually putting the slash your
 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.629
of actually putting the slash your
package name it just do res Auto and it

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639
package name it just do res Auto and it
 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.249
package name it just do res Auto and it
will do all the hard work for you so

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259
will do all the hard work for you so
 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:22.809
will do all the hard work for you so
we've just talked about what they are

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819
we've just talked about what they are
 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.369
we've just talked about what they are
and now let's talk about the differences

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379
and now let's talk about the differences
 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:28.059
and now let's talk about the differences
and how you actually use them so themes

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:28.069
and how you actually use them so themes
 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:30.780
and how you actually use them so themes
now themes are tied to your context

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790
now themes are tied to your context
 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.170
now themes are tied to your context
which is why it takes two methods it has

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180
which is why it takes two methods it has
 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.850
which is why it takes two methods it has
two methods on the Contacts one god set

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860
two methods on the Contacts one god set
 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.740
two methods on the Contacts one god set
theme which takes a resource ID point

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750
theme which takes a resource ID point
 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.690
theme which takes a resource ID point
into a style and as one thing to note

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700
into a style and as one thing to note
 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.610
into a style and as one thing to note
here it's a kind of a babbling named

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620
here it's a kind of a babbling named
 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.710
here it's a kind of a babbling named
method in that it doesn't set it applies

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720
method in that it doesn't set it applies
 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.410
method in that it doesn't set it applies
so you're you already have a theme and

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:46.420
so you're you already have a theme and
 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.060
so you're you already have a theme and
your activity and then when you call

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070
your activity and then when you call
 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.920
your activity and then when you call
this method it will apply on top it

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930
this method it will apply on top it
 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.880
this method it will apply on top it
doesn't actually wipe anything

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:50.890
doesn't actually wipe anything
 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.010
doesn't actually wipe anything
underneath and they have a get theme

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020
underneath and they have a get theme
 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.540
underneath and they have a get theme
which will return an instance of the

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550
which will return an instance of the
 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.090
which will return an instance of the
current theme now you're typically set

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100
current theme now you're typically set
 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.920
current theme now you're typically set
themed in your Android manifest so

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930
themed in your Android manifest so
 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.480
themed in your Android manifest so
you'll set it in what the Android tag or

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490
you'll set it in what the Android tag or
 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.850
you'll set it in what the Android tag or
whatever it is now internally all that

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860
whatever it is now internally all that
 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.560
whatever it is now internally all that
does is just before your oncreate is

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570
does is just before your oncreate is
 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.870
does is just before your oncreate is
called it will call set theme for you so

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880
called it will call set theme for you so
 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.100
called it will call set theme for you so
it's exactly the same api's with the

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110
it's exactly the same api's with the
 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.210
it's exactly the same api's with the
framework of calling now themes don't

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:12.220
framework of calling now themes don't
 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.490
framework of calling now themes don't
actually do really do anything I like to

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500
actually do really do anything I like to
 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.600
actually do really do anything I like to
think there's a lot big configuration

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.610
think there's a lot big configuration
 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.300
think there's a lot big configuration
stores everything else so let's take a

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310
stores everything else so let's take a
 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.290
stores everything else so let's take a
look at some of the things which are

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300
look at some of the things which are
 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.960
look at some of the things which are
actually in there and how what kind of

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:21.970
actually in there and how what kind of
 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.660
actually in there and how what kind of
configuration things are on so the first

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:24.670
configuration things are on so the first
 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.630
configuration things are on so the first
thing is default widget Styles so when

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:27.640
thing is default widget Styles so when
 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.670
thing is default widget Styles so when
you create a widget in your layout say

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680
you create a widget in your layout say
 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.370
you create a widget in your layout say
edit text it will have a default style

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.380
edit text it will have a default style
 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.530
edit text it will have a default style
applied to it and the way it finds out

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:34.540
applied to it and the way it finds out
 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.360
applied to it and the way it finds out
what that default style is is from your

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.370
what that default style is is from your
 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.360
what that default style is is from your
theme now each different widget has a

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.370
theme now each different widget has a
 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.650
theme now each different widget has a
different attribute for its default

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:40.660
different attribute for its default
 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.080
different attribute for its default
style and edit text is called edit text

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.090
style and edit text is called edit text
 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.880
style and edit text is called edit text
style text view is called text view

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:44.890
style text view is called text view
 

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.000
style text view is called text view
style you get the idea but yeah so

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.010
style you get the idea but yeah so
 

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.270
style you get the idea but yeah so
that's the default style we have some

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280
that's the default style we have some
 

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.790
that's the default style we have some
color values there are the ones you'll

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800
color values there are the ones you'll
 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.310
color values there are the ones you'll
probably mostly use of a tech colors so

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:56.320
probably mostly use of a tech colors so
 

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.930
probably mostly use of a tech colors so
it's cooler primary secondary tertiary

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:57.940
it's cooler primary secondary tertiary
 

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.460
it's cooler primary secondary tertiary
Allen's good talk more about these later

00:07:59.460 --> 00:07:59.470
Allen's good talk more about these later
 

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.820
Allen's good talk more about these later
but there are others to expierence

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:02.830
but there are others to expierence
 

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:03.750
but there are others to expierence
styles

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:03.760
styles
 

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.980
styles
so again Allen's gonna talk about

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:04.990
so again Allen's gonna talk about
 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.480
so again Allen's gonna talk about
expierences but they're basically mini

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:06.490
expierences but they're basically mini
 

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.320
expierences but they're basically mini
styles which affect only text now this

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.330
styles which affect only text now this
 

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.180
styles which affect only text now this
is where I think the bulk of stuff is in

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:12.190
is where I think the bulk of stuff is in
 

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.250
is where I think the bulk of stuff is in
themes and that is window configuration

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:14.260
themes and that is window configuration
 

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.590
themes and that is window configuration
values so when your activities created

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:16.600
values so when your activities created
 

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.110
values so when your activities created
and your dialog a window is created for

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120
and your dialog a window is created for
 

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.720
and your dialog a window is created for
you internally and that is where your

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:21.730
you internally and that is where your
 

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.600
you internally and that is where your
whole view hierarchy sits and above that

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:24.610
whole view hierarchy sits and above that
 

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.060
whole view hierarchy sits and above that
is a lot of framework stuff so if you're

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.070
is a lot of framework stuff so if you're
 

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.830
is a lot of framework stuff so if you're
using an action bar it will inject a

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840
using an action bar it will inject a
 

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.960
using an action bar it will inject a
load of views for the action bar and

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:30.970
load of views for the action bar and
 

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.719
load of views for the action bar and
this is so all the configuration values

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:33.729
this is so all the configuration values
 

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:35.940
this is so all the configuration values
and your theme is how that affects it so

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:35.950
and your theme is how that affects it so
 

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.140
and your theme is how that affects it so
there's also stuff like window

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:37.150
there's also stuff like window
 

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.980
there's also stuff like window
transitions all that kind of things then

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:40.990
transitions all that kind of things then
 

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.660
transitions all that kind of things then
we have to draw balls wouldn't be nice

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:42.670
we have to draw balls wouldn't be nice
 

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.029
we have to draw balls wouldn't be nice

the Shelf handy troubles to use and we

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:45.990
the Shelf handy troubles to use and we
 

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.499
the Shelf handy troubles to use and we
do the most important I think is

00:08:48.499 --> 00:08:48.509
do the most important I think is
 

00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:50.720
do the most important I think is
selectable item background that will

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:50.730
selectable item background that will
 

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.819
selectable item background that will
give you a really nice drawable to use

00:08:52.819 --> 00:08:52.829
give you a really nice drawable to use
 

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:54.110
give you a really nice drawable to use
as a background for a review it like a

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120
as a background for a review it like a
 

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.790
as a background for a review it like a
clickable view and you'll I'll give you

then lastly is a section a section we

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:04.649
then lastly is a section a section we
 

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:06.410
then lastly is a section a section we
call theme section I'm going to talk

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.420
call theme section I'm going to talk
 

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.569
call theme section I'm going to talk
more about this later but it's basically

00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:08.579
more about this later but it's basically
 

00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:09.800
more about this later but it's basically
there are certain components when

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:09.810
there are certain components when
 

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.420
there are certain components when
created allow you to override their

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:11.430
created allow you to override their
 

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.189
created allow you to override their
theme and they'll pick it out from your

00:09:13.189 --> 00:09:13.199
theme and they'll pick it out from your
 

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:16.850
theme and they'll pick it out from your
master theme in your activity right so

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860
master theme in your activity right so
 

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.079
master theme in your activity right so
that steams out the way it's talk about

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:18.089
that steams out the way it's talk about
 

00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:20.870
that steams out the way it's talk about
styles now stars do a lot and they're

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880
styles now stars do a lot and they're
 

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.009
styles now stars do a lot and they're
the things that did the bulk of the work

00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:22.019
the things that did the bulk of the work
 

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:24.290
the things that did the bulk of the work
when styling your views they're really

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300
when styling your views they're really
 

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.220
when styling your views they're really
handy for the sort of dignity

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:25.230
handy for the sort of dignity
 

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.139
handy for the sort of dignity
composition of common styling so you can

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:27.149
composition of common styling so you can
 

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:30.889
composition of common styling so you can
reuse stuff across different views look

00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:30.899
reuse stuff across different views look
 

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:35.120
reuse stuff across different views look
an example so here we have a view and we

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.130
an example so here we have a view and we
 

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.370
an example so here we have a view and we
want to reuse this background tag now

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380
want to reuse this background tag now
 

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.360
want to reuse this background tag now
this is kind of a trivial example

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:38.370
this is kind of a trivial example
 

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.829
this is kind of a trivial example
because you're right you're only reusing

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839
because you're right you're only reusing
 

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:41.900
because you're right you're only reusing
one thing you wouldn't usually do this

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:41.910
one thing you wouldn't usually do this
 

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.120
one thing you wouldn't usually do this
you probably reuse three or four but it

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.130
you probably reuse three or four but it
 

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.920
you probably reuse three or four but it
is a bit of a wheel deal and we'll do

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:45.930
is a bit of a wheel deal and we'll do
 

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.900
is a bit of a wheel deal and we'll do
example if we do more so we're going to

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:47.910
example if we do more so we're going to
 

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.379
example if we do more so we're going to
reuse these background tag so here's

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:51.389
reuse these background tag so here's
 

00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:52.610
reuse these background tag so here's
that style for it so we'll create a

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.620
that style for it so we'll create a
 

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.350
that style for it so we'll create a
style and then we'll give you an we'll

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360
style and then we'll give you an we'll
 

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.309
style and then we'll give you an we'll
put an item in there

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:55.319
put an item in there
 

00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:57.199
put an item in there
point into the attribute it's the name

00:09:57.199 --> 00:09:57.209
point into the attribute it's the name
 

00:09:57.209 --> 00:09:59.300
point into the attribute it's the name
and then we'll put our value within it

00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.310
and then we'll put our value within it
 

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.730
and then we'll put our value within it
now each out suite you set goes into the

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740
now each out suite you set goes into the
 

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.730
now each out suite you set goes into the
art intact then once we've done that we

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740
art intact then once we've done that we
 

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.530
art intact then once we've done that we
can go back to our layout and swap the

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540
can go back to our layout and swap the
 

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.540
can go back to our layout and swap the
Android background and replace it with a

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:11.550
Android background and replace it with a
 

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.550
Android background and replace it with a
style tag pointing to the style now if

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560
style tag pointing to the style now if
 

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.689
style tag pointing to the style now if
you've got more items in that style

00:10:14.689 --> 00:10:14.699
you've got more items in that style
 

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:18.769
you've got more items in that style
that'll be applied to bit of a pro tip

00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:18.779
that'll be applied to bit of a pro tip
 

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:21.079
that'll be applied to bit of a pro tip
for you Android studio does that whole

for you Android studio does that whole
 

00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:23.269
for you Android studio does that whole
flow for you in a really nice way if you

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279
flow for you in a really nice way if you
 

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:25.250
flow for you in a really nice way if you
go to the design tab when you're looking

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260
go to the design tab when you're looking
 

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.199
go to the design tab when you're looking
at a layout and right click on a view go

refactor refactor style it gives you a

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880
refactor refactor style it gives you a
 

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.460
refactor refactor style it gives you a
nozzle UI where you can like pull out

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:31.470
nozzle UI where you can like pull out
 

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.590
nozzle UI where you can like pull out
attributes and put them into a style it

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600
attributes and put them into a style it
 

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.929
attributes and put them into a style it
will do all for you but the or very good

00:10:35.929 --> 00:10:35.939
will do all for you but the or very good
 

00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:37.220
will do all for you but the or very good
thing it does is that it will try and

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:37.230
thing it does is that it will try and
 

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.750
thing it does is that it will try and
find other views in your layout and then

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760
find other views in your layout and then
 

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.400
find other views in your layout and then
automatically reuse the style it's

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:40.410
automatically reuse the style it's
 

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.269
automatically reuse the style it's
pretty cool so hopefully now you know

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279
pretty cool so hopefully now you know
 

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:46.009
pretty cool so hopefully now you know
the difference between themes and styles

00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019
the difference between themes and styles
 

00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:47.420
the difference between themes and styles
let's have a look at sort of the

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:47.430
let's have a look at sort of the
 

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.269
let's have a look at sort of the
intricacies are actually creating them

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279
intricacies are actually creating them
 

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:51.319
intricacies are actually creating them
so one of the things that you can do

00:10:51.319 --> 00:10:51.329
so one of the things that you can do
 

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:53.150
so one of the things that you can do
with files is that they support

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160
with files is that they support
 

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.639
with files is that they support
inheritance now themes and styles can

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:55.649
inheritance now themes and styles can
 

00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:57.030
inheritance now themes and styles can
have from each other which

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040
have from each other which
 

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.079
have from each other which
handy for when your clients of

00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:58.089
handy for when your clients of
 

00:10:58.089 --> 00:10:59.699
handy for when your clients of
derivative styles and you'll see there's

00:10:59.699 --> 00:10:59.709
derivative styles and you'll see there's
 

00:10:59.709 --> 00:11:01.650
derivative styles and you'll see there's
ample in a minute the important thing to

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:01.660
ample in a minute the important thing to
 

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.949
ample in a minute the important thing to
know it is that they overlay each other

00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959
know it is that they overlay each other
 

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:05.879
know it is that they overlay each other
there are a couple of ways of

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:05.889
there are a couple of ways of
 

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:08.009
there are a couple of ways of
implementing inheritance and styles the

00:11:08.009 --> 00:11:08.019
implementing inheritance and styles the
 

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:10.079
implementing inheritance and styles the
first is implicitly using the dot

00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:10.089
first is implicitly using the dot
 

00:11:10.089 --> 00:11:13.610
first is implicitly using the dot
notation so the parent here would be

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620
notation so the parent here would be
 

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.840
notation so the parent here would be
would you dump it tear it off button so

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:15.850
would you dump it tear it off button so
 

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.280
would you dump it tear it off button so
it's the star before the proceeding dot

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:19.290
it's the star before the proceeding dot
 

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.840
it's the star before the proceeding dot
you can also do it explicitly and that's

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:21.850
you can also do it explicitly and that's
 

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.059
you can also do it explicitly and that's
done for the parent tag so here we've

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:24.069
done for the parent tag so here we've
 

00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:25.800
done for the parent tag so here we've
got a star called my button style and it

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:25.810
got a star called my button style and it
 

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.650
got a star called my button style and it
has set an explicit parent and as you'd

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:28.660
has set an explicit parent and as you'd
 

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.769
has set an explicit parent and as you'd
guess the parent is what you've set

00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:30.779
guess the parent is what you've set
 

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:33.480
guess the parent is what you've set
there's a small gotcha in that the X

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.490
there's a small gotcha in that the X
 

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.540
there's a small gotcha in that the X
explicit Y always means I'd be implicit

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:36.550
explicit Y always means I'd be implicit
 

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.370
explicit Y always means I'd be implicit
so we've got style here which is using

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:38.380
so we've got style here which is using
 

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.139
so we've got style here which is using
by from dot notation as then in the name

00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:40.149
by from dot notation as then in the name
 

00:11:40.149 --> 00:11:42.660
by from dot notation as then in the name
but also has a parent tag and the

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:42.670
but also has a parent tag and the
 

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:47.610
but also has a parent tag and the
explicit version always wins now the

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:47.620
explicit version always wins now the
 

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.990
explicit version always wins now the
really powerful thing when using Styles

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.000
really powerful thing when using Styles
 

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.519
really powerful thing when using Styles
is that you can reference values from

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:50.529
is that you can reference values from
 

00:11:50.529 --> 00:11:53.280
is that you can reference values from
your theme that's that in attribute

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.290
your theme that's that in attribute
 

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.079
your theme that's that in attribute
thing we're talking about earlier so

00:11:55.079 --> 00:11:55.089
thing we're talking about earlier so
 

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.249
thing we're talking about earlier so
here we go back to our style that we

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:56.259
here we go back to our style that we
 

00:11:56.259 --> 00:11:58.470
here we go back to our style that we
created which sets a background to my

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480
created which sets a background to my
 

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.449
created which sets a background to my
Deauville and instead of using that we

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:00.459
Deauville and instead of using that we
 

00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:02.490
Deauville and instead of using that we
want to use this set of lights and

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:02.500
want to use this set of lights and
 

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.809
want to use this set of lights and
background which we talked about earlier

00:12:03.809 --> 00:12:03.819
background which we talked about earlier
 

00:12:03.819 --> 00:12:06.559
background which we talked about earlier
which is that nods clickable highlight

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:06.569
which is that nods clickable highlight
 

00:12:06.569 --> 00:12:09.030
which is that nods clickable highlight
so this is the syntax you use so that's

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040
so this is the syntax you use so that's
 

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.290
so this is the syntax you use so that's
break that down low because it looks a

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:10.300
break that down low because it looks a
 

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.050
break that down low because it looks a
bit a little bit alien so let's break it

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:13.060
bit a little bit alien so let's break it
 

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.970
bit a little bit alien so let's break it
down first thing is the question mark

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:14.980
down first thing is the question mark
 

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.680
down first thing is the question mark
now that denotes that we're going to be

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:16.690
now that denotes that we're going to be
 

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.400
now that denotes that we're going to be
doing a theme locker the second bit the

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:20.410
doing a theme locker the second bit the
 

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.439
doing a theme locker the second bit the
Android colon is the namespace we're

00:12:22.439 --> 00:12:22.449
Android colon is the namespace we're
 

00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:23.819
Android colon is the namespace we're
going to be looking up so the name of

00:12:23.819 --> 00:12:23.829
going to be looking up so the name of
 

00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:25.319
going to be looking up so the name of
the app that the length space that the

00:12:25.319 --> 00:12:25.329
the app that the length space that the
 

00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:28.439
the app that the length space that the
attribute is in so if you're using the

00:12:28.439 --> 00:12:28.449
attribute is in so if you're using the
 

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:29.550
attribute is in so if you're using the
custom attribute you can put whatever

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560
custom attribute you can put whatever
 

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.110
custom attribute you can put whatever
add for you whatever the name spatial

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120
add for you whatever the name spatial
 

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.840
add for you whatever the name spatial
setting to then we have an actress slash

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:33.850
setting to then we have an actress slash
 

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.730
setting to then we have an actress slash
now that's in notes the type of thing

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:35.740
now that's in notes the type of thing
 

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.439
now that's in notes the type of thing
we're going to be looking up now into

00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:37.449
we're going to be looking up now into
 

00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:39.059
we're going to be looking up now into
Android fashion we only have one type

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:39.069
Android fashion we only have one type
 

00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:41.490
Android fashion we only have one type
which is that actress so you can

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:41.500
which is that actress so you can
 

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.660
which is that actress so you can
actually emit this which we'll see in a

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:42.670
actually emit this which we'll see in a
 

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.179
actually emit this which we'll see in a
minute and then we have the last bit

00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:45.189
minute and then we have the last bit
 

00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:46.110
minute and then we have the last bit
which is the actual name of the

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120
which is the actual name of the
 

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.840
which is the actual name of the
attribute were going to be looking up

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:47.850
attribute were going to be looking up
 

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.550
attribute were going to be looking up
now as I said the type is optional which

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560
now as I said the type is optional which
 

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.900
now as I said the type is optional which
is probably why you've seen this syntax

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:51.910
is probably why you've seen this syntax
 

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.720
is probably why you've seen this syntax
so the actual slash is emitted it was

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:54.730
so the actual slash is emitted it was
 

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.590
so the actual slash is emitted it was
the same so now I'm gonna hand over to

00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:58.600
the same so now I'm gonna hand over to
 

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.100
the same so now I'm gonna hand over to
Alan to go through theme dot material

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:01.110

thanks Chris so Chris just gave you the

00:13:04.319 --> 00:13:04.329
thanks Chris so Chris just gave you the
 

00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:06.300
thanks Chris so Chris just gave you the
technical side of what is a theme what

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:06.310
technical side of what is a theme what
 

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.280
technical side of what is a theme what
is a style and how do we create them so

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:08.290
is a style and how do we create them so
 

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.560
is a style and how do we create them so
we're gonna go hands-on

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:09.570
we're gonna go hands-on
 

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.660
we're gonna go hands-on
with some of the material styles to

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:11.670
with some of the material styles to
 

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.790
with some of the material styles to
learn what we have is a base of building

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800
learn what we have is a base of building
 

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.980
learn what we have is a base of building
blocks for our own styles and how we can

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:15.990
blocks for our own styles and how we can
 

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.460
blocks for our own styles and how we can
apply these in practice all right so

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:19.470
apply these in practice all right so
 

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.310
apply these in practice all right so
first we have themes themes in Android

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320
first we have themes themes in Android
 

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.250
first we have themes themes in Android
are prefixed with theme dot in material

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260
are prefixed with theme dot in material
 

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.890
are prefixed with theme dot in material
its theme material so everyone should be

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:27.900
its theme material so everyone should be
 

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.210
its theme material so everyone should be
familiar with these we've got the

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220
familiar with these we've got the
 

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.430
familiar with these we've got the
material dark theme we have themes that

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440
material dark theme we have themes that
 

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.950
material dark theme we have themes that
have window attributes for dialogues and

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:33.960
have window attributes for dialogues and
 

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.540
have window attributes for dialogues and
of course we have themes that do some

so that we get those drawables at each

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:44.850
so that we get those drawables at each
 

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.990
so that we get those drawables at each
progress point so while we're here

something unusual about our widget
Styles and this is that the Lite themes

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820
Styles and this is that the Lite themes
 

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.140
Styles and this is that the Lite themes
and dark themes are identical so our

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:00.150
and dark themes are identical so our
 

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.570
and dark themes are identical so our
Lite themes typically just inherit

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:01.580
Lite themes typically just inherit
 

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.650
Lite themes typically just inherit
directly from the default themes and

directly from the default themes and
 

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.890
directly from the default themes and
don't redefine anything but under

don't redefine anything but under
 

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.630
don't redefine anything but under
different parent themes so if your

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640
different parent themes so if your
 

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.360
different parent themes so if your
activity is light or dark you're still

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:11.370
activity is light or dark you're still
 

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.340
activity is light or dark you're still
going to get correctly colored widgets

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:13.350

how do we do that well as Chris

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760
how do we do that well as Chris
 

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.819
how do we do that well as Chris
mentioned we have colors defined by the

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:19.829
mentioned we have colors defined by the
 

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.579
mentioned we have colors defined by the

themes and we're going to use these in
 

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.980
themes and we're going to use these in
the widgets so this allows really

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:24.990
the widgets so this allows really
 

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.750
the widgets so this allows really
high-level styling of what things look

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760
high-level styling of what things look
 

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.580

for the colored button that we just

00:17:48.739 --> 00:17:48.749
for the colored button that we just
 

00:17:48.749 --> 00:17:51.259
for the colored button that we just
showed we have a background that points

00:17:51.259 --> 00:17:51.269
showed we have a background that points
 

00:17:51.269 --> 00:17:54.229
showed we have a background that points
to a drawable in that drawable which is

00:17:54.229 --> 00:17:54.239
to a drawable in that drawable which is
 

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:55.999
to a drawable in that drawable which is
just a ripple wrapping a rounded rect

00:17:55.999 --> 00:17:56.009
just a ripple wrapping a rounded rect
 

00:17:56.009 --> 00:17:57.710
just a ripple wrapping a rounded rect
shape we actually don't use PNG s

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720
shape we actually don't use PNG s
 

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.009
shape we actually don't use PNG s
anymore we have a tint and that tint

00:18:01.009 --> 00:18:01.019
anymore we have a tint and that tint
 

00:18:01.019 --> 00:18:03.979
anymore we have a tint and that tint
points to a color state list and that

00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:03.989
points to a color state list and that
 

00:18:03.989 --> 00:18:06.859
points to a color state list and that
color state list has an enabled and a

00:18:06.859 --> 00:18:06.869

two color accents so when you see that

00:18:12.229 --> 00:18:12.239
two color accents so when you see that
 

00:18:12.239 --> 00:18:14.269
two color accents so when you see that
colored button the default color is

00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:14.279
colored button the default color is
 

00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:17.570
colored button the default color is
going to be color accent tint on a white

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580
going to be color accent tint on a white
 

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.960
going to be color accent tint on a white
shape drawable wrapped with a ripple so

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:20.970
shape drawable wrapped with a ripple so

let's talk a little bit more about theme

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320
let's talk a little bit more about theme
 

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.979
let's talk a little bit more about theme
colors we also have foreground and

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:24.989
colors we also have foreground and
 

00:18:24.989 --> 00:18:27.169
colors we also have foreground and
background colors so these are going to

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:27.179
background colors so these are going to
 

00:18:27.179 --> 00:18:29.479
background colors so these are going to
be white and black or black and white

00:18:29.479 --> 00:18:29.489
be white and black or black and white
 

00:18:29.489 --> 00:18:31.460
be white and black or black and white
respectively for the light and dark

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:31.470
respectively for the light and dark
 

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.340
respectively for the light and dark
themes and what good does this actually

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:34.350
themes and what good does this actually
 

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.009
themes and what good does this actually
do us here you may not be using flat

00:18:37.009 --> 00:18:37.019
do us here you may not be using flat
 

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:39.049
do us here you may not be using flat
black or flat white in your application

00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059
black or flat white in your application
 

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:42.440

a lot well let's take the switch for an

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:42.450
a lot well let's take the switch for an
 

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.960
a lot well let's take the switch for an
example so the switch has a couple of

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:44.970
example so the switch has a couple of
 

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.419
example so the switch has a couple of
different colors and we could have

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:47.429
different colors and we could have
 

00:18:47.429 --> 00:18:49.940
different colors and we could have
defined theme attributes for switch

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:49.950
defined theme attributes for switch
 

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.519
defined theme attributes for switch
foreground switch background and they're

00:18:52.519 --> 00:18:52.529
foreground switch background and they're
 

00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:54.680
foreground switch background and they're
all basically just variations on white

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:54.690
all basically just variations on white
 

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.070
all basically just variations on white
or black so let's dig into the XML for

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080
or black so let's dig into the XML for
 

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.609
or black so let's dig into the XML for
this the switch track is defined as a

00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:01.619
this the switch track is defined as a
 

00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:03.680
this the switch track is defined as a
rounded rect shape again we don't really

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:03.690
rounded rect shape again we don't really
 

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.190
rounded rect shape again we don't really
use p.m. G's and it points to a color

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200
use p.m. G's and it points to a color
 

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.190
use p.m. G's and it points to a color
state list for its tint in the enabled

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200
state list for its tint in the enabled
 

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.799
state list for its tint in the enabled
States this is going to be a dropped

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:12.809
States this is going to be a dropped
 

00:19:12.809 --> 00:19:15.229
States this is going to be a dropped
alpha sorry in the disabled state this

00:19:15.229 --> 00:19:15.239
alpha sorry in the disabled state this
 

00:19:15.239 --> 00:19:17.239
alpha sorry in the disabled state this
is going to inherit the disabled alpha

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:17.249
is going to inherit the disabled alpha
 

00:19:17.249 --> 00:19:19.460
is going to inherit the disabled alpha
from the theme which varies based on

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:19.470
from the theme which varies based on
 

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.960
from the theme which varies based on
light or dark theme and it's going to

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:20.970
light or dark theme and it's going to
 

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.720
light or dark theme and it's going to
use the foreground color so in the dark

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:23.730
use the foreground color so in the dark
 

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.359
use the foreground color so in the dark
theme you have a dropped alpha version

00:19:26.359 --> 00:19:26.369
theme you have a dropped alpha version
 

00:19:26.369 --> 00:19:30.229
theme you have a dropped alpha version
of white this is applied on top of a

00:19:30.229 --> 00:19:30.239
of white this is applied on top of a
 

00:19:30.239 --> 00:19:31.999
of white this is applied on top of a
rounded rect that already has a dropped

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:32.009
rounded rect that already has a dropped
 

00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:34.029
rounded rect that already has a dropped
opacity so we're gonna end up with

00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039
opacity so we're gonna end up with
 

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:36.680
opacity so we're gonna end up with
everything being a slight variation on

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:36.690
everything being a slight variation on
 

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.479
everything being a slight variation on
the foreground color and you can very

00:19:38.479 --> 00:19:38.489
the foreground color and you can very
 

00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:41.359
the foreground color and you can very
easily use this in your own widgets to

00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:41.369
easily use this in your own widgets to
 

00:19:41.369 --> 00:19:42.409
easily use this in your own widgets to
get something that's going to be

00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419
get something that's going to be
 

00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:46.129
get something that's going to be
consistent with your theme we also have

00:19:46.129 --> 00:19:46.139
consistent with your theme we also have
 

00:19:46.139 --> 00:19:48.950
consistent with your theme we also have
text colors as Chris mentioned so we

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960
text colors as Chris mentioned so we
 

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.269
text colors as Chris mentioned so we
have a primary text color

00:19:50.269 --> 00:19:50.279
have a primary text color
 

00:19:50.279 --> 00:19:52.070
have a primary text color
which is used to provide very high

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080
which is used to provide very high
 

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.810
which is used to provide very high
contrast for things that the user needs

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820
contrast for things that the user needs
 

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.999
contrast for things that the user needs
to be looking at immediately we have

00:19:55.999 --> 00:19:56.009
to be looking at immediately we have
 

00:19:56.009 --> 00:19:57.859
to be looking at immediately we have
secondary text color which is just a

00:19:57.859 --> 00:19:57.869
secondary text color which is just a
 

00:19:57.869 --> 00:19:59.599
secondary text color which is just a
dropped opacity and these are going to

00:19:59.599 --> 00:19:59.609
dropped opacity and these are going to
 

00:19:59.609 --> 00:20:03.019
dropped opacity and these are going to
follow the material spec so I believe 84

00:20:03.019 --> 00:20:03.029
follow the material spec so I believe 84
 

00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:06.709
follow the material spec so I believe 84
and 56% opacity and they're going to

00:20:06.709 --> 00:20:06.719
and 56% opacity and they're going to
 

00:20:06.719 --> 00:20:09.019
and 56% opacity and they're going to
follow the theme colors we also have

00:20:09.019 --> 00:20:09.029
follow the theme colors we also have
 

00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:11.029
follow the theme colors we also have
inverse versions of these which we don't

00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039
inverse versions of these which we don't
 

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:13.580
inverse versions of these which we don't
use so much on the platform anymore but

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:13.590
use so much on the platform anymore but
 

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.810
use so much on the platform anymore but
if you're going to be displaying content

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:14.820
if you're going to be displaying content
 

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.349
if you're going to be displaying content
against say a or accent color text

00:20:18.349 --> 00:20:18.359
against say a or accent color text
 

00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:20.330
against say a or accent color text
primary inverse or secondary inverse is

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.340
primary inverse or secondary inverse is
 

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.869
primary inverse or secondary inverse is
a great way to do that we also have

00:20:23.869 --> 00:20:23.879
a great way to do that we also have
 

00:20:23.879 --> 00:20:26.450
a great way to do that we also have
color accent primary and primary dark

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:26.460
color accent primary and primary dark
 

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.459
color accent primary and primary dark
which we added in material and are going

00:20:28.459 --> 00:20:28.469
which we added in material and are going
 

00:20:28.469 --> 00:20:30.919
which we added in material and are going
to provide your branding colors so if

00:20:30.919 --> 00:20:30.929
to provide your branding colors so if
 

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.599
to provide your branding colors so if
you're pulling in color accent you get

00:20:32.599 --> 00:20:32.609
you're pulling in color accent you get
 

00:20:32.609 --> 00:20:34.129
you're pulling in color accent you get
that color pop you'll probably want to

00:20:34.129 --> 00:20:34.139
that color pop you'll probably want to
 

00:20:34.139 --> 00:20:37.579
that color pop you'll probably want to
use a white or use color primary inverse

00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:37.589
use a white or use color primary inverse
 

00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:40.129
use a white or use color primary inverse
on top of that so in a light theme

00:20:40.129 --> 00:20:40.139
on top of that so in a light theme
 

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:41.839
on top of that so in a light theme
you'll have a dark accent in a dark

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:41.849
you'll have a dark accent in a dark
 

00:20:41.849 --> 00:20:44.119
you'll have a dark accent in a dark
theme you'll have a light accent and you

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:44.129
theme you'll have a light accent and you
 

00:20:44.129 --> 00:20:46.459
theme you'll have a light accent and you
can pull these into your drawables and

00:20:46.459 --> 00:20:46.469
can pull these into your drawables and
 

00:20:46.469 --> 00:20:48.589
can pull these into your drawables and
your color state lists we also have

00:20:48.589 --> 00:20:48.599
your color state lists we also have
 

00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:50.509
your color state lists we also have
color control normal and activated

00:20:50.509 --> 00:20:50.519
color control normal and activated
 

00:20:50.519 --> 00:20:53.839
color control normal and activated
control normal is great and I really

00:20:53.839 --> 00:20:53.849
control normal is great and I really
 

00:20:53.849 --> 00:20:55.669
control normal is great and I really
recommend everybody use this if you have

00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679
recommend everybody use this if you have
 

00:20:55.679 --> 00:20:59.089
recommend everybody use this if you have
icons so for example checkboxes are

00:20:59.089 --> 00:20:59.099
icons so for example checkboxes are
 

00:20:59.099 --> 00:21:00.619
icons so for example checkboxes are
going to use color control normal by

00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:00.629
going to use color control normal by
 

00:21:00.629 --> 00:21:03.079
going to use color control normal by
default if you're pulling an icon into

00:21:03.079 --> 00:21:03.089
default if you're pulling an icon into
 

00:21:03.089 --> 00:21:04.879
default if you're pulling an icon into
your action bar and you tint it with

00:21:04.879 --> 00:21:04.889
your action bar and you tint it with
 

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.799
your action bar and you tint it with
color control normal it's going to be

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:06.809
color control normal it's going to be
 

00:21:06.809 --> 00:21:08.930
color control normal it's going to be
the exact right opacity and the number

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940
the exact right opacity and the number
 

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.389
the exact right opacity and the number
of times that I've seen applications

00:21:10.389 --> 00:21:10.399
of times that I've seen applications
 

00:21:10.399 --> 00:21:13.609

guess how a lot of these widgets are set

00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:28.529
guess how a lot of these widgets are set
 

00:21:28.529 --> 00:21:30.950
guess how a lot of these widgets are set
up so we have compound buttons which is

all right so now we have an overview of
 

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.010
all right so now we have an overview of
what's available to us and how these are

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:06.020
what's available to us and how these are
 

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.570
what's available to us and how these are
used to build the framework themes and

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:07.580
used to build the framework themes and
 

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.120
used to build the framework themes and
styles and how we can apply these to our

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:10.130
styles and how we can apply these to our
 

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.420
styles and how we can apply these to our
applications and these are very powerful

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:13.430
applications and these are very powerful
 

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.150

is actually something kind of unusual
 

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.410
is actually something kind of unusual
for Android styles so for most views

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:38.420
for Android styles so for most views
 

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.660

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:01.730
some cool things about what's available
 

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.180
some cool things about what's available
to us for creating styles and creating

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:04.190
to us for creating styles and creating
 

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.130
to us for creating styles and creating
themed drawables how can we apply this

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:06.140
themed drawables how can we apply this
 

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.260
themed drawables how can we apply this
to do something kind of cool

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:08.270
to do something kind of cool
 

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:09.910
to do something kind of cool
well we introduced the day/night theme

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:09.920
well we introduced the day/night theme
 

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.800
well we introduced the day/night theme
in the support library and this is

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:11.810
in the support library and this is
 

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:12.850
in the support library and this is
something that we've supported in the

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:12.860
something that we've supported in the
 

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.970
something that we've supported in the
platform for actually quite a long time

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:14.980
platform for actually quite a long time
 

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.940
platform for actually quite a long time
so night day night is implemented as a

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:18.950
so night day night is implemented as a
 

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.920
so night day night is implemented as a
resource qualifier this has existed

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:20.930
resource qualifier this has existed
 

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.850
resource qualifier this has existed
since API 8 starting in API 23 this is

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:24.860
since API 8 starting in API 23 this is
 

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.160
since API 8 starting in API 23 this is
something that any application can

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.170
something that any application can
 

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.980
something that any application can
toggle through UI mode manager so if you

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:29.990
toggle through UI mode manager so if you
 

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.450
toggle through UI mode manager so if you
write an application and you want to

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:31.460
write an application and you want to
 

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.580
write an application and you want to
toggle the global state of day/night

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:33.590
toggle the global state of day/night
 

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.500
toggle the global state of day/night
mode you just go into UI mode manager

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:35.510
mode you just go into UI mode manager
 

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.020
mode you just go into UI mode manager
and you can set night mode when that

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:38.030
and you can set night mode when that
 

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.970
and you can set night mode when that
changes it's going to be treated as a

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:39.980
changes it's going to be treated as a
 

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.710
changes it's going to be treated as a
configuration change like you would have

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720
configuration change like you would have
 

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.770
configuration change like you would have
for changing device orientation which

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:44.780
for changing device orientation which
 

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:48.430
for changing device orientation which
adds the landscape resource qualifier so

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440
adds the landscape resource qualifier so
 

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.500
adds the landscape resource qualifier so
this is going to really simplify

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:49.510
this is going to really simplify
 

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.510
this is going to really simplify
swapping light and dark resources if

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520
swapping light and dark resources if
 

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.420
swapping light and dark resources if
your user either prefers dark or if you

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:55.430
your user either prefers dark or if you
 

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:56.740
your user either prefers dark or if you
want to set it up for automatic

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:56.750
want to set it up for automatic
 

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.750
want to set it up for automatic
wear at nighttime maybe your user will

00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760
wear at nighttime maybe your user will
 

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.460
wear at nighttime maybe your user will
see a dark theme and daytime they'll see

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:00.470
see a dark theme and daytime they'll see
 

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.250
see a dark theme and daytime they'll see
a light theme so the actual

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:03.260
a light theme so the actual
 

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.890
a light theme so the actual
implementation of this relies on

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:04.900
implementation of this relies on
 

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.050
implementation of this relies on
inheritance so we specify a day/night

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:08.060
inheritance so we specify a day/night
 

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.480
inheritance so we specify a day/night
theme and we have the same name in both

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:10.490
theme and we have the same name in both
 

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.180
theme and we have the same name in both
our values and night qualified values

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:13.190
our values and night qualified values
 

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.370
our values and night qualified values
directories and the only difference is

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:15.380
directories and the only difference is
 

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.070
directories and the only difference is
the parent that we're inheriting from so

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080
the parent that we're inheriting from so
 

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.910
the parent that we're inheriting from so
under not night or the default qualifier

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:21.920
under not night or the default qualifier
 

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.350
under not night or the default qualifier
we're going to inherit from themed

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360
we're going to inherit from themed
 

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.750
we're going to inherit from themed
material lights and under the night

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760
material lights and under the night
 

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.340
material lights and under the night
qualifier we're going to inherit from

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:27.350
qualifier we're going to inherit from
 

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.260
qualifier we're going to inherit from
the dark metier

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:28.270
the dark metier
 

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.230
the dark metier
theme now the magic here is that when we

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240
theme now the magic here is that when we
 

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.440
theme now the magic here is that when we
have this resource qualifier change the

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:34.450
have this resource qualifier change the
 

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:35.490
have this resource qualifier change the
application is going to go through a

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:35.500
application is going to go through a
 

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.080
application is going to go through a
lifecycle events will get a nun

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:37.090
lifecycle events will get a nun
 

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.330
lifecycle events will get a nun
configuration change and we're gonna

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:39.340
configuration change and we're gonna
 

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.580
configuration change and we're gonna
reload our theme using this new parent

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:41.590
reload our theme using this new parent
 

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.740
reload our theme using this new parent
which means everything that we inflate

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:43.750
which means everything that we inflate
 

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.820
which means everything that we inflate
is gonna have different theme colors now

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:47.830
is gonna have different theme colors now
 

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.850
is gonna have different theme colors now
you can also define explicit colors so

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:50.860
you can also define explicit colors so
 

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.410
you can also define explicit colors so
if you want to have a hard-coded color

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:52.420
if you want to have a hard-coded color
 

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.150
if you want to have a hard-coded color
and define that differently under night

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:54.160
and define that differently under night
 

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.430
and define that differently under night
or not night you can do that but it's

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440
or not night you can do that but it's
 

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.830
or not night you can do that but it's
easier to rely on theme colors so the

00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840
easier to rely on theme colors so the
 

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.840
easier to rely on theme colors so the
end result of this is that because

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:00.850
end result of this is that because
 

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.580
end result of this is that because
everything gets inflated against your

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:02.590
everything gets inflated against your
 

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.320
everything gets inflated against your
theme and we're using a different parent

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:04.330
theme and we're using a different parent
 

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.890
theme and we're using a different parent
you're going to get either dark or light

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900
you're going to get either dark or light
 

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.720
you're going to get either dark or light
resources and in custom widgets that

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:09.730
resources and in custom widgets that
 

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.160
resources and in custom widgets that
you've made where you're using theme

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:11.170
you've made where you're using theme
 

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:12.419
you've made where you're using theme
attributes you're just gonna

00:27:12.419 --> 00:27:12.429
attributes you're just gonna
 

00:27:12.429 --> 00:27:14.520
attributes you're just gonna
automatically get the right colors so

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:14.530
automatically get the right colors so
 

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.960
automatically get the right colors so
you don't have to do a lot of work to

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:15.970
you don't have to do a lot of work to
 

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.120
you don't have to do a lot of work to
switch between implementing a light and

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.130
switch between implementing a light and
 

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.540
switch between implementing a light and
a dark theme as Chris demonstrated in

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:21.550
a dark theme as Chris demonstrated in
 

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:22.950
a dark theme as Chris demonstrated in
our what's new and support library

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960
our what's new and support library
 

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.060
our what's new and support library
talked yesterday

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:24.070
talked yesterday
 

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.820
talked yesterday
this has been back ported to API 14

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:26.830
this has been back ported to API 14
 

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.130
this has been back ported to API 14
through app compat so if you want to

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:29.140
through app compat so if you want to
 

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.080
through app compat so if you want to
implement a light or dark light and dark

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.090
implement a light or dark light and dark
 

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.640
implement a light or dark light and dark
theme support in your application

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:32.650
theme support in your application
 

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.919
theme support in your application
super easy most of the work is already

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:34.929
super easy most of the work is already
 

00:27:34.929 --> 00:27:36.450
super easy most of the work is already
done for you you just need to add a

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:36.460
done for you you just need to add a
 

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.180
done for you you just need to add a
little switch that will toggle night

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:39.190
little switch that will toggle night
 

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:44.010
little switch that will toggle night
mode right so using themes and

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:44.020
mode right so using themes and
 

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.480
mode right so using themes and
attributes can helps with simplify

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.490
attributes can helps with simplify
 

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.640
attributes can helps with simplify
switching the visual presentation of

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:47.650
switching the visual presentation of
 

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.650
switching the visual presentation of
your application but what if you want to

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:49.660
your application but what if you want to
 

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.650
your application but what if you want to
change just a small portion of

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:51.660
change just a small portion of
 

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.200
change just a small portion of
presentation in your application so we

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:55.210
presentation in your application so we
 

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.000
presentation in your application so we
know that theme dot material can make

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.010
know that theme dot material can make
 

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.380
know that theme dot material can make
your application look dark

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:58.390
your application look dark
 

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:00.540
your application look dark
we know that theme dot material light

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:00.550
we know that theme dot material light
 

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.480
we know that theme dot material light
can make your application look light but

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:02.490
can make your application look light but
 

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:04.380
can make your application look light but
what if you want to have something like

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:04.390
what if you want to have something like
 

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.690
what if you want to have something like
a dark action bar but the rest of your

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:06.700
a dark action bar but the rest of your
 

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.880
a dark action bar but the rest of your
application be light well there's one

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:11.890
application be light well there's one
 

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.340
application be light well there's one
way you could do this you could use the

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:14.350
way you could do this you could use the
 

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:17.580
way you could do this you could use the
light activity light theme and then just

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:17.590
light activity light theme and then just
 

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.890
light activity light theme and then just
specify everything in your action bar

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:19.900
specify everything in your action bar
 

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.169
specify everything in your action bar
manually to be dark that's a little

00:28:22.169 --> 00:28:22.179
manually to be dark that's a little
 

00:28:22.179 --> 00:28:24.450
manually to be dark that's a little
complicated so maybe instead we'll have

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:24.460
complicated so maybe instead we'll have
 

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.030
complicated so maybe instead we'll have
a dark theme and we'll just manually

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:27.040
a dark theme and we'll just manually
 

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.100
a dark theme and we'll just manually
specify everything in our activity all

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:29.110
specify everything in our activity all
 

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.610
specify everything in our activity all
of our content to be a different color

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:31.620
of our content to be a different color
 

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.470
of our content to be a different color
that ends up being really really tricky

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480
that ends up being really really tricky
 

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.919
that ends up being really really tricky
so please please don't do that

00:28:36.919 --> 00:28:36.929
so please please don't do that
 

00:28:36.929 --> 00:28:40.519
so please please don't do that
don't don't hard-code text colors

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:40.529
don't don't hard-code text colors
 

00:28:40.529 --> 00:28:43.379
don't don't hard-code text colors
so there's an easier way and that is

00:28:43.379 --> 00:28:43.389
so there's an easier way and that is
 

00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:45.899
so there's an easier way and that is
through overlay themes and specifying

00:28:45.899 --> 00:28:45.909
through overlay themes and specifying
 

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:48.029
through overlay themes and specifying
themes on portions of your view

00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:48.039
themes on portions of your view
 

00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:50.159
themes on portions of your view
hierarchy and this is what we do with

00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:50.169
hierarchy and this is what we do with
 

00:28:50.169 --> 00:28:52.499
hierarchy and this is what we do with
the dark action bar theme so we actually

00:28:52.499 --> 00:28:52.509
the dark action bar theme so we actually
 

00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:55.289
the dark action bar theme so we actually
redefined the theme that's used for the

00:28:55.289 --> 00:28:55.299
redefined the theme that's used for the
 

00:28:55.299 --> 00:28:59.909
redefined the theme that's used for the
tool bar section of your application so

00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919
tool bar section of your application so
 

00:28:59.919 --> 00:29:01.680
tool bar section of your application so
everybody recalls we have overlay themes

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:01.690
everybody recalls we have overlay themes
 

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.409
everybody recalls we have overlay themes
we have light theme that pulls in light

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:04.419
we have light theme that pulls in light
 

00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:05.820
we have light theme that pulls in light
colors we have dark theme that pulls in

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:05.830
colors we have dark theme that pulls in
 

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:09.989
colors we have dark theme that pulls in
dark colors and these are implemented

00:29:09.989 --> 00:29:09.999
dark colors and these are implemented
 

00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:12.450
dark colors and these are implemented
using the Android theme attribute from

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:12.460
using the Android theme attribute from
 

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.460
using the Android theme attribute from
XML so this gets picked up by the layout

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:14.470
XML so this gets picked up by the layout
 

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.310
XML so this gets picked up by the layout
inflator and it's going to replace our

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.320
inflator and it's going to replace our
 

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.549
inflator and it's going to replace our
overlay the theme used to inherit to

00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559
overlay the theme used to inherit to
 

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:23.009
overlay the theme used to inherit to
inflate a sub section of your view

00:29:23.009 --> 00:29:23.019
inflate a sub section of your view
 

00:29:23.019 --> 00:29:24.869
inflate a sub section of your view
hierarchy and the actual implementation

00:29:24.869 --> 00:29:24.879
hierarchy and the actual implementation
 

00:29:24.879 --> 00:29:28.889
hierarchy and the actual implementation
here is pulling the theme attribute from

00:29:28.889 --> 00:29:28.899
here is pulling the theme attribute from
 

00:29:28.899 --> 00:29:31.200
here is pulling the theme attribute from
your XML and then applying that as a

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:31.210
your XML and then applying that as a
 

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:33.029
your XML and then applying that as a
context theme wrapper which is exactly

00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039
context theme wrapper which is exactly
 

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:33.810
context theme wrapper which is exactly
what it sounds like

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:33.820
what it sounds like
 

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.850
what it sounds like
we take your inflation context we're

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:35.860
we take your inflation context we're
 

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.739
we take your inflation context we're
going to apply a theme on top of that

00:29:37.739 --> 00:29:37.749
going to apply a theme on top of that
 

00:29:37.749 --> 00:29:39.869
going to apply a theme on top of that
we're going to inflate all of the child

00:29:39.869 --> 00:29:39.879
we're going to inflate all of the child
 

00:29:39.879 --> 00:29:42.450
we're going to inflate all of the child
content against this new wrapped context

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:42.460
content against this new wrapped context
 

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.769
content against this new wrapped context
so what you will get is effectively the

00:29:46.769 --> 00:29:46.779
so what you will get is effectively the
 

00:29:46.779 --> 00:29:49.799
so what you will get is effectively the
dark theme in the section of layout that

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:49.809
dark theme in the section of layout that
 

00:29:49.809 --> 00:29:52.619
dark theme in the section of layout that
has Android theme equals dark and light

00:29:52.619 --> 00:29:52.629
has Android theme equals dark and light
 

00:29:52.629 --> 00:29:55.950
has Android theme equals dark and light
everywhere else the actual

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:55.960
everywhere else the actual
 

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.200
everywhere else the actual
implementation of this relies on the

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.210
implementation of this relies on the
 

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.029
implementation of this relies on the
default layout that we provide for an

00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:00.039
default layout that we provide for an
 

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:02.249
default layout that we provide for an
activity that has an action bar so if

00:30:02.249 --> 00:30:02.259
activity that has an action bar so if
 

00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:05.369
activity that has an action bar so if
you dig into some of the XML files in

00:30:05.369 --> 00:30:05.379
you dig into some of the XML files in
 

00:30:05.379 --> 00:30:07.200
you dig into some of the XML files in
the android framework screen action bar

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.210
the android framework screen action bar
 

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.940
the android framework screen action bar
is what we inflate if you've requested

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:08.950
is what we inflate if you've requested
 

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.279
is what we inflate if you've requested
an action bar in your activity and we're

00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:11.289
an action bar in your activity and we're
 

00:30:11.289 --> 00:30:13.259
an action bar in your activity and we're
going to set the android theme attribute

00:30:13.259 --> 00:30:13.269
going to set the android theme attribute
 

00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:15.749
going to set the android theme attribute
to inherit from the action bar theme

00:30:15.749 --> 00:30:15.759
to inherit from the action bar theme
 

00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:19.109
to inherit from the action bar theme
attribute defined in your theme which

00:30:19.109 --> 00:30:19.119
attribute defined in your theme which
 

00:30:19.119 --> 00:30:20.909
attribute defined in your theme which
has attribute and theme a lot of times

00:30:20.909 --> 00:30:20.919
has attribute and theme a lot of times
 

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:23.450
has attribute and theme a lot of times
which is why we call this theme ception

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460
which is why we call this theme ception
 

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.879
which is why we call this theme ception
so we're gonna pull in the dark theme on

00:30:26.879 --> 00:30:26.889
so we're gonna pull in the dark theme on
 

00:30:26.889 --> 00:30:32.159
so we're gonna pull in the dark theme on
top of the light activity theme we've

00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:32.169
top of the light activity theme we've
 

00:30:32.169 --> 00:30:34.080
top of the light activity theme we've
defined action bar theme in the dark

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.090
defined action bar theme in the dark
 

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:37.799
defined action bar theme in the dark
action bar theme as material dark action

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:37.809
action bar theme as material dark action
 

00:30:37.809 --> 00:30:40.710
action bar theme as material dark action
bar this is the dark overlay which pulls

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720
bar this is the dark overlay which pulls
 

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.019
bar this is the dark overlay which pulls
in the dark theme colors it switches the

00:30:43.019 --> 00:30:43.029
in the dark theme colors it switches the
 

00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:45.539
in the dark theme colors it switches the
text foreground and background colors an

00:30:45.539 --> 00:30:45.549
text foreground and background colors an
 

00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:47.369
text foreground and background colors an
action bar sets up a couple of special

00:30:47.369 --> 00:30:47.379
action bar sets up a couple of special
 

00:30:47.379 --> 00:30:50.779
action bar sets up a couple of special
things for displaying the let's say

00:30:50.779 --> 00:30:50.789
things for displaying the let's say
 

00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:52.899
things for displaying the let's say
accent color in your

00:30:52.899 --> 00:30:52.909
accent color in your
 

00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:55.210
accent color in your
Toolbar but the important part is that

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:55.220
Toolbar but the important part is that
 

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.979
Toolbar but the important part is that
we're pulling in dark colors on top of

00:30:56.979 --> 00:30:56.989
we're pulling in dark colors on top of
 

00:30:56.989 --> 00:31:00.339
we're pulling in dark colors on top of
your base light beam we also redefined

00:31:00.339 --> 00:31:00.349
your base light beam we also redefined
 

00:31:00.349 --> 00:31:02.259
your base light beam we also redefined
the pop up theme so that you get a light

00:31:02.259 --> 00:31:02.269
the pop up theme so that you get a light
 

00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:04.869
the pop up theme so that you get a light
pop up on top of a dark action bar on

00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:04.879
pop up on top of a dark action bar on
 

00:31:04.879 --> 00:31:08.200
pop up on top of a dark action bar on
top of a light activity so we have three

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:08.210
top of a light activity so we have three
 

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.089
top of a light activity so we have three
themes at work here all overlaid on top

00:31:10.089 --> 00:31:10.099
themes at work here all overlaid on top
 

00:31:10.099 --> 00:31:14.469
themes at work here all overlaid on top
one another we also support Android

00:31:14.469 --> 00:31:14.479
one another we also support Android
 

00:31:14.479 --> 00:31:17.799
one another we also support Android
theme through the app compat library so

00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:17.809
theme through the app compat library so
 

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:19.149
theme through the app compat library so
this is gonna work all the way back to

00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159
this is gonna work all the way back to
 

00:31:19.159 --> 00:31:21.369
this is gonna work all the way back to
API seven for XML that gets inflated

00:31:21.369 --> 00:31:21.379
API seven for XML that gets inflated
 

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:23.979
API seven for XML that gets inflated
through app compat an inheritance of the

00:31:23.979 --> 00:31:23.989
through app compat an inheritance of the
 

00:31:23.989 --> 00:31:26.139
through app compat an inheritance of the
parent theme is going to work on API 11

00:31:26.139 --> 00:31:26.149
parent theme is going to work on API 11
 

00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:28.450
parent theme is going to work on API 11
and above and what this means is that if

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:28.460
and above and what this means is that if
 

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.999
and above and what this means is that if
you put Android colon theme in your XML

00:31:30.999 --> 00:31:31.009
you put Android colon theme in your XML
 

00:31:31.009 --> 00:31:33.849
you put Android colon theme in your XML
on API seven we will apply it to that

00:31:33.849 --> 00:31:33.859
on API seven we will apply it to that
 

00:31:33.859 --> 00:31:36.460
on API seven we will apply it to that
view only on API 11 and above we will

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:36.470
view only on API 11 and above we will
 

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.619
view only on API 11 and above we will
apply it to all of the views that are

00:31:38.619 --> 00:31:38.629
apply it to all of the views that are
 

00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:43.229
apply it to all of the views that are
inflated as a child of that view right

00:31:43.229 --> 00:31:43.239
 
 

00:31:43.239 --> 00:31:45.430
 
and now Chris is gonna cover some common

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440
and now Chris is gonna cover some common
 

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.979
and now Chris is gonna cover some common
mistakes that developers make when using

00:31:47.979 --> 00:31:47.989
mistakes that developers make when using
 

00:31:47.989 --> 00:31:52.599
mistakes that developers make when using
themes and styles thanks Allen so as

00:31:52.599 --> 00:31:52.609
themes and styles thanks Allen so as
 

00:31:52.609 --> 00:31:53.769
themes and styles thanks Allen so as
Alan said we're now going to go through

00:31:53.769 --> 00:31:53.779
Alan said we're now going to go through
 

00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:55.869
Alan said we're now going to go through
some of the things we see quite a lot

00:31:55.869 --> 00:31:55.879
some of the things we see quite a lot
 

00:31:55.879 --> 00:31:58.330
some of the things we see quite a lot
both in Google Apps and also externally

00:31:58.330 --> 00:31:58.340
both in Google Apps and also externally
 

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.239
both in Google Apps and also externally
on things like Stack Overflow hopefully

00:32:01.239 --> 00:32:01.249
on things like Stack Overflow hopefully
 

00:32:01.249 --> 00:32:02.169
on things like Stack Overflow hopefully
I'll be able to start repeating myself

00:32:02.169 --> 00:32:02.179
I'll be able to start repeating myself
 

00:32:02.179 --> 00:32:04.330
I'll be able to start repeating myself
because we we see this a lot and we

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:04.340
because we we see this a lot and we
 

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.729
because we we see this a lot and we
always say the same thing so the first

00:32:06.729 --> 00:32:06.739
always say the same thing so the first
 

00:32:06.739 --> 00:32:08.440
always say the same thing so the first
thing we're gonna go through is using

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:08.450
thing we're gonna go through is using
 

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.930
thing we're gonna go through is using
the incorrect style parent so it's

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:10.940
the incorrect style parent so it's
 

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.369
the incorrect style parent so it's
easier if we go for an example and show

00:32:12.369 --> 00:32:12.379
easier if we go for an example and show
 

00:32:12.379 --> 00:32:15.219
easier if we go for an example and show
you what this can actually do so here we

00:32:15.219 --> 00:32:15.229
you what this can actually do so here we
 

00:32:15.229 --> 00:32:17.109
you what this can actually do so here we
have an edit text well we have

00:32:17.109 --> 00:32:17.119
have an edit text well we have
 

00:32:17.119 --> 00:32:19.089
have an edit text well we have
multiplied text and what we want to do

00:32:19.089 --> 00:32:19.099
multiplied text and what we want to do
 

00:32:19.099 --> 00:32:20.799
multiplied text and what we want to do
we want to make every edit text have a

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:20.809
we want to make every edit text have a
 

00:32:20.809 --> 00:32:22.810
we want to make every edit text have a
different font the medium font but it

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:22.820
different font the medium font but it
 

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.460
different font the medium font but it
could be anything so what we're going to

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:24.470
could be anything so what we're going to
 

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:25.749
could be anything so what we're going to
do we're going to change the default

00:32:25.749 --> 00:32:25.759
do we're going to change the default
 

00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:28.389
do we're going to change the default
style for edit text and then set it to

00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399
style for edit text and then set it to
 

00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:31.570
style for edit text and then set it to
have a medium font so here we have

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:31.580
have a medium font so here we have
 

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.239
have a medium font so here we have
example and here's our style so our

00:32:34.239 --> 00:32:34.249
example and here's our style so our
 

00:32:34.249 --> 00:32:36.580
example and here's our style so our
style here is my edit text view style

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:36.590
style here is my edit text view style
 

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:37.450
style here is my edit text view style
could be whatever you want

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:37.460
could be whatever you want
 

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.799
could be whatever you want
but it sets one thing which is font

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:38.809
but it sets one thing which is font
 

00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:41.529
but it sets one thing which is font
family and that says it's a medium now

00:32:41.529 --> 00:32:41.539
family and that says it's a medium now
 

00:32:41.539 --> 00:32:43.419
family and that says it's a medium now
once you've done that we'll then

00:32:43.419 --> 00:32:43.429
once you've done that we'll then
 

00:32:43.429 --> 00:32:45.369
once you've done that we'll then
reference it in us in our theme so it

00:32:45.369 --> 00:32:45.379
reference it in us in our theme so it
 

00:32:45.379 --> 00:32:49.570
reference it in us in our theme so it
gets picked up as default and then you

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:49.580
gets picked up as default and then you
 

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.669
gets picked up as default and then you
run your app and you see this suddenly

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679
run your app and you see this suddenly
 

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:53.349
run your app and you see this suddenly
all of your edit text have gone you've

00:32:53.349 --> 00:32:53.359
all of your edit text have gone you've
 

00:32:53.359 --> 00:32:54.940
all of your edit text have gone you've
lost all your styling they're no longer

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:54.950
lost all your styling they're no longer
 

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.820
lost all your styling they're no longer
editable but you have changed the font

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:57.830
editable but you have changed the font
 

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.490
editable but you have changed the font
to medium

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:00.500
 
 

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.890
 
now the reason why this happens is that

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:02.900
now the reason why this happens is that
 

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.029
now the reason why this happens is that
you didn't set a parent on the style and

00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039
you didn't set a parent on the style and
 

00:33:06.039 --> 00:33:09.130
you didn't set a parent on the style and
what that happens is that you no longer

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:09.140
what that happens is that you no longer
 

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.320
what that happens is that you no longer
pick up all of these system defaults so

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:11.330
pick up all of these system defaults so
 

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.820
pick up all of these system defaults so
you know not get the background the fact

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:12.830
you know not get the background the fact
 

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.669
you know not get the background the fact
that it's editable all sorts of weird

00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679
that it's editable all sorts of weird
 

00:33:15.679 --> 00:33:16.930
that it's editable all sorts of weird
and random things which are in the style

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:16.940
and random things which are in the style
 

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.240
and random things which are in the style
so the way to fix it is you just set the

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:19.250
so the way to fix it is you just set the
 

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.830
so the way to fix it is you just set the
correct parent now the best way of

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840
correct parent now the best way of
 

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.330
correct parent now the best way of
finding out what the parent is is just

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:22.340
finding out what the parent is is just
 

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.010
finding out what the parent is is just
look at the theme you're inheriting from

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:24.020
look at the theme you're inheriting from
 

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.810
look at the theme you're inheriting from
so if you're using theme that material

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:25.820
so if you're using theme that material
 

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.090
so if you're using theme that material
just go into it it's it is big it's

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:28.100
just go into it it's it is big it's
 

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.090
just go into it it's it is big it's
about I don't know two hundred lines ish

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:30.100
about I don't know two hundred lines ish
 

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.860
about I don't know two hundred lines ish
but that it's all quite nicely spaced

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:32.870
but that it's all quite nicely spaced
 

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.630
but that it's all quite nicely spaced
out they're all grouped together it's

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640
out they're all grouped together it's
 

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.130
out they're all grouped together it's
not too hard to read and suddenly once

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:39.140
not too hard to read and suddenly once
 

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:39.700
not too hard to read and suddenly once
you've fixed it

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:39.710
you've fixed it
 

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:44.049
you've fixed it
it all looks good again now this is

00:33:44.049 --> 00:33:44.059
it all looks good again now this is
 

00:33:44.059 --> 00:33:46.120
it all looks good again now this is
quite a technical mistake you're all

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:46.130
quite a technical mistake you're all
 

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.279
quite a technical mistake you're all
really gonna mistake this if you're kind

00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:48.289
really gonna mistake this if you're kind
 

00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:50.200
really gonna mistake this if you're kind
of writing custom views but it's the

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:50.210
of writing custom views but it's the
 

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.789
of writing custom views but it's the
difference between default style atra

00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799
difference between default style atra
 

00:33:51.799 --> 00:33:54.430
difference between default style atra
and default style res now there are two

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.440
and default style res now there are two
 

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.200
and default style res now there are two
places where you'll use this the first

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:56.210
places where you'll use this the first
 

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.110
places where you'll use this the first
is the for our constructor on view now

00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120
is the for our constructor on view now
 

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.120
is the for our constructor on view now
that was added 9521 so I doubt many of

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:01.130
that was added 9521 so I doubt many of
 

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.250
that was added 9521 so I doubt many of
you using it but the main place you're

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:03.260
you using it but the main place you're
 

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.930
you using it but the main place you're
going to use this isn't obtained style

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:04.940
going to use this isn't obtained style
 

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.220
going to use this isn't obtained style
attributes and that is the way you

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:06.230
attributes and that is the way you
 

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:09.010
attributes and that is the way you
actually read attributes in views so he

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:09.020
actually read attributes in views so he
 

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.089
actually read attributes in views so he
can see at the bottom the last two

00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:10.099
can see at the bottom the last two
 

00:34:10.099 --> 00:34:11.829
can see at the bottom the last two
parameters are default bar at row and

00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839
parameters are default bar at row and
 

00:34:11.839 --> 00:34:14.169
parameters are default bar at row and
default style res and the problem is

00:34:14.169 --> 00:34:14.179
default style res and the problem is
 

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.089
default style res and the problem is
that default structure should always

00:34:16.089 --> 00:34:16.099
that default structure should always
 

00:34:16.099 --> 00:34:19.720
that default structure should always
point to an actor so the default spot at

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:19.730
point to an actor so the default spot at
 

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.129
point to an actor so the default spot at
church should point to an attribute in

00:34:21.129 --> 00:34:21.139
church should point to an attribute in
 

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:22.960
church should point to an attribute in
your theme to pick the default style

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:22.970
your theme to pick the default style
 

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:25.720
your theme to pick the default style
from the last wonderful star res it

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:25.730
from the last wonderful star res it
 

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.430
from the last wonderful star res it
should point to an actual resource so a

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440
should point to an actual resource so a
 

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.320
should point to an actual resource so a
natural star resource and this point our

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:29.330
natural star resource and this point our
 

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.419
natural star resource and this point our
dot style dot widget a widget blah blah

00:34:31.419 --> 00:34:31.429
dot style dot widget a widget blah blah
 

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:33.760
dot style dot widget a widget blah blah
blah now if you mix them up basically

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:33.770
blah now if you mix them up basically
 

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:37.419
blah now if you mix them up basically
things stop working now following on

00:34:37.419 --> 00:34:37.429
things stop working now following on
 

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:40.119
things stop working now following on
from that there's some intricacies in

00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:40.129
from that there's some intricacies in
 

00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:42.369
from that there's some intricacies in
how obtained style attributes actually

00:34:42.369 --> 00:34:42.379
how obtained style attributes actually
 

00:34:42.379 --> 00:34:44.589
how obtained style attributes actually
works and it's to do with the order

00:34:44.589 --> 00:34:44.599
works and it's to do with the order
 

00:34:44.599 --> 00:34:46.680
works and it's to do with the order
preference of how it reads an attribute

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:46.690
preference of how it reads an attribute
 

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:48.940
preference of how it reads an attribute
so when it's when you're trying to read

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:48.950
so when it's when you're trying to read
 

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:50.740
so when it's when you're trying to read
a set of attributes this is the order

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:50.750
a set of attributes this is the order
 

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.780
a set of attributes this is the order
goes through so the first thing you look

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:52.790
goes through so the first thing you look
 

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.550
goes through so the first thing you look
for is the value in your attribute set

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560
for is the value in your attribute set
 

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.619
for is the value in your attribute set
now that the attribute set is what

00:34:56.619 --> 00:34:56.629
now that the attribute set is what
 

00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:58.839
now that the attribute set is what
yahweh's contains all the absolutes

00:34:58.839 --> 00:34:58.849
yahweh's contains all the absolutes
 

00:34:58.849 --> 00:35:01.300
yahweh's contains all the absolutes
which are set on your actual layout so

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:01.310
which are set on your actual layout so
 

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.890
which are set on your actual layout so
if you have a layout and you've set

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:02.900
if you have a layout and you've set
 

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.750
if you have a layout and you've set
android background on it it will be

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:04.760
android background on it it will be
 

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.660
android background on it it will be
contained in the attribute set the

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:07.670
contained in the attribute set the
 

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.460
contained in the attribute set the
second thing he looks for is the same

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:09.470
second thing he looks for is the same
 

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.650
second thing he looks for is the same
value within any explicit style so if

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:11.660
value within any explicit style so if
 

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.120
value within any explicit style so if
you're using the style tag pointing to a

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:13.130
you're using the style tag pointing to a
 

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:14.150
you're using the style tag pointing to a
style it

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160
style it
 

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.390
style it
then look for in there the first thing

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400
then look for in there the first thing
 

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.220
then look for in there the first thing
you look for is in the default style res

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:19.230
you look for is in the default style res
 

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:21.349
you look for is in the default style res
if that's in the actual concrete pointer

00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359
if that's in the actual concrete pointer
 

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:23.500
if that's in the actual concrete pointer
to a default style

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:23.510
to a default style
 

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.579
to a default style
lastly looks at the attribute of the

00:35:25.579 --> 00:35:25.589
lastly looks at the attribute of the
 

00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:28.220
lastly looks at the attribute of the
default style and your theme and there's

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:28.230
default style and your theme and there's
 

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.569
default style and your theme and there's
finally it looks at the base value in

00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:29.579
finally it looks at the base value in
 

00:35:29.579 --> 00:35:31.819
finally it looks at the base value in
the theme now please don't rely on this

00:35:31.819 --> 00:35:31.829
the theme now please don't rely on this
 

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:34.029
the theme now please don't rely on this
because it leaves on to the next mistake

00:35:34.029 --> 00:35:34.039
because it leaves on to the next mistake
 

00:35:34.039 --> 00:35:37.460
because it leaves on to the next mistake
which is using view attributes in themes

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:37.470
which is using view attributes in themes
 

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.010
which is using view attributes in themes
so this is a mistake which actually

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.020
so this is a mistake which actually
 

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.920
so this is a mistake which actually
someone our team made recently so here

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:42.930
