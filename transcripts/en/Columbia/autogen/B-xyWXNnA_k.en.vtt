in the title and that is the word power

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460
in the title and that is the word power

because the chapter divides into two

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
because the chapter divides into two
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.280
because the chapter divides into two
pieces the first piece is a

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290
pieces the first piece is a
 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.220
pieces the first piece is a
technological piece and the second piece

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
technological piece and the second piece
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.639
technological piece and the second piece
is a political piece and to say the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649
is a political piece and to say the
 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.979
is a political piece and to say the
first of the technological piece deals

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

difficult question because you know
 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.160
difficult question because you know
there's so many different examples of it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170
there's so many different examples of it
 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.650

Europe got there first but you know

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340
Europe got there first but you know
 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.620
Europe got there first but you know
Egypt and Namibia were on their way and

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630
Egypt and Namibia were on their way and
 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.659
Egypt and Namibia were on their way and
you know there's nothing that special

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:36.669
you know there's nothing that special
 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.110
you know there's nothing that special
other than Europe being first to certain

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120
other than Europe being first to certain

things arguments that are made but seem

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590
things arguments that are made but seem
 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.480

to be rather Hollow

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490
to be rather Hollow
 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.200
to be rather Hollow
and so I found myself wondering well is

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210
and so I found myself wondering well is
 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.589
and so I found myself wondering well is
there some warrant here is there is it

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599
there some warrant here is there is it
 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.490
there some warrant here is there is it
something that happened that was

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500
something that happened that was
 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.529
something that happened that was
categorically different from other

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539
categorically different from other
 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:05.310
categorically different from other
historical phenomena and I look at

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320
historical phenomena and I look at
 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.589
historical phenomena and I look at
different arenas and I think well

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599
different arenas and I think well
 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:14.399
different arenas and I think well
science is important yes but maybe it

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:14.409
science is important yes but maybe it
 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:19.920
science is important yes but maybe it
doesn't quite effect enough of society

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:19.930
doesn't quite effect enough of society
 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.659
doesn't quite effect enough of society
to be a key military superiority comes

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:24.669
to be a key military superiority comes
 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.730
to be a key military superiority comes
and goes the European certainly had it

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740
and goes the European certainly had it
 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.920
and goes the European certainly had it
they don't have it anymore

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930
 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.899
prosperity well yeah but there have been

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:36.909
prosperity well yeah but there have been
 

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:39.890
prosperity well yeah but there have been
other prosperous societies and

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900
other prosperous societies and
 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.209
other prosperous societies and
prosperity is is something that is

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:44.219
prosperity is is something that is
 

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:48.420
prosperity is is something that is
realized in a competitive context and at

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.430
realized in a competitive context and at
 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.219
realized in a competitive context and at
some point others some other country is

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:50.229
some point others some other country is
 

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:55.219
some point others some other country is
going to be more prosperous than yours

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:55.229
 

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:56.540
modernity

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:56.550

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.600

that's the enigmatic term whatever it

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:00.610
that's the enigmatic term whatever it
 

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.779
that's the enigmatic term whatever it
might mean

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:03.789
 

00:08:03.789 --> 00:08:16.460
yet this is when it gained head weight

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:16.470
 

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.300
so I got thinking about this

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:18.310
so I got thinking about this
 

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:24.659
so I got thinking about this
technological side of it and I thought

00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:24.669
technological side of it and I thought
 

00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:27.570
technological side of it and I thought
well is it the technology that would

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:27.580
well is it the technology that would
 

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.080
well is it the technology that would
warrant this and of course there are

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.090
warrant this and of course there are
 

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.850
warrant this and of course there are
many technologies and therefore you have

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:32.860
many technologies and therefore you have
 

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.529
many technologies and therefore you have
to do specify what you mean that seems

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:37.539
to do specify what you mean that seems
 

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:46.650
to do specify what you mean that seems
to me that to stand out and that the key

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:46.660
to me that to stand out and that the key
 

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:54.000
to me that to stand out and that the key

00:08:54.010 --> 00:09:00.210
to them both is is velocity the ability
to make something go faster now ever

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:00.220

00:56:32.529 --> 00:56:32.539
clergyman who got monks or other clergy
 

00:56:32.539 --> 00:56:35.170

circle with about you know a very large

and had a big Leyden jar and one person

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:47.390
and had a big Leyden jar and one person
 

00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:48.640
and had a big Leyden jar and one person
touched a Leyden jar they were all

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:48.650
touched a Leyden jar they were all
 

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:51.279
touched a Leyden jar they were all
touching each other and then you could

00:56:51.279 --> 00:56:51.289
touching each other and then you could
 

00:56:51.289 --> 00:56:55.299
touching each other and then you could
observe that the that the shock that was

00:56:55.299 --> 00:56:55.309
observe that the that the shock that was
 

00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:57.279
observe that the that the shock that was
felt by the person farthest away from

the Leyden jar was occurring apparently

00:57:01.539 --> 00:57:01.549
the Leyden jar was occurring apparently
 

00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:03.700
the Leyden jar was occurring apparently
at the same time as the initial touching

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:03.710
at the same time as the initial touching
 

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:07.690
at the same time as the initial touching
of Leyden jar and that's what first gave

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:07.700
of Leyden jar and that's what first gave
 

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.059
of Leyden jar and that's what first gave
the idea of that electricity or one of

00:57:10.059 --> 00:57:10.069
the idea of that electricity or one of
 

00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:12.130
the idea of that electricity or one of
the first things they gave the idea that

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:12.140
the first things they gave the idea that
 

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:15.670
the first things they gave the idea that
electrical impulses travel essentially

well instantaneous movement is is very

well instantaneous movement is is very
 

00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:25.809
well instantaneous movement is is very
appealing so then the question was how

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:25.819
appealing so then the question was how
 

00:57:25.819 --> 00:57:29.890
