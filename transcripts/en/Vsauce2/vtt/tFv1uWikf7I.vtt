Vsauce!

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.060
Kevin here.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.310
Christmas: Rioting, getting drunk and demanding
food from rich people.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.620
The Twelfth Night of Christmas in Tudor-era
England reversed class roles, with peasants

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.330
being served by nobles - a tradition stemming
from the ancient Roman festival of Saturnalia.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.599
Even through the early 1800s, Christmas Day
in New York City saw the poor getting drunk

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:31.079
and rioting against the elite - extorting
food and drink and vandalizing their homes.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.680
The Santa Claus we know today was developed
in part to make the focus of the holiday giving

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.580
gifts to children, which kept the lower class
home with their families - and not out knocking

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.180
down doors for figgy pudding.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.580
The model for Santa was Saint Nicholas - a
4th century Christian saint famous for secret

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.940
gift-giving - like putting coins in the shoes
left out for him.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.530
And the name Santa Claus is a phonetic alteration
of the German Sankt Niklaus.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.600
After the Protestant Reformation, veneration
of saints fell out of favor throughout much

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.240
of Europe, so secret gift-giving and behavior-monitoring
fell upon folklore companions of Saint Nicholas

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.689
like Belsnickel - a ragged-looking man clad
in fur who threatened naughty kids with a

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:21.689
stick.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.799
An 1821 poem -- the first contemporary description
of Santa Claus -- reveals that he left a birch

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.130
rod in children's stockings so parents could
discipline them.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.409
That poem was called “The Children’s Friend.”

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.420
And suddenly coal sounds pretty good.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.649
Hanging stockings at Christmas evolved from
the practice of leaving carrots in boots near

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.080
the chimney to feed the Norse mythological
god Odin’s flying horse.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.889
Odin came down the chimney or fire hole and,
in exchange for the horse food, left candy.

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:59.999
Mistletoe has been revered for millennia because
it stays a vibrant green through the winter.

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:06.579
It also grows on oak trees, which were sacred
to Ancient Druids - with the likely derivation

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.140
of the word Druid being “One with knowledge
of the Oak”.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.319
Druids thought of kissing under mistletoe
as a love charm that promoted fertility because

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.540
mistletoe contained the soul of the beloved
oak tree... and also that it was the oak tree's

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.849
genitals.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.359
And as always - thanks for watching!
