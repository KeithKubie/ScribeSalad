00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:02.530
- We've already talked
about the 14th Amendment

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.420
in previous videos,
but just as a reminder,

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.247
Section 1 of the 14th Amendment says,

00:00:07.247 --> 00:00:09.847
"All persons born or naturalized
in the United States,

00:00:09.847 --> 00:00:12.027
"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,

00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:13.857
"are citizens of the United States

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:16.527
"and of the State wherein they reside.

00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:19.137
"No State shall make or enforce any law

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:21.357
"which shall abridge the
privileges or immunities

00:00:21.357 --> 00:00:23.137
"of citizens of the United States;

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:25.717
"nor shall any State deprive any person

00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:27.737
"of life, liberty, or property,

00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:30.577
"without the due process of law;

00:00:30.577 --> 00:00:34.127
"nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction

00:00:34.127 --> 00:00:37.600
"the equal protection of the laws."

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.170
And this last clause,
which I just underlined,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.470
the Equal Protection Clause,
has been cited many times,

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.740
not just in social justice movements

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.320
but in many Supreme Court cases.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.980
And what we're going to do in this video

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.240
is think about how rulings
by the Supreme Court

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.990
represent both continuity over time,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.080
but also change over
time, especially relative

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.330
to the protection of minority rights.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.360
One of the most significant test cases

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.490
of the 14th Amendment
happens almost 30 years

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.420
after the amendment is ratified in 1896.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.970
This is a situation where
the state of Louisiana

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.340
passes a law that African American people

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.270
have to sit in a separate
railcar from white people.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.970
And so you have this gentleman here,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.940
Homer Plessy, a resident of New Orleans,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.970
who decides to test this law.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.630
He sits in a white only car,

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.840
and he is 1/8 African American.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.920
And he gets arrested.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.480
This case eventually goes to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.000
the United States Supreme Court,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.700
and they rule that the Louisiana law

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.740
requiring separate cars
is not unconstitutional

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.460
as long as the cars
are judged to be equal.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.050
And this is where that term
"separate but equal" comes from.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.950
And this is viewed as a
fairly infamous ruling

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.120
because it was the
Supreme Court reinforcing

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.760
this idea of segregation, even after

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.840
the 14th Amendment had been
passed almost 30 years prior.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.030
Now, we go almost 60 years in the future

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.870
in order for segregation to be challenged

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.950
in a very significant way.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.010
Then we get to the case of Brown versus

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.030
Board of Education of
Topeka, Kansas in 1954,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.940
in which the then Supreme Court

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.247
rules that "No, segregation is not okay.

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:31.370
"Separate is inherently unequal."

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.250
And this right over here is a picture

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.740
of a desegregated
classroom around that time

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.790
although this is not in Topeka, Kansas.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.200
But it shows how based
on the passage of time,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.100
based on social norms, based on a change

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.000
in the make-up of the Supreme Court,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.400
how they can make rulings
that go one way or the other.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.840
Plessy versus Ferguson
reaffirms segregation.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.070
It's perceived to curtail minority rights

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.850
while Brown versus Board of
Education goes the other way.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.700
Once again, taking a look
at the 14th Amendment.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.960
Now, if we fast-forward to 1993,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.880
we have another really interesting

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.760
test case, Shaw versus Reno.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.770
This is a situation where
after the 1990 census

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.200
North Carolina takes a look
at its congressional districts

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.190
and sends them to review by
the federal Justice Department.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.010
The federal Justice Department decides

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.300
that the first pass
that North Carolina took

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.030
at the districting only had one

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.430
black majority congressional district.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.010
And they thought that there could be

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.930
two black majority
congressional districts.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.620
So, the state of North
Carolina redistricted again,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.690
and they created this 12th district here,

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.500
which you can see is
kind of a strange shape.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500
It's strung along over 160 miles
in this very thin district.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.550
Now, this was taken to the Supreme Court

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.610
by citizens of North Carolina saying that

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.420
this districting was a severe
case of gerrymandering,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.810
which we've talked about in other videos,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.950
and should be deemed unconstitutional.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.560
And the Supreme Court
actually did rule in 1993

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.010
that redistricting purely
on the basis of race,

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.580
as was done in this situation,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.600
even though it was with the intent

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.580
of having more minority representation

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.950
in Congress, that this
type of redistricting

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.210
on the basis of race was unconstitutional.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.650
This Supreme Court also cited
the Equal Protection Clause

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.987
and also cited the 14th Amendment saying,

00:04:23.987 --> 00:04:26.747
"Look, once you start redistricting

00:04:26.747 --> 00:04:29.547
"based on racial lines, it creates a type

00:04:29.547 --> 00:04:33.017
"of racial separation,
which is unconstitutional

00:04:33.017 --> 00:04:35.360
"by the 14th Amendment."

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.080
So, these are really good cases to know.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.610
They show how the Supreme Court

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.090
can rule differently depending

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.850
on what time period we are in

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.080
or depending on the circumstance.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.030
That often times when we think about

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.597
equal protection, we think about

00:04:49.597 --> 00:04:52.060
protection of minority rights.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.590
But as we saw in the
case of Shaw versus Reno,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.760
even when the intent of, in
this case gerrymandering,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.180
is to give more minority representation,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.290
it was deemed unconstitutional

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.190
because from the Supreme Court's

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.693
point of view violated the 14th Amendment.
