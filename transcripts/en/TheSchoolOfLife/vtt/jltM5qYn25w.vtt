00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.880
Since around 1750

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.940
we've been living in a highly distinctive era in the history of love

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.660
that we can call "romanticism".

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.160
Romanticism emerged as an ideology

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.180
in Europe in the mid 18th century

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.800
in the minds of poets, artists and philosophers.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.240
And it's now conquered the world.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.060
No single relationship ever follows the romantic template exactly.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.060
But it's broad outlines are frequently present, nevertheless.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.760
And can be summed up as follows:

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.420
Romanticism is deeply hopeful about marriage.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.240
Romanticism took marriage,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.040
hitherto seen as practical and emotionally temperate union,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.100
and fused it together with a passionate love story

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.300
to create a unique proposition of a life-long, passionate love marriage.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.620
Along the way romanticism united love and sex.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.700
Previously people had imagined that they could have sex with characters they didn't love,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.300
and that they could love someone without having extraordinary sex with them.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.620
Romanticism elevated sex to the supreme expression of love.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.420
Frequent, mutually satisfying sex became the bellwether of the health of any relationship.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.120
Without necessarily meaning to, romanticism made infrequent sex and adultery into catastrophes.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.480
Romanticism proposed that true love must mean an end to all loneliness.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.300
The right partner must, it promised, understand us entirely

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.260
possibly without needing even to speak to us.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.660
They would ensure it our souls.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.460
Romantics put a special premium on the idea that our partner might understand  us without needing to say anything.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.180
Romanticism believed that choosing a partner should be about letting oneself be guided by feelings,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.580
rather than practical considerations.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.280
You know you're in love because you have a special feeling.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.960
Romanticism has manifested a powerful disdain for practicalities and money.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.020
It feels cold or, as we say, unromantic

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.960
to say you know you're with the right person because the two of you make an excellent financial fit

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.000
or because you cherish the things like bathroom etiquette and attitudes to punctuality.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.640
Romanticism believes that true love is synonymous with accepting everything about someone.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.240
The idea that one's partner or oneself may need to change

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.620
is taken to be a sign that the relationship is on the rocks.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.760
"You're going to have to change" is a last ditch threat.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.020
This template of love is a historical creation.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.560
It's a hugely beautiful and often enjoyable one.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.080
But we can state boldly: romanticism has been a disaster for relationships.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.320
It's an intellectual and spiritual movement

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.080
which has had a devastating impact on the ability of ordinary people

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.680
to lead succesful emotional lives.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.380
The salvation of love lies in overcoming a succession of errors within romanticism.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.900
These are some of the myths of romanticism.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.760
That we should meet a person of extraordinary inner and outer beauty

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.280
and immediately feel a special attraction to them and they to us.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.200
We should have highly satisfying sex, not only at the start, but forever.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.380
We should never be attracted to anyone else

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.640
We should understand one another intuitively.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.800
We don't need an education in love.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.100
We may need to train to become a pilot or brain surgeon, but not a lover.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.800
We'll pick that up along the way by following our feelings.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.200
We should have no secrets and spend constant time together.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.740
Work won't get in the way.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.420
We should raise a family without any loss of sexual or emotional intensity.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.980
Our lover must be our soulmate, best friend, co-parent, co-chauffeur, accountant, household manager and spiritual guide.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.240
If we question the assumptions of the romantic view of love

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.660
it's not in order to destroy love, but to save it.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.460
We need to piece together a post-romantic theory of couples

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.880
because in order to make a relationship last

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.220
we have to be disloyal to the romantic emotions that get us into it in the first place.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.460
We need to replace the romantic template with a psychologically mature vision of love we might call "classical",

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.960
and which encourages in us a range of unfamiliar, but hopefully effective, attitudes.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.860
For example:

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.080
That it's normal that love and sex may not always belong together.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.940
That discussing money, early on, up front, in a serious way, is not a betrayal of love.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.480
That realizing that we're rather flawed, and our partner is too, is a huge benefit to a couple

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.540
because it increases the amount of tolerance and generosity in circulation.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.520
That we will never find everything in one person, nor they in us,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.740
not because of some unique flaw, but because that's just the way human nature is.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.680
That we need to make amends and often rather artificial sounding efforts to understand one another.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.920
That intuition can't get us where we need to go.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.500
And that spending two hours discussing whether bathroom towels should be hung up or can be left on the floor

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.260
is neither trivial nor unserious.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.860
There is a special dignity around issues of laundry and time keeping.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:02.020
All these attitudes and more belong to a new, more hopeful, post-romantic future for love.
