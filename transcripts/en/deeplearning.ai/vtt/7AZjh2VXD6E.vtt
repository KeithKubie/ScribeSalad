I hope you enjoyed this course and to help you complete it

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.259
I want to make sure that there are a few course resources that you know about

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.500
First if you have any questions

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.639
Or you want to discuss anything with the classmates or the teaching staff including me?

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.229
Or if you want to file a bug report the best place to do that is the discussion forum

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.359
The teaching staff and I will be modeling that regularly and this is also a good place for you to

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.839
Get answers to your questions from your classmates or if you wish try to answer your classmates questions

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.540
to get to the discussion forum from this course homepage if you look at this menu bar on the left you also might look a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.290
Bit different than mine, but they'll do this discussion forum tab which give you click on gives you to the discussion forum?

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:51.179

Can't guarantee that we'll be able to reply promptly to every email, but we will read every email that you send

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.779
Next I know that there are other companies that wish to train maybe large numbers of employees would be learning if you're responsible for

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.489
Employee training in your company and would like to train a hundred or more

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.299
employees
