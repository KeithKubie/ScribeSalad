the premise that we worked with we saw
 

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:41.189
the premise that we worked with we saw
that it could take as little as three

00:10:41.189 --> 00:10:41.199
that it could take as little as three
 

00:10:41.199 --> 00:10:43.980
that it could take as little as three
days to six weeks so we're saying it

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:43.990
days to six weeks so we're saying it
 

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.259
days to six weeks so we're saying it
average we think it can take from four

00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:46.269
average we think it can take from four
 

00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:47.939
average we think it can take from four
to six weeks it really depends on how

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:47.949
to six weeks it really depends on how
 

00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:49.999
to six weeks it really depends on how

so in March of last year we had spent a

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:10.960
so in March of last year we had spent a

so in March of last year we had spent a
lot of time pulling out poor playback

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.480
lot of time pulling out poor playback

functionality from the app into a
 

00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:17.760
functionality from the app into a
library and what we were doing with this

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:17.770
library and what we were doing with this
 

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.160
library and what we were doing with this
library was bringing this library into

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.170
library was bringing this library into
 

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.140

focus on modernizing our app we could

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:35.470
focus on modernizing our app we could
 

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.680
focus on modernizing our app we could
hit the ground running and really focus

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:37.690
hit the ground running and really focus
 

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.840

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.500
because we were in that first wave of
internet development there was very

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:55.510
internet development there was very
 

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.540
internet development there was very
little documentation we were learning as

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:57.550
little documentation we were learning as
 

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.060
little documentation we were learning as
we are going both sides and our

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:00.070
we are going both sides and our
 

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.100
we are going both sides and our
developer advocate Arun

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.110
developer advocate Arun
 

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.990
developer advocate Arun
really did a great job partnering with

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000
really did a great job partnering with
 

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.600
really did a great job partnering with
us to make sure we were set up for

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:06.610
us to make sure we were set up for
 

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.820
us to make sure we were set up for
success so we were getting quick

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:08.830
success so we were getting quick
 

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.310
success so we were getting quick
turnaround times on bug issues

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.320
turnaround times on bug issues
 

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.740
turnaround times on bug issues
status updates on issues and how they

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:13.750
status updates on issues and how they
 

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.650
status updates on issues and how they
were tracking google also vetted all the

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:16.660
were tracking google also vetted all the
 

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.540
were tracking google also vetted all the
third-party libraries that we were using

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:18.550
third-party libraries that we were using
 

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.890
third-party libraries that we were using
so we didn't have to worry about

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:19.900
so we didn't have to worry about
 

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.890
so we didn't have to worry about
compatibility issues they also gave us

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:22.900
compatibility issues they also gave us
 

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.530
compatibility issues they also gave us
tips on what we can do to reduce our apk

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:25.540
tips on what we can do to reduce our apk
 

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.630
tips on what we can do to reduce our apk
size and they shared a lot of their tips

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:27.640
size and they shared a lot of their tips
 

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.720
size and they shared a lot of their tips
at another iOS session today and we got

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:30.730
at another iOS session today and we got
 

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.270
at another iOS session today and we got
a lot of testing supports again being in

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:33.280
a lot of testing supports again being in
 

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.660
a lot of testing supports again being in
the first wave we had access or limited

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:36.670
the first wave we had access or limited
 

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.760
the first wave we had access or limited
access to devices so we couldn't do a

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:38.770
access to devices so we couldn't do a
 

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.190
access to devices so we couldn't do a
lot of testing in-house and we were also

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:41.200
lot of testing in-house and we were also
 

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.200
lot of testing in-house and we were also
under NDA so not a lot of people knew

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.210
under NDA so not a lot of people knew
 

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.200
under NDA so not a lot of people knew
what we were doing so then I would say

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.210
what we were doing so then I would say
 

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.230
what we were doing so then I would say
made it easy for us in terms of what was

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240
made it easy for us in terms of what was
 

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.180
made it easy for us in terms of what was
hardest I say the hardest thing for

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:51.190
hardest I say the hardest thing for
 

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.330
hardest I say the hardest thing for
periscope was just being aware of the

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:54.340
periscope was just being aware of the
 

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.120
periscope was just being aware of the
subtle differences between a regular app

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.130
subtle differences between a regular app
 

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.150
subtle differences between a regular app
and an instant app so instant ABS run in

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160
and an instant app so instant ABS run in
 

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.850
and an instant app so instant ABS run in
this sandboxed environment and what that

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:02.860
this sandboxed environment and what that
 

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.410
this sandboxed environment and what that
means is there's not a one-to-one

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:04.420
means is there's not a one-to-one
 

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.710
means is there's not a one-to-one
mapping of the API behavior between the

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720
mapping of the API behavior between the
 

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.130
mapping of the API behavior between the
regular app and instant app and we saw

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:11.140
regular app and instant app and we saw
 

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.050
regular app and instant app and we saw
this right away when we were looking at

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:13.060
this right away when we were looking at
 

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.140
this right away when we were looking at
how periscope parts were being rendered

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:15.150
how periscope parts were being rendered
 

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.610
how periscope parts were being rendered
periscope parts are like a core

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:17.620
periscope parts are like a core
 

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.180
periscope parts are like a core
experience in the periscope community

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:21.190
experience in the periscope community
 

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.850
experience in the periscope community
they're what viewers use to show their

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:23.860
they're what viewers use to show their
 

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.010
they're what viewers use to show their
supports and appreciation for what the

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:26.020
supports and appreciation for what the
 

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.590
supports and appreciation for what the
broadcaster is shown so getting this

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:28.600
broadcaster is shown so getting this
 

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.810
broadcaster is shown so getting this
experience right the periscope parts was

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:30.820
experience right the periscope parts was
 

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.180
experience right the periscope parts was
really critical for us it needed to be

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:33.190
really critical for us it needed to be
 

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.880
really critical for us it needed to be
exactly the same between the instant app

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:35.890
exactly the same between the instant app
 

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.580
exactly the same between the instant app
and the regular app and the fix for this

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:38.590
and the regular app and the fix for this
 

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.660
and the regular app and the fix for this
was actually easy what we were doing is

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:42.670
was actually easy what we were doing is
 

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.390
was actually easy what we were doing is
we were calling create bitmap and we are

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:45.400
we were calling create bitmap and we are
 

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.550
we were calling create bitmap and we are
using this three parameter version to

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.560
using this three parameter version to
 

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.790
using this three parameter version to
create a fit map it took Indah with the

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800
create a fit map it took Indah with the
 

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.400
create a fit map it took Indah with the
heights and the bitmap configuration but

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:53.410
heights and the bitmap configuration but
 

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.830
heights and the bitmap configuration but
in the internet world you need to give

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:55.840
in the internet world you need to give
 

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.440
in the internet world you need to give
it a little bit more information so the

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:58.450
it a little bit more information so the
 

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.660
it a little bit more information so the
fix here was we had to switch to using a

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:00.670
fix here was we had to switch to using a
 

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.880
fix here was we had to switch to using a
four parameter version and that fourth

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:02.890
four parameter version and that fourth
 

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.710
four parameter version and that fourth
parameter was one that took in the

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720
parameter was one that took in the
 

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.410
parameter was one that took in the
display metrics and that gave us the

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:07.420
display metrics and that gave us the
 

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.420
display metrics and that gave us the
density a compatibility mode in order to

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:09.430
density a compatibility mode in order to
 

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.760
density a compatibility mode in order to
render those bitmaps correctly in the

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:11.770
render those bitmaps correctly in the
 

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.760
render those bitmaps correctly in the
internet world so the key takeaway here

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:14.770
internet world so the key takeaway here
 

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.970
internet world so the key takeaway here
is just to really take a lot of time to

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:17.980
is just to really take a lot of time to
 

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.680
is just to really take a lot of time to
test your app thoroughly because there

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:19.690
test your app thoroughly because there
 

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.350
test your app thoroughly because there
may be a subtle difference in how the

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360
may be a subtle difference in how the
 

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.000
may be a subtle difference in how the
API behaves

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.010
API behaves
 

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.580
API behaves
in its naps because they are running in

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:26.590
in its naps because they are running in
 

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.090
in its naps because they are running in
this sandbox environment they have

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.100
this sandbox environment they have
 

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.650
this sandbox environment they have
restrictions and platform limitations in

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:31.660
restrictions and platform limitations in
 

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.170
restrictions and platform limitations in
order to make it secure for these

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:34.180
order to make it secure for these
 

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.650
order to make it secure for these
instant apps to run on the device and

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660
instant apps to run on the device and
 

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.270
instant apps to run on the device and
Google has come a long way since we

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:39.280
Google has come a long way since we
 

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.450
Google has come a long way since we
started again we were first wave and the

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:42.460
started again we were first wave and the
 

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.190
started again we were first wave and the
tooling and the support is really there

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:44.200
tooling and the support is really there
 

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.660
tooling and the support is really there
there's a lot of lint support in there

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:45.670
there's a lot of lint support in there
 

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.190
there's a lot of lint support in there
that will help developers with this yep

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:49.200
that will help developers with this yep
 

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:59.610
that will help developers with this yep
thank you so we move now to tiles we're

00:15:59.610 --> 00:15:59.620
thank you so we move now to tiles we're
 

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.500
thank you so we move now to tiles we're
going to talk about refactoring

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:00.510
going to talk about refactoring
 

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.930
going to talk about refactoring
refactoring is or can be the scariest

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:03.940
refactoring is or can be the scariest
 

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.820
refactoring is or can be the scariest
thing when you read the docs and you

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:05.830
thing when you read the docs and you
 

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.670
thing when you read the docs and you
think am I going to be able to do that

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680
think am I going to be able to do that
 

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.350
think am I going to be able to do that
so we wanted to talk about what it means

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.360
so we wanted to talk about what it means
 

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.930
so we wanted to talk about what it means
to refactor water

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:11.940
to refactor water
 

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.070
to refactor water
recommendations that Kyle can give the

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.080
recommendations that Kyle can give the
 

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.710
recommendations that Kyle can give the
audience in terms of how to make this

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720
audience in terms of how to make this
 

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.400
audience in terms of how to make this
process easier so Kyle would you give

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:20.410
process easier so Kyle would you give
 

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.220
process easier so Kyle would you give
the audience some recommendations on how

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:22.230
the audience some recommendations on how
 

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.570
the audience some recommendations on how
refactor the app but also how to reduce

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:24.580
refactor the app but also how to reduce
 

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.430
refactor the app but also how to reduce
the educate size yeah absolutely

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440
the educate size yeah absolutely
 

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.340
the educate size yeah absolutely
so the VA was app itself the full app

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:29.350
so the VA was app itself the full app
 

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.040
so the VA was app itself the full app
actually started 16 megabytes and to get

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.050
actually started 16 megabytes and to get
 

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:33.480
actually started 16 megabytes and to get
down to an instant app you need to have

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:33.490
down to an instant app you need to have
 

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.420
down to an instant app you need to have
each feature be four megabytes so for us

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:36.430
each feature be four megabytes so for us
 

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.310
each feature be four megabytes so for us
we were going to build a player instant

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320
we were going to build a player instant
 

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.620
we were going to build a player instant
app that we needed to chop down a lot of

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:40.630
app that we needed to chop down a lot of
 

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.070
app that we needed to chop down a lot of
megabytes on um so with that we found a

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:44.080
megabytes on um so with that we found a
 

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.510
megabytes on um so with that we found a
lot of different tools we could use and

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:45.520
lot of different tools we could use and
 

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.710
lot of different tools we could use and
different things we could do to

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720
different things we could do to
 

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.630
different things we could do to
accommodate that and get there as fast

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:48.640
accommodate that and get there as fast
 

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.450
accommodate that and get there as fast
as possible one of the we kind of

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:51.460
as possible one of the we kind of
 

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.770
as possible one of the we kind of
started with a low-hanging fruit of the

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:52.780
started with a low-hanging fruit of the
 

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.340
started with a low-hanging fruit of the
easy things so of that you have a tool

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:56.350
easy things so of that you have a tool
 

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.780
easy things so of that you have a tool
that's built actually right into Android

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:57.790
that's built actually right into Android
 

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.450
that's built actually right into Android
studio which is for removing unused

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:00.460
studio which is for removing unused
 

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.070
studio which is for removing unused
resources so you extras going to

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:02.080
resources so you extras going to
 

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.560
resources so you extras going to
refactor on Android studio removed on

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:04.570
refactor on Android studio removed on
 

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:05.940
refactor on Android studio removed on
these resources and that'll kill things

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:05.950
these resources and that'll kill things
 

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.640
these resources and that'll kill things
like layout files that aren't being

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:08.650
like layout files that aren't being
 

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.650
like layout files that aren't being
referenced anymore and then because of

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:10.660
referenced anymore and then because of
 

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.150
referenced anymore and then because of
that it will remove any pngs and are

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160
that it will remove any pngs and are
 

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.140
that it will remove any pngs and are
being used anymore

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.150
being used anymore
 

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.580
being used anymore
so that's a really good place to start

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:14.590
so that's a really good place to start
 

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:18.180
so that's a really good place to start
that's kind of where we began the next

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:18.190
that's kind of where we began the next
 

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.190
that's kind of where we began the next
piece is actually little bit meteor and

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:20.200
piece is actually little bit meteor and
 

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.260
piece is actually little bit meteor and
more technical and I guess that advice

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:22.270
more technical and I guess that advice
 

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.560
more technical and I guess that advice
is basically trying to look and draw out

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:25.570
is basically trying to look and draw out
 

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:28.650
is basically trying to look and draw out
a dependency tree for whatever feature

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:28.660
a dependency tree for whatever feature
 

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.270
a dependency tree for whatever feature
you're trying to turn into an instant

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280
you're trying to turn into an instant
 

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.180
you're trying to turn into an instant
app so for look what would that end up

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:33.190
app so for look what would that end up
 

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.410
app so for look what would that end up
looking like is basically taking the

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:34.420
looking like is basically taking the
 

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.780
looking like is basically taking the
activity or fragment and then look at

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:36.790
activity or fragment and then look at
 

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.660
activity or fragment and then look at
all the imports

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:37.670
all the imports
 

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.760
all the imports
the file and then see what those

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:39.770
the file and then see what those
 

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.920
the file and then see what those
importance what those point2 and what

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:41.930
importance what those point2 and what
 

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.480
importance what those point2 and what
their dependencies are and it actually

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:43.490
their dependencies are and it actually
 

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.760
their dependencies are and it actually
helps us to draw this out just you can

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:45.770
helps us to draw this out just you can
 

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.580
helps us to draw this out just you can
see exactly what classes this feature

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:48.590
see exactly what classes this feature
 

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.730
see exactly what classes this feature
will depend on so in our case we

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:51.740
will depend on so in our case we
 

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.590
will depend on so in our case we
actually started by you know we thought

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600
actually started by you know we thought
 

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.200
actually started by you know we thought
all along that we had then modular izing

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.210
all along that we had then modular izing
 

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.210
all along that we had then modular izing
our code making it super easy to just

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:58.220
our code making it super easy to just
 

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.610
our code making it super easy to just
pull out all like our player activity

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:00.620
pull out all like our player activity
 

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.590
pull out all like our player activity
was inside of our player package so we

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600
was inside of our player package so we
 

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.600
was inside of our player package so we
started out by just trying to cut that

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:04.610
started out by just trying to cut that
 

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.470
started out by just trying to cut that
and paste it into a module so in doing

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480
and paste it into a module so in doing
 

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.910
and paste it into a module so in doing
so we were like oh hopefully this is

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:09.920
so we were like oh hopefully this is
 

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.920
so we were like oh hopefully this is
going to work but sure enough ended up

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:11.930
going to work but sure enough ended up
 

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.120
going to work but sure enough ended up
having a whole bunch of those red

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:13.130
having a whole bunch of those red
 

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.560
having a whole bunch of those red
squiggly lines on all of our import

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:14.570
squiggly lines on all of our import
 

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.990
squiggly lines on all of our import
statements which was of course daunting

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000
statements which was of course daunting
 

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.880
statements which was of course daunting
but from there we kind of started

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:18.890
but from there we kind of started
 

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:19.840
but from there we kind of started
figuring out well what are the things

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:19.850
figuring out well what are the things
 

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.070
figuring out well what are the things
that we can cut down on what are the

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080
that we can cut down on what are the
 

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.960
that we can cut down on what are the
dependencies we can remove from our

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:22.970
dependencies we can remove from our
 

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.870
dependencies we can remove from our
player activity so what that ended up

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:25.880
player activity so what that ended up
 

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.130
player activity so what that ended up
looking like I guess a concrete example

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:27.140
looking like I guess a concrete example
 

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.890
looking like I guess a concrete example
we ran into was we use fresco for our

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:29.900
we ran into was we use fresco for our
 

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.380
we ran into was we use fresco for our
image caching which if you're unfamiliar

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:32.390
image caching which if you're unfamiliar
 

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.150
image caching which if you're unfamiliar
is actually a pretty large library it's

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160
is actually a pretty large library it's
 

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.190
is actually a pretty large library it's
great because it's super performing but

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200
great because it's super performing but
 

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.170
great because it's super performing but
it's around two megabytes which in the

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:38.180
it's around two megabytes which in the
 

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.730
it's around two megabytes which in the
world of instant apps is absolutely

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:39.740
world of instant apps is absolutely
 

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.960
world of instant apps is absolutely
massive

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:40.970
massive
 

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.910
massive
I mean it's half of your requirement for

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:42.920
I mean it's half of your requirement for
 

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.300
I mean it's half of your requirement for
a feature so we basically had to find a

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:46.310
a feature so we basically had to find a
 

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.790
a feature so we basically had to find a
way to pull out fresco and then swap in

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:48.800
way to pull out fresco and then swap in
 

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.680
way to pull out fresco and then swap in
some other form of image caching so what

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:50.690
some other form of image caching so what
 

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.600
some other form of image caching so what
that end up looking like was we created

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:52.610
that end up looking like was we created
 

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.430
that end up looking like was we created
this interface which handles all of our

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440
this interface which handles all of our
 

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.340
this interface which handles all of our
image caching for us which you then can

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:57.350
image caching for us which you then can
 

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.200
image caching for us which you then can
basically stub in and inject which

00:18:59.200 --> 00:18:59.210
basically stub in and inject which
 

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.240
basically stub in and inject which
different implementations like to use so

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.250
different implementations like to use so
 

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.340
different implementations like to use so
the way that we use so basically for our

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:03.350
the way that we use so basically for our
 

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.680
the way that we use so basically for our
full app we use fresco because we like

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:05.690
full app we use fresco because we like
 

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.050
full app we use fresco because we like
the performance but then for the instant

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:08.060
the performance but then for the instant
 

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.550
the performance but then for the instant
app we use Picasso which is only a

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:09.560
app we use Picasso which is only a
 

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.830
app we use Picasso which is only a
couple hundred kilobytes which of course

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840
couple hundred kilobytes which of course
 

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.900
couple hundred kilobytes which of course
we still get image caching may not be as

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:13.910
we still get image caching may not be as
 

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.140
we still get image caching may not be as
fast but it still works so that was a

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:17.150
fast but it still works so that was a
 

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.870
fast but it still works so that was a
big piece for us the last thing is

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880
big piece for us the last thing is
 

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.890
big piece for us the last thing is
something we actually I think kind of

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:20.900
something we actually I think kind of
 

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.960
something we actually I think kind of
did relatively well which was relying

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:22.970
did relatively well which was relying
 

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.290
did relatively well which was relying
pretty heavily on composition so for the

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:26.300
pretty heavily on composition so for the
 

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.460
pretty heavily on composition so for the
player activity we of course have this

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:27.470
player activity we of course have this
 

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:28.930
player activity we of course have this
player component that we rely very

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:28.940
player component that we rely very
 

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.090
player component that we rely very
heavily on for all of our playback now

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:31.100
heavily on for all of our playback now
 

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.760
heavily on for all of our playback now
our player has to be able to accommodate

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:32.770
our player has to be able to accommodate
 

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.260
our player has to be able to accommodate
360 video playback it has to be able to

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:35.270
360 video playback it has to be able to
 

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.230
360 video playback it has to be able to
do chrome casting we have offline

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240
do chrome casting we have offline
 

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.900
do chrome casting we have offline
playback of encrypted files first so you

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:40.910
playback of encrypted files first so you
 

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.750
playback of encrypted files first so you
can download to watch later and because

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760
can download to watch later and because
 

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.250
can download to watch later and because
of that we we knew we had to build our

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:45.260
of that we we knew we had to build our
 

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.300
of that we we knew we had to build our
player in such a way that we could

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:46.310
player in such a way that we could
 

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.190
player in such a way that we could
easily add in these pieces or inject

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200
easily add in these pieces or inject
 

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.920
easily add in these pieces or inject
them in so because we have

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:50.930
them in so because we have
 

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.870
them in so because we have
the same codebase really for both our

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880
the same codebase really for both our
 

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.500
the same codebase really for both our
mobile apps and our TV Android out we

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:56.510
mobile apps and our TV Android out we
 

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.600
mobile apps and our TV Android out we
started this process because we didn't

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:58.610
started this process because we didn't
 

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.190
started this process because we didn't
need things like that it ended up

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200
need things like that it ended up
 

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.200
need things like that it ended up
benefiting us in the long run using

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:02.210
benefiting us in the long run using
 

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.700
benefiting us in the long run using
dependency injection at that level

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:03.710
dependency injection at that level
 

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.470
dependency injection at that level
because then for our instant app we

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480
because then for our instant app we
 

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.770
because then for our instant app we
actually don't need to have 360 we don't

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:08.780
actually don't need to have 360 we don't
 

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.760
actually don't need to have 360 we don't
need chromecast

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:09.770
need chromecast
 

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:10.990
need chromecast
we don't need offline playback because

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000
we don't need offline playback because
 

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.160
we don't need offline playback because
it's not currently supported by in

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:12.170
it's not currently supported by in
 

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.810
it's not currently supported by in
synapse so it's actually really easy

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:13.820
synapse so it's actually really easy
 

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.940
synapse so it's actually really easy
just to remove these large dependencies

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:15.950
just to remove these large dependencies
 

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.890
just to remove these large dependencies
so with 360 you get things like the

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:17.900
so with 360 you get things like the
 

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.230
so with 360 you get things like the
cardboard SDK which is pretty large or

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240
cardboard SDK which is pretty large or
 

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.820
cardboard SDK which is pretty large or
with chromecast you have Play services

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:21.830
with chromecast you have Play services
 

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.950
with chromecast you have Play services
which is also pretty large offline

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:23.960
which is also pretty large offline
 

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.970
which is also pretty large offline
playback cut a whole bunch of like

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:24.980
playback cut a whole bunch of like
 

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.130
playback cut a whole bunch of like
encrypt your files

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:26.140
encrypt your files
 

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.150
encrypt your files
so basically we're able to remove those

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:28.160
so basically we're able to remove those
 

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.830
so basically we're able to remove those
right off the bat and that saves us a

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840
right off the bat and that saves us a
 

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.200
right off the bat and that saves us a
ton of space so I guess basically just

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:32.210
ton of space so I guess basically just
 

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.930
ton of space so I guess basically just
to sum up all that stuff it's it's

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:34.940
to sum up all that stuff it's it's
 

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.010
to sum up all that stuff it's it's
really a matter of just looking your

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:36.020
really a matter of just looking your
 

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.400
really a matter of just looking your
dependencies seeing exactly what depends

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:39.410
dependencies seeing exactly what depends
 

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:40.630
dependencies seeing exactly what depends
on what what our things are absolutely

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640
on what what our things are absolutely
 

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.310
on what what our things are absolutely
necessary and if there's something with

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320
necessary and if there's something with
 

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.080
necessary and if there's something with
relatively large think about wrapping it

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.090
relatively large think about wrapping it
 

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.610
relatively large think about wrapping it
in an interface try to compose your

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:45.620
in an interface try to compose your
 

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.560
in an interface try to compose your
different pieces with that interface you

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:47.570
different pieces with that interface you
 

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.780
different pieces with that interface you
can either potentially omit it entirely

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:49.790
can either potentially omit it entirely
 

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.730
can either potentially omit it entirely
or swap it for something smaller like we

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:51.740
or swap it for something smaller like we
 

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.299
or swap it for something smaller like we
did with fresco and then also for people

00:20:55.299 --> 00:20:55.309
did with fresco and then also for people
 

00:20:55.309 --> 00:20:56.590
did with fresco and then also for people
that are going to be building new

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600
that are going to be building new
 

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.210
that are going to be building new
features going forward something that

00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:58.220
features going forward something that
 

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.650
features going forward something that
we've started doing and has helped us a

00:20:59.650 --> 00:20:59.660
we've started doing and has helped us a
 

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.830
we've started doing and has helped us a
ton it's actually just we built a new

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840
ton it's actually just we built a new
 

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.510
ton it's actually just we built a new
feature into your app build it as a

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520
feature into your app build it as a
 

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.120
feature into your app build it as a
module build its own totally a library

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:07.130
module build its own totally a library
 

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.220
module build its own totally a library
module that your main app depends on and

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:09.230
module that your main app depends on and
 

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.350
module that your main app depends on and
then keep an eye on that build.gradle

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360
then keep an eye on that build.gradle
 

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.299
then keep an eye on that build.gradle
file because that'll tell you exactly

00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:13.309
file because that'll tell you exactly
 

00:21:13.309 --> 00:21:14.530
file because that'll tell you exactly
all the things that are consuming all

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:14.540
all the things that are consuming all
 

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.970
all the things that are consuming all
the space and those are the things that

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:15.980
the space and those are the things that
 

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.590
the space and those are the things that
are gonna get you in the end and of

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600
are gonna get you in the end and of
 

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.820
are gonna get you in the end and of
course if anyone has any questions about

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:18.830
course if anyone has any questions about
 

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.290
course if anyone has any questions about
our particular implementation you can

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:20.300
our particular implementation you can
 

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.530
our particular implementation you can
feel free to ask me after thank you

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:23.540
feel free to ask me after thank you
 

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.980
feel free to ask me after thank you
of course

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:28.990
 
 

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.960
 
so I think that that's a good segue into

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:31.970
so I think that that's a good segue into
 

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.080
so I think that that's a good segue into
the next question

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.090
the next question
 

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.300
the next question
doing some of this work that you do for

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:37.310
doing some of this work that you do for
 

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.520
doing some of this work that you do for
your instant app may result in benefits

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:39.530
your instant app may result in benefits
 

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.890
your instant app may result in benefits
for your installed up or you installable

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:41.900
for your installed up or you installable
 

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:46.210
for your installed up or you installable
up so that's like free a free wing that

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:46.220
up so that's like free a free wing that
 

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.470
up so that's like free a free wing that
you're getting when you're doing this

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480
you're getting when you're doing this
 

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.980
you're getting when you're doing this
work so Anna what was was there any

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:50.990
work so Anna what was was there any
 

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.100
work so Anna what was was there any
benefit or did the work that you did on

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:54.110
benefit or did the work that you did on
 

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.320
benefit or did the work that you did on
your instant knob have any benefits on

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:56.330
your instant knob have any benefits on
 

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.280
your instant knob have any benefits on
your installable up yes yes it had so

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:00.290
your installable up yes yes it had so
 

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.590
your installable up yes yes it had so
when we started to work on our instance

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600
when we started to work on our instance
 

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.300
when we started to work on our instance
up we knew that we are going to change

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:04.310
up we knew that we are going to change
 

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.760
up we knew that we are going to change
the structure of our projects this

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:06.770
the structure of our projects this
 

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.490
the structure of our projects this
because within sometimes you give users

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:09.500
because within sometimes you give users
 

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.710
because within sometimes you give users
the opportunity to after the feature

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.720
the opportunity to after the feature
 

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.630
the opportunity to after the feature
from your application and this means it

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640
from your application and this means it
 

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.240
from your application and this means it
has to be in a separated module so this

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:16.250
has to be in a separated module so this
 

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.800
has to be in a separated module so this
was one of the biggest challenges that

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:17.810
was one of the biggest challenges that
 

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.950
was one of the biggest challenges that
we faced because we didn't have modules

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960
we faced because we didn't have modules
 

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.070
we faced because we didn't have modules
and we brainstormed a lot in order to

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080
and we brainstormed a lot in order to
 

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.840
and we brainstormed a lot in order to
find a way to split all projects in

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:25.850
find a way to split all projects in
 

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.210
find a way to split all projects in
meaningful units that could be used in

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:28.220
meaningful units that could be used in
 

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.880
meaningful units that could be used in
both insult up and doing sums up because

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:30.890
both insult up and doing sums up because
 

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.370
both insult up and doing sums up because
we we took this approaches we didn't

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:33.380
we we took this approaches we didn't
 

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.560
we we took this approaches we didn't
want to have the feeling in the future

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:35.570
want to have the feeling in the future
 

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:37.060
want to have the feeling in the future
that we are going to maintain two

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:37.070
that we are going to maintain two
 

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.140
that we are going to maintain two
different applications so because it was

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:41.150
different applications so because it was
 

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.210
different applications so because it was
such a big change we decided to do it

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:43.220
such a big change we decided to do it
 

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.970
such a big change we decided to do it
gradually and as we release often we

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:45.980
gradually and as we release often we
 

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.790
gradually and as we release often we
didn't want to have any impact on on our

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:48.800
didn't want to have any impact on on our
 

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.440
didn't want to have any impact on on our
customers so now having more modules it

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:53.450
customers so now having more modules it
 

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.080
customers so now having more modules it
increased our build time but the Indians

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:56.090
increased our build time but the Indians
 

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.410
increased our build time but the Indians
we learn so much during this process we

00:22:59.410 --> 00:22:59.420
we learn so much during this process we
 

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.730
we learn so much during this process we
have a better project structure and I

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:02.740
have a better project structure and I
 

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.050
have a better project structure and I
think with the new tools that were

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.060
think with the new tools that were
 

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.730
think with the new tools that were
announced today we are going to see some

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:06.740
announced today we are going to see some
 

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.970
announced today we are going to see some
improvements some other improvements

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:09.980
improvements some other improvements
 

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.850
improvements some other improvements
that we did with our in our application

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:12.860
that we did with our in our application
 

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.740
that we did with our in our application
were to reduce the size of the apk and

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:16.750
were to reduce the size of the apk and
 

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.640
were to reduce the size of the apk and
the number of methods and how we we did

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:21.650
the number of methods and how we we did
 

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.770
the number of methods and how we we did
it we started by looking our Prague our

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:23.780
it we started by looking our Prague our
 

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.420
it we started by looking our Prague our
files just to make sure we haven't

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:25.430
files just to make sure we haven't
 

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.720
files just to make sure we haven't
missed anything and then we looked at

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:28.730
missed anything and then we looked at
 

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.870
missed anything and then we looked at
the libraries that we used and we

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880
the libraries that we used and we
 

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.820
the libraries that we used and we
decided to remove some of them for

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:33.830
decided to remove some of them for
 

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.160
decided to remove some of them for
others we looked for a lighter version

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:36.170
others we looked for a lighter version
 

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.110
others we looked for a lighter version
as we replace them and

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120
as we replace them and
 

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.570
as we replace them and
then we actually noticed something

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580
then we actually noticed something
 

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.610
then we actually noticed something
interesting so while we are

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620
interesting so while we are
 

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.430
interesting so while we are
investigating why our resources are so

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440
investigating why our resources are so
 

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.490
investigating why our resources are so
big we found out that some libraries has

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500
big we found out that some libraries has
 

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.100
big we found out that some libraries has
lots of strings that were localized in

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.110
lots of strings that were localized in
 

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.049
lots of strings that were localized in
so many languages that we didn't used in

00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.059
so many languages that we didn't used in
 

00:23:54.059 --> 00:23:56.780
so many languages that we didn't used in
our application so we change the Gradle

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:56.790
our application so we change the Gradle
 

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:59.270
our application so we change the Gradle
script so that we can include only the

00:23:59.270 --> 00:23:59.280
script so that we can include only the
 

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.490
script so that we can include only the
seven languages that we support and this

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500
seven languages that we support and this
 

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.450
seven languages that we support and this
also decreased the size of already case

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:04.460
also decreased the size of already case
 

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:08.510
also decreased the size of already case
so after all these changes we notice a

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520
so after all these changes we notice a
 

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.880
so after all these changes we notice a
decrease in our application size by

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:10.890
decrease in our application size by
 

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:15.680
decrease in our application size by
about 20% and other changes that with

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:15.690
about 20% and other changes that with
 

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.710
about 20% and other changes that with
this but not necessarily related to

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720
this but not necessarily related to
 

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.380
this but not necessarily related to
refactoring but they were related to the

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:21.390
refactoring but they were related to the
 

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.660
refactoring but they were related to the
fact that we were building an instant up

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:23.670
fact that we were building an instant up
 

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.810
fact that we were building an instant up
so one example was adding smart lock for

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820
so one example was adding smart lock for
 

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:32.120
so one example was adding smart lock for
passwords this was recommended to having

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.130
passwords this was recommended to having
 

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.370
passwords this was recommended to having
any thumbs up and it was very easy to

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:34.380
any thumbs up and it was very easy to
 

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.820
any thumbs up and it was very easy to
integrate and we felt that it was a very

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:37.830
integrate and we felt that it was a very
 

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.430
integrate and we felt that it was a very
good feature and we decided to have it

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440
good feature and we decided to have it
 

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.070
good feature and we decided to have it
in our installed app as well as we

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080
in our installed app as well as we
 

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.080
in our installed app as well as we
simplify the sign-in experience for our

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.090
simplify the sign-in experience for our
 

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:49.400

the audience we are constantly improving
 

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.310
the audience we are constantly improving
our application and during this program

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320
our application and during this program
 

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.880
our application and during this program
we learn so many things we have we have

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:01.890
we learn so many things we have we have
 

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.700
we learn so many things we have we have
now a better project structure we remove

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:04.710
now a better project structure we remove
 

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.520
now a better project structure we remove
some of the libraries we kept only the

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:07.530
some of the libraries we kept only the
 

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.720
some of the libraries we kept only the
ones that work truly helpful for us and

ones that work truly helpful for us and
 

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.940
ones that work truly helpful for us and
I will say that the fact that we

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:13.950
I will say that the fact that we
 

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.130
I will say that the fact that we
decrease the apk size gave us a big

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140
decrease the apk size gave us a big
 

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.060

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:49.740
now we're going to go to Lucas and this
 

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.740
now we're going to go to Lucas and this
is our last question before Q&amp;A

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:52.750
is our last question before Q&amp;A
 

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:56.850

so Lucas now that you've gone through

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:56.860
so Lucas now that you've gone through
 

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.470
so Lucas now that you've gone through
the process of building an instant out

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480
the process of building an instant out
 

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.710
the process of building an instant out
for Zillow what are some recommendations

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720
for Zillow what are some recommendations
 

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.470
for Zillow what are some recommendations
or what what are the things that you

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480
or what what are the things that you
 

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.510
or what what are the things that you
wish it known before you started this

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520
wish it known before you started this
 

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.500
wish it known before you started this
process yeah so I think one of the big

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:10.510
process yeah so I think one of the big
 

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.940
process yeah so I think one of the big
recommendations I would have is to

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:11.950
recommendations I would have is to
 

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.040
recommendations I would have is to
definitely sit down and read through all

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.050
definitely sit down and read through all
 

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.950
definitely sit down and read through all
the requirements for Internet's and make

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960
the requirements for Internet's and make
 

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.540
the requirements for Internet's and make
sure that everything you think you have

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:18.550
sure that everything you think you have
 

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.220
sure that everything you think you have
implemented you actually test to make

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:20.230
implemented you actually test to make
 

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.470
implemented you actually test to make
sure you have implemented so for the

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480
sure you have implemented so for the
 

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.910
sure you have implemented so for the
longest time we thought we had a

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:23.920
longest time we thought we had a
 

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.770
longest time we thought we had a
plinking and blended correctly in our

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:25.780
plinking and blended correctly in our
 

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.320
plinking and blended correctly in our
regular app the problem was we went to

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.330
regular app the problem was we went to
 

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.210
regular app the problem was we went to
test it to make sure that it was working

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:30.220
test it to make sure that it was working
 

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.490
test it to make sure that it was working
it didn't so we had the kind of whole

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:32.500
it didn't so we had the kind of whole
 

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.190
it didn't so we had the kind of whole
development on our instant app and make

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200
development on our instant app and make
 

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.920
development on our instant app and make
sure that we got app linking actually

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:37.930
sure that we got app linking actually
 

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.730
sure that we got app linking actually
working in our main app and so you know

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:41.740
working in our main app and so you know
 

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.640
working in our main app and so you know
just make sure that you look all that

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:44.650
just make sure that you look all that
 

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:47.250
just make sure that you look all that
over and pet for sure test it before you

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:47.260
over and pet for sure test it before you
 

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.200
over and pet for sure test it before you
just start working on this and app

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:49.210
just start working on this and app
 

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:53.540
just start working on this and app
another thing to keep in mind is that

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:53.550
another thing to keep in mind is that
 

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.010
another thing to keep in mind is that
network calls and in synapse all have to

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:56.020
network calls and in synapse all have to
 

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.830
network calls and in synapse all have to
be secured network hauled so we had to

00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840
be secured network hauled so we had to
 

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.080
be secured network hauled so we had to
go through and audit our network library

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:01.090
go through and audit our network library
 

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.700
go through and audit our network library
to make sure that everything we had was

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:02.710
to make sure that everything we had was
 

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.640
to make sure that everything we had was
using secure network called and we also

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:05.650
using secure network called and we also
 

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:07.380
using secure network called and we also
had audit all the third-party libraries

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:07.390
had audit all the third-party libraries
 

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.450
had audit all the third-party libraries
who are using it turns out one of our

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:09.460
who are using it turns out one of our
 

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:12.270
who are using it turns out one of our
analytics libraries was using unsecured

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:12.280
analytics libraries was using unsecured
 

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.040
analytics libraries was using unsecured
Network calls and then they were just

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.050
Network calls and then they were just
 

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.330
Network calls and then they were just
basically not working all in instant

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:15.340
basically not working all in instant
 

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.750
basically not working all in instant
apps to go through and make sure that

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760
apps to go through and make sure that
 

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.790
apps to go through and make sure that
you can either work around those Network

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:20.800
you can either work around those Network
 

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.580
you can either work around those Network
calls in your instant app or you know

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:23.590
calls in your instant app or you know
 

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:26.820
calls in your instant app or you know
reimplemented in a secure way another

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:26.830
reimplemented in a secure way another
 

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.980
reimplemented in a secure way another
big thing that I would recommend is to

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:28.990
big thing that I would recommend is to
 

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:33.210
big thing that I would recommend is to
get very familiar with build tools like

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:33.220
get very familiar with build tools like
 

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:37.820
get very familiar with build tools like
Kyle Record recommended the apk analyzer

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:37.830
Kyle Record recommended the apk analyzer
 

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.610
Kyle Record recommended the apk analyzer
I think probably around 70% of our work

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:41.620
I think probably around 70% of our work
 

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.040
I think probably around 70% of our work
was to cut our app size down and these

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:44.050
was to cut our app size down and these
 

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:47.940
was to cut our app size down and these
tools are definitely a lifesaver another

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:47.950
tools are definitely a lifesaver another
 

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.210
tools are definitely a lifesaver another
tool that we ended up using a lot was

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:50.220
tool that we ended up using a lot was
 

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.850
tool that we ended up using a lot was
actual gradle dependencies which would

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860
actual gradle dependencies which would
 

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.740
actual gradle dependencies which would
print out a whole dependency tree for

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:54.750
print out a whole dependency tree for
 

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.140
print out a whole dependency tree for
you and it will not only show you the

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:57.150
you and it will not only show you the
 

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.060
you and it will not only show you the
libraries that you depend on but the

00:27:59.060 --> 00:27:59.070
libraries that you depend on but the
 

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.669
libraries that you depend on but the
libraries that those libraries depend on

00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679
libraries that those libraries depend on
 

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:02.960
libraries that those libraries depend on
so you can see all your transitive

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:02.970
so you can see all your transitive
 

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:06.130
so you can see all your transitive
dependencies and you can actually

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:06.140
dependencies and you can actually
 

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.899
dependencies and you can actually
through Gradle you can exclude some of

00:28:08.899 --> 00:28:08.909
through Gradle you can exclude some of
 

00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:11.390
through Gradle you can exclude some of
those transitive dependencies so we were

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.400
those transitive dependencies so we were
 

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.130
those transitive dependencies so we were
able to exclude like third-party

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140
able to exclude like third-party
 

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.649
able to exclude like third-party
Analytics libraries and that was able to

00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:15.659
Analytics libraries and that was able to
 

00:28:15.659 --> 00:28:17.630
Analytics libraries and that was able to
help cut down the size of our app quite

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640
help cut down the size of our app quite
 

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.080
help cut down the size of our app quite
a bit and then another thing to look at

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:21.090
a bit and then another thing to look at
 

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.470
a bit and then another thing to look at
for size lies is your assets make sure

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480
for size lies is your assets make sure
 

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.450
for size lies is your assets make sure
you're not using really detailed assets

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460
you're not using really detailed assets
 

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.890
you're not using really detailed assets
when they can't really tell the

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900
when they can't really tell the
 

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.960
when they can't really tell the
difference I think we ended up just

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:29.970
difference I think we ended up just
 

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.180
difference I think we ended up just
totally removing our two most detailed

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:32.190
totally removing our two most detailed
 

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.909
totally removing our two most detailed
folders of assets and that ended up

00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919
folders of assets and that ended up
 

00:28:34.919 --> 00:28:36.890
folders of assets and that ended up
helping to get us actually down below 4

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900
helping to get us actually down below 4
 

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.470
helping to get us actually down below 4
Meg's so that we could actually get her

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480
Meg's so that we could actually get her
 

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.210
Meg's so that we could actually get her
instant app up and running that was

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220
instant app up and running that was
 

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.020
instant app up and running that was
working and last thing we found out was

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.030
working and last thing we found out was
 

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:47.419
working and last thing we found out was
we had a crasher on startup of our

00:28:47.419 --> 00:28:47.429
we had a crasher on startup of our
 

00:28:47.429 --> 00:28:51.350
we had a crasher on startup of our
instant app and one way that we were

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360
instant app and one way that we were
 

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.360
instant app and one way that we were
able to debug it was I

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:53.370
able to debug it was I
 

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.870
able to debug it was I
since instant apps are just a zip file

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880
since instant apps are just a zip file
 

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.380
since instant apps are just a zip file
with feature module apks you can

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:00.390
with feature module apks you can
 

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.960
with feature module apks you can
actually side load those apks onto your

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:02.970
actually side load those apks onto your
 

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.270
actually side load those apks onto your
phone like you would a regular app and

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:05.280
phone like you would a regular app and
 

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.250
phone like you would a regular app and
that way when you start it up it would

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260
that way when you start it up it would
 

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.899
that way when you start it up it would
start up just like the regular app would

00:29:08.899 --> 00:29:08.909
start up just like the regular app would
 

00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:11.049
start up just like the regular app would
and you wouldn't lose some of these

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:11.059
and you wouldn't lose some of these
 

00:29:11.059 --> 00:29:15.710
and you wouldn't lose some of these
exceptions in the Indus factories and I

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720
exceptions in the Indus factories and I
 

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.720
exceptions in the Indus factories and I
think the last thing I'd like to say is

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:17.730
think the last thing I'd like to say is
 

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:21.470
think the last thing I'd like to say is
that you know it kind of it sounds like

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480
that you know it kind of it sounds like
 

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.240
that you know it kind of it sounds like
this might be a difficult thing to do

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:23.250
this might be a difficult thing to do
 

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.000
this might be a difficult thing to do
but trust me it's worth it I think it

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.010
but trust me it's worth it I think it
 

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.070
but trust me it's worth it I think it
