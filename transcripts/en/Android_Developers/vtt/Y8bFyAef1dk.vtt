[electronic music]

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:31.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Are we unmuted?

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.030
OK.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.030
Now we are.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.030
Good afternoon.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.030
OK, welcome to--.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, sorry.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.030
[laughs]

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Welcome to the Friday Review of Games
everyone.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.410
I, as always, am Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.280
&gt;&gt;Dan: And I am Dan Galpin.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.481
&gt;&gt;Ian: And I have a very special present for
Dan today.

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:48.960
Today we are drinking, say it.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, it's a Cuve di Chaque Auban, I
would say.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.810
Maybe.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: We'll go with that.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.810
That sounds good.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: Sounds close enough.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.810
It might be Flemish, though.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.810
It might have time--.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: Ask Reto.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.810
He's foreign.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.810
[Dan laughs]

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.810
&gt;&gt;Reto: I am foreign.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.810
How do we pronounce this?

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.810
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's Cuve di Chaque Auban.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, I agree.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.810
OK.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.810
Do we get the Reto-cam?

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.810
Reto-cam.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.810
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh, Reto-cam's broken.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, fail on the Reto-cam.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, dammit.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.190
All right.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.690
&gt;&gt;Reto: I'm just a black void.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's good because next week, we can
suck less and we can get the Reto-cam working.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: There we go.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, I gotta say something about this
beer because in, I don't want to like.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.690
Here, you can have the open one.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.979
&gt;&gt;Reto: Cuve di Chaque Auban.

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, nice.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: Excellent.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: Reto-cam.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: Reto-cam.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.350
Yeah.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: Awesome.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.350
OK.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: You can just see just a little bit
of Big Pete in the background.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.250
Indeed.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.420
So, the thing about this beer, it's sour Flemish
ale.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.110
Flemish sour red ale.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:55.340
It is, it apparently has a cascade of beautiful
complex flavors, oak barrel aging for 18 months,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.360
etc., etc.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.390
&gt;&gt;Dan: Vanilla.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.530
It's all about the vanilla note and sourness.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: Actually, this is really, really sour
beer.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.200
This is like, I've had sour beers before and
they were like, they were like lemonade or

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200
something.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.239
This is the warheads of beer.

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.379
This is, yeah.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.480
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is, but it also has such a delicate
and complicated flavor.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.700
I think of it like a champagne almost.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.010
Even a whiskey of beer.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.689
Except that it isn't, it doesn't taste anything
like whiskey.

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's extremely, no, no.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.230
Yeah.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.230
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's complicated.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.650
It's just that whiskey is complicated.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, it's a very, very complicated
flavor.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.129
&gt;&gt;Dan: Fine wine.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.530
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, I've had that--.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.690
&gt;&gt;Reto: And I would say it's kind of like
a wine.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.859
I would agree.

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.019
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.189
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.189
Absolutely.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:38.189
It's complex like that.

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.189
All right.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.189
&gt;&gt;Dan: Thank you.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.569
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, if you happen to watch the Friday
App Clinic last hour, you'll notice that I

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.809
was there along with Reto because I'm a big
proponent of podcast apps.

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:53.249
I've never found one that I liked.

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.510
Still haven't, but hopefully, we planted some
seeds.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.249
You know what I'm looking for now.

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.939
Again, my 20 dollars are yours.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:02.939
You wanna do a kickstarter?

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.220
I'll give you a hundred bucks.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.659
Of course you'll have to give me something
for it.

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:07.659
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, yeah.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:08.659
Absolutely.

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.669
&gt;&gt;Ian: I would totally go for a transport
control that doesn't suck.

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:12.669
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mm-hmm.

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:19.079
&gt;&gt;Ian: And something that always plays whatever
is buffered up instead of failing randomly

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.529
because my internet went away.

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:21.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.919
&gt;&gt;Ian: If that was like your hundred dollar
kick starter offer, I would totally go for

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:25.919
that.

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:26.919
All right.

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:27.919
Anyway.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:28.919
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.839
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, the point that I'm making is I
played with podcast apps.

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:33.839
Dan played with games.

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:38.230
So, I'm just gonna sit back here and let him
advertise EA.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.230
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.120
So, I just wanted to say that I am absolutely
not wearing this because of any other reason

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.499
other than the fact that EA gave it to me
this week.

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.919
And it just happens to be that we're doing
sports today.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.299
So, I figured wearing EA is part of it.

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.299
&gt;&gt;Ian: Bingo.

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.980
&gt;&gt;Dan: And we are not doing any EA titles
because none were nominated.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.799
Not that they're not good titles.

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.290
I actually, I really like both soccer and
football, but we are here to look at games

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.349
people nominated on the moderator page.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.870
And we have a very eclectic set of games.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.689
And, of course, the Olympics are still technically
going on.

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:09.689
So,--.

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.870
&gt;&gt;Ian: But we don't know it because we don't
have cable subscriptions and all we get here

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.870
is NBC.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.101
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, and we do have a lot of YouTube
live streams going out there that is actually

00:04:19.101 --> 00:04:22.260
how I have caught all of my Olympics that
I've seen this year is on YouTube.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.330
Any of you YouTube folks that made that happen.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.840
And let's talk about what we have today.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.960
We've got a really wide variety of games.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.570
We have everything from what I would call
simple, shoot, where they replicate one mechanic

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:44.660
game really well to actually, at the end we
actually even have a Olympic-style old summer

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.750
games style remix game.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nice.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: Cool, but--.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: I played that for hours in junior high.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.960
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.650
This one has touch controls and it's pretty
cool.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.210
A lot of these games need some work, but it
was great to see such a wide variety of stuff.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.500
I was expecting golf games and soccer games
and we didn't get any of those.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.780
So, no football games at all.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: No.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.780
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, no.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.780
We, so we've got a couple of varied--.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: Which is weird.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.240
Do you think it's just that football games
on Android suck?

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.710
'Cause it feels like, you feel like that would
be really good for football games.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, we used to make, exactly.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.120
Football Madness is great and so is the Game
Off title, Real Football or whatever.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.120
They're both really good.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.669
They get good ratings.

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:22.810
And soccer, very similar.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.340
We've got three great soccer titles actually
on Android.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.740
So, I'm not quite sure why, but I think people
wanted to play with other stuff.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.930
We did actually, we sort of have a soccer
title in Neymar Game, which is awesome if

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.930
you are a fan.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.380
And if you are a fan of football, of course
you are a fan of Neymar.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.780
I'm probably pronouncing it wrong.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.780
Is it Neymar?

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.780
Or, I don't know.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.780
I'm terrible at names.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.780
All right.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.950
So, let's start off with the first one.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:45.950
This is Stardunk.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:52.000
It's kind of an interesting game because it
actually is a game, it's a multi-player game.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.900
And you challenge random people.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.550
Ooh, nice.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.550
Points.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.020
Free starpoints.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.020
Interesting.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.960
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.960
Play online.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.960
Why, yes.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.840
I have logged into OpenFeint for you.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.160
Not that I'm a huge fan of OpenFeint.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.640
And, but anyways, the goal of this is to shoot
baskets.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.060
And I first thought that actually, the gravity
of said planet would affect this, but it doesn't

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.450
as far as I can tell.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, that's boring.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.230
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it's--.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.230
However, it's fun.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.380
It's fun to see a fun presentation of all
of this.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.990
And it actually, there are, there actually
are three basketball games that we have that

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.390
all have the same shot mechanic.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:45.170
This one just takes it out and to the farthest
crazy extent with the real time network challenge

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.170
here.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.170
I really suck at this.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.170
I'm sorry.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.170
But--.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.620
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, I was gonna say, with the amount
of hints that you get with this, it seems

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.860
like you should be doing better.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.860
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.860
Yeah.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.570
The, especially since, in theory, I've played
it before we actually got on the air here.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.400
&gt;&gt;Dan: But you also, there's, you are, actually,
one of the goals is you want to hit all four

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.400
of the backboard pieces there.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.750
That turns you into this fiery mode, which
I'll try to show you here.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.150
Oh, I missed again.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.600
&gt;&gt;Ian: So close.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.190
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.980
Now I'm actually hitting baskets, trying to
hit the backboard.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.020
Come on, I only have 52 seconds.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, that's not gonna happen.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.020
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, I know.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, come on.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.710
I know.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.710
I'm just totally sucking.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.710
Yes, finally.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: There you go.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:29.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.810
Now we're in like, in like flame happy mode
here on the baskets.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:31.810
We're doing swish--.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:32.810
Anyways.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.450
So this is actually a pretty fun game.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.150
Some general comments of it, we do see that,
I would like to see some higher resolution

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.400
art work for this, the static art work.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.170
The font is definitely bleary here on the
Transformer Prime.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.330
That's one of the very, the number font here
at the bottom.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.330
And that's--.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think that's intentional.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.270
I think that's actually got a, 'cause look
at the number font on the top.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.270
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.270
I know.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.540
But it's still, it's a combination of both
blur and--.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.211
I mean, there is definitely something.

00:07:55.211 --> 00:07:56.211
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, I think that, yeah.

00:07:56.211 --> 00:07:57.211
There's a little bit of bloom on it.

00:07:57.211 --> 00:07:58.211
&gt;&gt;Dan: Bloom on it.

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:01.010
But I would still like to see a little higher
res, definitely with some of the text.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.860
But overall, the presentation looks really
nice in this category of games.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.860
It's good.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.889
The back key is actually handled quite reasonably
here.

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:13.630
And you can see I go right back into my session
here where we get to see, oh, here at the

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.580
end where I rank with the rest of the world.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.580
And there we are.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.580
&gt;&gt;Dan: So--.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's not bad.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.580
That screen is a little busy.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.580
But the information is good.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, and I think part of this is also,
you'll see there's some places in which text

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.130
overlaps and stuff like that.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.380
It's some little details here.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.690
Again, we got really blurry looking icons.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: I love how they have OpenFeint, yeah.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.629
A blurry OpenFeint and Haze app and Twitter
and Facebook.

00:08:34.629 --> 00:08:35.629
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:37.139
&gt;&gt;Ian: And whatever App Sign is.

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:38.139
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:39.139
&gt;&gt;Ian: Is that a new thing?

00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:41.259
Is that something the kids are doing that
I just don't even know about?

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:43.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, maybe share over email.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.100
Yeah, it's over email.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.100
So, interesting.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Woah.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's sad.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: Using the share intent.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.100
I know.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.160
They should really think about using a share
intent there at that point.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.589
So, I would definitely comment on that.

00:08:55.589 --> 00:08:56.589
Yeah.

00:08:56.589 --> 00:08:58.181
It's nice to just not have the OpenFeint menu.

00:08:58.181 --> 00:09:03.059
The problem with not having a menu key in
OpenFeint is there is no way for me to change

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:04.059
my profile.

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:07.579
So, I am forever Player one eight five four
seven four zero zero seven three.

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:12.120
Thank you OpenFeint for not having a button
to do anything in my settings.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.089
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's weird that in a year, they haven't
changed that.

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:17.089
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:18.089
I know.

00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:19.089
I can't-- so anyways.

00:09:19.089 --> 00:09:23.220
Normally, we need a menu key and actually,
in order to actually go in and make those

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.220
changes.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.149
So, I'm awesome to see this game actually
is properly supporting Honeycomb in ICS without

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:31.389
having any kind of compatibility.

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:32.779
But with OpenFeint, it totally sucks.

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:34.560
So, OpenFeint, fix your problem.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.560
Please.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.740
I just don't like--.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: You just don't like fun.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.740
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.740
It's trying.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.740
I actually would have.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.740
I wanted to change it my real profile, but
it did not actually work.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.650
So that was Stardunk and yeah.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.220
It's fun, but I definitely want to see a little
bit, just a little bit of refinement there.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.189
But other than that, I was pretty happy with
that game.

00:09:52.189 --> 00:09:59.309
I thought it was really cool, a really cool
example of doing network play and doing a

00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:00.309
tournament.

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:01.309
This has actually become really common.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:04.550
This anonymous tournament with a whole bunch
of people all playing against a single timed

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.019
mode.

00:10:06.019 --> 00:10:08.589
I would like to see some sort of reverse interaction
actually.

00:10:08.589 --> 00:10:10.420
I think and all of that.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.410
So, I'm going in the next game right now,
which is Ninja Volleyball.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:19.850
And one of the things that you can tell here--Ninja
Volley--is that I'm right into the game and

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.770
it takes me into the last menu that I was
in, which is cool.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.759
It's a little bit, actually, strange enough
jarring.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:30.540
If I actually back out of the game, the expectation
is when I come back in, I'm actually going

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.639
to probably be at the same place rather than
back to where I was.

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:35.639
So, that's an interesting--.

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:36.639
&gt;&gt;Ian: What do you mean?

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:38.920
The same place, as in like, not where you
were?

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: As in not where I am.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.070
See, I'm back at settings.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.070
I don't know.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.070
It's kind of interesting.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.809
This has actually been customized.

00:10:44.809 --> 00:10:46.350
Again, this is just from a UI perspective.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:51.301
I just wanted to see, while this does definitely
work, it just, it would be cool to make it

00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:53.769
a little clear what this interface is actually
doing.

00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:55.139
This is hair.

00:10:55.139 --> 00:10:59.629
And you figure out pretty well how to different
hair customizations and different colors.

00:10:59.629 --> 00:11:01.519
&gt;&gt;Ian: It is weird that it's just numbers,
though.

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:02.519
I mean, I like--

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:03.519
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:04.519
&gt;&gt;Ian: that's an odd UI.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:05.629
It looks like a debug UI.

00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:06.629
&gt;&gt;Dan: It does, actually.

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:08.119
It looks like we're testing it.

00:11:08.119 --> 00:11:09.959
And so, but it's really awesome.

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:13.209
You can create all sorts of different cool
customizations for your team.

00:11:13.209 --> 00:11:14.209
The characters look good.

00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:17.670
I want high res art work, but in fact, high
res font, especially.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.160
I mean, as I said,--.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: If you don't mind me saying something
about the font.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:28.980
I know we were wrong last week when we dissed
on the Real Racing guy, not Real Racing, or

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.230
the Tiny Racing guy for using comic sans.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.339
He was actually using just a font that ripped
off comic sans.

00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:36.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: Correct, yeah.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:38.490
Which is just like yeah.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.519
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's like, "No, I'm not drinking Colt
45.

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:45.710
I'm drinking a cheaper version that tries
to be Colt 45."

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.779
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:11:46.779 --> 00:11:47.839
&gt;&gt;Ian: Sure.

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:52.110
Anyway, I'm just gonna say this font, it looks
kinda like comic sans.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.110
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.089
It definitely, definitely, definitely is not
comic sans.

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.139
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's not comic sans.

00:11:56.139 --> 00:11:57.139
&gt;&gt;Dan: I see what they were trying to do.

00:11:57.139 --> 00:11:59.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: It looks like an unholy union between
papyrus and comic sans.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.300
It actually does remind me of that papyrus
quite a lot.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.120
The main thing, I would say, is they're trying
to keep a ninja feel here.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.829
&gt;&gt;Dan: But this is not getting it, this particular
font.

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:09.829
Also, these are just bitmaps.

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:13.860
So I'd definitely like to see some really
cool work done on this.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: The truth is, I think there should
just be a rule of--.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.560
Oh, yeah.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's much better.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.209
I'd like to see everything use the font that
says "Best used in Bluetooth multi-player

00:12:21.209 --> 00:12:22.209
coming soon."

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:23.209
&gt;&gt;Ian: There you go.

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:24.209
I think that is papyrus.

00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:27.579
But papyrus stopped being exciting after [corrotica],
basically.

00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:28.579
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:12:28.579 --> 00:12:33.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: My rule of thumb is in a game, do not
use a font that comes free with Microsoft

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.920
Word.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.809
It just, it's just the wrong idea.

00:12:36.809 --> 00:12:37.920
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.920
All right.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.910
So, we've got a lot of different options here.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.800
There's Bluetooth player coming soon.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.029
But there is--.

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:47.040
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's get into the game.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.149
&gt;&gt;Dan: Let's get into the game.

00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:54.180
So, once again, again, this is just really
nicely imaginative game play here.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.390
And when you actually get into playing the
game, what you actually have to do is touch

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.880
the ball with your hand.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.529
And because you're ninjas, you move silently
and quickly to the spot where the ball is,

00:13:03.529 --> 00:13:04.529
which is why I say it's volleyball.

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:05.529
&gt;&gt;Ian: Sweet.

00:13:05.529 --> 00:13:06.529
&gt;&gt;Dan: So I love this.

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:07.829
&gt;&gt;Ian: So you don't need any animation at
all.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:08.829
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:09.829
And I love--.

00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:10.829
&gt;&gt;Ian: That is awesome.

00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:11.839
&gt;&gt;Dan: I love the concept behind the--I just
died.

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:13.509
I love the concept behind the game.

00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:14.509
&gt;&gt;Ian: How can you die?

00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:15.509
You're a ninja.

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:16.509
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:17.509
I know.

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:18.509
Well, just because I'm a ninja, doesn't mean
I can catch things correctly.

00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:19.939
&gt;&gt;Ian: You're not a very good ninja, are you?

00:13:19.939 --> 00:13:21.139
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'm a suck ninja.

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:22.139
Fourth touch.

00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:23.200
Touch to continue.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.200
See.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.200
That was an interesting one, too.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.800
Popping up a toast in the middle of your game
play, generally not a-- to transmit information.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.119
Better than popping up a dialogue, but I'd
love to see it actually--.

00:13:34.119 --> 00:13:37.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, again, and I think actually the
developer of this game corresponded a little

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:43.679
bit with some of the critics on our moderator
page saying that they do actually have a lot

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:44.679
more to go.

00:13:44.679 --> 00:13:47.930
This is, this is sort of an alpha quality
game, right?

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.079
&gt;&gt;Dan: And I'm totally impressed with what
they've done with it.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.360
Honestly, the game is fun.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.360
It plays well.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.360
It actually uses gestures.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.360
You don't just tap.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.779
You actually, as you tap and then you can
actually fling with the gestures.

00:13:56.779 --> 00:13:57.779
&gt;&gt;Ian: Very, very cool.

00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:00.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: I definitely think some more tutorials.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.959
Where you can see, they're actually doing
a lot of things right already.

00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:05.720
They're using lights out mode in the game.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.889
It actually navigates quite reasonably when
you're inside the game.

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:11.119
They're using libgdx.

00:14:11.119 --> 00:14:13.939
&gt;&gt;Ian: Just need a little bit better assets
for the tablets.

00:14:13.939 --> 00:14:14.939
Let's face it.

00:14:14.939 --> 00:14:16.209
These just aren't good 720p assets.

00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:17.209
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:18.209
Exactly.

00:14:18.209 --> 00:14:20.069
They're, but it really a great start.

00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:23.309
And you see the back key actually does do
something reasonable.

00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:25.619
Here we are, back on our main menu and then
we are back out.

00:14:25.619 --> 00:14:26.730
Kind of like you'd expect.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.739
So, very nice game.

00:14:27.739 --> 00:14:28.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: Not bad at all.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.600
&gt;&gt;Dan: Good job, Ninja Volley guys.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.509
And yeah, just keep going with that.

00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:34.160
The next one was really, really interesting.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:40.350
This was Basketball Lite and this is a game,
actually, that we looked at ages and ages

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.350
ago.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.350
It's like, this is an old game.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.360
And right there at the start of the game is,
"Try our new basketball game, Tip-Off."

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.360
So I'm like, "OK.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.360
We gotta actually have both."

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.360
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.879
&gt;&gt;Dan: And you can show how they're going
from this game, uses all sorts of Android

00:14:51.879 --> 00:14:59.290
UI and it's actually kinda ugly, but the game
itself is cool.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.739
So you see, this is not designed at all for
tablets.

00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:04.249
You can see all that UI was designed for phones.

00:15:04.249 --> 00:15:10.319
And it actually doesn't explain to you how
to play the game at all in the actual game.

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:13.309
But it's essentially exactly the same mechanics--.

00:15:13.309 --> 00:15:14.889
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, is that a Box2D net?

00:15:14.889 --> 00:15:16.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: It might be.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:17.730
It's very possible.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:18.730
I'm not sure.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:19.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's awesome.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: But yeah, they've done actually a really
nice job with this game.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.980
And I remember looking at this like, a year
and half or two years ago, whenever it came

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:27.980
out.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.069
I was like, "Wow, nice job."

00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:30.069
So, that's cool.

00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:31.139
But that's the old version of the game.

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:36.679
And it's actually pretty free of problems
other than ugly, non-tablet UI.

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:39.290
One thing that's very-- when you do it, when
you have something that has been optimized

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.689
for tablet, this is what it looks like.

00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:44.429
You see, all the buttons are over on the left-hand
side.

00:15:44.429 --> 00:15:45.829
They're all really, really small.

00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:48.119
And remember, this is an NDPI device.

00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:52.619
So, all of your text is gonna be really, really
small because the idea of a tablet is to fit

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.259
more stuff on the screen.

00:15:54.259 --> 00:15:56.490
And the problem is, in this particular case,
we don't.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:00.670
What we really want is really nice, big text,
really nice buttons that make sense.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:05.209
And so, this is, if you don't do any optimization
around tablets, this is what you end up with,

00:16:05.209 --> 00:16:07.100
which again is quite playable.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.649
And this game has network challenge and all
sorts of crazy stuff in it.

00:16:10.649 --> 00:16:11.649
But I just wanna see more.

00:16:11.649 --> 00:16:12.649
You definitely see zoom.

00:16:12.649 --> 00:16:14.620
You definitely see the old menu.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.889
Let's go to Tip-Off, which is their new game.

00:16:19.889 --> 00:16:20.889
So, which has--.

00:16:20.889 --> 00:16:21.889
&gt;&gt;Ian: Clean.

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:28.000
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it's a completely, this game
is like a completely different kind, different

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.179
level of game compared to the original.

00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:34.550
It's really cool to see that they went from
that to this.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.379
And it has leader boards, coins.

00:16:36.379 --> 00:16:40.130
The only problem is actually from a navigation
perspective.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.529
There's a lot of stuff that are still missing,
especially when you're in the tutorial.

00:16:43.529 --> 00:16:46.019
There's a lot of problems.

00:16:46.019 --> 00:16:49.110
And so, I kind of, see if we can actually.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.689
So, let's, I think we're not gonna be in this
tutorial level here.

00:16:52.689 --> 00:16:54.879
So, you're not going to get to see all the
fun stuff.

00:16:54.879 --> 00:16:59.959
You see it's actually the same game with just
a great presentation.

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:03.959
And I think this actually shows what it takes,
what the next level looks like.

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:09.660
I mean, really, this is the exact same game
we saw before with just a ton of other awesomeness

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.660
in the presentation.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:15.000
And I actually, I thought they did such a
good job on this, going from where they were

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.190
before.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.839
Now, so here we are.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:18.850
I hit the back key.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:19.900
This is not bad, OK?

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.130
We're back to copying the dialogue in the
back.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:26.010
Let's hit the back key again and nothing happens,
OK?

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.400
And then, also we have this interesting thing.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.810
There is this, restart and play.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:35.150
Play, because it looks all different than
all the other options here, I did not even

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.680
realize initially that that meant continue
down there at the bottom.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.680
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, yeah.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.080
It doesn't, well, it's weird because it's
actually a different color scheme.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.080
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: It almost looks like it's greyed out,
like it's part of a background screen that

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.260
isn't active right now.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.260
So I kept hitting restart.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.260
Like, "I'm restarting.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.260
I'm restarting."

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: And that was, again, I did that even
during the tutorial 'cause I couldn't figure

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.260
out like, how do I continue?

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.260
It's a mismatched style.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: It is.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.260
It's a totally mismatched style.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.260
So I definitely wanna see that change.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.360
There's a lot of little tiny UI things here
that actually, that could be altered to make

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.360
it better.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.450
I mean, it has a very complete tutorial, which
is slightly annoying because the tutorial

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.690
came across as very, very slow unfortunately
in this game.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.420
I don't have it up, so I can't show it to
you.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.310
But I would definitely look at that.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.030
But other than that, this game is looking
really, really good.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.720
A couple of weird back key issues and then
a couple of little UI glitches.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.720
But wow.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.620
Compare those two games and it's night and
day in terms of presentation.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.110
And it shows.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:34.230
The difference between a game that's good
and a game that is great and is gonna get

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.770
featured, a lot of times is just presentation.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.770
This is--.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:38.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: It really is.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:39.770
I mean, it's sad to say.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.020
I mean, you'd like to believe that you can
just whip one of these things out in a month

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.780
in your garage, but no.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.220
No, you can't.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.920
And as a consumer, that's not what you want,
right?

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.300
But if you take some time to do the art right,
yeah, absolutely.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.890
By the way, I'm sorry I seem distracted.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:55.890
It's just that--.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:56.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: He's playing games.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:03.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm playing, well, I'm playing Big
Win Baseball and my team, Reto Likes Sandwiches,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.220
is about to play their first exhibition.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.450
&gt;&gt;Dan: Nice.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.180
And that is true.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.500
So, we can have a Reto-cam right now.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.630
So, the next one we're gonna look at is actually
9 Innings Baseball.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:19.630
So here we are.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.160
Reto Likes Sandwiches.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: Sammiches.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.530
&gt;&gt;Dan: Sammiches.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.530
Is it?

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.530
Yeah, exactly.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.530
All right.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.580
So, select control method.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.580
So you got your choice.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.480
You've got auto and semi-auto.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.380
I'm gonna pick auto here.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.590
And no, this is actually--.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:37.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: 9 Innings?

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.000
&gt;&gt;Dan: 9 Innings Baseball, thank you.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.730
Now, we do still see the vestigial menu key
here, which is sad because honestly guys,

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:45.730
it's clear--.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.290
&gt;&gt;Ian: How many times have we talked about
this?

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.290
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.290
I know.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.290
It's, it's--.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: And I'm not saying like, on this show.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:58.010
I'm talking about in person that you guys,
guys that made this game.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.400
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.700
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's a Com2uS game, right?

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.870
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is a Com2uS game.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Don Lim from Com2uS, dude.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.620
Talk to me.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:20.210
It's really cool 'cause Com2uS is well-known
for its K-titles, K Baseball, which are like

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.560
all these really, really cute little kids
playing baseball, right?

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:29.430
And this is their more realistic title, which
I think appeals to me more.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.350
I think it's more of an American audience
type of title.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: Totally.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: And I think they've done a pretty good
job.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.050
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, and this actually combines two
different mechanics in the game.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.941
This actually, so the reason why I picked
this game here is that it actually, it actually

00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:49.350
combines the arcade mechanic we see here with
this tutorial, which I'm going through really

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.350
slowly.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.700
You see, you end up getting cards.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.700
And--.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.320
&gt;&gt;Ian: Who's Emma?

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.130
&gt;&gt;Dan: What?

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.280
&gt;&gt;Ian: You had an Emma on your screen.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.280
There she is, Emma.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.920
&gt;&gt;Dan: Emma is my tutorial goddess.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: Really?

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.920
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: There's always some cute girl telling
you how to play sports in these games.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.170
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wow.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.170
&gt;&gt;Dan: So there we are.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: And you do see that that was actually
a real--.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wow.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.170
They're even licensing like--.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.860
&gt;&gt;Dan: Kid characters or something.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.930
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.930
Interesting.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:27.090
Emma doesn't actually know, she doesn't look
like somebody that knows a lot about baseball.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.090
She looks like she's a--.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.170
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, she's totally--.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.510
&gt;&gt;Ian: She's on a webcam somewhere, come on.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.510
&gt;&gt;Dan: No.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.510
Emma is totally--.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Like, I'm not being like, sexist here.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.070
It's just that she looks like she's sitting
in her bedroom on a webcam.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: Stealing home base, that's hardcore.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.050
&gt;&gt;Ian: You stole home.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.050
&gt;&gt;Dan: I guess.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.050
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nice.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.050
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.810
Don't forget to make your order for the pitcher.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.040
Make his pitch.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040
All right.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.690
But anyways, the point of this is, let's go
back.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.650
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think they got her off mystockphoto.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.650
I really do.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: You think so?

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm pretty sure, yeah.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.510
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.770
So you actually have cards.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.690
You actually end up with this box of cards
you can manage.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.690
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's cool.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:08.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: And so, this is actually, it combines
actually a lot of what is going on in an arcade

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.040
baseball game.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.720
You can actually buy cards.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.730
You can enhance and mix cards.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.330
And then, you can play the game.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: No.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: No tutorial.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.820
Back, back.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.960
First of all, on-screen back key.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.960
Ah.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.960
All right.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.510
But at least the back key does actually work,
which is good.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.540
So let's do--.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:36.220
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, we had this conversation with
a lot of people because they'll say, "Well,

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:43.710
apparently we did some tests and people really
like to have a back key on-screen as well."

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:49.420
Our response is usually, "Well, A, those may
not be your most hardcore Android users.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:57.590
And B, the whole point is to use a consistent
UI so that we get everybody educated to use

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.390
a particular type of UI."

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.220
But whatever.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.540
If you don't wanna get featured, go ahead
and put your own on-screen back button in.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.680
[Dan laughs]

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.680
Cool.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.680
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.870
So, you can see here, actually, what's cool,
you have this combination of only, I've elected

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.490
to only play offense 'cause I actually wanna
play defense in the game.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:17.950
Again, we're in simple mode.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:24.240
The game has all sorts of different modes
designed to please different kinds of users.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.230
And that's what's actually cool about the
game is it's really, it's just got super deep

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.230
modes.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.440
I would say this arcade system is not particularly
deep, but even have two levels of arcade.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.190
This is like the simple arcade and then they
have a complicated arcade.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:40.120
The one thing they don't have is going all
the way out where Big Win Baseball goes, where

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:45.150
it just allows the game to play itself.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.570
And then, but you, you can go all the way
auto-play through the game like this.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:53.200
Again, so you can say, "I'm gonna play through
this much of the game and see what happens."

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.200
Boom.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.200
Boom.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.820
So now, it's just doing basic stuff.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.610
You can actually watch it play out.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:04.311
It's not as, the, again, this is just really,
really simple in terms of presentation when

00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:05.740
you're actually watching the game play.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.920
But it gives you that card game mechanics,
which is kinda cool.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.320
And you can see my players are sucking.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.570
None of them are actually scoring.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.090
But you can watch this.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:21.490
You can even skip this whole thing and just
go right there, back to where I said and just

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.050
let the game calculate itself out.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:24.090
Oh, there we are.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.100
My team's doing pretty well.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:29.310
So even if all you'd like to do is manage
baseball, you just want to manage the last

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.850
couple of innings, you can actually do this.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.840
You can play through the arcade of just the
last couple of innings.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.840
So really--

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.840
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, cool.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: however you wanna play, play baseball,
whether you want the full experience or the

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.250
partial experience, this game has it.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:40.250
I just wanna see--.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: That makes sense.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.250
Dan, can I borrow your credit card?

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: No.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.250
What are you--?

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's OK.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.890
I've actually already got it.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.920
&gt;&gt;Dan: I was gonna say.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.140
&gt;&gt;Ian: We're good.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.360
&gt;&gt;Dan: You're famous.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.890
Actually, you are supporting, by yourself,
Hothead Games, I believe.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.310
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, my Google self, anyway.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.510
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:05.180
So, in any case, I don't want to go too much
farther into this game.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.050
Obviously, the biggest problem with it is
it's just not an Android game.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:13.520
I mean, it just needs to have the UI slightly
customized for Android.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.900
I definitely wanna see higher resolution art
work, especially in things like the buttons,

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.220
which is kind of a shame 'cause you've got
the images.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.170
The images actually scale really, really well
and that's what we've seen, the images scale

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.170
really well.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.290
Things like the buttons, we can see these
edges.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.290
It would just be nice.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.360
Give us some hi-res art work.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.490
Give us some higher res fonts and the game
will look just that much better.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.340
So that would be my if I were gonna say anything.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.260
But basically, make sure the back key works
everywhere, man.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.270
&gt;&gt;Dan: How many times have we said that?

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.720
That'll get you nailed.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:49.660
For the Google Play Store, when they do featuring,
they have a QA process they go to and they're,

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.330
the QA people will go through every screen
and try to hit the back key.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:54.330
&gt;&gt;Dan: And hit the back key.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.330
Yeah.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:56.330
I'm just like--.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: And just dumb stuff like that, right?

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.330
'Cause it's really frustrating when it doesn't
work.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.330
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.330
Exactly.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.440
So, we're actually gonna go contrasting that
to Big Win Baseball.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.920
And Big Win Games are--.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.290
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, no.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.440
Let's put it on the phone, actually.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.420
You know, the truth is, this game plays a
lot better on the phone.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.420
&gt;&gt;Dan: Does it really?

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.820
&gt;&gt;Ian: But it really does 'cause, because
there's no action.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.960
There's nothing where you have to move your
hands around really fast.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: But it looks so pretty.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.870
I like to compare this to, well, I put it
up on--.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:25.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, but you're opening a starter
pack and I'm getting my platinum players going,

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.760
right?

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, I just, I wanna show--.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:28.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:29.810
No, no.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:30.810
no.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:31.810
You know what, Dan?

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:32.810
You just do what you want.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.080
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, as soon as the starter pack opens,
I wanna go to yours for play.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.740
But I do wanna show people the contrast, the
presentation.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.820
Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.730
The presentation of this game is really professional.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:42.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:43.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: Look at that.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:44.730
All the animation.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: You can see that also, all of the fonts
are just beautiful.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.250
They're outlined.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.920
They're actually very close to resolution
as the starter pack itself, it's a little

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.920
low there.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.130
But all of the rest, it looks really, really
sharp.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.320
And it just makes a huge difference when you're
on a tablet like this.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:01.120
And as you can see it's, from a tablet perspective,
they're doing a pretty, pretty good job.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.040
They're actually using the keyboard, which
isn't bad.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's make that Whiskey Rebels.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:05.970
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, go ahead.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.600
You've got the keyboard now.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: Right, exactly.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:13.570
Oh.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, are you gonna spell whiskey with
an "e?"

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.900
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.650
&gt;&gt;Ian: Is that the kind of whiskey you like?

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:21.650
[Dan laughs]

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:22.930
Big Pete begs to differ.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:24.270
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.270
I know.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:26.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right, then.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.270
Fine.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.270
&gt;&gt;Dan: We're American whiskey, here.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think you mean 'murican.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.270
&gt;&gt;Dan: 'murican whiskey.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.400
All right.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.800
So we get to select cards.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.200
Any suggestions here?

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, you know what?

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.350
It just makes you use all three of them.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.350
That's a good point.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.350
It does.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.680
&gt;&gt;Ian: So the only thing I don't like about
Big Win Baseball, compared to, let's say,

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.690
Big Win Hockey, which I went nuts over, too
many players.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.160
You have ten players to manage.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.480
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.580
Starting lineup for hockey is five players.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.570
It's a lot easier to fill them all with platinum.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:58.780
It's a lot easier to remember who they are.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:27:59.780
This is a lot.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.780
But--.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.960
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, baseball in general is a complicated
game to manage.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960
I think it's--.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.680
&gt;&gt;Ian: I mean, when I think about baseball,
I mostly think of where's the garlic fries?

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.140
So, I'm probably not the target audience.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.140
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.140
But the garlic fries are really, really good.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.140
Although, they're actually--.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: Although, I did just spend like ten
bucks on big boosters.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:21.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, and they are right in the little
Gordon Biersch Stand, right on the left hand

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:22.260
side of--.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: Anyway.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: [inaudible].

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: I haven't been to a baseball game since
I lived in Seattle, actually.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, really?

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:28.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: No.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, we need to get you to a game.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: There you go.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.970
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, yeah.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:40.780
Again, the presentation is really what they
have done an incredible job with in this game.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:46.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, but as you know, earlier on in
my career, I did sports games for Microsoft.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.890
And I remember that was something we spent
a long time on.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.570
You try to make things look like a network
broadcast.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:29:01.120
All of this presentation is just really, really
good, especially for such a small game.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.120
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:10.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: The camera motions, the animation,
the sliding in and out, the crispness of the

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.390
graphics, it's all just really, really high
quality.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.390
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's well done.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:15.390
It's very well done for what it is.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:20.980
I mean, it's not like a full-blown, 3D baseball
like we've seen, but for what they're doing

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:29.010
with 2D with a little bit of transformation,
it's quite good.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.120
And again, this is just a card game.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.100
But for people who really like to manage baseball,
it gets a little closer to that.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.650
It's not a realistic game in any sense.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.760
It really is a card game that has baseball
stuff thrown into it.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, what's really fun about this,
so we're watching a game right now.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:48.010
And the truth is, what we're really watching
is a computer simulation, the outcome of which

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.520
is known as soon as it starts.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.520
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: But the fun thing about watching it
is first, it is fun.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.510
They do some nice things with the graphics.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:30:01.030
They, but more than anything else, they show
you what your players can and can't do and

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.030
where they screw up.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.600
&gt;&gt;Dan: I have a beer in my hand and I'm watching
the tablet play baseball.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.020
This is like, this is fun right here.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, this is awesome.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:09.060
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, I know.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.790
All right.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's switch to camera two.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.450
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:15.450
Really?

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:16.450
&gt;&gt;Ian: Come on.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.520
&gt;&gt;Dan: It spilled all over my EA shirt.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Drinking problem.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.760
True.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.820
So anyway.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.820
We can skip this.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.350
You can skip it at any time.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:31.420
The value of watching it is so you get to
see where your team members are screwing up.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.420
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mm-hmm.

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.920
So, I'm gonna keep kicking people's ass at
Big Win Baseball.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.460
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'm gonna continue with the other game.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.460
&gt;&gt;Ian: You bet.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.600
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:45.530
So, in general, this game also has occasional
issues with back key, mostly where they couldn't

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.520
figure out what it would do.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.610
&gt;&gt;Dan: And again, figure out what it will
do.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:51.870
Make it do something.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:52.870
All right.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.360
Let's go into comedy here.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.250
I'm gonna have to rotate the screen on this
one.

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:58.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: We're doing comedy games?

00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:59.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is--.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nice.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:05.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is, this is, it is a sort of a
sports game.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.180
This is the Neymar game.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: This is a fantasy game.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:09.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:10.890
And your goal is--.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's who I wanna be right there,
that guy.

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:12.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: The goal is to keep it, oh.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:13.890
Are we not getting output?

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:14.890
There we are.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:15.890
Now you guys are seeing it.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.890
Oh yeah.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:17.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, they're not seeing it.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:18.890
Oh, now they are.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:19.890
OK.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:20.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: Now they're seeing it.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:21.890
That's what I mean.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:22.890
Oh yeah.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:23.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: This is great.

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:24.900
This totally reminds me of like, arcade games
from 1985.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:25.980
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right when they first got video into
them.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is, oh, sorry.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:31.770
It's the Neymar game.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.100
How do you pronounce the game?

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.100
Someone's got to know.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: Don't you recognize Neymar?

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.090
&gt;&gt;Dan: He's only the football hero.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.910
&gt;&gt;Ian: I don't know who this guy is.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:44.910
&gt;&gt;Dan: He is the number one footballer of
just basically in the world today.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.380
&gt;&gt;Reto: We call that soccer here in the United
States, right?

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: Right.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, here in the United States.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.120
Sure.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.120
Yeah.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:58.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: Hey, women's soccer just won the gold
for the US.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:59.809
And it was kick ass, by the way.

00:31:59.809 --> 00:32:01.270
You saw those matches.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.450
Both against UK and Japan.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.640
It was, they were really amazing.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.020
Those are some seriously tough women, I'll
have to say.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.650
And they did an amazing job.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:13.271
So anyways, your job is to keep the ball alive.

00:32:13.271 --> 00:32:14.750
I wouldn't really call it a soccer game.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.280
I wouldn't really call it a sports game.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.220
It is sports related and it's kind of fun.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.990
&gt;&gt;Ian: Of course it's a sport.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:21.850
&gt;&gt;Dan: It has like, seven animations.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: Sure, you're doing it with a soccer
ball, but you could be doing it with a hackey

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:31.150
sack and then it would be the national sport
of all like, old people in China.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.960
[Dan laughs]

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right, let's go on.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.650
&gt;&gt;Ian: That was cool.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:40.001
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's totally fine.

00:32:40.001 --> 00:32:41.001
&gt;&gt;Ian: I would play that.

00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:43.610
&gt;&gt;Dan: The biggest problem with this game,
and I'll show you it, is it actually uses

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:49.350
a permission which I really hate people using,
which is prevent system lock.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:52.720
So now, I hit the back button again and boom,
I'm back in the game without a lock.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, yeah.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.180
That's a little annoying because you'd think
that when you clear the screen, especially

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:05.240
somebody like you, Dan, where you will frequently
play games in the middle of conducting high-level

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.240
secret conversations.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.430
&gt;&gt;Ian: You have the nuclear launch codes on
your laptop.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:13.450
You have the code to Sergei's Batman lair.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.630
We don't want those things stolen.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.190
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, absolutely.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:21.500
And besides, we all know that Larry is Batman.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.580
Let's be, Sergei's too obvious.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.280
He makes, he's more like Alfred.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.420
He makes the toys.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: You do realize that that was a secret,
right?

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.050
There's like this misdirect thing going on.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:33.490
And now you've just like, everybody on--.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:34.490
You know what?

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:35.490
We're gonna get kicked off YouTube.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:36.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, sorry.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:37.490
You know what?

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.090
I mean, you probably just, all you have to
do is hear Larry talk these days, you know

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.090
you know.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:41.090
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hey, I'm Batman.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.090
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:43.100
&gt;&gt;Reto: OK, keep this up and I'm cutting you
guys off.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.100
All right.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's right.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.100
Wait.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.100
Are we really being cut off?

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: No.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: So--.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Daniel just needs to go to the bathroom
again.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.100
All right.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.230
So, this is a good game, but it shouldn't
ask for that permission.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.230
That's dumb.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.230
Don't do that.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:56.230
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:57.520
And also, the game continues to play underneath
the lock screen when you lock it.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: What the hell?

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.040
&gt;&gt;Dan: We couldn't figure out how to stop
it, so we just did, we're not gonna allow

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.040
you to lock it.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.040
No.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.040
Don't do that.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.040
That sucks.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040
Oh, my God.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.040
Bad.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.040
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, I just, so guys.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.429
I wanna go on record in saying, and I'll just
hold this up.

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:17.350
Actually, can you put the device cam on the
phone cam?

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:18.350
Yeah.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.770
What does that say, Dan?

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.050
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's five point five percent alcohol
by volume.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:25.139
&gt;&gt;Ian: And how much is left?

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:26.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: About two-thirds of a bottle.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.070
&gt;&gt;Ian: I rest my case.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.070
Next game.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:33.619
&gt;&gt;Dan: Are you saying that I've been doing
more of the talking?

00:34:33.619 --> 00:34:34.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, no.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:36.679
You're supposed to do more of the talking.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.679
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:41.150
The next one is Toons 2012 Summer Games, which
displays that--.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.700
&gt;&gt;Ian: Can you say 2012?

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:43.700
Is that OK?

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:44.929
&gt;&gt;Dan: I think so.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:46.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Are you sure?

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.160
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: And games?

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, that's a good question.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think there's some jack booted thugs
out there that wanna--.

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:54.350
OK.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:55.350
Let's, moving right along.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.520
So, let's see this thing.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.520
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520
So, 2012--.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, dude.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.060
Is this like that old Hannah Barbara cartoon?

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:02.060
&gt;&gt;Dan: This--.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.480
&gt;&gt;Ian: Come on Mugsy, we need to cheat.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.280
&gt;&gt;Dan: I really loved this game, I hate to
say.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.390
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's all right.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:09.390
I love Summer Games.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.390
It's great.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:11.390
&gt;&gt;Dan: My, the sad--.

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:12.390
&gt;&gt;Ian: Not as good as Winter Games, but--.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:13.390
&gt;&gt;Dan: The sad points about this game.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:18.010
One, is that world challenge rather than actually
opening up a web view inside of the game,

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.770
actually opens up a web view outside of the
game.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:25.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: We could debate endlessly which is
worse, but the point is they open up a web

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.120
view.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.120
Come on.

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.120
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.120
It's sad.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.390
But any case.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:36.740
So, anyways, you've got, we can go through
here and we've got on-screen back buttons.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.360
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know what opening up a web view
says, by the way?

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.800
I'm just gonna say this and I know this is
gonna be a little bit politically incorrect.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:48.500
But opening up a web view basically says,
"We wanna cheat people on our payroll."

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.500
Right?

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.580
I mean, come on.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.450
You're like Java Script programmers.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.860
You gotta do that stuff?

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.860
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's do it native, come on.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.020
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.020
So, here we are.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.230
We have an on-screen back button and we have
no support for the back key.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: No good.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.340
No.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.340
Yeah, right there.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:10.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: They're at least targeting SDK, version
11 or higher or whatever 'cause we've gotten

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.490
rid of all of the menu key.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.650
This is the menu key, which is good.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:15.690
That's a good start.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:16.690
And--.

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.599
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's see the game, actually.

00:36:18.599 --> 00:36:19.760
You know what?

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.760
People are bored with us--.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.430
&gt;&gt;Dan: Harping on the menu key, back key,
over and over again.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.430
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: But they keep coming and stuff.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:28.600
And you know what that's like?

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.600
So sad.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: You get an email saying, "Hey, we didn't
actually feature you and here's why."

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:34.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:35.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's tough.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:39.160
&gt;&gt;Dan: I actually played the boxing game before,
so let's do it.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.160
All right.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.160
Here we are.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.160
And everything has this--.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: This is cute.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.160
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is totally cute.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.160
As I said, the whole game is cute.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.160
Defend.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.160
OK.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.160
Defend and--.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wow.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.619
It's like Punch Out, but with turtles.

00:36:50.619 --> 00:36:51.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:53.740
So, how do I attack?

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.740
There we are.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.740
Hit.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.740
Ooh, I like that.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: You like punching turtles?

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:58.740
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: You're a turtle puncher?

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.850
&gt;&gt;Dan: He's a snapping turtle.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:01.850
OK.

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:02.850
I'm totally this.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:03.850
Oh, man.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:08.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: I ate a turtle once and it was the
saddest thing ever 'cause they brought it

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.590
out with like this little shell on it and
everything.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.050
And he looked so cute.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:14.050
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:19.119
I remember going to the markets in Taipei
and actually seeing partially, recently, oh

00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:20.119
man.

00:37:20.119 --> 00:37:21.500
I just totally died.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.500
Let's see another sport.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.500
That one sucked.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.500
&gt;&gt;Dan: It looked good, though.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.500
Didn't it?

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: The back button doesn't work.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.500
&gt;&gt;Dan: The back button doesn't work anywhere
in this game.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.500
I just hit the home key.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, wow.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.770
&gt;&gt;Dan: You get to see what happens now.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.119
Let's go back.

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:34.119
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:35.800
&gt;&gt;Dan: Toon Summer Games.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: And--.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.040
&gt;&gt;Dan: Come on.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.040
Do it.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.040
Yeah.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.040
All right.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.040
&gt;&gt;Ian: BMX?

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.450
Wait, is BMX a summer game?

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:45.290
&gt;&gt;Dan: It is in their summer games.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:46.290
All right.

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: Can we play dressage?

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:52.369
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] No, I don't think they have
dressage.

00:37:52.369 --> 00:37:53.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.530
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, wow.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:56.530
Awesome.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:57.530
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.220
&gt;&gt;Ian: Seriously, this is just like those
cartoons we used to watch when we were kids.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.890
They were like Manilla Gorilla or whatever
he was.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:02.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: Totally.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:03.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, yeah.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:04.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is one of the, oh.

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:05.890
Sorry.

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:08.430
See, every time I pick up the tablet, we lose
HDMI.

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:09.430
Oh.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:10.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, that hurts.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.920
&gt;&gt;Dan: That did.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.920
Totally hurt.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: That is a really small bike.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.000
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] Anyways.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.260
I really do love this game.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.770
I want them to fix their back key issues.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:23.270
I wish we could feature them tomorrow.

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.200
I mean, to be honest, I'm sure it's--.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.510
Unfortunately, by the time they fix everything
in it, the games are gonna be over.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:37.119
&gt;&gt;Ian: What I love is the way that this gorilla
riding a BMX bike on these random sandy hills

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:40.320
is also doing it in front of a backdrop of
the London skyline.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.140
&gt;&gt;Ian: Look, it's the Gherkin.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.550
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] Exactly.

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.140
Look, it's the London Eye.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.310
&gt;&gt;Reto: Have you not been to London recently,
Ian?

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:51.300
You haven't seen the Great Sand Dunes of South
London?

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, I've not, but then again, I never
did go to South London.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: There you go.

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:59.580
&gt;&gt;Reto: You're missing out.

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:05.720
&gt;&gt;Dan: Actually, what we're just doing is
we're down in what like, in like Sussex or

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.020
something like that, right?

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.620
So, here's my real question, Reto.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:16.000
Are you checking for people that are asking
us questions or berating us or calling me

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.410
a racist on live stream?

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:20.420
Or, are you checking Meme Gen?

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.790
&gt;&gt;Reto: I'm reading memes and eating a sandwich.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:23.790
[Dan laughs]

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:24.790
&gt;&gt;Ian: Sure.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:25.790
How's that sandwich?

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:26.790
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's fantastic.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:27.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:28.790
The sandwiches here are great.

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:29.790
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm really glad you brought enough
for the whole class.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:30.790
&gt;&gt;Reto: Of course.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:31.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: [unintelligible].

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:33.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: Not after eating two psycho donuts
for breakfast.

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:34.640
&gt;&gt;Reto: Breakfast of champions.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: Indeed.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.980
&gt;&gt;Dan: I bet this is how you get, there we
are.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:40.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wait.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.980
You're--.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:42.980
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'm trying to lift.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:43.980
I'm trying to lift.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:44.980
There we are.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: This is, you can't actually see what
Dan is doing with his hands, but it's curious.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.280
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.590
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, yeah.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:52.590
Nice.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, wait.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:55.670
Ah.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:56.670
It's all over.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:57.670
Yes.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.670
Finished.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:59.670
No.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:00.670
I lost.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:01.670
I died.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.670
What a pity.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.670
Objective breached.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:04.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:05.670
So, what else do we have to look at today?

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.670
So, I love that game.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:10.520
We have, the last one is Blobby Volleyball.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:17.950
&gt;&gt;Dan: And once again, presentation-wise,
there's a lot of tack in this game.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:18.950
And there's just--.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:19.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: Tack?

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:20.950
&gt;&gt;Dan: Tech.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:22.570
There's a lot of tech in this game.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.260
But there just needs to be a lot of work in
the presentation.

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:30.340
There's nothing worse than having this old
school font than having this old school font

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.950
with this outline, which shows how low res
everything is.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:37.210
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, it could be, I mean, it could
be an homage.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:39.369
It feels like Lucas Arts in 1989.

00:40:39.369 --> 00:40:40.650
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:41.920
All right.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.450
We're gonna play against bots.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:47.550
This game really does shine, though, with
its two-player mode as far as I can tell.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:48.790
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, that's cool.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:49.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: And yeah.

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.980
And actually, the game itself is really well
done.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:55.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's like the ultimate distillation
of Dead or Alive beach volleyball.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:58.740
It kind of is.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:59.740
Wait.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.890
But no one would've like Dead or Alive beach
volleyball if it didn't have girls in bikinis,

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:03.890
right?

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:04.890
Isn't that--?

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:07.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think they've captured the essence
of it.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.570
[Dan laughs]

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:13.090
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'm sure someone would have.

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:17.270
Actually, one of my friends loved Dead or
Alive.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:19.170
Also, I do like the fact that you're actually--.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.210
&gt;&gt;Ian: My wife loved beach volleyball.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:23.450
To my enduring puzzlement.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.840
&gt;&gt;Dan: Also, you can hit the ball a lot.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.840
Yes.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.859
I finally won a point.

00:41:29.859 --> 00:41:36.050
&gt;&gt;Ian: This is really, by the way, we're,
if you'd like to help out with our show, we're

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:39.410
looking for a replacement for Dan, who can
play games.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:40.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:45.600
That's basically what it comes down to.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.600
[laughs]

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.350
So tell us about the game.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.369
What are they doing right?

00:41:50.369 --> 00:41:54.310
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, what they're doing right is they
actually have reasonable back key mode.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:59.861
And the game actually, the presentation actually,
when you actually get into the game itself,

00:41:59.861 --> 00:42:00.861
it's pretty good.

00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:05.230
What they need to do is obviously focus on
getting presentation everywhere to that level.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.230
And it's funny.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:07.230
It's that 90 percent thing.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:12.360
I think they've actually done, they have support
for wi-fi.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:18.350
It's like, it would be great if the wi-fi
stuff would feel a little less technical,

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:19.960
but it's cool Bluetooth.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:20.960
They actually have it too--.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: It does take you back, though.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.060
It takes to back to when you'd actually build
like an IPX, SPX LAN from scratch.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.060
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: Just to play Doom.

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:30.330
&gt;&gt;Dan: Totally, totally.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:33.250
And honestly, the final thing is just the
general presentation of the game.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:37.240
It just needs to be just that much sharper
and that much better.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.240
It needs polish.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: It needs polish.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.240
But it looks--.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, it's interesting because you
contrast this with something like Big Win

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:46.080
Baseball and the truth is, I'm not, I don't
want to make a value judgment about which

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.100
game is better, which game is more fun.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.060
But let's just talk about the packaging.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.530
The way that people feel when they're playing
the game.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:58.640
It's like you can have two cars that are equally
fast, equally as fun to drive.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.340
But one's all like rusted out and the paint's
all pitted and everything.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.310
And one's painted really nicely.

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:05.560
It just, it makes you feel psychologically
different.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.380
So we can turn off the basketball, the Blobby
Volleyball card here.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.660
And I really liked, the example is this.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:16.420
This is, if you turn off the Blobby Volleyball
card right now, Daniel.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.619
'Cause they're not on it anymore.

00:43:18.619 --> 00:43:19.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: Do you see what happened?

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.300
Do you see what happens?

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:26.800
One week, first week, always just right on
the ball, totally on the ball.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.050
Second week, just like, "Screw you guys."

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:30.170
&gt;&gt;Dan: Dan's talking.

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:31.170
There's a basketball--.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:32.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Whatever.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:36.190
And then I'm like watching something, yeah.

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:38.040
How are the young and the restless?

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: Because--.

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.740
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, no.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.260
He's looking at me and Jen.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.580
So, let's be serious.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.580
Yeah.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:48.580
I love soap operas.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.580
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, yes.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.580
So, so here we are.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.580
So just by comparison, this is Tip-Off here.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.020
I'm sorry, this is Basketball Lite here.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.490
And contrast that to what they've done in
their new game in terms of Tip-Off.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:57.490
And it's just--.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:58.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:00.520
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, this had a lot of loading screens,
but other than that,--.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:05.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: It hardly, I feel like a lot of it
is just going in and getting a designer to

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.690
work on the game for about five days or less
is all it would take.

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:10.690
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:11.690
They've done a lot here.

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:12.690
Let's--.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:13.690
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, no.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:14.690
I realize the implementation took longer.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:19.300
I'm saying like, if you or I was to go in
with a game, a crummy game that we did and

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.770
take it to Roman Nurik, for instance.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:21.770
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:22.859
&gt;&gt;Ian: Roman Nurik, the Ukranian.

00:44:22.859 --> 00:44:25.230
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, and have him hire an artist.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: No.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.590
I mean, he would like photoshop some mocks
for us.

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:34.300
And then, we could implement them and they
would look good instead of bad, the way most

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.300
of our games look.

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:36.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.300
Especially my games.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.390
So, in any case, yeah.

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:43.750
The, so that's just an example of a developer
who took an initial game concept, which was

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:48.570
really great, and took it to the next level
with this really cool, polished UI.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:52.660
And again, that's the kind of thing that needs
to happen with Blobby Volleyball.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.660
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's really good.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:57.120
And it just needs to be taken to that next
level.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.120
And you can tell, right?

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.250
You can tell if you're not at that level.

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:02.990
And if you can't?

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.250
Hire somebody who can.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.410
It's not the kind of talent everybody has.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:07.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:09.280
And my feeling is people say, "What does it
take to get featured?"

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.990
And I say, "Well, it takes a great game that
has a good presentation."

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.280
At least a good presentation.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.010
It doesn't have to be a spectacular presentation,
but you have to remember.

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:23.060
Your game has to be at that level, off the
screen here, if it doesn't have that presentation.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.100
Like, it has to be so good.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:28.650
It has to be a concept that's so amazing,
have never seen anything like it, that's got

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:31.610
rave reviews and that kind of thing.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:32.990
The presentation is really important.

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:36.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, 'cause remember, this reflects
on us, right?

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.100
The Google Play Team looks at a game.

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.290
Says, "OK, we're gonna maybe have a screen
shot.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.560
We're gonna have a feature graphic."

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:49.380
The quality of that presentation is going
to reflect directly on Google Play.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:54.710
And they're going to be asking themselves,
"Is today's set of games going to make Google

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:59.220
Play look like a champion, or is it gonna
make it look like the cigarettes and pure

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:04.560
water store across from my house, right next
to the porn dealership and the check cashing

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.560
place?"

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.580
&gt;&gt;Dan: You're house is in the most awesome
location.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:12.250
Let me just say that.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:13.250
So,--.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: Just think about that is all I'm saying.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.690
So, what you're looking at is--.

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:23.130
&gt;&gt;Ian: What are we looking at?

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:24.290
&gt;&gt;Dan: Wow.

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:25.460
All right.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.030
I'm not even gonna, I'm not gonna put that
up.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.030
So,--.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:29.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Was it dirty?

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:30.040
&gt;&gt;Dan: No.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:34.070
It said, so in there, in Blobby Volleyball,
they had me look at this.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.270
But in Blobby Volleyball, there's a copy.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:41.800
They mention that they're using the Paypal
library tool with ad blocking.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:42.890
So, yes.

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:43.890
Exactly.

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:44.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wait.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:45.890
Hang on.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:47.270
I'm trying to--.

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:48.370
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:49.470
&gt;&gt;Ian: What?

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:50.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: Put that up again.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.060
&gt;&gt;Dan: Nice.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: We're gonna do a special segment on
this.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:58.510
Special 30-second investigative segment on
what are they doing?

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:01.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: We added a paid feature for blocking
ads.

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:04.550
We need to add permission to read [inaudible]
and identity used by Paypal library to allow

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:06.359
in-app payments and ad blocking.

00:47:06.359 --> 00:47:09.660
First of all, you're not allowed to use Paypal
to do this.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.660
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:15.710
So you guys, by the time you go to look at
Blobby Volleyball, it may not be there anymore.

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:16.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's very possible.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.880
That violates Google policy.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.970
&gt;&gt;Dan: Our policy, yeah.

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:24.431
And actually, we recently updated the policy
to really clarify this to make it very, 'cause

00:47:24.431 --> 00:47:27.260
a lot of developers will read through the
policy and they wouldn't understand it.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.930
So now, it's very clear in the policy.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:30.930
So, yeah dudes.

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:33.840
Switch to using in-app payments on Google
Play if you're gonna list the game on Google

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:34.840
Play.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.840
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:36.840
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's just that simple.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:37.840
&gt;&gt;Ian: Everyone has to use in-app payments.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.750
There are a couple of small exceptions.

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:42.530
They don't apply to you.

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:43.530
I guarantee it.

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.530
They do not.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:45.530
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, they do not.

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:46.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, use Google Play payments.

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:51.420
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, and the real key thing is, again,
when someone's looking at the game, first

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.330
of all, putting OpenFeint pictures in your
game.

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:58.210
I mean, that does not make me want to go and
download the game right there at all.

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:00.960
It makes me actually not want to download
the game.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, especially the thing with the,
their list of what are those?

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:10.750
Oh, I thought that was like their tap joy
list or something, or an offer wall.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:11.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, no.

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:13.500
That's just how bad achievements look in OpenFeint.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.390
&gt;&gt;Ian: The only, and ironically, there is
one screen that looks great here.

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:18.620
And it's the end game screen.

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:19.620
It's not a bad game.

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: It is.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:21.620
It isn't.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:25.850
And actually, what's funny is the font, weirdly
enough, looks better in their screen shots

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:27.440
than it does in the game that I have.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.440
I'm not sure--.

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: That screen shot is reduced.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.440
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, no.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.640
It's actually, as I look it's a different
font style.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: Really?

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.640
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.070
That font, see it's a larger, wider serif
on the font.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:39.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: We could talk about this for days and
days.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:41.780
Let's go ahead and call a moratorium here.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.590
Call an end to this show.

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:44.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.680
&gt;&gt;Ian: But we've looked at some great sport's
games.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: Wait, have we?

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:50.440
Oh, yes, we have.

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: We have.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.810
And a lot of games that we did not know about.

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:55.320
I mean, we've seen the Madden's.

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.660
We've seen the--.

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:04.370
&gt;&gt;Ian: Those are fun games, but it was really
cool to see some smaller Indie titles, especially

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:06.450
that Tip-Off basketball, how they improved.

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:07.450
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:09.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think every developer can learn from
that story.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: I want you to, I was really personally
excited about Ninja Volley.

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:15.310
I really wanna see where that team goes with
that.

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:16.310
I think that--.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:17.310
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's a good idea.

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:18.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's a really good idea and it's really
cute.

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:22.660
And I was also personally, Tip-Off is great.

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:23.800
Star Dunk was really fun.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.820
Again, I like games that have competitive
aspects to it.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:28.820
And it was just awesome.

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.700
I did not know about the Toons Summer Games
game.

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.700
And I totally wanna see them just--.

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:33.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: That was really cute.

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:34.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: It was totally cute.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:35.030
I wanna see them clean it up.

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:37.610
I'm really sad that I didn't find out about
that a month ago.

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:38.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:40.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: To be honest because I would've said,
"All right.

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:42.390
Do this and this and this and this and then--."

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:43.390
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, yeah.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:44.390
We would've featured it for the Olympics.

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:45.390
Totally.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:46.390
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:47.390
We would absolutely feature it.

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:48.390
It's hard.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:50.130
I mean, the team here doesn't catch everything
that goes through.

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.180
And so, that's part of the reason we do this
show.

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:57.651
And so, I wish we would have done sports last
week, but we had a lot of fun with racing

00:49:57.651 --> 00:49:58.651
last week.

00:49:58.651 --> 00:49:59.900
And what's our next week's show?

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Next week's show is ARPGs.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.349
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's right.

00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:04.349
That's right.

00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:07.349
We're going to, A. What does A mean?

00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:08.910
&gt;&gt;Ian: J or K?

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:10.480
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, OK, OK.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.480
That's right.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.480
That's not a joke.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.480
So, we're talking about--.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: Japanese role-playing games, Korean
role-playing games.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.230
Really, any Pacific rim role-playing games.

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:19.790
You know what we're talking about--the genre.

00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:20.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: PRRPG.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:21.840
&gt;&gt;Ian: You can totally, yeah.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.840
It's not it.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.330
I mean, you don't have to be Asian to make
them, but--.

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:25.330
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, exactly.

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:26.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: It doesn't hurt.

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.560
So then--.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: Anachronox is in that model in some
ways.

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:30.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:31.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: I mean, it was still one of my favorites.

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:32.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:34.350
So, the yeah.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:37.470
The cutesy, PlayStation portable type of role-playing
games.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.290
There's a ton of them out there.

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:43.760
A lot of them come from like, Com2uS always
puts one out every few months, Gameville.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:48.390
&gt;&gt;Dan: By the way, I totally want to see a
mobile version of Anachronox, even though

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.210
I know no one useful has the rights to that
license.

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:52.180
&gt;&gt;Ian: I want to see that Mickey game, what
is that called?

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.180
Kingdom Hearts.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, Kingdom Hearts is awesome.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.940
&gt;&gt;Ian: That was so cool.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.300
So, yeah.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:03.740
If you guys know of some great Asian role-playing
games, we totally wanna see them.

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:08.320
Dan here is a huge fan and I nod along and
pretend that I understand what's happening.

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.220
&gt;&gt;Ian: So we'll totally go over that next
week.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.360
And we will see you on the flip side.

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:18.130
&gt;&gt;Dan: I just wanna point this out, that this
is almost gone, by the way.

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:19.420
It's almost gone, see?

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:20.420
Yeah.

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:21.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: That explains so much.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:22.810
All right.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:23.810
I'm Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:24.810
This is Dan Galpin.

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:26.530
Fred, no, I'm sorry.

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.250
Fred Chung was nowhere to be found.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:29.960
Reto Meier was our producer.

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.560
Daniel Phang was our engineer.

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.910
And we are out of here.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:34.910
&gt;&gt;Dan: Cheers.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:35.910
[clink]

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:39.450
That bottle was empty.
