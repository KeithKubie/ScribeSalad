1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.643
Okay.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.100
<v 1>During my last deployment to Iraq in 2006 one of the first things we did was a</v>

3
00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:11.530
series of operations on the eastern side of Ramadi.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.680
In order to execute these operations,

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.150
we took a majority of the seals to Camp Corregidor home with the first of the

6
00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:23.950
five oh six band of brothers on the edge of the [inaudible] district of mirror

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.000
of Ramadi.
Camp Corregidor was like Ford Apocalypse.

8
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.910
They received mortar fire RPGs and small arms fire daily.

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.950
The barracks were an old partially blown out building with sandbags in the

10
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:42.980
windows,
dirt floors and no air conditioning.

11
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.690
There were no showers.
It was hard living.

12
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.270
As far as the fighting Charlie company from the first of the five Oh six who who

13
00:00:55.941 --> 00:01:00.620
we were set to work with had suffered almost 40 casualties in the time they had

14
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:05.621
been in Ramadi and had gone from a fighting force of 140 to just over a hundred

15
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.970
Charlie company loved having seals with them after the first operation they

16
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:14.170
conducted with seals.

17
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.640
The company commander told his battalion CEO he wanted seals with him on every

18
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:20.440
mission to help keep his men alive.

19
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.200
As we continued these initial operations into the melodic district,

20
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.060
there were heavy firefights,

21
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.140
many dead enemy and multiple coalition casualties.

22
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.010
It was intense,
sustained combat.

23
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.330
Many would have considered camp Corregidor and eastern Ramadi to be hell on

24
00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:48.070
earth,
but I knew it was exactly where seals belonged.

25
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.070
We soon completed that first run of missions and headed back to our main camp.

26
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.060
When we got there,
I told one of the platoon commanders,

27
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.120
I wanted him to select guys to form a seven man squad to take back to Camp

28
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.863
Corregidor,

29
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.370
but he told me he didn't want to just pick guys.

30
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.780
He thought that some guys might not want to go back to Corregidor due to the

31
00:02:13.781 --> 00:02:18.160
hard living conditions,
the tough fighting and the high rate of casualties.

32
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.620
That sounded reasonable to me.

33
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.830
So I mustered the whole troop in the planning space.

34
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.020
I explained to them that we were sending a squad to Corregidor permanently

35
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.280
because the army is in a tough fight and suffering heavy casualties and that as

36
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:38.000
Americans,
as servicemen and as frogman,

37
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.590
we can not sit on the sidelines is that happens.
If there's a fight,

38
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.690
we need to be in it.

39
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.830
I wrote on the Dry Erase Board Camp Corregidor volunteers and I said to this

40
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:56.770
pack of seals,
if you want to go over to Corregidor,

41
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.330
if you want to volunteer to be in the area with the worst living conditions,

42
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.230
with the hardest fighting and with the highest chances of getting hurt or killed

43
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.431
the,

44
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:11.140
go ahead and write your name up on that board and then I walked out of the room

45
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.620
a short while later I came back in and I looked at the list on the board.

46
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.870
It was filled,
in fact,

47
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:29.070
every single seal to a man had written his name on that board.

48
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.480
Yes,
every man had volunteered to go forward

49
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.410
into that raging storm

50
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.820
and that is who we are.

51
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.420
That is what we joined the seal teams for to do what no one else can do.

52
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.050
In the worst areas.
In the worst conditions,

53
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.630
we crave the dirt and sweat and fire and blood.

54
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.310
Let there be no doubt it is in our soul.

55
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.960
It is in our nature.

56
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.420
Sure seals can do any job well,

57
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.330
but it isn't the belly of the beast where we thrive.

58
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.290
I have seen with my own eyes the whole sale slaughter that occurs when seals are

59
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.400
unleashed on the enemy as we were meant to be and it is incredible thing.

60
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.050
It is also a thing of strategic impact areas like Ramadi and solder city,

61
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.020
which after years of complete enemy control become pacified soon after the sort

62
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:49.051
of overwhelming carnage is wielded by the frog men on the high ground.

63
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.450
This is who we are,
death dealers,
killers,

64
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.010
executioners,

65
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.070
and in being so saviors,
defenders,

66
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.960
warriors,

67
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.490
<v 0>okay.</v>

68
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.700
<v 1>Now there are those that say we need to change,</v>

69
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.590
evolve and mature.

70
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.970
They claim that the nature of war has changed,

71
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.930
that it is more complex and demands a more sensitive approach.

72
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.650
I say they are wrong.

73
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.940
War May morph and appear different through the ages and when you live through a

74
00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:35.940
war and you see it up close like we are now,

75
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.280
you may notice complexities that you didn't perceive about the wards you studied

76
00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:42.600
in history class,

77
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.220
but I tell you there is nothing new.

78
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.220
The nature of war has never changed and never will change.

79
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The nature of war is deaf to kill the enemy before he kills you.

80
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.750
The rest is details.

81
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.663
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

82
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.160
<v 1>Now of course we can handle the details.
In fact,</v>

83
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.810
seals can excel at all of them.
Gathering intelligence,
assembling information,

84
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.310
forming alliances,
rebuilding communities,
training,
protecting,

85
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.610
treating seals can do anything,

86
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.230
but these details can also be done by others.

87
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.950
You don't need to be a seal to conduct those activities.

88
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.210
I say send seals forward into the violent Frey since yields where no one else

89
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:44.081
can go to do what no one else can do since you the find and butcher our enemies,

90
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:49.480
soulless masses and leave nothing behind but scorched earth and rubbled

91
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.790
buildings.
That is our nature.

92
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.760
As I look at the seal teams today,
I say to you all,
yes,

93
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.170
absolutely evolve.
Get smarter,
better,

94
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.060
faster,
more creative.

95
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.840
Learn to mitigate risk when you can figure out new ways to win.

96
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.480
Attack the enemy in new ways using information and intelligence.

97
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.820
Infiltrate the enemy and turn him against himself.
Evil against evil.

98
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.510
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

99
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.810
<v 1>adapt and overcome.
Changing enemy tactics.</v>

100
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.210
By all means,
evolve and get better every day,

101
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.740
every chance you get.

102
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.900
But don't forget the nature of war at.

103
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:43.060
Don't forget the nature of seals.

104
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.060
<v 0>Okay?</v>

105
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.060
<v 1>We must train brutally and without mercy so we can fight the same way brutally</v>

106
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.640
and without mercy.

107
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.640
Our job is to close with and destroy the enemy and we do it better than anyone.

108
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.620
Yes,
our current wars will someday end,

109
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.560
but war indoors before man was war,

110
00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:13.890
waited for him as long as man is,

111
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.670
war will always be always.

112
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.240
And our great nation will always need men to do what is in our nature.

113
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.280
Kill the enemy,
kill him as he sleeps.
Kill him as he plots.

114
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.280
Kill him as he hides.
Kill him as he fights.

115
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.710
That is our nature and that is our solemn duty.

116
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:44.893
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

117
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.290
<v 1>Light the fire.
Take the torch.</v>

118
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.620
Hold it high.
Let it burn bright.

119
00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.260
Let it supply

120
00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.310
<v 0>the warmth and light of freedom and liberty for our country men,</v>

121
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.990
but also let the fire incinerate our enemy.

122
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.620
Let the inferno consume everything he is,

123
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.760
everything he ever will be and everything he has ever held sacred.

124
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.063
Okay.

125
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.930
<v 1>As I walk away from the teams today,
I assure you I will never forget.</v>

126
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.140
I will never forget your service and sacrifice.
I will never forget you,

127
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.220
my fellow seals for getting me here to this day for leading me,

128
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.890
for following me and for watching my back.

129
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.810
I will never forget our fellow soldiers,
sailors,
airmen,

130
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:43.380
and marines that are fought and sacrificed so much.

131
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.170
I will never forget those big,

132
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:49.770
tough frogman and hardcore seals that came before me,

133
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.220
particularly the ones that raised me in the teams and taught me the true way of

134
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:59.190
the frog man.
And finally,

135
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.680
I will never forget our fallen brothers,

136
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.820
the many seals who have sacrificed their lives for our freedom,

137
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.370
especially Mark Lee,
Mike,
soar and Ryan.

138
00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:16.371
Job of seal team three task unit bruiser who lived and fought and died like

139
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:21.204
warriors.

140
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.970
I am humbled to serve with you all and I will never forget.

141
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.483
Thank you.

142
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.960
God bless the teams at God bless the United States of America.
