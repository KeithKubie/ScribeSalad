BOBBY FLAY: What's up everybody?

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:08.740
Thanks for being here.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.906
I'm very excited to be here.

00:00:09.906 --> 00:00:11.740
I've wanted to come
here for a long time.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.960
A lot of my friends who
are chefs have cooked here,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.890
and I always kind
of felt left out.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.510
So I'm glad that I got an
invitation to come here.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.990
So today I'm going to make
a version of carnitas.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.500
This is from my new
book, "Bobby Flay FIT."

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.630
I have a new book coming out
in just a handful of days.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.370
And it is about eating
in a healthful way

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.040
and just living a
healthier lifestyle.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.850
You know, as a chef, I
get asked all the time

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.590
how I stay in shape.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.180
And so I figured it was time
to write a cookbook about that.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.490
And so today's dish is actually
a play on a classic Mexican

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.860
or southwestern dish called
carnitas, which you've all

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.230
seen carnitas tacos everywhere.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.060
And most of the time its--

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.560
carnitas are cooked
with a pork shoulder,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.124
which has tons of fat in it.

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:04.540
And then they fry it at the
end and make it really crispy,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.710
which is always a
good thing, of course.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.830
But I'm going to actually make
a much simpler version of it,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.510
a healthier version, and one
that, actually, you can cook

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.430
in a very quick amount of time.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.810
So here's the deal.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.820
So we're going to make
the pork carnitas.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.880
It's going to have a pomegranate
and chipotle glaze on it.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.190
And we're going to make
some guacamole, which

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.440
is, I think, the recipe that
you guys are all actually

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.500
going to take away and then
use more than anything else.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.130
But that's OK.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.260
I mean, that's how
I cook my food.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.650
I make things with--

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.285
I make one component at a time,
and then you can sort of mix

00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:39.910
and match them.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.010
They don't necessarily
have to all go together.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.320
But in this case, they will.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.610
We're going to make
some pickled red onions.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.510
I'll show you how I
make those as well.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.380
Now usually when I make
pickled red onions,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.000
like if you watch
"Beat Bobby Flay,"

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.830
I make a lot of pickled
red onions for garnish.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.210
Because they're crispy,
they're tart, they're sweet.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.630
They can be really pretty.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.170
And a lot of times I'll just
use, like, some grenadine

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.850
and some vinegar.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.480
So you want something
acidic, and then you

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.419
want something sweet.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.460
In this case, we're going
to use some lime juice,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.690
and some water, and
then some cane sugar.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.000
They tell me that cane sugar
is better than processed sugar,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.780
so we're going to use that.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.360
And you just put
this on the stove,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.050
and then you bring it to a boil.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.190
And once you get it to a
boil, once you get to a boil,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.940
it's ready to go.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.880
You don't need to
reduce it down.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.112
You don't need to cook it
for a long period of time.

00:02:36.112 --> 00:02:37.570
You just want to
have that solution

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.580
to pour over the onions.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.620
And the way I cut
my onions for this

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.260
is, I cut them very thinly
in sort of half moons.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.110
So we're going to just
take the peel off.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.450
And then, very
carefully, you just

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.545
want to slice half moons of
the onion, just like this.

[KNIFE HITTING WOODEN CUTTING
 BOARD]

00:03:06.034 --> 00:03:07.450
And the great thing
about this is,

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.570
like, when you
pickle jalapenos, you

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.071
can use the same recipe, the
pickling recipe, for anything

00:03:14.071 --> 00:03:15.070
that you want to pickle.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.810
You can pickle jalapenos.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.360
You can pickle some cauliflower
if you want, some carrots.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.497
It's really up to you.

00:03:20.497 --> 00:03:22.580
Pickled vegetables have
become, obviously, really,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.704
really important.

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:25.120
I'm finding that
in my restaurant.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.287
Like, at Gato,
people are basically

00:03:27.287 --> 00:03:28.870
eating fish and
vegetables these days.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.790
I mean, it's amazing how
many vegetables we have.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.310
In fact, the number one dish
is a kale and wild mushroom

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.660
paella.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.935
And it's a vegetarian paella.

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:42.115
And we've been open for
about four years in March,

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:44.680
and every single night since
the day the restaurant's opened

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.930
it's been the number one dish.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.210
I would have never predicted
that four years ago--

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.860
that a vegetarian dish
would be the number one

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.190
dish on my restaurant menu--

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.714
ever.

00:03:52.714 --> 00:03:54.880
I mean, in fact, I almost
didn't put it on the menu.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.504
I'm, like, this is
never going to sell.

00:03:56.504 --> 00:03:57.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.800
That tells you how
much we know-- nothing.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.490
OK.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.211
So very thinly sliced onions--

00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:06.938
and do we have a
mixing bowl for this?

00:04:06.938 --> 00:04:08.040
This one?

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.540
OK.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.748
[BOWL CLINKS AGAINST COUNTER]

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:10.650
Found it!

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.083
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:12.800
All right.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.590
So we put some onions in here.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.279
And then you just
bring this to a boil,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.279
and then you just basically
just pour this over.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.100
And as the pickling
liquid sits on the onions,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.600
it will just pickle the
onions more and more.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.630
And you don't have to remove
the pickling liquid at all.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.500
In fact, actually, I
like to just put it

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.130
in a Mason jar, put
in my refrigerator.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.570
When I need some,
I just take them.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.236
And it just preserves
them, and you just

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.620
have it for a long time.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.110
And you can really go for,
you know, months and months,

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.260
really, when you pickle
a vegetable like that.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.510
So it's really cool to have.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.370
And usually, like
in the beginning

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.902
of the summer in my
house out East, I usually

00:04:49.902 --> 00:04:51.360
pickle a bunch of
red onions, and I

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.980
pickle a bunch of
jalapenos, basically,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.855
for the whole summer.

00:04:53.855 --> 00:04:56.180
So when I'm making, like,
fish tacos with my friends,

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.700
or even a dish like this, I
know that those two components

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.890
are already done.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.829
And I mean, that's
key to cooking.

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:05.370
At some point, you as the cook
want to get out of the kitchen

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.310
and to the table.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.400
So that's one of
the ways I do it.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.705
OK, so those are
the pickled onions,

00:05:10.705 --> 00:05:13.620
and we'll bring those
back later to garnish.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.840
And now we're going to
make a glaze for the pork.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.610
So as I said before, we're
going to use pork tenderloin.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.670
And we have two components
for the pork tenderloin.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.700
A spice rub-- we want to create
some flavor and some texture

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.380
on the outside of
the pork tenderloin--

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.870
and then also a glaze.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.790
So for the glaze, it's going
to be some pomegranate molasses

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.160
and some pomegranate juice.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.400
So basically, if you reduce
the pomegranate juice,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.110
you get pomegranate molasses.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.050
It's a much thicker, syrupy,
like, pomegranate juice,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.950
and it's very thick.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.150
So you can find this in--

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.090
basically, you can find
this everywhere now.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.960
I mean, this has become a very
sort of fashionable product

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.400
in American cooking.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.064
So some pomegranate juice--

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.480
you can use cranberry
juice if you

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.688
can't find pomegranate juice.

00:05:58.688 --> 00:06:01.000
But again, obviously, you
can find it everywhere now.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.020
Some pomegranate molasses
for some thickness, and then

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.650

and they're great.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.270
It's fiery.

something to wake it up.

They're really magic.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.597
Do you use them a lot?

00:06:48.597 --> 00:06:49.180
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.720
BOBBY FLAY: Yeah,
they're fantastic.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.870
You know, in some ways,
they've almost become a cliche.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.856
I mean, there's obviously a
restaurant chain all over,

00:06:57.856 --> 00:06:59.480
on every street
corner, named Chipotle.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.500
But that doesn't mean that
I don't want to use this,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.240
because this thing is so good.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.740
OK.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.240
It's smoky.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.690
It's fiery.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.700
And that's the thing
that I like to do.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.470
I like to sort of
counterbalance.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.780
If I have something
sweet or tart,

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.140
I want to add something
that's a little sour or spicy.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.920
And that's the key
to my food-- where

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.040
there's lots of flavor
going on, but the balance

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.120
is really the key.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.890
So in this case, you have
the tart and the sweetness

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.360
of the pomegranate,
and then you have

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.250

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.840
You have the pork.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.220
The pork doesn't
have a ton of flavor,

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.420
because there's not
a lot of fat in it.

But it's going to have the
spice rub on the outside of it,

So three ingredients
for the spice rub--

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.460
some chili powder, some
coriander seed, and then

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.010
some cumin.

Cumin is very, very powerful.

So you just need a little bit.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.730
And then some salt and pepper.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.010

A little bit of canola oil--

now a lot of people ask me why
I don't cook with olive oil.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.580
I use extra virgin

So cumin-- if you're
not familiar with cumin,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.230
it's a spice that you'll find
in lots of Latin cooking,

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.106

South American cooking.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.760
And it's very earthy.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.280
It almost has a musty flavor,
but a little bit really

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.934
goes a long ways.

a little cumin in it.

much, then you can overpower.

And we're going to put
one layer of the pork--

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.362
now this is a very common
mistake for a home cook.

00:11:20.362 --> 00:11:21.490
They have a lot of pork.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.215
They pour it all into the pan.

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:26.685
And what happens is
it starts to steam

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:28.270
it as opposed to saute it.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.250
So what I want to do
is I want to make sure

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:35.310
that every piece of pork is
touching the bottom of the pan.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.730
We want direct heat.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.980
If I have pork on the
bottom of the pan,

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.810
and then pork on top of the
pork, what's going to happen?

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.002
It's going to create steam.

00:11:46.002 --> 00:11:47.710
And then the pork is
just going to steam.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.260
We're not going to get that
nice crust on the outside.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.135
So basically, the way to do
it is you have to be patient

00:11:53.135 --> 00:11:54.010
and do it in batches.

00:11:56.075 --> 00:11:57.950
And you don't want to
crowd the pan too much.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.330
You want to give it some room.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.920
Because otherwise, the
same thing will happen.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.572
And I always get a little
extra salt and pepper.

00:12:09.572 --> 00:12:10.530
That's the other thing.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:14.190
I mean, the difference between
a professional cook and a home

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.260

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.364
for the most part, not
100% across the board--

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.530
but for the most part, the
thing that I see the most

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.630
is that a home cook is a little
more timid with seasoning.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.192
And in my kitchen, I'm
constantly saying to my cooks,

00:12:27.192 --> 00:12:29.400
did you season it on both
sides with salt and pepper?

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.810

basics of cooking

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.320
is seasoning the food first.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.367

00:12:39.367 --> 00:12:40.950

just missing.

just simple salt and pepper.

because I just go like this.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.730
I mean, a pinch is this.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.340

And I use kosher
salt. And kosher salt

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.230
is-- it's large
granules of salt, right?

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.870
So the right way to season--

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.232
I won't put more in here,
I'll just do it over here--

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.440
is you take it in your hands.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.630
So this is a pinch, all right?

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.530
There's your answer.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.910
I don't know how much that is.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.370
And you crush it
in your fingers.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.110
So as you're crushing
it, you season the food.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.350
And then you season
from up here, not here.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.100
Because if you season
close to the food,

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.360
you're going to just get pieces
of salt in particular places.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.790
If you're seasoning
from up here,

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.117
you'll distribute
it much better.

AUDIENCE: How do you
know that the meat--

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.820
BOBBY FLAY: Well,
in this case, it's

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.030
going to cook really quickly.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.560
So I mean, if you were
cooking a pork tenderloin,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.960
you'd want to make sure
it was, like, one--

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.970
So a meat thermometer,
which I barely ever

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.430
use because I use this
touch, this method,

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.210
which is just experience.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.190
But really, you should test it.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.565
So at 150, 155, you should
take it out and let it rest.

00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:05.690
Because it's going to
continue to cook it till it's

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:06.745
stone cold.

00:16:06.745 --> 00:16:07.605

it's sliced steak, right?

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.381
So you want your avocados--

00:16:50.381 --> 00:16:51.880
obviously, when you
go to the store,

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.919
the avocados are never ripe.

00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:54.710
I mean, it's crazy.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.820
You have to dig.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.990
I mean, I've had like--

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:06.192
it's almost like silent
wars at the avocado stand.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.900
Because you know, the
person is up there,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.319
and there's, like, two
ripe avocados out of 400.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:14.680
And you get it, and they look
at you with a dirty look.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.670
Here's the thing.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.410
You have to dig
underneath the avocados.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.940
Because a lot of
times, what happens

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.560
is the avocados on
the top aren't ripe,

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.740
and the ones that are
being covered by the light

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.599
are actually ripening quicker.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:28.270
So when you're in Whole Foods
or wherever you're shopping,

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.370
just make sure that you
go through the bottom,

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.536
and look under the bottom,
because you'll definitely

00:17:32.536 --> 00:17:33.640
find some ripe avocados.

I didn't have to go
digging for them.

is I slice around

They're a little bit spicier.

of fresher way to do it.

I mean, it will be a little
bit spicier with the seeds in.

That's OK.

this trick, right?

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.290
if you want it to be a little
bit more sort of fit-like,

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.040
lettuce leaves.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.330
And I find the best ones
are butter lettuce or Boston

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.670
lettuce.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.570
Just because of their
shape, they hold together.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.680
But they're soft
at the same time.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:48.315
And then, we just take
some of our pork carnitas--

00:24:48.315 --> 00:24:52.080
and don't fill it up too
much, just a little bit.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.400
OK.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.865
And then a little bit
of the guacamole--

00:25:29.805 --> 00:25:33.140
so you know, you're getting
the tenderness from the pork.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.630
You're getting that sort
of smooth, cooling effect

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.336
from the avocado
and the guacamole.

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:39.960
And the the pickled
red onions is

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.789
going to add that crunch to it.

00:25:48.691 --> 00:25:49.677
Here we are.

00:25:57.072 --> 00:26:00.460
And then, for garnish,
some pomegranate

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.220
seeds to bring-- to reinforce
the flavor of the pomegranate

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:16.600
glaze and a squeeze of lime.

00:26:19.939 --> 00:26:21.245
There we go, pork carnitas.

00:26:21.245 --> 00:26:26.972
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:26.972 --> 00:26:30.100
Can we hand these out or not?

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.356
I promise you won't die.

00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:32.927
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:32.927 --> 00:26:34.010
There's only four of them.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.676
This is like being
at the avocado stand.

00:26:35.676 --> 00:26:37.009
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:37.009 --> 00:26:38.800
I'll just-- I'll let
you guys fight it out.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.764
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:40.764 --> 00:26:41.930
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.860
To go back to the
avocados, if you

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.500
are unable to actually
find a ripe avocado,

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.210
how do you ripen it?

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:51.420
BOBBY FLAY: To ripen
an avocado, you

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.747
put it in a brown
paper bag or something,

00:26:54.747 --> 00:26:56.860
get it away from the light.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.620
And it will ripen.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.040
It doesn't take that long.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.400
A couple of days, and you
will have ripe avocados.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.695
It goes really fast.

00:27:04.695 --> 00:27:06.804
You guys didn't really
share with your friends.

00:27:06.804 --> 00:27:07.772
That was it.

00:27:07.772 --> 00:27:11.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:13.015
BOBBY FLAY: Anybody else?

00:27:13.015 --> 00:27:13.514
Yeah?

00:27:16.054 --> 00:27:18.220
AUDIENCE: My eight-year-old
is, like, super obsessed

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.510
with "Beat Bobby Flay."

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.690
BOBBY FLAY: Oh, is that right?

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:20.560
AUDIENCE: She's always
wondering, like,

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.226
why do they all want
to beat Bobby Flay?

00:27:22.226 --> 00:27:24.165
So she sent me a
bunch of questions.

00:27:24.165 --> 00:27:24.790
BOBBY FLAY: OK.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.550
AUDIENCE: I'm only
going to ask--

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.310
BOBBY FLAY: How many are there?

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.666
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:27.666 --> 00:27:28.690
AUDIENCE: I'll only ask one.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.440
BOBBY FLAY: Good.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.015
AUDIENCE: So what made
you start cooking?

00:27:32.015 --> 00:27:33.640
BOBBY FLAY: What made
me start cooking?

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.210
I dropped out of high school.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.545
So tell her not to do that.

00:27:37.545 --> 00:27:40.170
I dropped out of high school in
10th grade, and I needed a job.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:41.980
And so I went to
work in a restaurant.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.480
I started out as a
busboy, actually,

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.260
for the first two weeks.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.295
And then I was offered
a job in the kitchen.

00:27:48.295 --> 00:27:49.499
And I was, like, OK.

00:27:49.499 --> 00:27:51.040
I mean, you know,
I was 17-years-old.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.960
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.904
But I fell in love with it.

00:27:54.904 --> 00:27:56.320
And then I went
to culinary school

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.171
after that, about a
year and a half later.

00:27:58.171 --> 00:28:01.344
And I've basically been doing
the same thing for 35 years.

00:28:01.344 --> 00:28:03.260
AUDIENCE: Where did you
go to culinary school?

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.970
BOBBY FLAY: Well, it used to
be called The French Culinary

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.980
Institute on Grand
Street and Broadway.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.800
And now it's called the
International Culinary Center,

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.760
yes.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.458
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:12.458 --> 00:28:13.291
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:14.150
BOBBY FLAY: Yes.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.085
I'm really upset
that they changed

00:28:15.085 --> 00:28:16.376
the name of my only alma mater.

00:28:16.376 --> 00:28:17.739
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:18.780
BOBBY FLAY: Anybody else?

00:28:21.719 --> 00:28:23.760
AUDIENCE: Other than your
own restaurants, what's

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.040
your favorite in New York City?

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.250
BOBBY FLAY: I like Via Carota,
which is an Italian trattoria

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.750
right over on Grove Street.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:35.250
It reminds me of walking
down the street in Rome,

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:38.070
and you getting lucky
that you found this place.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.980
The food is very simple,
but executed perfectly.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.909
And it's a place that
I feel like I can go

00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:45.683
all the time, Via Carota, yeah.

00:28:45.683 --> 00:28:47.683
I shouldn't have told you
that, because now it's

00:28:47.683 --> 00:28:48.808
going to be hard to get in.

00:28:48.808 --> 00:28:49.308
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:49.308 --> 00:28:50.682
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:28:50.682 --> 00:28:51.460
It was super good.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.172
BOBBY FLAY: Good.

00:28:52.172 --> 00:28:56.610
AUDIENCE: How long do you pickle
onions for, any pickling--

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:57.895
jalapenos, et cetera?

00:28:57.895 --> 00:29:00.020
BOBBY FLAY: I mean, you
should probably pickle them

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.600
for at least a couple hours.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.060
But then you just have them--

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.290
you just put the whole
thing in a Mason jar

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.749
and keep them in
your refrigerator.

00:29:06.749 --> 00:29:08.665
AUDIENCE: You don't want
to use those, though?

00:29:08.665 --> 00:29:09.920
Because you just made them?

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.961
BOBBY FLAY: No, exactly--

00:29:10.961 --> 00:29:12.132
I used these.

00:29:12.132 --> 00:29:12.840
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.502
BOBBY FLAY: These
were made when?

00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:16.386
SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:16.386 --> 00:29:17.797
BOBBY FLAY: All right, yeah.

00:29:17.797 --> 00:29:18.880
But they're still crunchy.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.840
They're sweet and tart.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.442
They're good.

00:29:21.442 --> 00:29:22.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:28.259 --> 00:29:28.925
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:29:28.925 --> 00:29:29.240
BOBBY FLAY: Hi.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.900
AUDIENCE: I have a question
in terms of the oil you used.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.430
What about coconut oil?

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:37.110
Because in high temperature,
at least my whatever,

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:41.080
Google searches have said
that coconut oil least

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.070
is a little better than--

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:46.450
because the way it breaks down.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.720
BOBBY FLAY: I mean, honestly,
I'm not an oil expert.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.030
But the thing about
coconut oil, is

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.530
it really tastes like coconut.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.910
It has flavor.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:30:01.310
I like canola because
it's a lot cleaner flavor.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.740
A lot of people I know use
coconut oil, and they like it.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.660
So that's actually
a good oil to use.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.970
Grapeseed oil is another
one that people use.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:12.080
Peanut oil, also, is
one that can actually

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.656
take very high heat.

00:30:13.656 --> 00:30:16.220
See, that's what
happens is-- if you

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:20.100
want to get your saute pan
smoking to sear something,

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.950
and you have extra
virgin olive oil in it,

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.570
it's going to make it bitter.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:29.700
And these lighter oils,
coconut oil included,

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.756
can withstand the higher heat
without loosing its integrity.

00:30:34.756 --> 00:30:37.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.570
AUDIENCE: So besides
going to culinary school,

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.320
if you're someone who's
interested in home

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.247
cooking, what are your tips
to improve your skills?

00:30:44.247 --> 00:30:46.330
Like, what's a good way
to continue to get better?

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.538
BOBBY FLAY: Buy all my books.

00:30:47.538 --> 00:30:48.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:52.165
BOBBY FLAY: Um, look, you
know, as you guys know better

00:30:52.165 --> 00:30:58.220
than anybody, you have access
to so many things online.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:02.520
And in fact, like, you
know, on "Beat Bobby Flay,"

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.780
I get challenged to things
that I've never done before.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.170
And I spend-- like,
when I can't sleep at 3

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.170
o'clock in the morning--

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.880
I'm watching YouTube videos
of dishes from Ethiopia.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.990
I mean, I'm serious--

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.880
like, to see what they are like.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.410
And it really gives me--

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:24.040
it's actually way better
than just reading a recipe.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:28.537
Because you get to see
how the dish continues

00:31:28.537 --> 00:31:30.870
to evolve as they cook it
when they add the ingredients.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:32.877
And that's a big difference.

00:31:32.877 --> 00:31:33.960
AUDIENCE: Awesome, thanks.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:39.240
BOBBY FLAY: I mean, there's
so much how-to online now.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.120
And there's no substitute
for experience.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.144
Do it.

00:31:43.144 --> 00:31:45.435
And I always say to people,
like, a lot of times people

00:31:45.435 --> 00:31:47.359
will say to me, I'm a
disaster in the kitchen.

00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:49.650
I don't know how to cook
anything, but I need to learn.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.320
For whatever reason, they've
decided this is the time.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.060
And I always say to them,
you need five dishes.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.320
Figure out how to make a
fish dish, a pasta dish,

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.500
you know, a steak, a
salad, something else.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.250
And then, once you
have those five dishes,

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.083
and you continue to
make them over and over,

00:32:05.083 --> 00:32:07.350
you're going to get tired
of making them the same way.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.090
And it's going to
force you to sort

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.630
of start to add
things to the dishes

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.050
and move onto the next thing.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.580
But think about
all the experience

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.246
that you're getting
making those dishes.

00:32:17.246 --> 00:32:18.930
That's the key.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.967
It's like when you ask me-- how
do you know when it's cooked?

00:32:21.967 --> 00:32:24.550
I know when it's cooked because
I can look at it and tell you.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.614
But that's because I've
had a lot of experience.

00:32:26.614 --> 00:32:29.030
The more you do something, the
more comfortable you'll be.

00:32:31.583 --> 00:32:32.166
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:33.760
That was a nice YouTube plug.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.500
I like that.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.010
But I was just
wondering if there's

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.350
any, like, city or
small town that you've

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.910
been to that kind
of surprised you

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.887
with how good the restaurants
were or the food was there

00:32:43.887 --> 00:32:46.220
that's not like New York City
where you have everything.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.060
BOBBY FLAY: Cities?

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like, a
smaller city or something.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.310
BOBBY FLAY: I mean, honestly,
the food in this country

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.580
is getting to be amazing
everywhere in this country.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.750
I mean, it never
used to be that way.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.880
You know, I was
just in Albuquerque,

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.574
and what's going on
there is amazing.

00:33:04.574 --> 00:33:05.990
Obviously, a place
like Charleston

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.990
has blown up already.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:14.335
Seattle, Minneapolis--
amazing food there--

00:33:14.335 --> 00:33:15.710
actually, one of
the chefs-- this

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.126
is what's happening
a lot, because

00:33:17.126 --> 00:33:18.890
of the economies
of scale of opening

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:21.725
a restaurant in New York, which
frankly, have become close

00:33:21.725 --> 00:33:22.700
to impossible.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.620
I mean, it's really hard.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:31.710
And a really great chef, who is
the chef de cuisine of Danielle

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:35.320
for many years, his
name is Gavin Kaysen--

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.620
he did his time with Danielle.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.680
He got great reviews
under Danielle,

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.800
and it was, like, OK,
it's time for me to go.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.065
Now most people
would, at that point,

00:33:46.065 --> 00:33:48.190
find a restaurant in New
York, a space in New York,

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:50.430
get a partner, and
they'd open a restaurant.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.200
He decided to go back to
his roots in Minneapolis.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.450
That's why I thought about it.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:56.660
And he's killing it.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.670
You know, the economies of scale
in a city like that work way

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.920
better.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.766
And now there's an
appreciation for good food,

00:34:04.766 --> 00:34:07.140
and people are willing to pay
for it basically everywhere

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:07.940
in this country.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.692
That never used
to be the truth--

00:34:09.692 --> 00:34:11.010
the case.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.710
But it took us a long time
for us, in this country,

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.219
to catch up to the rest of
the world in terms of food's

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:18.820
important to us.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.080
And I think, in
most cases, we've

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.657
surpassed the rest of the world.

00:34:22.657 --> 00:34:23.156
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:23.156 --> 00:34:23.864
BOBBY FLAY: Sure.

00:34:27.564 --> 00:34:29.480
AUDIENCE: So I was just
wondering what you'd--

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.550
BOBBY FLAY: I feel like
you're going to challenge me.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.091
AUDIENCE: No.

00:34:31.091 --> 00:34:31.927
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:31.927 --> 00:34:33.260
BOBBY FLAY: You just came at me.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.563
Like, you kind of like squared
off with me right there.

00:34:35.563 --> 00:34:36.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.639
What's your-- come
on, what's the dish?

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:38.472
All right, let's go.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:43.520
AUDIENCE: I was wondering, like,
when you cook at home, just

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.969
for yourself, how
do you approach it.

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:48.130
Do you try to make crazy things?

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.700
Or do you just
have a go to dish?

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:53.280
BOBBY FLAY: Like, bacon,
egg, and cheese sandwich?

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.698
I mean, chefs cook for
themselves really simply

00:34:55.698 --> 00:34:56.198
at home.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:03.010
You know, I'm trying
to think about--

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:06.726
like, only for myself, or
for having a dinner party?

00:35:06.726 --> 00:35:11.180
Just for myself, I mean,
it's really not much.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.630
It's really like an egg
sandwich or something.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.820
I'm never home for
dinner, because I'm always

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.500
in the restaurants
or somewhere else.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.999
And I'm never really
home for lunch.

00:35:19.999 --> 00:35:21.350
So it's usually breakfast.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:24.252
Or, like, if I've been
out late, and I've

00:35:24.252 --> 00:35:26.210
had a couple of cocktails,
and I want something

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:29.630
to sort of quench my
hunger, it literally

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.490
is, like, a bacon, egg,
and cheese sandwich.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:36.650
And it's nothing
that's better ever--

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:40.255
hot sauce, boom.

00:35:40.255 --> 00:35:41.534
That's the truth.

00:35:41.534 --> 00:35:42.950
I could have said,
yeah, you know,

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:45.744
I take a little foie
gras and some caviar.

00:35:45.744 --> 00:35:47.238
That doesn't happen.

00:35:47.238 --> 00:35:49.230
Anybody else?

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:56.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
saying that--

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:57.680
did you get that?

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.180
Or do you want me
to say it again?

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.610
I remember that was one of
the more difficult ones.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:06.126
What's the most difficult
"Beat Bobby Flay" or anything

00:36:06.126 --> 00:36:08.970
that you've been
challenged to make?

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:09.890
BOBBY FLAY: It's too--

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:11.350
that was a tough one.

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:14.380
Listen, when I get taken
out of my wheelhouse,

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.590
those are the best shows.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:17.770
Because I'm like-- I'm
stumped, for the most part.

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:21.840
But no matter what, I'm
going to cook something.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.530
And a lot of times it's never
an authentic version of it,

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:29.880
because I don't know
the authentic version.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.170
I'm making sort of what I
think the dish might be,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:37.810
or sort of a play on it.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.637
So I think it was-- you
know, I brought up Ethiopia,

00:36:40.637 --> 00:36:42.220
because Marcus
Samuelson challenged me

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.485
to the national
dish of Ethiopia.

00:36:44.485 --> 00:36:45.884
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:45.884 --> 00:36:48.050
I don't know-- I don't even
remember the name of it.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.841
And so basically-- and
then somebody else--

00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:51.336
it was an Iranian dish?

00:36:51.336 --> 00:36:54.180
SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.950
BOBBY FLAY: Yeah.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:57.330
It was-- yeah.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.600
You know, so those--

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.390
and a dish like bibimbap--
at least bibimbap

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:07.110
is a dish that I
like to eat, right?

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.610
So when I go to a
Korean restaurant,

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.200
I'm always ordering bibimbap.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.617
So I mean, I get it.

00:37:11.617 --> 00:37:12.700
You know, it's vegetables.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.575
It's meats, whatever.

00:37:13.575 --> 00:37:16.170
It's rice.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:17.800
It's not going to be authentic.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.830
So if somebody from South Korea
landed at the table, they'd be,

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:23.520
like, what is this?

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.680
But that said, it's
my version of it.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.790
And actually, I
thought the bibimbap--

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:29.790
I lost the bibimbap one.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.498
But I was, like, I
think I have a chance.

00:37:31.498 --> 00:37:32.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.980
The other two dishes, I
literally had no chance.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.740
I mean, I was just kind of
watching what they were doing.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.720
And I'm like, all
right, chili powder.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.270
You know?

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.621
OK, rice, saffron, great.

00:37:41.621 --> 00:37:42.120
You know?

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.180
And kind of, like, I just
tried to make it taste good.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.100
That's ultimately
what I try to do.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.200
And the culinary team
behind the scenes,

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.180
who procure all the
ingredients and everything,

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.827
there's a guy there
who says to me--

00:37:55.827 --> 00:37:57.660
he's, like, the reason
why you win sometimes

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.780
is because you understand
the yummy factor.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.590
So when the judges
taste it, they're,

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:02.750
like, oh, this tastes good.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.500
And that's the key.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.090
It's that the judges
don't see who made what.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.740
It's blind.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:12.330
They're only tasting the
dish after it's been plated,

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:13.590
and we're just standing there.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.259
So they don't know
who made which dish.

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:17.550
So I always know that there
are certain things-- like I

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:21.930
was talking to you guys about
before, where you combine sour

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:26.040
and tart and sweet and spicy,
and all those things that make

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.230
you go, oh, this tastes good.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.940
So even if it's not authentic,
if I can make it taste good

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.140
and I don't know what
I'm doing, I have a shot.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.727
It doesn't work out
most of the time.

00:38:35.727 --> 00:38:36.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.268
BOBBY FLAY: Sure.

00:38:39.907 --> 00:38:40.448
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:40.448 --> 00:38:41.749
BOBBY FLAY: Hi.

00:38:41.749 --> 00:38:44.165
AUDIENCE: Can you recommend
where to get good fresh fruits

00:38:44.165 --> 00:38:48.857
and vegetables in Manhattan
and maybe the Upper West Side?

00:38:48.857 --> 00:38:50.190
BOBBY FLAY: What are you saying?

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.290
You don't like
where you shop now?

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:55.035
AUDIENCE: I think it's hard
to find good, fresh fruits

00:38:55.035 --> 00:38:56.884
and vegetables in the city.

00:38:56.884 --> 00:38:59.300
BOBBY FLAY: I will say that
when you go to the West Coast,

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.500
it's a lot easier.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.550
And you know, I guess that's
just because of the place

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:06.900
that we live in.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.550
You know, I find it,
especially in the winter,

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:13.510
it's really hard to find
fabulous vegetables here,

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.570
because it is what it is.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:18.270
In the summertime, I
find it a lot easier.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.676
I mean, I probably
shop where you shop.

00:39:20.676 --> 00:39:22.620
Where do you shop?

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:34.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.876
BOBBY FLAY: How
about Whole Foods?

00:39:35.876 --> 00:39:36.828
AUDIENCE: Whole
Foods [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:36.828 --> 00:39:37.453
BOBBY FLAY: OK.

00:39:37.453 --> 00:39:38.677
Then go to Whole Foods.

00:39:38.677 --> 00:39:39.997
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:39.997 --> 00:39:40.830
That's where I shop.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.954
AUDIENCE: There's a farmers'
market on 97th Street.

00:39:42.954 --> 00:39:44.264
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:44.264 --> 00:39:45.680
BOBBY FLAY: The
farmers' markets--

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.240
the farmers' markets in
the city are wonderful.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.910
Again, in the summer,
they're amazing.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.270
In the winter, it
gets a little--

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:54.470
there's lots of potatoes.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.320
You know?

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.550
So I mean-- but I think that
Whole Foods does a good job.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:00.470
I really do.

00:40:02.844 --> 00:40:04.260
AUDIENCE: What are
you going to do

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.593
with the rest of that guacamole?

00:40:05.593 --> 00:40:10.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.231
BOBBY FLAY: Good question.

00:40:12.231 --> 00:40:13.647
Well, you need
chips or something.

00:40:13.647 --> 00:40:15.182
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:15.182 --> 00:40:16.390
AUDIENCE: I'll figure it out.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.181
BOBBY FLAY: Do we have
chips in this place?

00:40:18.181 --> 00:40:19.120
OK.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.700
Anybody else?

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.199
Hi.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.459
AUDIENCE: What's
next food trend?

00:40:24.459 --> 00:40:25.750
There was kind of Greek yogurt.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.877
What's the next thing that's
going to hit the market that

00:40:27.877 --> 00:40:28.696
will change a food category?

00:40:28.696 --> 00:40:29.678
BOBBY FLAY: Oh, god.

00:40:33.115 --> 00:40:34.180
Any guesses?

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:34.990
I don't know.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:36.640
I'm the worst at this.

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.470
If I tell you what the
next food trend is,

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:40.300
you know it's not
going to be that.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.050
What do you think?

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:41.758
What's happening?

00:40:41.758 --> 00:40:42.553
I mean--

00:40:43.052 --> 00:40:45.940
JENNIFER: I think [INAUDIBLE]
ancient grain [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:46.970
BOBBY FLAY: Yeah.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:49.325
Beans are going to
take over grains?

00:40:49.325 --> 00:40:52.000
JENNIFER: Beans [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.110
BOBBY FLAY: Jennifer is my
public relations person.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.390
So she knows more than
I do about trends.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:03.460
But I think that
we're going to go--

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.250
I think, in the
big picture, there

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:09.430
we're going to continue to eat
more and more vegetables, more

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.970
fish.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:15.810
And meat is going to take a
side dish position in the world.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:18.990
That's just what
seems to be happening.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.210
And I think this is just
going to continue to be

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:24.060
more of a trend in that way.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.560
I mean, I feel like
we've exhausted

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.960
every food trend in every
country in the world so far.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.730
It's amazing.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:35.400
I love Middle Eastern
food, because it's

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.740
so beautiful and so
healthful and so flavorful.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.310
I mean, I think those
are the key things now.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.244
You want things that
are good for you,

00:41:42.244 --> 00:41:44.160
that have a lot of flavor,
and that are really

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.410
pretty to look at.

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:47.900
And I think that a
cuisine like that--

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.170
Israeli cuisine is amazing.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.490
It's like that as well.

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:54.210
I mean, when I order at home,
I order from Taim a lot.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:56.526
You know that place?

00:41:56.526 --> 00:41:59.750
Oh, it's the best
falafel in New York.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:00.910
But it goes beyond that.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.970
I mean, it's, like,
Israeli cuisine,

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:07.530
and it's so good, so healthful.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:09.600
Pomegranates are everywhere.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.810
Anybody else?

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:11.970
I know that wasn't helpful.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.174
But I don't know.

00:42:14.174 --> 00:42:15.590
AUDIENCE: On the
food trend topic,

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.240
is there a current food trend
that you're just so sick of?

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.830
Maybe it's, like,
a certain dish--

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:22.920
BOBBY FLAY: Poke bowls--

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.230
I feel like Poke bowls--

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:30.660
here's the thing
about a Poke bowl.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.860
What has to be great
about a Poke bowl--

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.570
the fish.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:39.391
So I know that there's all these
fast, casual environments doing

00:42:39.391 --> 00:42:39.890
it.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.390
I get a little
concerned about that.

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.719
I don't want
inexpensive Poke bowl.

00:42:44.719 --> 00:42:45.760
You know what I'm saying?

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.790
That's just my thing.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:51.740
And they just came on so
strong, out of nowhere.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.364
It's crazy.

00:42:52.364 --> 00:42:54.030
I mean, I know you
know that, obviously,

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:59.110
in Hawaii, that's where
the trend sends from.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:00.580
That was my answer.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.677
I don't know.

00:43:01.677 --> 00:43:02.760
I'm not going to say kale.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.340
I want kale to
stay here forever.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:06.280
It's so good.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.150
I mean, when I want
to go to a restaurant

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:13.690
and order a kale salad,
I feel like I should not

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:17.050
be ordering a kale salad, but
I really want it, you know?

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:18.940
It's so good.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.090
I love that black kale.

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.650
It's so good.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:23.330
Anybody else?

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:25.205
AUDIENCE: What is the
last thing you googled?

00:43:28.435 --> 00:43:35.334
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:35.334 --> 00:43:37.250
BOBBY FLAY: What was the
last thing I googled?

00:43:40.148 --> 00:43:48.664
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:48.664 --> 00:43:49.330
I have to think.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.906
I can't remember the last
time I googled something.

00:43:51.906 --> 00:43:53.232
JENNIFER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:53.232 --> 00:43:54.190
BOBBY FLAY: No, I know.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.760
I use it all the time,
as everybody else does.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.240
You just put me on the spot.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.640
I can't remember.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.457
I'll think about.

00:44:04.457 --> 00:44:05.290
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:06.605
I'll follow up with it.

00:44:06.605 --> 00:44:07.230
BOBBY FLAY: Oh.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:08.146
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:08.146 --> 00:44:09.880
JENNIFER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.050
BOBBY FLAY: No, I--

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.790
Elise sent me the address.

00:44:17.304 --> 00:44:19.470
AUDIENCE: You were just
speaking about pomegranates.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:24.300
Do you have a trick or a really
great way of cutting one open?

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:24.991
BOBBY FLAY: Yes.

00:44:24.991 --> 00:44:25.990
Did I forget to do that?

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.896
Is that what you're telling me?

00:44:26.896 --> 00:44:27.396
OK.

00:44:27.396 --> 00:44:29.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.112
So I cut it open like that.

00:44:32.112 --> 00:44:33.570
But the way you
get the seeds out--

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:34.956
I think that's what
you're asking, right?

00:44:34.956 --> 00:44:35.539
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:38.150
BOBBY FLAY: OK.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:42.480
An easier way to get the seeds
out is you take a wooden spoon,

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.985
and you put a little bit of
pressure on the pomegranate,

00:44:45.985 --> 00:44:47.307
and you just whack them out.

00:44:47.307 --> 00:44:51.634
[BANGING NOISES]

00:44:51.634 --> 00:44:53.550
This way, you don't have
to pick through them.

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:55.966
When we were kids, we used to
eat these in grammar school.

00:44:55.966 --> 00:44:56.780
I don't know why.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.700
But we called them
Chinese apples.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.160
That's what we knew them as.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.330
There you go.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:05.740
And some of them go in the bowl.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:06.672
Some of them don't.

00:45:06.672 --> 00:45:07.832
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:07.832 --> 00:45:08.540
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.170
BOBBY FLAY: Oh,
you're very welcome.

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:11.836
I'm sure you didn't
know how to do that.

00:45:11.836 --> 00:45:19.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:21.130
AUDIENCE: I have a
question for you.

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:23.411
So growing up, I've watched
a lot of your shows,

00:45:23.411 --> 00:45:24.660
a lot of your different shows.

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.180
And even getting older, like,
continue watching your shows.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.220
And being in this
environment, I've

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.740
had a chance to meet
a few famous chefs,

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.150
including yourself now.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.990
And so I wanted to know are
there any chefs that you grew

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:40.470
up watching that inspired
you to continue to cook

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:42.030
and to try to be better?

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:45.770
I know you said, since
high school, yes.

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:49.800
BOBBY FLAY: Well, you have to
understand that Food Network TV

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.820
and I were born together.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.240
So there was no Food Network
before I was cooking.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.890
I was already cooking
professionally,

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:58.470
and then Food Network
showed up one day.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.010
And I've been
there for 22 years.

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:05.950
So you know, Julia Child,
the Galloping Gourmet--

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:06.950
do you know who that is?

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:07.783
AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:46:10.907 --> 00:46:12.490
BOBBY FLAY: His thing
was really cool.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.490
He would make this gourmet
meal, and it was always

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.320
sort of French inspired.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.480
And he always had, like,
this cool jacket on.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.930
And then he'd go up, he'd plate
the meal, pour a glass of wine.

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:24.930
And he'd have a
little table for two.

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.000
And he'd go out to the audience
and pick whatever cute girl

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.040
he wanted to pick, and
take her by the hand,

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.050
and finish having
dinner with her.

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:34.383
I mean, it was really kind
of sweet, actually, you know?

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:37.570
That was the show.

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:39.445
It was Julia Child and
the Galloping Gourmet.

00:46:39.445 --> 00:46:41.442
That was really it.

00:46:41.442 --> 00:46:45.100
You know, Emeril
really led the charge.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:49.540
He was on every minute of the
Food Network for so many years.

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:52.270
And I knew Emeril before
he was Emeril, you know?

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:56.940
I mean, we basically grew up
together in this business.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.690
But yeah, I think the
first celebrity chef

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.680
that I really knew
was Wolfgang Puck.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.400
I mean, he, in my
opinion, changed

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.350
the way we think about
food in America now.

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:12.930
Really, he took food
that was whimsical

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:14.820
and made it incredible.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.810
And made it fun for people
to go to a restaurant

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:19.770
to eat great food.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:23.910
So you didn't have to go
to some stodgy old place

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:25.230
to eat good food.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.830
He was the first person to take
pizzas and put smoked salmon

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:30.540
and duck sausage on them.

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.540
And people were, like,
wow, you can do that?

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.332
And he's, like, yeah,
you can do that.

00:47:34.332 --> 00:47:35.790
And I always find
it amazing to me,

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:39.870
because it took an Austrian
guy to show America

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:42.660
how to cook good food.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.455
But it's the truth.

00:47:44.455 --> 00:47:48.640
I mean, Wolfgang is amazing,
and continues to be.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.084
I mean, some people say
he's got restaurants

00:47:51.084 --> 00:47:52.000
in airports and stuff.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:52.620
Like that.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:53.120
Yeah, but so what?

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.744
I mean, when you go
to his restaurants,

00:47:54.744 --> 00:47:57.460
like in LA, he's
there all the time.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.180
I don't know how.

00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.866
There must be ten of him.

00:47:59.866 --> 00:48:01.740
He's always walking
around in his chef white.

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:04.130
He's got his towel
over his shoulder.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.990
He comes up to you.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:06.726
He sounds like Arnold
Schwarzenegger.

00:48:06.726 --> 00:48:07.425
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:07.425 --> 00:48:08.590
What's up?

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.960
And he cares so much
about what he does.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:15.060
He's a true leader
of our industry.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.367
Yeah?

00:48:17.367 --> 00:48:19.200
AUDIENCE: You said that
you and Food Network

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.000
were born together.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.350
How did Food Network find you?

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:22.349
How did you get started?

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:27.710
BOBBY FLAY: Look, you know,
Food Network was a startup cable

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:31.620
network, and you know,
they had no money.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.660
So the chefs that
were actually being

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.550
asked to fill the
time, so to speak,

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.050
if you couldn't get
there by subway,

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:42.030
you weren't coming
on the network.

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:44.760
I mean, they weren't flying
people in from California

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.870
or anything to do that.

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:47.370
They had no money.

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.370
So you know, it was
a 24-hour network.

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:52.170
They had a lot of time to fill.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:49:00.570
And so I just started guesting
on different shows as a guest.

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:03.730
And then I said,
you know, I think

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:04.980
I should do a grilling show.

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.521
Like, you don't do
anything grilling.

00:49:06.521 --> 00:49:08.050
They're, like, what do you mean?

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.479
Well, here's a list of
recipes I think we could do.

00:49:10.479 --> 00:49:11.520
Like, do you have a name?

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.436
Like, yeah, how about
"Grillin' and Chillin'"?

00:49:13.436 --> 00:49:14.177
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:14.177 --> 00:49:15.570
And they're, like, all right.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:17.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:18.510
I'm not kidding you.

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:21.030
That was the extent
of the meeting.

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:23.020
And then we shot 42 episodes.

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.840
That was me and this
guy from Philadelphia.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.006
He was like the country guy.

00:49:26.006 --> 00:49:27.300
I was the city guy.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.820
We beat each other up
verbally, kind of fun,

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.610
like banter and stuff like that.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:33.190
You know?

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:37.932
Anyway, like, he would
say to me, I don't--

00:49:37.932 --> 00:49:39.640
like, I'd be making
a sauce in a blender.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.050
He's, like, I don't use fancy
equipment like a blender.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:44.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:45.790
OK, you know.

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:51.020
Anyway, so we shot 42
episodes in six days--

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:54.030
seven a day, live to tape.

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:58.230
And that's why, when I
shoot a cooking show now,

00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:59.790
I can shoot-- if I
really wanted to,

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:01.350
I could shoot five in a day.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.140
Because I basically
shoot live to tape.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.740
There was no editing
in those days.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.450
You had to hit the marks
to go to commercial.

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.740
So they didn't have the
money to edit, literally.

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:11.870
There was no editing.

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:14.370
I remember when they're, like,
we're going to start editing.

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:15.155
I'm, like, what?

00:50:15.155 --> 00:50:17.739
And it was years later.

00:50:17.739 --> 00:50:19.030
It was five or six years later.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:22.420
I did television live
to tape, basically,

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.680
for the first six or seven
years of my career there.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.690
So when I do it, when
I do a cooking show now

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.680
that has editing, like
I'm doing this new show

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.710
with Damaris Phillips,
called "Bobby and Damaris,"

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:35.250
very original name.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.750
And it took us a long time
to figure out that name.

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:41.190
And she was, like, this
is the fastest I've ever

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:43.392
done a cooking show by tenfold.

00:50:43.392 --> 00:50:45.850
And I was, like, well, how long
does it take you do a show?

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:49.140
She was, we do, like,
a half a show a day.

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.420
And I just don't see
any reason for it.

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.110
Because they're trying
to be so perfect.

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:56.610
So when you pick
up the pomegranate,

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:58.634
and they're, like, can
you pick it up again?

00:50:58.634 --> 00:51:00.050
No seriously,
that's what happens.

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.530
And I go, OK.

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:02.410
What did I do wrong?

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:04.285
Well, I just didn't like
where your hand was.

00:51:04.285 --> 00:51:05.336
Who cares?

00:51:05.336 --> 00:51:05.960
You're cooking.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:10.220
And I think part of it is, when
you overshoot a cooking show,

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.760
you lose the guts of it.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.730
Because if I make a mistake, it
makes the viewer feel better.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:18.500
Who cares?

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.970
If I burn something
a little bit,

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:21.750
or if I spill
something-- oh, good.

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:24.860
If you spill
something, stop down.

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:26.880
You've got to clear
the whole thing off.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.460
Bring in the more prep, right?

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.240
It's insane.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.070
It's totally nuts.

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:31.130
I don't shoot that way.

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.952
So I can shoot three
shows, four shows.

00:51:33.952 --> 00:51:35.660
We can start at 8
o'clock in the morning.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:39.190
At 3 o'clock in the
afternoon, I'm having a beer.

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:40.240
And then it feels real.

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.165
You want to have your
own cooking show?

00:51:45.165 --> 00:51:46.742
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:46.742 --> 00:51:48.658
BOBBY FLAY: Yeah, but
what would the theme be?

00:51:48.658 --> 00:51:50.217
AUDIENCE: Uh, well--

00:51:50.217 --> 00:51:51.050
BOBBY FLAY: Come on.

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:51.530
Pitch me.

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:52.405
This is it right now.

00:51:52.405 --> 00:51:54.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:56.400
AUDIENCE: Like, meat
eaters going vegetarian,

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:56.900
like something--

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.200
BOBBY FLAY: Well you just--

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:57.699
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:57.699 --> 00:52:02.300
AUDIENCE: --my perspective--
you can have it if you want.

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.680
I don't think I have the
caliber to execute right now.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.390
Nick.

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:06.110
BOBBY FLAY: What's
your last name?

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:06.890
AUDIENCE: Gomez.

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:07.640
BOBBY FLAY: Gomez.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.200
So Nick Gomez, the show is--

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.910
OK, so vegetarians.

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:12.337
Vegetarians who
were meat eaters?

00:52:12.337 --> 00:52:12.920
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.640
BOBBY FLAY: OK.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.979
AUDIENCE: I always eat meat, and
it's the basis of everything.

00:52:16.979 --> 00:52:18.770
As a kid, I would push
away the vegetables,

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:21.170
and I would grab
for the chicken.

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:23.360
And now the trend is
vegetables and eating healthy.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.400
And the meat is
hard to set aside,

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.020
but trying to make vegetables
that I actually want to eat.

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:29.250
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:31.760
BOBBY FLAY: So the show would
basically be you'd have, like,

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:35.360
a big juicy steak over here, and
you'd be, like, all right, just

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:35.930
stay there.

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:37.402
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:37.402 --> 00:52:39.610
And then you'd come over
here and saute some zucchini

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:42.839
and convince people that's
what they really want to eat?

00:52:42.839 --> 00:52:44.630
AUDIENCE: Like, make
vegetables good enough

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.040
to eat for someone
who didn't want

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.150
to eat them in the first place?

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:48.116
BOBBY FLAY: That's a good thing.

00:52:48.116 --> 00:52:48.785
Absolutely.

00:52:48.785 --> 00:52:49.868
Should we give him a show?

00:52:49.868 --> 00:52:51.326
AUDIENCE: (SPEAKING
TOGETHER) Yeah!

00:52:51.326 --> 00:52:52.680
BOBBY FLAY: All right.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.670
8 o'clock tomorrow.

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:54.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:55.956
BOBBY FLAY: Cool.

00:52:55.956 --> 00:52:58.080
SPEAKER 3: Everybody, help
me thank him for coming.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.830
[APPLAUSE]
