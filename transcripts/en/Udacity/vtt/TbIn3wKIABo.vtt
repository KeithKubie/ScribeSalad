Great. 
So, let's apply

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.080
what we learned about fragments 
and resource folder qualifiers

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.786
to update our Sunshine app.

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:08.942
Figure out which layout folders should
contain an activity-main layout file,

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.620
so that we can accomplish
a one pane UI on phones,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.756
and a two-pane UI on tablet's.

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:16.452
