[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.400
All right.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.460
Now, the term
psychedelic is usually

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.300
associated with
mind-expanding chemicals,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.670
consciousness-expanding
drugs that grow on the earth.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.530
But the root of the
word psychedelic

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.190
actually means to make
manifest the mind.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.860
Now, you can see why psychedelic
substances bring our visions

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.360
into being.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.640
We call it active
hallucinations.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.870
But is this not, in many
ways, the same thing

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.170
as our imagination?

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.460
And is technology not, in
many ways, a manifestation

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.076
of the human mind,
embodied imagination,

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:47.302
the actualization, the
rendering of our hallucinations

00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:48.690
into existence?

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.350
You know, the creature
that ate the mushrooms

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.410
and then started
doing art on the caves

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.945
is the same species that
hallucinated starships

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:57.456
into existence.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:00.220
Technology is
literally psychedelic.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.730
It literally is
outsourced cognition

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.520
and how we extend the
boundaries of the human mind.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.970
The goals of mind expansion,
the counterculture 1960s

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.060
ethos of expand your horizons,
transcend your reality,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.880
make that cognitive
leap is no different

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.170
than the manifestation of
our information technology.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.606
Google is the first
psychedelically informed

00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:23.558
super power.

00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:25.938
Its visions of
inter-connectivity,

00:01:25.938 --> 00:01:28.010
inter-conductivity
and repository

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.890
of all of human knowledge
becomes almost like Gaea,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.280
like a collective consciousness.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.390
So again, the whole notion
is that we should really

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.740
come to understand that the
whole psychedelic revolution

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.214
from the '60s ended up being
literalized by the information

00:01:42.214 --> 00:01:43.630
technologies that
have transformed

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.270
our world over
the last 30 years.
