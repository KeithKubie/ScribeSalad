00:00:00.426 --> 00:00:02.315
- [Instructor] The table
represents the cost

00:00:02.315 --> 00:00:04.069
of buying a small piece of land

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.661
in a remote village since the year 1990.

00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:10.695
Which kind of function best
models this relationship?

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:11.628
And I'm using,

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:13.997
this is an example from
the Khan Academy exercises,

00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:16.342
and we're really trying to pick between

00:00:16.342 --> 00:00:18.159
whether a linear model

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.547
or a linear function
models this relationship

00:00:20.547 --> 00:00:21.964
or an exponential

00:00:23.128 --> 00:00:25.718
model or exponential function

00:00:25.718 --> 00:00:27.737
will model this relationship.

00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:29.195
So like always, pause this video,

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.301
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:34.434
All right, so now let's
think about this together.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.129
So as the time goes by around this,

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.554
the time variable right over here,

00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:41.498
we see that we keep
incrementing it by two.

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:44.248
Go from zero to two, two to four,

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:47.141
four to six, so on and so forth.

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:49.159
It keeps going up by two.

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.886
So if this is a linear relationship,

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:54.930
given that our change in time is constant,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.695
our change in cost should
increase by a constant amount.

00:00:58.695 --> 00:00:59.851
Doesn't have to be this constant,

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:01.807
but it has to be a constant amount.

00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:04.299
If we were dealing with an
exponential relationship,

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.523
we would multiply by the same amount

00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:10.417
for a constant change in time.

00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:11.645
Let's see what's going on here.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:12.648
Let's just first look at

00:01:12.648 --> 00:01:13.915
the difference between these numbers.

00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:15.748
To go from 30 to 36.9,

00:01:16.738 --> 00:01:18.905
you would have to add 6.9.

00:01:19.927 --> 00:01:22.260
And to go from 36.9 to 44.1,

00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:25.184
what do you have to add?

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:26.851
You have to add 7.2.

00:01:28.436 --> 00:01:30.924
And now to go from 44.1

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:31.757
to 51.1,

00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.454
you would have to add seven.

00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.917
Now to go to 51.1

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:39.750
to 57.9,

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:43.808
you are adding 6.8,

00:01:45.824 --> 00:01:47.404
6.8.

00:01:47.404 --> 00:01:50.904
And then finally, going from 57.9 to 65.1,

00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:54.461
let's see, this is almost eight,

00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:56.294
7.1, this is what, 7.2

00:01:57.237 --> 00:01:59.930
we're adding, plus 7.2.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.870
So you might say, "Hey, wait,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.624
"we're not adding the exact
same amount every time."

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:05.629
But remember, this is intended to be data

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:10.071
that you might actually get
from a real-world situation.

00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:11.945
And the data that you get
from a real-world situation

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:14.805
will never be exactly a linear model

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.034
or exactly an exponential model.

00:02:17.034 --> 00:02:19.112
But every time we add two years,

00:02:19.112 --> 00:02:21.220
it does look like we're
getting pretty close

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.169
to adding 7,000 dollars in cost.

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.606
6.9 is pretty close to seven.

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:27.869
That's pretty close to seven.

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:28.964
That is seven.

00:02:28.964 --> 00:02:30.522
This is pretty close to seven.

00:02:30.522 --> 00:02:32.261
That's pretty close to seven.

00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:35.706
So this is looking like
a linear model to me.

00:02:35.706 --> 00:02:38.351
You could test whether
it's an exponential model.

00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:42.441
You see, well, what factor
am I multiplying each time?

00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:45.448
But that doesn't seem to be as,

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:47.913
this doesn't seem to be
growing exponentially.

00:02:47.913 --> 00:02:49.404
It doesn't seem like we're multiplying

00:02:49.404 --> 00:02:51.247
by the same factor every time.

00:02:51.247 --> 00:02:54.685
It seems like we're multiplying
by a slightly lower factor,

00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:56.634
as we get to higher cost.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:03:00.351
So the linear model seems
to be a pretty good thing.

00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:02.575
If I see every time I
increase by two years,

00:03:02.575 --> 00:03:05.882
I'm increasing cost by
6.9 or 7.2 or seven.

00:03:05.882 --> 00:03:07.335
It's pretty close to seven.

00:03:07.335 --> 00:03:09.663
So it's not exactly the cost,

00:03:09.663 --> 00:03:12.009
but the model predicts it pretty well.

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:15.203
If you were to plot these on a,

00:03:15.203 --> 00:03:16.674
on a coordinate plane

00:03:16.674 --> 00:03:19.226
and try to connect the dots,

00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:20.940
it would look pretty close to a line,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.350
or you could draw a line
that gets pretty close

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.517
to those dots.
