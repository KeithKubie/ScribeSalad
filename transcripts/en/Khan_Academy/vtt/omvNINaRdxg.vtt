00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.229
Let's say I'm walking
along some trail

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:04.270
and there are some trees
on the side of the road.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.760
And let's just say
these are some plants.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.622
And these are the
barks of the trees--

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:10.830
maybe I should do it in
brown-- but you get the idea.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.980
These are some plants that are
along the side of the road,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.905
or at least the stem of the
plant or the bark of the tree.

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:18.780
And in the background,
I have some mountains.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.900
Maybe those mountains
are several miles away.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.770
We know just from
experience that if I'm

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.270
walking-- let me draw
myself over here--

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.800
we know that if I'm
walking this way,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.790
the trees look like
they're going past me much

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.780
faster than the mountains.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.500
Like I'll just be going
past one tree after another.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.880
And they'll just whizz past
me-- maybe if I'm running.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.410
But the mountains don't seem
to be moving that quickly.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.670
And this idea, that as
you change your position

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.280
the things that
are closer to you

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.370
seem to move more than the
things that are further

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.810
from you, this property
is called parallax.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.560
And what we're going
to do in this video--

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.290
and maybe it's
especially obvious

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.623
if you're driving in a car,
then the things close to you

00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:11.026
are whizzing by you, maybe
the curve of the street

00:01:11.026 --> 00:01:13.150
or whatever, while the
things that are further away

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.544
don't seem to be
whizzing by you as fast.

00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:16.960
What I want to do
in this video is

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.130
think about how we
can use parallax

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.221
to figure out how far
certain stars are.

00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:23.220
And what I want to emphasize
is that this method

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.870
is only good for
relatively close stars.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.020
We don't have
instruments sensitive

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.320
enough yet to use parallax to
measure stars that are really,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.790
really, really far away.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.290
But to think about
how this is done,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.460
how we use stellar parallax--
just let me write "stellar"

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.560
up here-- how we use stellar
parallax, the parallax

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.250
of stars, to figure out
how far away they are,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.820
let's think a little bit
about our solar system.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.460
So here is our sun
in the solar system.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.530
And here is Earth at
one point in the year.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.220
And what I want to
do is-- and let's

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.540
just say this is the North
Pole, kind of popping out

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.440
of the screen here.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.910
And so the Earth is
rotating in that direction.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.160
And I also want to think
about a star that is obviously

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.680
outside of our solar system.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.190
And I'm really underestimating
the distance to this star.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.970
As we'll see, or as
you might already know,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.460
the distance to the nearest
star from our solar system

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.127
is 250,000 times the distance
between the Earth and the sun.

00:02:25.127 --> 00:02:26.960
So if I wanted to draw
this to scale-- well,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.980
first of all, the Earth would
be this unnoticeable dot here--

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.210
but you would also, whatever
distance this is, you

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.580
would have to multiply
that by 250,000

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.280
to get the distance
to this nearest star.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.010
Anyway, with that
said, let's think

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.740
about what that star would
look like from the surface

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.600
of the Earth.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.767
So let me pick a
point on the surface.

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:48.600
Maybe if we're thinking
about North America,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.160
we're right there in
the northern hemisphere.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.880
So let's take that
little patch of land

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.770
and think about how the position
of that star would look.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.310
So that's the patch of land.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.250
Maybe this is my
house right over here,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.440
jutting out the
side of the Earth.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.650
Maybe this is me standing.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.720
I'm drawing everything
sideways because I'm

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.260
trying to hold this perspective.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.400
So this is me looking up.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.920
And let's say at
this point in time,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.960
the way I've drawn
this patch, the sun

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.860
will just be coming
over the horizon.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.740
So the sun is
essentially at sunrise.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.870
So let me do my best at drawing
the sun from my point of view.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.230
Remember, the Earth is
rotating in this way-- the way

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.720
I've drawn it, it's
rotating counterclockwise.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.620
But from the
surface of the Earth

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.750
it would look like the
sun is coming up here.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.090
It's rising in the east.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.380
But right at that
dawn, on this day when

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.630
the Earth is right over here,
what would that star look like?

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.190
So if you look at this
version of the Earth,

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.500
the star is kind of skewed
a little bit-- not straight

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.200
up, straight up would
be this direction,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.440
from the point of view
of my house-- it is now

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.041
skewed a little bit
closer to the sun.

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.790
So if you go in this
is zoomed-in version,

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.140
straight up would look
something like that.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.710
And maybe based
on my measurement,

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:15.330
it would look like the
star is right over there.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.640
So it's a little bit
skewed towards where

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.690
the sun is rising, towards the
east relative to straight up.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.670
Now let's fast-forward
six months so

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.250
that the Earth is on the other
side of its orbit from the sun.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.290
So let's fast-forward
six months.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.510
We're over here.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.040
And let's wait for a time of
day where we are-- essentially

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.160
that little patch of
the Earth is pointed

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.150
in the same direction, at
least in our galaxy, maybe.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.490
And if you think about it, if we
go back to this patch of Earth,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.540
now the Earth is still
rotating in that direction.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.150
But now the sun is on the west.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.660
The sun is going to
be right over here.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.000
Maybe I'll do it like this
just to make it clear.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.471
I'll draw this side of the
sun with this greenish color.

00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:05.720
Obviously the sun is not
green, but it will make clear

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.580
that now we're about the sun
is going to be over here.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.440
The patch is going to be
turning away from the sun.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.330
So it'll look to that
observer on Earth

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.460
like the sun is setting.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.380
So it'll look like the sun is
going down over the horizon.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.980
But the important
thing is, once we're

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.820
at this point in the year,
what will that star look like?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.840
Well, if we have
this large diagram,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.670
we see that the star,
relative to straight up,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.160
it is now a little bit to the
west now, a little bit more

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.840
on the side of that setting sun.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.290
So the star would now look
like it is right there.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.620
And if we have good
enough instruments,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.050
we can measure the angle
between where that star was

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.770
six months ago and
where it is now.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.260
And let's call that
angle 2 times theta.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.760
And the reason why
I call it 2 times

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:10.100
theta-- we could call theta
the angle between the star

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.570
and being straight up.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.030
So this would be theta,
and that would be theta.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.850
And I care about that
because if I know theta,

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.930
and if I know the distance
from the Earth to the sun,

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.210
I can then use a little
bit of trigonometry

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.630
to figure out the
distance to that star.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.400
Because if you think about
it, this theta right over here

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.990
is the same as this angle.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.610
So if this is straight up.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.940
That is looking straight
up into the night sky.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.030
This would be the angle theta.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.460
If you know that angle from
basic trigonometry, or actually

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.620
even basic geometry,
if you say this

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:49.840
is a right angle over here,
this would be 90 minus theta.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.900
And then you could use
some basic trigonometry.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.940
If you know this
distance right here,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.770
and you're trying to figure
out this distance, the distance

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.570
to that nearest star,
we could say, look,

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.180
we need a trigonometric
function that

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.430
deals with the opposite
angle of what we know.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.910
We know this thing
right over here.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.160
And the adjacent
angle-- we already

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.750
know this thing right over here.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.160
So let me call this
the Earth-sun distance,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.350
or let me just call this d.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.240
And we want to figure out x.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.502
So some basic
trigonometry-- and you

00:07:26.502 --> 00:07:27.960
might want to do
this if you forget

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.112
the basic trigonometric
functions-- SOHCAHTOA.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.650
Sine is opposite/hypotenuse.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.970
Cosine is adjacent/hypotenuse.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.530
Tangent is opposite/adjacent.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.890
So the tangent function
deals with the two sides

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.630
of this right triangle
that we can now deal with.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:54.890
So we could say that the tangent
of 90 minus theta, this angle

00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:07.060
right over here--
let me write it--

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.550
is equal to the
opposite side-- is

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:15.420
equal to x over the
adjacent side, over d.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.680
Or another way, if you assume
that we know the distance

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.660
to the sun, you multiply both
sides times that distance.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:28.610
You get d times the tangent of
90 minus theta is equal to x.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.200
And you can figure out the
distance from our solar system

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.230
to that star.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.909
Now I want to make it
very, very, very clear--

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.549
these are huge distances.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:42.020
I did not draw this to scale.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.390
The distance to the
nearest star is actually

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.860
250,000 times the
distance to our sun.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.541
So this angle is going to be
super, super, super, super

00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:52.040
small.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.206
So you would need to have
very good instruments even

00:08:54.206 --> 00:08:57.070
to measure-- even to
observe-- the stellar parallax

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.860
to the nearest stars.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.880
And we're constantly
having better instruments--

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.680
and actually the
Europeans right now

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.730
are in the process of a mission
called Gaia to measure these

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.160
to enough accuracy that we can
start to measure the accurate

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.071
distance to stars several tens
of thousands of light years

00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:15.570
away.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.540
So that'll start to give
us a very accurate map

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.080
of a significant chunk
of our galaxy, which

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.470
is about 100,000 light
years in diameter.
