- Two fucking stories

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.641
I broke through trees,

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:11.745
I've got no fuckin' pants on,
there's blood everywhere,

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:16.016
and I'm in a sewage
slime shit soaked--

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.752
'cause I don't want
to touch germs.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.653

- This man needs
no introduction,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.063
he is a judge on
"America's Got Talent,"

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.231
Howie Mandel!

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.534
[cheers and applause]

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:55.415

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:57.851
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:01.321
This is, uh--this is--
oh, shit.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.090
This is a pole. This is--

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:08.261
Fuck.
You have no idea, this is--

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.863
I didn't know. I--okay.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.599
I'm gonna--we're supposed
to tell a story.

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:15.835
Th--this is not happening.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:18.638
And the truth is,
this is a show I've watched.

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:21.441
I've watched--
I watch this show,

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.476
and I love it, and I say,
"I got stories!

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.044
"I could be on--"
And I watched it

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:27.213
on Comedy Central,
and I said, "Look at this,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.684
"kind of a cool set,
and it's just a cool vibe.

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:35.488
I'll do it! I'll do it!"

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.490
And I just showed f--

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.859
This is not a set!

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.895
[laughter]

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:45.231
This is--I'm just--
You know because you're--

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.367
They don't know!

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:49.202
Fuck it,
this is not happening.

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:50.503
I'm a germophobe!

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.640
I'm a fucking--
This is a real--

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.243
This is a fucking strip club,
and this...

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.312
[laughter]

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:03.416
This is real, and I--
maybe you're noticing this, I--

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:04.817
People who know--
I've been in the business

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:07.320
for, like, years, 40 years--

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:10.857
I just got glasses this year.
I just got glasses,

00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:14.527
because my wife said,
"You missed the sign." And I--

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:19.098
I saw the sign, it's the words
on the sign that I didn't--

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.767
So she said,
"Go to an optometrist."

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.769
I said, "I don't have
an optometrist!

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:24.671
I don't have--
I've never been!"

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.706
I never went.
I don't shake hands.

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:28.408
I don't want to be touched.

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:29.842
I'm traum--
I went to the--

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.011
And he said,
"You're fucking blind.

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:33.513
You're blind."

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:35.014
I didn't know that. I was--

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:36.716
I've been a judge
for eight years

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:39.519
on a talent show,
I can't see a fucking thing.

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:43.089
[laughter]

00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:45.225
This is the first year
I've ever worn--

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:49.229
And you don't understand,
I'm so fucking freaked out,

00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:53.366
and now I can see clear--
I can see the shit on the pole.

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:56.236
[laughter]

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:59.038
They brought me to this room
before you got here,

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:02.041
and they said,
"The best light is right here."

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:05.445
I don't want to be right here.
I want to be in the dark.

00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:07.113
I want to be way in the dark.

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:10.149
I don't want to be anywhere
near the fucking pole.

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:11.584
What--

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:14.153
What kind of stains--
what is this?

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.623
What is--
Why not at the end of the night

00:04:16.722 --> 00:04:18.224
just shooting this here now,

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:21.094
why wouldn't you just
sponge that off?

00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:23.463
Why is that there?

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:25.231
I'm not--
It's not fucking funny.

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:26.399
You're laughing!

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:28.735
This is not my story.

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.004
This story is not
one I'm telling.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.109
This is a story that is fucking
happening now.

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:40.013
This is a story I'm gonna tell
on another show later.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.315
Why--This is a whole
fuckin' room!

00:04:42.414 --> 00:04:45.251
Why do I have to stand
beside this fuck--

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.419
What are these stains?

00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:48.488
They're not even human shapes.

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:52.659
What was wrapped around--
Oh, my God.

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:55.295
Oh, you have no idea.
I won't wipe my own ass.

00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:57.363
I don't wipe my--
I don't.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.032
You know how I knew I made it?

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:01.334
I bought one of those toilets,
I bought a toilet--

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:04.671
I walk in, the do--
It opens, it's, "Hello, Howie."

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.939
It says hello, and I sit down,

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:09.609
and then it's like
a power wash and a dry.

00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:13.613
I won't touch myself.
I don't want to be near here.

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.783
[laughter]

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.719
I got here an hour ago.
I have to piss.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:23.222
I won't go in the bathroom.

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.058
Are you guys shooting
the whole body?

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:26.959
'Cause if you are, I won't piss.

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:29.896
But if you just shoot me
from the waist up, I'll piss.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:32.565
I will piss
on this fucking show,

00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:35.134
and they'll say,
"This is not happening."

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:37.370
[laughter]

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.038
I'm gonna urinate,

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:40.907
because I'm not going
in that fucking room there.

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:43.743
I don't want to touch anything.
I never have.

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:45.478
I'm not good in normal life.

00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:47.146
I have three children.

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:50.350
I didn't want to touch the
children when we had them.

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.719
No, I didn't. We had--
My first one was a girl.

00:05:52.818 --> 00:05:54.687
She's potty trained.
I say that with pride.

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:57.657
Like she, I didn't even want to
potty train her, because--

00:05:57.756 --> 00:05:59.225
not because I didn't want
to be involved

00:05:59.324 --> 00:06:01.928
in anything that had to do
with the bathroom,

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:04.364
but also because I thought--
I have brothers.

00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:07.400
And I was so afraid of raising
a woman, raising a girl,

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:10.069
and I would be so nervous
each and every night,

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.506
to just worry about, is she
gonna be brought home safely?

00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:17.377
So my brilliant idea was, like,
to not potty train her,

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:20.012
because I know,
just from my own experience,

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.248
when I was dating,
if a woman shit herself,

00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:26.018
I took her right home--
I always did.

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:28.354
I always did.
Always did.

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:31.624
I would crack the window,
and say, "We're going home.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.794
We're going home."

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.530
That's how I am.
That's how I am.

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.533
So--but my wife was really
into potty training

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:42.368
'cause she wants to be
like everyone else.

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:46.706
So--so I took no part in it,
and it was weird,

00:06:46.772 --> 00:06:48.107
because I--because of that,

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:50.109
I didn't have
a lot of interaction

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:53.212
with my own first child, and
I wanted to have interaction.

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:55.081
So my wife says to me--
like, she's saying to me

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.716
like, when she's one
and two years old,

00:06:56.782 --> 00:06:58.384
"You got to take her out.
You got to--

00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:59.952
"You have to interact.

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.954
"You have to create a bond
with your own child,

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:04.123
with your own--"
So I strategically,

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:06.426
because I'm thinking,
like, I don't want to go

00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:08.227
into a public restroom for my--
with myse--

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:10.496
I don't want to put--
I don't want to take her

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.899
into a public--
and as a little baby girl,

00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:14.300
you would have to take her
into the--

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.068
I couldn't walk into
the ladies' room.

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:18.638
I'd have to walk into the--
into the men--

00:07:18.737 --> 00:07:20.406
I don't want
to sit her on that,

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:23.409
and there isn't enough
paper to--

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.411
I would put enough paper
so that when she was sitting,

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.914
she'd be eye to eye with me.
I would want--I would put--

00:07:28.013 --> 00:07:29.348
just to be safe.

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:31.250
So--but I said,
"I don't want to--"

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.119
So this is my strategy.
You want to hear what I did?

00:07:33.218 --> 00:07:37.190
I waited. I waited till she
crapped, till she pissed,

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:40.092
till I visually saw my wife
clean her all up

00:07:40.192 --> 00:07:42.361
and dress her,
and I said to my wife, like,

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:43.930
"You know what?
I'm gonna take her out."

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.765
I just like that--
She had no idea.

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:47.366
"Really? Just like that?"
"Just like that."

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:49.936
She had no idea
I had been watching.

00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:52.371
So I put my daughter
in the car,

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:54.774
and I put her in the--in
the seats, and I strap her in,

00:07:54.873 --> 00:07:56.275
'cause safety first.

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.010
And we're going down
the Ventura Freeway.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.712
I'm driving down
the Ventura Freeway,

00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:02.315
and she says, "Da-da--"
And it's so cute when you--

00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:04.784
And I said, "Yes?"
Jackie is her name.

00:08:04.883 --> 00:08:06.219
And I said, "Yes?"

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:10.523
And she says,
"I have to go potty."

00:08:10.622 --> 00:08:14.627
The fuck? You just--

00:08:14.693 --> 00:08:17.129
You just went.
I didn't say that out loud.

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:19.031
But in my mind, I'm going,
"What the fuck?

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:22.301
"Why would you--
Why wouldn't you--

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:23.469
"You did! I saw!

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:25.071
"And fuck it,
you're wearing a diaper!

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:26.506
"Why are you telling me?

00:08:26.605 --> 00:08:28.708
Just shit yourself,
and I'll act--"

00:08:28.807 --> 00:08:31.177
But you can't make those kind
of plans with children.

00:08:31.276 --> 00:08:33.379
Anyway, so she says, "Daddy,
I want to go to the potty."

00:08:33.478 --> 00:08:35.381
And I know how important
it was to my wife

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.483
to continue the--

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.920
So I said, 'cause I don't want
her to suffer in any way,

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:44.156
I said,
"Fine, I'll take you home."

00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:46.659
So I turned around
on the Ventura Freeway.

00:08:46.725 --> 00:08:48.194
This is a true--I swear to God.

00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:50.830
And I'm driving, down
the Ventura Freeway west,

00:08:50.896 --> 00:08:52.899
and she says, "I'm gonna go--

00:08:52.998 --> 00:08:54.734
I can't hold it, Daddy,
I'm gonna go now."

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:57.036
And I said, "Don't--
No! Don't go n--"

00:08:57.135 --> 00:09:00.406
She go, "I'm gonna go now!"
I said, "Don't! Don't!"

00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:04.110
And then she cried
because I yelled, but...

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:06.412
I pulled over to
the side of the road,

00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:08.214
'cause I don't think
things through--

00:09:08.313 --> 00:09:10.683
just like doing this appearance
on this show.

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:13.052
I had no idea. You could tell.

00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:16.022
Shit just happens.
So--and I unbuckle her,

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:17.723
and I take this beautiful
baby girl,

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.859
my first little baby girl,
and I take her out of the--

00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.294
and on the Ventura Freeway.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.296
For those that don't live
in California,

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:25.531
there's, like--there's a part
where there's, like, hedges.

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:27.767
There's, like--there's like
trees along the side.

00:09:27.866 --> 00:09:30.136
So I go, "This will be nice,
maybe it's a bonding--

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:31.637
it's kind of like
a camping trip."

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:34.206
So I--I--

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:35.608
I figure
we'll go into the bushes.

00:09:35.707 --> 00:09:37.143
We'll go into the bushes.

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:38.544
So I get out,
I'm holding the little baby,

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:41.714
and I step
into the bushes, right?

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.884
'Cause I'm gonna--we got to be
covered, we got to be--

00:09:44.983 --> 00:09:47.887
Okay, so these were not bushes.

00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:49.555
Apparently,

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:53.459
these were the top of trees
from way down below.

00:09:53.558 --> 00:09:54.961
[audience groaning]

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.731
This was a fucking ravine.
I didn't know!

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:01.000
I stepped off the cliff

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:03.402
and then began to tumble.

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:05.171
Yes! Yes!

00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:07.506
I'm holding
a fucking baby girl,

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:09.442
and now I'm on my back...

00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:11.911
[screaming]

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.579
Screaming!
I don't know what to do,

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:15.181
and I'm sliding.

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:17.683
And twigs are breaking,
and shit is happening.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.920
My pants got caught
on something and ripped off!

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:22.588
I have no fucking pants on.

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:26.525
My skin, my flesh is being
removed from my thighs.

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:27.994
Blood is everywhere.

00:10:28.093 --> 00:10:30.930
I'm screaming.
She's screaming.

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:32.498
Trees are breaking.

00:10:32.597 --> 00:10:35.668
Finally, I land at the bottom
in a--

00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:39.672
in a--in a puddle of goo.

00:10:39.771 --> 00:10:41.007
There was a--

00:10:41.106 --> 00:10:43.643
I think it was like
a sewage--

00:10:43.742 --> 00:10:46.278
like a runoff.

00:10:46.378 --> 00:10:48.981
Two fucking stories
from my car,

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:50.683
I broke through trees,

00:10:50.782 --> 00:10:54.286
I've got no fuckin' pants on,
there's blood everywhere,

00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:58.391
and I'm in a sewage
slime shit soaked--

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:01.060
'cause I don't want
to touch germs.

00:11:01.126 --> 00:11:05.131
[laughter]

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:07.366
And she's crying, she's crying.

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:09.869
She goes, "Daddy,
I have to go!"

00:11:09.968 --> 00:11:12.638
So I go, "Okay!"

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:16.075
And my wife--this is the part
why would you put--

00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:19.245
why would any girl ever be
dressed in a onesie?

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:21.647
A fucking onesie! It's not--

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:22.982
It's not convenient.

00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:26.085
So I undo the onesie,

00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:27.653
and I pull it down
by her ankles,

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:32.224
and I'm holding her
in front of me.

00:11:32.324 --> 00:11:34.527
And her legs are straight down,
and she goes,

00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:38.898
"Daddy, I'm gonna make a mess
on my pants."

00:11:38.997 --> 00:11:41.333
This is the part
that's a problem--

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.171
I was not raised around women.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.706
I only had brothers.

00:11:46.805 --> 00:11:48.874
And I was trying to be helpful,
so I said,

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:51.377
"Honey, honey, honey, you won't
get it on your pants.

00:11:51.476 --> 00:11:54.847
Put your feet up on my neck."

00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:59.185
Why do you know?
Why do you know?

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:02.254
I didn't know!
I didn't know!

00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:05.291
Her feet are up on my neck,
and I go, "Go!"

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:10.062
And she starts to go like
a fucking horse into my face!

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:14.266
She's pissing, my eyes
are stinging from urine.

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:17.369
I'm choking on piss.
[imitates choking]

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:19.305
I'm choking,
I've got no pants on,

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:23.275
my legs are bleeding,
I am in this sewage.

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:25.144
It's stinking and rotting,

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.546
and there's dead
fucking rats around.

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:30.216
And she's pissing
all over my face

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:32.418
and her own pants,
and she's crying,

00:12:32.517 --> 00:12:34.220
because there's a mess.

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:37.223
It's not fucking funny.
This is true.

00:12:37.322 --> 00:12:40.893
This happened.
This fucking happened.

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:44.230
And I--I--I--I--

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:45.898
So she said,
"My pants are dir--"

00:12:45.997 --> 00:12:49.668
Your pants are dirty? I don't
have fucking pants on!

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.504
So she makes me take off
her pants, she's naked.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.105
I don't want to touch anything,

00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:54.907
I throw it into
the fucking swamp.

00:12:55.006 --> 00:12:59.578
She's naked, and now I got
to make my way back to the car.

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:03.449
And I start to climb.
I am not--I am not--

00:13:03.548 --> 00:13:06.252
I'm Jewish,
and there aren't a lot

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:07.753
of Jewish mountain climbers.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.156
I don't know if you know
the Biblical story.

00:13:10.255 --> 00:13:11.924
We're not swimmers,
we're not mountain--

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.360
We walked in the desert
for 40 fuckin' years.

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:17.163
We got to a river,
we wouldn't even take a dip.

00:13:17.262 --> 00:13:19.632
We waited for it to part,
a fuckin' miracle,

00:13:19.731 --> 00:13:20.866
so we can walk--

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:23.269
You got to understand.

00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:27.773
That's not my culture.
That's not--

00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:29.675
That's not what we do, okay?

00:13:29.774 --> 00:13:33.479
So I start to climb, and I grab
one twig, and I grab another.

00:13:33.578 --> 00:13:35.681
And my legs are burning
and there's urine,

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.450
and there's blood,
and there's shit in that swamp.

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:39.952
There's a scum on the top!

00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:41.687
I don't even know
what that scum--

00:13:41.786 --> 00:13:44.156
what forms on the top of a
fuckin' puddle in the Valley?

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.491
But anyway, so I'm climbing,

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.359
and then the fuckin' twig
breaks,

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:49.161
and I slide back down,
and we're in the mud again.

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:51.463
Now she's covered in mud
and her own urine

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.300
and some of my blood,
and she's screaming.

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:56.302
And then I go
and I find another path.

00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:58.637
And I get halfway up,
and I slide back down.

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:00.472
- Oh!
- Don't say, "Oh!"

00:14:00.572 --> 00:14:04.310
It doesn't help
if you say, "Oh!"

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:06.812
I'm reliving it. Please!

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:10.516
[laughter]

00:14:10.615 --> 00:14:14.720
Just listen
to the fucking story.

00:14:14.819 --> 00:14:16.989
I hope this--none of this
is really happening,

00:14:17.088 --> 00:14:19.658
and this is a dream, and I wake
up, and this didn't happen.

00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:23.095
But anyway, so and then I find--
and then I climb again.

00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:24.430
I get halfway up,
and I slide down,

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:25.998
and halfway up,
and I slide down,

00:14:26.064 --> 00:14:28.000
and finally after what seems
like an eternity,

00:14:28.099 --> 00:14:31.871
but is probably 45 minutes
since my daughter pissed,

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.506
I make my way to the top,

00:14:34.606 --> 00:14:37.176
and I break out
of these branches,

00:14:37.275 --> 00:14:39.178
and I'm on the Ventura Freeway,

00:14:39.244 --> 00:14:40.846
which is probably
the busiest freeway

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:42.882
in all of North America.

00:14:42.981 --> 00:14:45.885
And I walk out,
and I'm holding a baby

00:14:45.984 --> 00:14:50.189
who is screaming and crying
and naked little girl,

00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:54.026
covered in mud and urine
and blood,

00:14:54.092 --> 00:14:56.629
and I'm not wearing pants.

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:59.565
And I'm soaked,
and I'm bleeding,

00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:01.867
and I'm fucking mad and angry.

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:05.237
And I come out, and I'm, like,
200 yards from my car.

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:07.773
I'm nowhere near our car!

00:15:07.872 --> 00:15:10.209
And I walk out,
and just as I walk out

00:15:10.275 --> 00:15:11.477
holding this little girl,

00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:13.545
a car slows down
in front of me,

00:15:13.645 --> 00:15:16.215
and the guy looks at me,
like, closely.

00:15:16.314 --> 00:15:17.216
And I go, "Shit."

00:15:17.315 --> 00:15:18.384
And he goes,

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.220
"Are you Howie Mandel?"

00:15:21.286 --> 00:15:23.422
[laughter and applause]

00:15:23.521 --> 00:15:26.058
And I went, "No!"

00:15:26.124 --> 00:15:27.626
And he drove off.

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:29.929
That is the last time
I took out my daughter.

00:15:30.028 --> 00:15:32.231
She just turned 32 last week,
and we went out for dinner

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.000
for the first time since.

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:36.135
[applause]

00:15:36.234 --> 00:15:38.404
Thank you very much.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.272
<i> Thank you. Thank you.</i>

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:42.908
<i> - Howie Mandel, everybody.</i>

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:43.842
<i> [cheers and applause]</i>
