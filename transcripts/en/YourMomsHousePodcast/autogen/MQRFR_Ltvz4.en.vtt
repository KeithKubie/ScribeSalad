00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:43.820
the guy
who's probably married probably old a

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:43.830
who's probably married probably old a
 

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:48.350
who's probably married probably old a
little bit older who wants to watch porn

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:48.360
little bit older who wants to watch porn
 

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:51.610

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280
figured it out boo-boo yeah that was the
 

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.410
figured it out boo-boo yeah that was the
theory before like what if these guys

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420
theory before like what if these guys
 

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.810

things like that was on Showtime yes
 

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:39.020
things like that was on Showtime yes
that's what I'm saying no it's like an

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:39.030
that's what I'm saying no it's like an
 

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:40.850
that's what I'm saying no it's like an
extension of that okay so but the

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:40.860
extension of that okay so but the
 

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:43.130
extension of that okay so but the
actually it's under fear of being caught

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:43.140
