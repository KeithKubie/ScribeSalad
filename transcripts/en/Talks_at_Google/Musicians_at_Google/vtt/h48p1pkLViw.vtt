[MUSIC - GORDON CHAMBERS,
"SONGWRITING MEDLEY"]

00:02:00.322 --> 00:02:02.280
GORDON CHAMBERS: So I am
the common denominator

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.390
of all those songs.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.120
But it's music lovers like you
that made them all number ones.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.890
So right now, I'm
going to do a song.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.420
On every album,
I cover something

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.090
that I've written in
my own special way.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.140
Tonight, this one goes
out to a dedication

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.730
to two very important ladies
in my career, my first two

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.659
mentors, the late, great,
Phyllis Hyman, and a lady

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.200
that I wrote for,
who told me that it

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.880
was time for me to also
go solo as an artist.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.010
Give it up for-- it's one
year since she went to glory.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.922
Give it up for the
beautiful, incomparable,

00:02:42.922 --> 00:02:44.880
and forever in our hearts,
Ms. Whitney Houston.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.401
Last but not least,
for my beautiful,

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:52.900
the matriarch of
our family recently

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.530
gone home, Aunt
Barbara, Barbara Powell.

00:02:57.232 --> 00:02:59.190
[MUSIC - GORDON CHAMBERS,

[APPLAUSE]

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.745
GORDON CHAMBERS: Thank you.

00:05:38.745 --> 00:05:40.620
So right now, I'm going
to bring to the stage

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.536
a good friend of mine.

00:05:41.536 --> 00:05:45.470
We've been working together
for the last three years,

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.370
shows for the newest
album, "Sincere."

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.370
Everybody say "sincere."

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.360
AUDIENCE: Sincere.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.810
GORDON CHAMBERS: And he
played at the first show.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.920
You played at the first
"Sincere" album release,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.010
right Ricky?

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.550
And I've been
admiring his talent.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.650
He's an amazing guitar player.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.540
I first saw him on the road with
Leela James and was blown away.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.440
And I said, we're going
to get it together.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.570
And it took a couple more
years, but we stayed in touch.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.195
And I'm always appreciative that
he plays with me, because he's

00:06:07.195 --> 00:06:10.120
a very hard-working man on
the road, who tours constantly

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.880
with Trey Songz.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.147
So right now, as I said that
Whitney Houston was the one who

00:06:15.147 --> 00:06:17.480
gave me that inspiration and
told me that it was my time

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.840
to not just write
but also to sing,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.510
so then I began working
on the first solo album.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.570
I'm going to do a cut
from the first solo album.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.796
I'm going to do something
from the second solo album.

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:30.420
And I'm going to do a couple of
cuts from the third solo album,

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.045
if that's all right with y'all,
because I got three kids.

00:06:34.045 --> 00:06:35.520
And I got to give them all love.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.330
So are we plugged in?

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.830
Cool.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.280
We good?

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.780
It's on you.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:56.870
One, two, three, and--
Come on, I need some snaps.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.250
We need some percussion
up in this piece.

00:07:07.109 --> 00:07:08.650
Trey Songz was
actually in the studio

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.275
when we were recording
this very album.

00:07:10.275 --> 00:07:11.010
Here we go.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.968
[MUSIC - GORDON CHAMBERS,
"NEVER FALL IN LOVE"]

00:09:56.925 --> 00:09:59.050
GORDON CHAMBERS: So that
was from album number one.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.980
All three albums are
for sale tonight.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.856
And I take credit cards, because
I have an iPhone and a Square.

00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:07.730
So right now, I'm going
to bring to the stage

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.880
a young lady I
most recently met,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.040
beautiful, beautiful songstress
living in Brooklyn as well,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.730
another rising songbird.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.896
Give it up for Amma Whatt as
she makes her way to the stage.

[APPLAUSE]

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.930
GORDON CHAMBERS: This is
a song that I recorded

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:31.810
with a very good friend
of mine, Ms. Ledisi.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.630
And it's called "To Love
Again," and it was a big hit.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.463
So if you know it,
please sing along, y'all.

up for Amma Whatt, y'all.

00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:11.267
GORDON CHAMBERS: Give
it up for soul music.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.450
GORDON CHAMBERS:
Give it up for Ricky.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.870
And do not give it up
for this mic stand.

00:15:29.977 --> 00:15:32.060
So now, we're going to do
some songs from the most

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.670
current album, "Sincere."

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.600
I shot this video of this
song in my house in Brooklyn.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.830
Is Brooklyn in the house?

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.320
GORDON CHAMBERS: I shot
it right in my own house.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.870
And it featured an
amazing acting performance

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.077
by a friend of ours, who's an
amazing singer, named Sy Smith.

00:15:50.077 --> 00:15:51.910
So if you check out the
video for this song,

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.445
you'll see her acting
her behind off.

00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:56.820
And you'll also see a woman
who surprised me and came out

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.320
tonight.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.340
She's also in the video.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.740
Ms. Ebony Joanne
is in the house.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.250
Acting her behind
off in the video.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.130
You got to love soul artists,
because as we work together,

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.171
and we're there for each
when we need each other,

00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:11.430
aren't we, Ebony?

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.320
I think she's
working on her album.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.290
So anyway, this song is a
song that actually Troy Taylor

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.920
wanted Trey Songz to record.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.084
[SINGING] And Trey said, no,
no, no, no, no, and I said,

00:16:26.084 --> 00:16:27.409
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:27.409 --> 00:16:29.700
It's called "I Can't Love
You (If You Don't Love You)."

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.650

GORDON CHAMBERS: So this
is my last song tonight,

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.530
also from the "Sincere" album.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.580
This is my favorite
song that I've ever

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.260
recorded as a solo
artist, my number one

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.567
iTunes-selling song
as a solo artist.

00:20:40.567 --> 00:20:42.400
And I'm gonna have some
friends of mine come

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.289
and help me sing this, so
we can take it to church.

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:47.330
Do you mind if we take it
to church a little bit?

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:58.545
So welcome to the stage, my
friends, Duray, Dia, and Rasul.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:35.854
My name is Gordon Chambers.

00:26:40.975 --> 00:26:42.350
RYAN LOREN: All
right, everybody.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.933
We're here to welcome
Gordon Chambers.

00:26:43.933 --> 00:26:46.920
I'm so happy to have you here.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.800
It's been a long time coming.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.730
And Gordon, for those
of you who don't know,

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:57.630
is probably one of the
best writers in existence.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.545
That's just one man's
opinion, but that's mine.

00:27:00.545 --> 00:27:03.170
And so I'm going to talk to you
a little bit about your writing

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.940
process and all of that.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.650
But first can you take
us back to the beginnings

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.660
and how you got started?

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.910
I know you've had
quite a background.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.360
And just take us back.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.920
GORDON CHAMBERS: It
began, it was all a dream,

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.352
I used to read
"Word Up" magazines.

00:27:21.352 --> 00:27:23.310
Give love to Brooklyn
and Biggie Smalls, y'all.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.280
Brooklyn in the house.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.260
But I have lived in Brooklyn
for the last 15 years or so.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.466
But I was born in the Bronx but
raised in a wonderful community

00:27:31.466 --> 00:27:32.590
called Teaneck, New Jersey.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.760
And I think some
Teaneck people are here.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.120
And I'm grateful for
my town, because it

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.480
was a town where they were
just a wonderful group

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.110
of supportive parents, my
parents and music teachers.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:47.420
And when I was in sixth
grade, I was writing songs.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.140
I was given an assignment
to write a short story

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.590
about the book "Jonathan
Livingston Seagull."

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.509
And being the Libra creative
person that I am, I said,

00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:58.550
instead of writing a short
story, I wrote a song.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:27:59.720
And I showed the
teacher the song.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.910
You said, well, that's
a really good song.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.634
She said, why don't we teach
this to all the sixth graders?

00:28:03.634 --> 00:28:05.550
And so she taught it to
all the sixth graders,

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.091
and it was performed
in a sixth grade

00:28:07.091 --> 00:28:09.470
assembly for all the kids.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.070
And then later on
in high school,

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.350
I continued writing songs.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.058
And one of my best
friends in high school

00:28:14.058 --> 00:28:17.140
was murdered by her boyfriend--
Donyale Morton, may she ever

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:17.930
rest in peace.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:22.570
And after she passed, I
needed to do something

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.930
to process my feelings.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.780
And I wrote a song
called "Always Be There."

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.670
And once again, I showed
it to some of the teachers

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:29.253
at the school.

00:28:29.253 --> 00:28:31.370
And they were very
moved by the song.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:33.810
And I shared it
with her parents.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.450
And then one of the teachers
was a dance choreographer

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:37.660
at the school, Ms. Miller.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.240
And she said, I'm going
to choreograph something

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.960
to this song so that
this will forever

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.379
live in the Teaneck
Terpsichoreans repertoire.

00:28:45.379 --> 00:28:46.670
So she choreographed something.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:47.890
And then other
students came forward.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:49.764
We'll do a poem, and
then we'll do something.

00:28:49.764 --> 00:28:52.380
So the birth of that song
created a whole evening

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.640
where 2,000 people
came to just give

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.400
creative remembrances
of Donyale.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.880
So I really felt like
God had chosen me

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:06.140
as a child to provide
songs that could inspire

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.290
and that could heal.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.990
And so after that,
I went to college,

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.070
I went to Brown University,
kept on writing.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.010
Then I took a job at
"Essence" magazine

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.584
and became the entertainment
editor of "Essence."

00:29:16.584 --> 00:29:18.500
And I served in that
position for seven years.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.740
And that was a great
networking place.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.430
And so while I was
there hanging out,

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:26.670
I met a wonderful lady, Phyllis
Hyman, may she rest in peace.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:29.560
And she took me under her wing,
and I also met Queen Latifah.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.290
And so Queen Latifah
and Phyllis Hyman

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:34.730
were the first two superstars,
who not only became friends

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.159
but mentors and had me write
on some of their albums.

00:29:37.159 --> 00:29:38.950
And then I met other
people, like producers

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.520
Barry Eastman,
Dave Hall, and then

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.830
started writing some
of the songs that

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:46.900
became number one hits and
sold millions of records.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.430
God is good.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.870
So some of those songs
include, Anita Baker's

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.070
"I Apologize," Brownstone's
"If You Love Me, Say It,"

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.620
the theme from "Set It
Off," "Missing You,"

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.120
by Brandy, Tamia, Gladys
Knight, and Chaka Khan,

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.200
as well as cuts for Whitney
Houston, Tamia, Brandy, Gladys

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.970
Knight, Marc Anthony, Patti
Labelle, Chaka Khan Chaka

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.160
Khan, and 75 recording artists.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:09.935
Thank you, Lord.

00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:15.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.515
RYAN LOREN: I am
curious about this.

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:19.520
And I ask other artists,
too, but can you

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.050
talk about the process you use
to write and how it happens?

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.570
Is it different every time?

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.710
Do you create conditions
that make it happen?

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:27.586
Or what would you do?

00:30:27.586 --> 00:30:29.751
GORDON CHAMBERS: I have a
different writing process.

00:30:29.751 --> 00:30:30.890
It just depends what it is.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.300
Some songs of mine I
write at the piano,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.790
and they tend to
be more ballads.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.730
But a lot of times,
collaborations

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.630
are about opposites attracting.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.990
So a lot of my songs
have been written

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:46.000
with producers that were
quote unquote "beat guys."

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.460
But the producers I got
a chance to work with

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.910
were more than just beat people.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.730
Stevie J. And Dave
Hall, these were

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:56.160
guys who had real fabulous
musicianship on top

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:56.820
of their beats.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:57.960
But they had hard beats.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.470
They knew how to knock
their heads in the studio.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.384
My glasses are falling off.

00:31:03.384 --> 00:31:04.800
It was like, I was
a man who would

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.350
come in with the
melody on top, and they

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.558
would have the beat knocking.

00:31:07.558 --> 00:31:10.111
And that's how you had that
great opposites attract

00:31:10.111 --> 00:31:10.610
of music.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:14.490
So sometimes it was a situation
of being given a great track.

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.240
"If You Love Me" was a track
that Dave Hall presented me.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.480
And he gave it to me on a CD.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.220
And one morning-- I'm
Jamaican, so Jamaicans

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.150
are notoriously late.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.140
I was on time today, though.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.760
Jamaicans are notoriously late.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.690
So one day, I was
on my way, late

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.706
to my job at "Essence"
magazine, I swear to God.

00:31:28.706 --> 00:31:31.080
It just started to pour rain
as I was thinking about what

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.219
lie I could call Susan
Taylor with and tell her

00:31:33.219 --> 00:31:35.760
I was going to be late, because
I had every lie in the book--

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.710
the cat, the grandmother died,
the this, the that, blah, blah.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:39.850
What lie can I tell?

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.020
I swear, God was like,
don't tell any more lies,

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.670
because the rain
started pouring down.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:47.460
I popped Dave Hall's track
into the CD player of my car,

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.270
and all I heard
were those chords.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.840
And the first line of "If
You Love Me" came to me.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.750
"I don't want to rain on this
parade," inspired by the rain

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.261
as I was late to work.

00:31:56.261 --> 00:31:57.260
Songs can come anywhere.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.365
I've literally had songs hit me.

00:31:59.365 --> 00:32:00.740
One day, I was
getting a haircut.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.970
I was in the barber shop.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:03.880
And this idea came to me.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.770
And the barber
scratched my head,

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.054
because I was like, I
need a pen, I need a pen.

00:32:08.054 --> 00:32:09.720
And he's like, yo,
I'm about to cut you.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.540
And he really did cut me
with the barber thing.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:17.630
But that was when the words to
a song that I wrote for Brandy

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.500
called "One Voice," they
came to me immediately.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.580
So I think being a songwriter
is about being open,

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.364
having something to say.

00:32:26.364 --> 00:32:27.780
It takes being a
sensitive person.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.240
You have to be in touch
with your emotions.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.562
You can't be the alpha male
to be a great songwriter.

00:32:33.562 --> 00:32:35.270
You really have to be
the sensitive male.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.570
You have to know what you feel
and be able to articulate it,

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:42.430
because the women audience,
they get it right away.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.050
But it's interesting, since I've
become a performer, not just

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.640
a songwriter, I have found
that my songs now, especially

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.350
the songs on my solo
albums, are speaking

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:50.829
to the men very poignantly.

00:32:50.829 --> 00:32:52.870
A lot of the men have told
me that buy my records

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.661
and go to my concerts,
they said, thank you

00:32:54.661 --> 00:32:58.270
for saying for me what I didn't
have the emotional sensitivity

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.120
and that kind of courage to say.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.632
So it's about being open.

00:33:01.632 --> 00:33:02.840
RYAN LOREN: Thanks very much.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.689
So can you talk
about, obviously,

00:33:04.689 --> 00:33:05.730
you're not just a writer.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.150
You're also a performer,
singer, artist.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.870
So what was the
critical point where

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.927
you decided, all right,
I'm going to do this?

00:33:13.927 --> 00:33:16.260
GORDON CHAMBERS: It had been
in my mind for a long time.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.060
Because I was in the
studio all the time

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.135
writing songs for
other artists, people

00:33:20.135 --> 00:33:22.260
don't realize that I sang
all of those songs first.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.720
I did the demos
for "I Apologize."

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.810
I did the demo
for "Missing You."

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.310
I did the demo for
"If You Love Me."

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:27.730
So the artist who
record the songs

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.146
were always listening
to my voice.

00:33:29.146 --> 00:33:31.630
I would lay the lead vocals
and the background vocals.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.629
I was always in the
studios recording.

00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:34.670
And I knew how to record.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.503
And then in my years
as entertainment editor

00:33:36.503 --> 00:33:38.630
at "Essence," I was going
to all the concerts.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.350
I've seen everyone in concert.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.934
And I was going backstage, I was
hanging out with the artists,

00:33:42.934 --> 00:33:43.975
interviewing the artists.

00:33:43.975 --> 00:33:45.830
So I was having the
best artist development

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.020
that one could ever have,
because I was seeing it

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.080
on the side of a journalist.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.134
So I was really learning
about the business.

00:33:52.134 --> 00:33:53.300
But then there was the fear.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.080
I was like, afraid to step
from one side to the other.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.750
And it was something I wanted to
do, but I was afraid to do it.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.610
And then sometimes you
just have to be open

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.880
and ask people for help.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.772
What happened was
I started to-- not

00:34:05.772 --> 00:34:07.480
get afraid of making
the music but afraid

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.816
of asking the very people
around me to help me,

00:34:09.816 --> 00:34:12.190
because I knew that I didn't
have tons and tons of money.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.424
But I want to make
a quality project.

00:34:15.424 --> 00:34:17.840
But the day that changed my
life was, I was in the studio,

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.290
producing the late and
great Whitney Houston.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:22.749
And I was producing
a song for her.

00:34:22.749 --> 00:34:25.039
And I told her that I wanted
her to hit a certain note.

00:34:25.039 --> 00:34:27.219
And I kept telling her to
hit it higher and higher.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:28.677
And then she looked
me in the face,

00:34:28.677 --> 00:34:30.949
and she said, "I think
you want to do what I do.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:32.365
And if that's what
you want to do,

00:34:32.365 --> 00:34:35.530
then that's what
you need to do."

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.449
And I looked at her,
like, what did she say?

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:38.892
She was really in my face, too.

00:34:38.892 --> 00:34:41.100
And she's from Newark, so
what she gets in your face,

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:41.940
it's kind of.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:46.162
So the Newark came on,
the Brooklyn stepped back.

00:34:46.162 --> 00:34:47.620
And I said, well,
what do you mean?

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:48.920
She said, I think
you want to sing.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.150
If that's what you
want to do, then that's

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:51.670
what you should be doing.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:56.000
And it was like one those
times when an angel speaks Word

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.400
into your life, and you feel it.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.860
And it penetrates your heart.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:02.230
So shortly after that, I went
to church the Sunday after that,

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:06.380
and my minister Pastor Trouffant
at Emmanuel Baptist Church

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:10.562
in Brooklyn gave a sermon
about how not to wait,

00:35:10.562 --> 00:35:12.520
that now is your time,
whatever you want to do.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.360
And he talked about
how Jesus died at 36.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.390
And many of the miracles
that you read about

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.600
were done in the last
three years of his life.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.690
So he said, don't
wait for your time

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.190
if there's something
you want to do.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.090
And so after Whitney
preached to me in the studio

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.100
and then Pastor Trouffant
preached to me, then I said,

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:29.946
it's time.

00:35:29.946 --> 00:35:31.070
The universe is telling me.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.134
And I called all my
friends in the business.

00:35:33.134 --> 00:35:35.300
And I said, I think I'm
ready to make a solo record.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.970
And everyone said yes.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.250
My producer Troy Taylor
said, come on through.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:40.760
We're going to do
it in my basement.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.110
And we went to his basement, my
friend's publicist, Gwendolyn

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:44.790
Quinn.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.956
These are people I had all
worked with at "Essence,"

00:35:46.956 --> 00:35:49.480
but I was afraid to ask them
to help me on my own stuff.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.870
Gwendolyn Quinn said,
I'll do your PR.

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:53.510
Everyone I reached
out to said, we

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:55.100
have been waiting
for this moment.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.280
And they all helped me,
started booking shows,

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.021
booked the very first
show at Joe's Pub.

00:35:59.021 --> 00:36:01.020
I swear, I thought 10
people were going to come.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.230
They had to turn
200 people away.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.730
Then the night of
the album release,

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:07.150
we had the album release
around the corner at BB

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.690
King's-- packed, packed,
almost a sold out show.

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:12.210
It's just from the jump,
it's as if the world

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.444
had been waiting for me
to step into my greatness.

00:36:14.444 --> 00:36:15.860
And sometimes
that's what you have

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.026
to do is, just listen to
what the universe is trying

00:36:18.026 --> 00:36:20.090
to tell you and don't be
afraid to step into it.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.750
RYAN LOREN: Thanks a lot.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.276
Let's give it up for that.

00:36:23.276 --> 00:36:25.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:29.080
RYAN LOREN: Last question--
so about the music, talk to us

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.090
about what the last
album meant to you.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.090
That was your third
album, "Sincere,"

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:35.070
and then what's next?

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.720
GORDON CHAMBERS: Every album
gets more and more personal.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.095
The first album was called
"Introducing Gordon Chambers,"

00:36:40.095 --> 00:36:42.680
which featured collaborations
with friends-- Roy

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.085
Hargrove, Mike Phillips.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.370
Carl Thomas is on that album.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:52.630
So the first album had a
slightly jazzy feeling to it.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:55.550
"Love Stories" featured
a duet with Ledisi,

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.920
"To Love Again,"
which became a big hit

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.060
record on a lot
of radio stations.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.830
Then the third album, "Sincere,"
which is the most recent album,

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.579
I just wanted to make
an album that I felt

00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:05.609
was very, very personal.

00:37:05.609 --> 00:37:07.150
And I want to make
an album this time

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:10.270
from the perspective of
being a live performer.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:12.700
The first two albums were
more from the perspective

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.400
of a songwriter that's
writing and also sings.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.830
This one was started from the
perspective of a performer,

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.882
and I wanted to give people
lyrically a backstage, up close

00:37:23.882 --> 00:37:25.840
and personal emotional
look at what my life is.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.290
I wanted to be
more as vulnerable

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.467
as I could be with the lyrics.

00:37:29.467 --> 00:37:31.050
That's why the first
song on the album

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.674
is called "I'm In
The Band," because it

00:37:32.674 --> 00:37:35.109
was written from
that perspective.

00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:37.150
I'm in the process of
making another album called

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.530
"Conversations With God."

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:42.500
And it's going to be
an inspirational album.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.802
It's going to have a
spiritual tonality,

00:37:44.802 --> 00:37:46.510
but I'm also talking
about relationships,

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:47.510
I'm talking about life.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:48.926
And I'm just getting
more and more

00:37:48.926 --> 00:37:51.250
vulnerable with each album.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:54.450
I feel that the
R&amp;B male tradition

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:57.750
has been taken over
by the sexuality.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.510
And I want to provide
more of the sensitivity

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:04.189
and the sensuality into
the lyrical landscape.

00:38:04.189 --> 00:38:05.230
RYAN LOREN: Amen to that.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:10.740
Thanks for being here.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.490
Everybody, I've learned a
lot from Gordon in my life.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.182
We've known each
other a few years.

00:38:16.182 --> 00:38:17.640
You're a role model
to many people.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:17.990
GORDON CHAMBERS: Thank you.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:19.630
RYAN LOREN: Thanks so
much for being here.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.880
GORDON CHAMBERS: Thank you
for doing this for us here.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.370
Thank you.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:23.286
RYAN LOREN: Of course.

00:38:23.286 --> 00:38:24.625
Thank you.

00:38:24.625 --> 00:38:26.000
GORDON CHAMBERS:
See y'all later.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.850
[APPLAUSE]
