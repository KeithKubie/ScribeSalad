00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.279
 
the average number of calories that we

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289
the average number of calories that we
 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.480
the average number of calories that we
eat per day is about 2,100 kilocalories

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490
eat per day is about 2,100 kilocalories
 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.710
eat per day is about 2,100 kilocalories
per day okay and that's energy per unit

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720
per day okay and that's energy per unit
 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.279
per day okay and that's energy per unit
time kilocalories per day so energy per

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289
time kilocalories per day so energy per
 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.380
time kilocalories per day so energy per
unit time is what we call power in

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390
unit time is what we call power in
 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.019
unit time is what we call power in
physics not the Washington DC kind of

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029
physics not the Washington DC kind of
 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.840
physics not the Washington DC kind of
power but power for physicists is how

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850
power but power for physicists is how
 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.000
power but power for physicists is how
much energy are you burning up per unit

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010
much energy are you burning up per unit
 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.660
much energy are you burning up per unit
time and if you calculate how much that

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670
time and if you calculate how much that
 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.240
time and if you calculate how much that
works out to it's the same thing as a

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250
works out to it's the same thing as a
 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.790
works out to it's the same thing as a
hundred watt bulb

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800
hundred watt bulb
 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.220
hundred watt bulb
so a watt is a Joule per second and if

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230
so a watt is a Joule per second and if
 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.830
so a watt is a Joule per second and if
you calculate how many joules you burn

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840
you calculate how many joules you burn
 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.870
you calculate how many joules you burn
up in a day at 100 watts that works out

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880
up in a day at 100 watts that works out
 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.530
up in a day at 100 watts that works out
to be 20 100 kilocalories per day so if

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540
to be 20 100 kilocalories per day so if
 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.899
to be 20 100 kilocalories per day so if
you have a like if there are three

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909
you have a like if there are three
 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.270
you have a like if there are three
people in the room and it gets warm it's

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280
people in the room and it gets warm it's
 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.160
people in the room and it gets warm it's
because they're generating 300 watts of

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170
because they're generating 300 watts of
 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.620
because they're generating 300 watts of
heat it's like having a 300 watt bulb

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630
heat it's like having a 300 watt bulb
 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.289
heat it's like having a 300 watt bulb
going on so if you multiply a hundred

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299
going on so if you multiply a hundred
 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.569
going on so if you multiply a hundred
Watts by 6.8 billion which is the number

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579
Watts by 6.8 billion which is the number
 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.330
Watts by 6.8 billion which is the number
of people on the planet you find out

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340
of people on the planet you find out
 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.389
of people on the planet you find out
that the whole power generation of the

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399
that the whole power generation of the
 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.120
that the whole power generation of the
human species is about 0.68 terawatts ok

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130
human species is about 0.68 terawatts ok
 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.139
human species is about 0.68 terawatts ok
terawatt is a lot of watts let's see you

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149
terawatt is a lot of watts let's see you
 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.719
terawatt is a lot of watts let's see you
know I'm there's kilowatts megawatts

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729
know I'm there's kilowatts megawatts
 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.839
know I'm there's kilowatts megawatts
gigabytes gigawatts and then terawatts

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:43.849
gigabytes gigawatts and then terawatts
 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:47.139
gigabytes gigawatts and then terawatts
so it's it's a lot our domestic animals

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149
so it's it's a lot our domestic animals
 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.499
so it's it's a lot our domestic animals
if we are 0.68 terawatts our domestic

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509
if we are 0.68 terawatts our domestic
 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.129
if we are 0.68 terawatts our domestic
animals are about twice that so that

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139
animals are about twice that so that
 

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:58.779
animals are about twice that so that
makes it about 1.4 terawatts and then if

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789
makes it about 1.4 terawatts and then if
 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.379
makes it about 1.4 terawatts and then if
you look at all of the domestic all of

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389
you look at all of the domestic all of
 

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.980
you look at all of the domestic all of
the inanimate energy that people produce

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990
the inanimate energy that people produce
 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.969
the inanimate energy that people produce
it's about 15 terrawatts so you should

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979
it's about 15 terrawatts so you should
 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.990
it's about 15 terrawatts so you should
think of each person you see as a parade

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000
think of each person you see as a parade
 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.979
think of each person you see as a parade
of 25 people

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989
of 25 people
 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.120
of 25 people
first there's the person and that

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130
first there's the person and that
 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.990
first there's the person and that
person's energetic consumption

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000
person's energetic consumption
 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.059
person's energetic consumption
immediately behind our

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069
immediately behind our
 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.789
immediately behind our
people who represent the domestic

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799
people who represent the domestic
 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.970
people who represent the domestic
animals on average that that person is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980
animals on average that that person is
 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.569
animals on average that that person is
responsible for and after that there are

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579
responsible for and after that there are
 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.050
responsible for and after that there are
22 more people who represent the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060
22 more people who represent the
 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.660
22 more people who represent the
inanimate energy okay so 1 plus 2 plus

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670
inanimate energy okay so 1 plus 2 plus
 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.129
inanimate energy okay so 1 plus 2 plus
22 is 25 so why are we transforming the

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139
22 is 25 so why are we transforming the
 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.869
22 is 25 so why are we transforming the
earth because we have 7 billion people

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879
earth because we have 7 billion people
 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.589
earth because we have 7 billion people
but each of them has 25 shadows

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599
but each of them has 25 shadows
 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.899
but each of them has 25 shadows
energetic shadows so it's the same as if

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909
energetic shadows so it's the same as if
 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.259
energetic shadows so it's the same as if
the earth were covered with 175 billion

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269
the earth were covered with 175 billion
 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.409
the earth were covered with 175 billion
people that's how we are transforming

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:05.419
people that's how we are transforming
 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.589
people that's how we are transforming
the earth animals are a part of that

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599
the earth animals are a part of that
 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.159
the earth animals are a part of that
their equivalent of 2 of those people
