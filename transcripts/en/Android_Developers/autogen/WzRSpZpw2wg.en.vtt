they mean is they can't live without the
 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.530
they mean is they can't live without the
things that the phone connects them to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
things that the phone connects them to
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.300
things that the phone connects them to
the people they love the issues they

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
the people they love the issues they
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.789

this has become a portal for us to other
 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.559
this has become a portal for us to other
people in other places and so that's

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569
people in other places and so that's

important for you to remember so this is
 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.300
important for you to remember so this is
sort of the backbone of the talk there's

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310
sort of the backbone of the talk there's
 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.460
sort of the backbone of the talk there's
like who's sort of Maslow's pyramid of

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470
like who's sort of Maslow's pyramid of
 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.660
like who's sort of Maslow's pyramid of
needs right so this is sort of my

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670
needs right so this is sort of my
 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.270
needs right so this is sort of my
pyramid of needs for notifications and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280
pyramid of needs for notifications and
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.849
pyramid of needs for notifications and
at the well the top but at the base the

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859
at the well the top but at the base the
 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.559
at the well the top but at the base the
first thing if you can't do anything

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569
first thing if you can't do anything
 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.909
first thing if you can't do anything
else when you're making a decision I

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919
else when you're making a decision I
 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.110
else when you're making a decision I
want you to ask yourself if you're gonna

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120
want you to ask yourself if you're gonna
 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.409
want you to ask yourself if you're gonna
annoy the user right don't do that

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419
annoy the user right don't do that
 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.379
annoy the user right don't do that
and then we walk up the the pyramid we

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389
and then we walk up the the pyramid we
 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.720
and then we walk up the the pyramid we
want to respect their life and their

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730
want to respect their life and their
 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.430
want to respect their life and their
story and how we're fitting into it we

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440
story and how we're fitting into it we
 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.599
story and how we're fitting into it we
want to empower them to do the things

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609
want to empower them to do the things

the noise you wanted it to make for
 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.550
the noise you wanted it to make for
example and that's a good thing because

example and that's a good thing because
 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.960
example and that's a good thing because
if you'd made the noise at the wrong

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970
if you'd made the noise at the wrong
 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.460
if you'd made the noise at the wrong
time you would have annoyed the user

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470
time you would have annoyed the user

right so what do you need to know is the
 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.780
right so what do you need to know is the
developers about this this is what the

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790
developers about this this is what the
 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.120
developers about this this is what the
system does right the user has a lot of

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130
system does right the user has a lot of
 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.500
system does right the user has a lot of
ways to control this they can say

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510
ways to control this they can say
 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.500
ways to control this they can say
because all the information channels

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510
because all the information channels
 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.390
because all the information channels
that users user as I said they're

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400
that users user as I said they're
 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.250
that users user as I said they're
evolving fast right they're changing

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260
evolving fast right they're changing
 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.700
evolving fast right they're changing
rapidly

so they're kind of idiomatic some people

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050
so they're kind of idiomatic some people
 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.200
so they're kind of idiomatic some people
still rely on phone calls a lot some

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210
still rely on phone calls a lot some

still rely on phone calls a lot some
people use SMS is there's a lot of

people use SMS is there's a lot of
 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.100
people use SMS is there's a lot of
variability there so the user is able to

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110
variability there so the user is able to
 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.830
variability there so the user is able to
control this by sort of a channel basis

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840
control this by sort of a channel basis
 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.690

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880
Builder pattern because that makes sure
 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.400
Builder pattern because that makes sure
that we have all the information we need

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410
that we have all the information we need
 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.650
that we have all the information we need
to treat your notification correctly and

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660
to treat your notification correctly and
 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.580
to treat your notification correctly and
this is all about getting the

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590
this is all about getting the
 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.890
this is all about getting the
notification at the right place so this

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900
notification at the right place so this
 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.800
notification at the right place so this
is the Builder pattern very basic

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810
is the Builder pattern very basic
 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.510
is the Builder pattern very basic
obviously you get some icon text title

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520
obviously you get some icon text title
 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.440
obviously you get some icon text title
and you build it and you get a

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.450
and you build it and you get a
 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.040
and you build it and you get a
notification I will try to use

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050
notification I will try to use
 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.750
notification I will try to use
notification compat everywhere in the

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760
notification compat everywhere in the
 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.129
notification compat everywhere in the
sample sometimes it doesn't fit on the

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139
sample sometimes it doesn't fit on the
 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:11.810
sample sometimes it doesn't fit on the
screen but if you're using the Builder

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820
screen but if you're using the Builder
 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.219
screen but if you're using the Builder
you should be using the compat builder

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229
you should be using the compat builder
 

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:15.560
you should be using the compat builder
because this will at least compile and

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570
because this will at least compile and
 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.990
because this will at least compile and
run all the way back to four I don't

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000
run all the way back to four I don't
 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.460
run all the way back to four I don't
know if anybody targeting four anymore

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.470
know if anybody targeting four anymore
 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.770
know if anybody targeting four anymore
but so for all intensive purposes all

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780
but so for all intensive purposes all
 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.379

androids right so it will fall for

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:24.389
androids right so it will fall for
 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:25.940
androids right so it will fall for
features that don't exist it will fall

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:25.950
features that don't exist it will fall
 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.070
features that don't exist it will fall
back gracefully and then you don't have

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080
back gracefully and then you don't have
 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.960
back gracefully and then you don't have
to worry about it so that's nice as we

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:29.970
to worry about it so that's nice as we
 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.500
to worry about it so that's nice as we
do that for you so here's the the media

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:33.510
do that for you so here's the the media
 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.560
do that for you so here's the the media
thing so for category very simple you

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:36.570
thing so for category very simple you
 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.879
thing so for category very simple you
just there's a builder method that you

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:37.889
just there's a builder method that you
 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:40.790
just there's a builder method that you
set the category and you just have to

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800
set the category and you just have to
 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.310
set the category and you just have to
pick the right one that's the hard part

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:42.320
pick the right one that's the hard part
 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.230
pick the right one that's the hard part
so here's some categories so these are

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240
so here's some categories so these are
 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.659
so here's some categories so these are
the ones that relate to that screen I've

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:47.669
the ones that relate to that screen I've
 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:49.190
the ones that relate to that screen I've
showed you before the ones that the user

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.200
showed you before the ones that the user
 

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.529
showed you before the ones that the user
right now has direct control over so

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:51.539
right now has direct control over so
 

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:53.779
right now has direct control over so
alarms reminders events messages calls

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:53.789
alarms reminders events messages calls
 

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:55.790
alarms reminders events messages calls
there you'll notice that they're pretty

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800
there you'll notice that they're pretty
 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.770
there you'll notice that they're pretty
tightly defined so alarms are like alarm

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:00.780
tightly defined so alarms are like alarm
 

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.000

clocks the thing that wakes you up in
 

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.170
clocks the thing that wakes you up in
the morning so you have to think again

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.180
the morning so you have to think again
 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.090
the morning so you have to think again
about what is the user going to expect

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:05.100
about what is the user going to expect
 

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.930
about what is the user going to expect
when they say they want to be

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:05.940
when they say they want to be
 

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.240
when they say they want to be
interrupted by alarms and make sure that

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.250
interrupted by alarms and make sure that
 

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.620
interrupted by alarms and make sure that
you're not gonna surprise them when you

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:09.630
you're not gonna surprise them when you
 

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.790
you're not gonna surprise them when you
tell us that it's an alarm okay and one

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800
tell us that it's an alarm okay and one
 

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.590
tell us that it's an alarm okay and one
of the most subtle ones I think is this

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:15.600
of the most subtle ones I think is this
 

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.060
of the most subtle ones I think is this
category message which sounds pretty

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.070
category message which sounds pretty
 

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.370
category message which sounds pretty
generic like a message okay but this

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:19.380
generic like a message okay but this
 

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.250
generic like a message okay but this
particularly means synchronous messages

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:21.260
particularly means synchronous messages
 

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
particularly means synchronous messages
so SMS is instant messages things like

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:24.270
so SMS is instant messages things like
 

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.140
so SMS is instant messages things like
that on the next page there is email

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:27.150
that on the next page there is email
 

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.810
that on the next page there is email
which is asynchronous messages so email

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:29.820
which is asynchronous messages so email
 

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.550
which is asynchronous messages so email
we wouldn't necessarily consider that a

the main features you can set in the

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:14.300
the main features you can set in the
 

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.120
the main features you can set in the
Builder is something called priority and

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.130
Builder is something called priority and
 

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.670
Builder is something called priority and
that sounds pretty good people usually

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680
that sounds pretty good people usually
 

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.880
that sounds pretty good people usually
think a priority is where I am the list

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:20.890
think a priority is where I am the list
 

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.769
think a priority is where I am the list
and often I imagine that people want to

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:23.779
and often I imagine that people want to
 

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:26.019
and often I imagine that people want to
be two toward the top of the list but

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:26.029
be two toward the top of the list but
 

00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:27.280
be two toward the top of the list but
priority is about a lot more than just

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:27.290
priority is about a lot more than just
 

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.410
priority is about a lot more than just
where you are in the list so you'll

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:29.420
where you are in the list so you'll
 

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.090
where you are in the list so you'll
notice at the bottom here there's this

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:31.100
notice at the bottom here there's this
 

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.940
notice at the bottom here there's this
thing priority min which actually gets

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:33.950
thing priority min which actually gets
 

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.710
thing priority min which actually gets
sort of a different visual treatment so

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720
sort of a different visual treatment so
 

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.000
sort of a different visual treatment so
in this case it's a little bit grey

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.010
in this case it's a little bit grey
 

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.860
in this case it's a little bit grey
that's sort of de-emphasized

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:40.870
 

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.990
these have implications about how the

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000
these have implications about how the
 

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.280
these have implications about how the
user is going to end up being

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:45.290
user is going to end up being
 

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.960
user is going to end up being
interrupted and this we should run

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:46.970
interrupted and this we should run
 

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:47.860
interrupted and this we should run
through a couple of those and try to

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:47.870
through a couple of those and try to
 

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.790
through a couple of those and try to
understand them so again trying not to

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800
understand them so again trying not to
 

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.639
understand them so again trying not to
disturb the user annoy the user one

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:54.649
disturb the user annoy the user one
 

00:10:54.649 --> 00:10:57.220
disturb the user annoy the user one
thing you should do is use things like

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:57.230
thing you should do is use things like
 

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.199
thing you should do is use things like
priority lower or priority min and this

00:10:59.199 --> 00:10:59.209
priority lower or priority min and this
 

00:10:59.209 --> 00:11:00.519
priority lower or priority min and this
is how you set them except

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:00.529
is how you set them except
 

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:05.619
is how you set them except
there's a Nina or a constant and the

00:11:05.619 --> 00:11:05.629
there's a Nina or a constant and the
 

00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:07.989
there's a Nina or a constant and the
reason you should not always want to get

00:11:07.989 --> 00:11:07.999
reason you should not always want to get
 

00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:09.219
reason you should not always want to get
users face is because you may have

00:11:09.219 --> 00:11:09.229
users face is because you may have
 

00:11:09.229 --> 00:11:11.229
users face is because you may have
information that you sold to them at

00:11:11.229 --> 00:11:11.239
information that you sold to them at
 

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:12.999
information that you sold to them at
some point in the future you don't know

00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:13.009
some point in the future you don't know
 

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:15.189
some point in the future you don't know
when to post it to them and there's been

00:11:15.189 --> 00:11:15.199
when to post it to them and there's been
 

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:16.389
when to post it to them and there's been
some studies you can look in the

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399
some studies you can look in the
 

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.819
some studies you can look in the
academic research I think there was one

00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:18.829
academic research I think there was one
 

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:20.949
academic research I think there was one
I can't remember a reference right now

00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959
I can't remember a reference right now
 

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:22.479
I can't remember a reference right now
anyway if you look for them you'll find

00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:22.489
anyway if you look for them you'll find
 

00:11:22.489 --> 00:11:23.889
anyway if you look for them you'll find
the studies the show that people are

00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:23.899
the studies the show that people are
 

00:11:23.899 --> 00:11:25.089
the studies the show that people are
more receptive to notifications that

00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:25.099
more receptive to notifications that
 

00:11:25.099 --> 00:11:27.159
more receptive to notifications that
they get at the right time

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:27.169
they get at the right time
 

00:11:27.169 --> 00:11:30.129
they get at the right time
so this is a way for you to sort of do

00:11:30.129 --> 00:11:30.139
so this is a way for you to sort of do
 

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:31.929
so this is a way for you to sort of do
that on the cheap right you posted in

00:11:31.929 --> 00:11:31.939
that on the cheap right you posted in
 

00:11:31.939 --> 00:11:34.359
that on the cheap right you posted in
the low priority bin so that they aren't

00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:34.369
the low priority bin so that they aren't
 

00:11:34.369 --> 00:11:36.639
the low priority bin so that they aren't
grabbing attention but these will see

00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:36.649
grabbing attention but these will see
 

00:11:36.649 --> 00:11:39.279
grabbing attention but these will see
them when it's time so here's an example

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:39.289
them when it's time so here's an example
 

00:11:39.289 --> 00:11:41.639
them when it's time so here's an example
of my lock screen for example there's a

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:41.649
of my lock screen for example there's a
 

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:44.949
of my lock screen for example there's a
chat message from Mike and it looks like

00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959
chat message from Mike and it looks like
 

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:47.079
chat message from Mike and it looks like
I have one notification it turns out

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:47.089
I have one notification it turns out
 

00:11:47.089 --> 00:11:48.459
I have one notification it turns out
that I actually have two notifications I

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:48.469
that I actually have two notifications I
 

00:11:48.469 --> 00:11:52.509
that I actually have two notifications I
have this file upload notification and

00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:52.519
have this file upload notification and
 

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:54.099
have this file upload notification and
that was something that the app decided

00:11:54.099 --> 00:11:54.109
that was something that the app decided
 

00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:55.929
that was something that the app decided
wasn't enough to like bother me though

00:11:55.929 --> 00:11:55.939
wasn't enough to like bother me though
 

00:11:55.939 --> 00:11:57.699
wasn't enough to like bother me though
right so this is another way that we the

00:11:57.699 --> 00:11:57.709
right so this is another way that we the
 

00:11:57.709 --> 00:12:00.129
right so this is another way that we the
presentation is keyed to priority so if

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:00.139
presentation is keyed to priority so if
 

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:01.569
presentation is keyed to priority so if
you post a min priority notification

00:12:01.569 --> 00:12:01.579
you post a min priority notification
 

00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:03.399
you post a min priority notification
what you're saying is don't bother the

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:03.409
what you're saying is don't bother the
 

00:12:03.409 --> 00:12:05.259
what you're saying is don't bother the
user if they go looking in the shade you

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:05.269
user if they go looking in the shade you
 

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:06.759
user if they go looking in the shade you
can present it to them because then

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:06.769
can present it to them because then
 

00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:08.169
can present it to them because then
they're probably bored you might be

00:12:08.169 --> 00:12:08.179
they're probably bored you might be
 

00:12:08.179 --> 00:12:10.029
they're probably bored you might be
picking up something but we don't put it

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:10.039
picking up something but we don't put it
 

00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:11.499
picking up something but we don't put it
on the lock screen because it's not

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:11.509
on the lock screen because it's not
 

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:12.729
on the lock screen because it's not
important enough to like bother you

00:12:12.729 --> 00:12:12.739
important enough to like bother you
 

00:12:12.739 --> 00:12:13.599
important enough to like bother you
while you want on your way somewhere

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:13.609
while you want on your way somewhere
 

00:12:13.609 --> 00:12:16.509
while you want on your way somewhere
else but the the mists instant message

00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519
else but the the mists instant message
 

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:18.039
else but the the mists instant message
yeah I might I don't want to know about

00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:18.049
yeah I might I don't want to know about
 

00:12:18.049 --> 00:12:19.839
yeah I might I don't want to know about
that I don't know I missed it

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:19.849
that I don't know I missed it
 

00:12:19.849 --> 00:12:22.929
that I don't know I missed it
so another place that minimum priority

00:12:22.929 --> 00:12:22.939
so another place that minimum priority
 

00:12:22.939 --> 00:12:24.219
so another place that minimum priority
notifications don't show up is the top

00:12:24.219 --> 00:12:24.229
notifications don't show up is the top
 

00:12:24.229 --> 00:12:26.409
notifications don't show up is the top
here so you'll notice the status bar has

00:12:26.409 --> 00:12:26.419
here so you'll notice the status bar has
 

00:12:26.419 --> 00:12:29.859
here so you'll notice the status bar has
one chat icon there is no file upload

00:12:29.859 --> 00:12:29.869
one chat icon there is no file upload
 

00:12:29.869 --> 00:12:31.419
one chat icon there is no file upload
icon right so it's another way that

00:12:31.419 --> 00:12:31.429
icon right so it's another way that
 

00:12:31.429 --> 00:12:33.519
icon right so it's another way that
while the users on their way somewhere

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:33.529
while the users on their way somewhere
 

00:12:33.529 --> 00:12:36.009
while the users on their way somewhere
else you don't necessarily want to

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:36.019
else you don't necessarily want to
 

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:37.929
else you don't necessarily want to
bother them with this update that maybe

00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:37.939
bother them with this update that maybe
 

00:12:37.939 --> 00:12:43.739
bother them with this update that maybe
not maybe not critical another way to

00:12:43.739 --> 00:12:43.749
 

00:12:43.749 --> 00:12:45.909
get the user the information they need

00:12:45.909 --> 00:12:45.919
get the user the information they need
 

00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:48.399
get the user the information they need
is to use this thing called set alert

00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:48.409
is to use this thing called set alert
 

00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:51.069
is to use this thing called set alert
once set only alert once nothing days

00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:51.079
once set only alert once nothing days
 

00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:53.679
once set only alert once nothing days
use that yeah so okay so you should be

00:12:53.679 --> 00:12:53.689
use that yeah so okay so you should be
 

00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:55.649
use that yeah so okay so you should be
using it so this is a situation where

00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:55.659
using it so this is a situation where
 

00:12:55.659 --> 00:12:57.999
using it so this is a situation where
again it's not an it's not an instant

00:12:57.999 --> 00:12:58.009
again it's not an it's not an instant
 

00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:59.199
again it's not an it's not an instant
message notification OTT one that I'm

00:12:59.199 --> 00:12:59.209
message notification OTT one that I'm
 

00:12:59.209 --> 00:13:00.519
message notification OTT one that I'm
gonna like I hear the beep and I pull my

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:00.529
gonna like I hear the beep and I pull my
 

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:01.779
gonna like I hear the beep and I pull my
phone out and look at it right away

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:01.789
phone out and look at it right away
 

00:13:01.789 --> 00:13:03.249
phone out and look at it right away
it might be something like what's the

00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:03.259
it might be something like what's the
 

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:07.469
it might be something like what's the
weather or what's latest stock boat or

00:13:07.469 --> 00:13:07.479
weather or what's latest stock boat or
 

00:13:07.479 --> 00:13:11.259
weather or what's latest stock boat or
you know how far away something those

00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:11.269
you know how far away something those
 

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:12.039
you know how far away something those
are the kind of things where you're not

00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:12.049
are the kind of things where you're not
 

00:13:12.049 --> 00:13:13.390
are the kind of things where you're not
gonna alert the user you don't have any

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:13.400
gonna alert the user you don't have any
 

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.560
gonna alert the user you don't have any
finally information to give them but you

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:14.570
finally information to give them but you
 

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.760
finally information to give them but you
have information they might be able to

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:15.770
have information they might be able to
 

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.560
have information they might be able to
take advantage of if they happen to see

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:17.570
take advantage of if they happen to see
 

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.580
take advantage of if they happen to see
it and this is a way if for example you

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:21.590
it and this is a way if for example you
 

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.660
it and this is a way if for example you
did want to alert them that you were

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:22.670
did want to alert them that you were
 

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.950
did want to alert them that you were
posting it but you do want to keep

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:23.960
posting it but you do want to keep
 

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.210
posting it but you do want to keep
bothering them while you're updating it

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:25.220
bothering them while you're updating it
 

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.010
bothering them while you're updating it
you can update it in the background so

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:27.020
you can update it in the background so
 

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.170
you can update it in the background so
set only alert once says don't make

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:29.180
set only alert once says don't make
 

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.120
set only alert once says don't make
noise again if you've already made noise

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.130
noise again if you've already made noise
 

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.700
noise again if you've already made noise
don't do it again and then the system

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:33.710
don't do it again and then the system
 

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:34.480
don't do it again and then the system
tracks that because that's something

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:34.490
tracks that because that's something
 

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.740
tracks that because that's something
that would be difficult for you to track

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:35.750
that would be difficult for you to track
 

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.340
that would be difficult for you to track

this instant message we keep seeing a
lot of the notifications you're gonna

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:46.850
lot of the notifications you're gonna
 

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.280
lot of the notifications you're gonna
see on my screen shots are from an

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:48.290
see on my screen shots are from an
 

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.780
see on my screen shots are from an
example app and I have a link to the

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:49.790
example app and I have a link to the
 

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.230
example app and I have a link to the

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:56.900
myself
 

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.900
myself
so I'll be working on something and I'll

00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:58.910
so I'll be working on something and I'll
 

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.180
so I'll be working on something and I'll
forget and I'll run the test app and

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:01.190
forget and I'll run the test app and
 

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.070
forget and I'll run the test app and
look at it and I'll go home and I'll

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:03.080
look at it and I'll go home and I'll
 

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.390
look at it and I'll go home and I'll
come back the next day and they'll be

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:04.400
come back the next day and they'll be
 

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.770
come back the next day and they'll be
like oh my gosh I'm like I missed a

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:05.780
like oh my gosh I'm like I missed a
 

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.270
like oh my gosh I'm like I missed a
thing from Mike or I missed a call from

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:07.280
thing from Mike or I missed a call from
 

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.080
thing from Mike or I missed a call from
whoever or whatever okay so there's this

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.090
whoever or whatever okay so there's this
 

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.940
whoever or whatever okay so there's this
notion of stale notifications when we go

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:12.950
notion of stale notifications when we go
 

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.710
notion of stale notifications when we go
talk to people we see you know they'll

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720
talk to people we see you know they'll
 

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.030
talk to people we see you know they'll
pull down their shade and let me like

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040
pull down their shade and let me like
 

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.180
pull down their shade and let me like
ten notifications from this app the most

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:19.190
ten notifications from this app the most
 

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.740
ten notifications from this app the most
recent which was useful but the other

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:20.750
recent which was useful but the other
 

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.380
recent which was useful but the other
ones are totally not so you should this

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:23.390
ones are totally not so you should this
 

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.090
ones are totally not so you should this
is very easy you should just cancel them

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:25.100
is very easy you should just cancel them
 

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.130
is very easy you should just cancel them
out right if you think that you've

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:27.140
out right if you think that you've
 

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.930
out right if you think that you've
posted information that the user isn't

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:28.940
posted information that the user isn't
 

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.510
posted information that the user isn't
going to care about an hour from now

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:30.520
going to care about an hour from now
 

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.830
going to care about an hour from now
don't show it to them right get out of

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:32.840
don't show it to them right get out of
 

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.720
don't show it to them right get out of
their face their attention is worth more

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:34.730
their face their attention is worth more
 

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.940
their face their attention is worth more
than than your extra effort for coding

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:36.950
than than your extra effort for coding
 

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.320
than than your extra effort for coding
right so you can do them that favor and

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:38.330
right so you can do them that favor and
 

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.720
right so you can do them that favor and
they will appreciate it so that's one

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:40.730
they will appreciate it so that's one
 

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.280
they will appreciate it so that's one
thing you do so this is the this is the

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:42.290
thing you do so this is the this is the
 

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.830
thing you do so this is the this is the
alarm service it's again existed back

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:44.840
alarm service it's again existed back
 

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.230
alarm service it's again existed back
from the beginning of Android and so in

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240
from the beginning of Android and so in
 

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.150
from the beginning of Android and so in
this case I would craft this little

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160
this case I would craft this little
 

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.790
this case I would craft this little
pending attempt which in this in this

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800
pending attempt which in this in this
 

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.260
pending attempt which in this in this
instance to the code sort of indicates

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:53.270
instance to the code sort of indicates
 

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.760
instance to the code sort of indicates
that it may cancel all my notifications

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:54.770
that it may cancel all my notifications
 

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.490
that it may cancel all my notifications
so I call no man cancel all if you want

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:57.500
so I call no man cancel all if you want
 

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.870
so I call no man cancel all if you want
to track individual notifications you

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880
to track individual notifications you
 

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.100
to track individual notifications you
would just make a pending intent with

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:00.110
would just make a pending intent with
 

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:05.650
would just make a pending intent with
the ID for example okay so I've been

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:05.660
the ID for example okay so I've been
 

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.730
the ID for example okay so I've been
talking about how to get out of the

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:06.740
talking about how to get out of the
 

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.460
talking about how to get out of the
user's way sometimes you do need to get

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:09.470
user's way sometimes you do need to get
 

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.600
user's way sometimes you do need to get
in the users where you need to alert

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:10.610
in the users where you need to alert
 

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.210
in the users where you need to alert
them so we should talk about that a

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:13.220
them so we should talk about that a
 

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.260
them so we should talk about that a
little bit okay so this is another

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:17.270
little bit okay so this is another
 

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.170
little bit okay so this is another
situation where the system UI is helping

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:20.180
situation where the system UI is helping
 

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.920
situation where the system UI is helping
you so it used to be the case that if

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:23.930
you so it used to be the case that if
 

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.769
you so it used to be the case that if
you were reading a book on Android and

00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:25.779
you were reading a book on Android and
 

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:28.860
you were reading a book on Android and
got a phone call he kind of got smacked

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:28.870
got a phone call he kind of got smacked
 

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.329
got a phone call he kind of got smacked
in the face with who would the resulting

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:30.339
in the face with who would the resulting
 

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:32.939
in the face with who would the resulting
activity right make me blah right so

00:15:32.939 --> 00:15:32.949
activity right make me blah right so
 

00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:34.079
activity right make me blah right so
you're reading away and you're focused

00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:34.089
you're reading away and you're focused
 

00:15:34.089 --> 00:15:35.730
you're reading away and you're focused
and all sudden this phone call comes in

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:35.740
and all sudden this phone call comes in
 

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.840
and all sudden this phone call comes in
and the person who called you didn't

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:36.850
and the person who called you didn't
 

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.220
and the person who called you didn't
know that they were gonna interrupt

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:38.230
know that they were gonna interrupt
 

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.639
know that they were gonna interrupt
something

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:38.649
something
 

00:15:38.649 --> 00:15:39.869
something
or maybe you were playing a game even

00:15:39.869 --> 00:15:39.879
or maybe you were playing a game even
 

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:40.980
or maybe you were playing a game even
right like he could have been playing a

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:40.990
right like he could have been playing a
 

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:42.179
right like he could have been playing a
game about to get a high score and then

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:42.189
game about to get a high score and then
 

00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:45.689
game about to get a high score and then
ba right so that's not good

00:15:45.689 --> 00:15:45.699
ba right so that's not good
 

00:15:45.699 --> 00:15:49.079
ba right so that's not good
so one thing we did in lollipop is we

00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:49.089
so one thing we did in lollipop is we
 

00:15:49.089 --> 00:15:50.910
so one thing we did in lollipop is we
introduced this idea of a peek so

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920
introduced this idea of a peek so
 

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.920
introduced this idea of a peek so
there's a peeking notification so the

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:52.930
there's a peeking notification so the
 

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.150
there's a peeking notification so the
nice thing about this is that the user

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160
nice thing about this is that the user
 

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.920
nice thing about this is that the user
doesn't get pulled out of their task so

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:55.930
doesn't get pulled out of their task so
 

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.509
doesn't get pulled out of their task so
attention sometimes is about focus

00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519
attention sometimes is about focus
 

00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:00.540
attention sometimes is about focus
sometimes about tasks and because you

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:00.550
sometimes about tasks and because you
 

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.429
sometimes about tasks and because you
don't know what task they're in this is

00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:02.439
don't know what task they're in this is
 

00:16:02.439 --> 00:16:04.980
don't know what task they're in this is
something the system will help you do so

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:04.990
something the system will help you do so
 

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:06.299
something the system will help you do so
in this case in this example the phone

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:06.309
in this case in this example the phone
 

00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:08.519
in this case in this example the phone
call comes in the user gets a chance to

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:08.529
call comes in the user gets a chance to
 

00:16:08.529 --> 00:16:10.170
call comes in the user gets a chance to
maybe finish the sentence they were

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:10.180
maybe finish the sentence they were
 

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.939
maybe finish the sentence they were
reading and then answer it or ignore it

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:11.949
reading and then answer it or ignore it
 

00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:14.249
reading and then answer it or ignore it
or whatever they want to do and what we

00:16:14.249 --> 00:16:14.259
or whatever they want to do and what we
 

00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:18.420
or whatever they want to do and what we
realized was that it was still an

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:18.430
realized was that it was still an
 

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.569
realized was that it was still an
interruption if you're reading to hear

00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:21.579
interruption if you're reading to hear
 

00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:23.730
interruption if you're reading to hear
the noise even if it wasn't a phone call

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:23.740
the noise even if it wasn't a phone call
 

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:24.840
the noise even if it wasn't a phone call
let's say was just an instant message so

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:24.850
let's say was just an instant message so
 

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.220
let's say was just an instant message so
you're reading or planning game in here

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:26.230
you're reading or planning game in here
 

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.369
you're reading or planning game in here
put it like ah I need to go see what

00:16:29.369 --> 00:16:29.379
put it like ah I need to go see what
 

00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:30.840
put it like ah I need to go see what
that was like it might've been something

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:30.850
that was like it might've been something
 

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:31.920
that was like it might've been something
important and then you go see what it

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:31.930
important and then you go see what it
 

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:32.910
important and then you go see what it
was and turns out well anything

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920
was and turns out well anything
 

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.579
was and turns out well anything
important so what we what we did is we

00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:35.589
important so what we what we did is we
 

00:16:35.589 --> 00:16:38.970

allowed high priority notifications to

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:38.980
allowed high priority notifications to
 

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.230
allowed high priority notifications to
bubble up into this space so you can

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.240
bubble up into this space so you can
 

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.540
bubble up into this space so you can
elect to use this space by setting your

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:45.550
elect to use this space by setting your
 

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.549
elect to use this space by setting your
priority high so this is another way in

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:47.559
priority high so this is another way in
 

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:48.960
priority high so this is another way in
which priority changes the way you're

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:48.970
which priority changes the way you're
 

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.290
which priority changes the way you're

might be looking for it cuz they may not

00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559
might be looking for it cuz they may not
 

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:47.920

whatever and they don't even think about

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.050
whatever and they don't even think about

whatever and they don't even think about
it

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:51.980
it
 

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.310
it
but for example in this case we surface

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320
but for example in this case we surface
 

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.450
but for example in this case we surface
it right in the long press so they can

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:55.460
it right in the long press so they can
 

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.340
it right in the long press so they can
say I don't like that notification and

surface will show them to the user and
that'll take them directly deep into

that'll take them directly deep into
 

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.480
that'll take them directly deep into
your app and then they can do all the

something and I think that the key idea
 

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.000
something and I think that the key idea
there is that any time the user tells

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.010
there is that any time the user tells
 

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.470

so any chance you get where they give
 

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.430
so any chance you get where they give
you their preferences you should

definitely treat those something to save
 

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.110
definitely treat those something to save
and cherish and back it up and restore

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120
and cherish and back it up and restore
 

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.860

it and make sure it's still there okay

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:11.870
it and make sure it's still there okay
 

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:16.930
it and make sure it's still there okay
so if you don't have a settings activity

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:16.940
so if you don't have a settings activity
 

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.250

for your notifications and you should

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:18.260
for your notifications and you should
 

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.110
for your notifications and you should
this is how it looks so it turns out

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:20.120
this is how it looks so it turns out
 

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.240
this is how it looks so it turns out
it's really easy I told you I was

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:22.250
it's really easy I told you I was
 

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.260
it's really easy I told you I was
climbing the same mountain as you

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:23.270
climbing the same mountain as you
 

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.490
climbing the same mountain as you
actually had never written the

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:24.500
actually had never written the
 

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.860
actually had never written the
preference pill so I learned this with

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:26.870
preference pill so I learned this with
 

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.620
preference pill so I learned this with
the talk but you write some xml's

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:29.630
the talk but you write some xml's
 

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.390
the talk but you write some xml's
checkbox preference so this in

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400
checkbox preference so this in
 

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.350
checkbox preference so this in
particular controls my example app like

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360
particular controls my example app like
 

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.110
particular controls my example app like
a I want my example SMS to make noise or

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120
a I want my example SMS to make noise or
 

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.150
a I want my example SMS to make noise or
not so this is sort of what the XML

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:40.160
not so this is sort of what the XML
 

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.330
not so this is sort of what the XML
looks like and then very simply you just

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:43.340
looks like and then very simply you just
 

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.330
looks like and then very simply you just
pull it out of preferences and if it's

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:46.340
pull it out of preferences and if it's
 

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.100
pull it out of preferences and if it's
not true you don't you don't set the

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.110
not true you don't you don't set the
 

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.200
not true you don't you don't set the
sound right so that's that's pretty easy

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:50.210
sound right so that's that's pretty easy
 

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.460
sound right so that's that's pretty easy
so we should be doing this definitely

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:53.470
so we should be doing this definitely
 

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.740
so we should be doing this definitely
okay the other way to empower the users

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:55.750
okay the other way to empower the users
 

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.869
okay the other way to empower the users
is to like I said they should be able

00:21:57.869 --> 00:21:57.879
is to like I said they should be able
 

00:21:57.879 --> 00:21:59.580
is to like I said they should be able
notification should be actionable

00:21:59.580 --> 00:21:59.590
notification should be actionable
 

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.169
notification should be actionable
so obviously you should add actions to

00:22:01.169 --> 00:22:01.179
so obviously you should add actions to
 

00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:05.430
so obviously you should add actions to
them so actions are this way to add more

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440
them so actions are this way to add more
 

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.860
them so actions are this way to add more
than one intent to a notification so

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:07.870
than one intent to a notification so
 

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.180
than one intent to a notification so
normally you would click on the

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:09.190
normally you would click on the
 

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.860
normally you would click on the
notification it would take you far and

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:10.870
notification it would take you far and
 

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.539
notification it would take you far and
intent usually that just opens your app

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:12.549
intent usually that just opens your app
 

00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:14.399
intent usually that just opens your app
and drops you in the appropriate context

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:14.409
and drops you in the appropriate context
 

00:22:14.409 --> 00:22:18.749
and drops you in the appropriate context
to see the thing but sometimes the user

00:22:18.749 --> 00:22:18.759
to see the thing but sometimes the user
 

00:22:18.759 --> 00:22:19.889
to see the thing but sometimes the user
might be able to make a decision from

00:22:19.889 --> 00:22:19.899
might be able to make a decision from
 

00:22:19.899 --> 00:22:21.779
might be able to make a decision from
the shade and that for the user

00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:21.789
the shade and that for the user
 

00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:23.399
the shade and that for the user
perspective that's much better

00:22:23.399 --> 00:22:23.409
perspective that's much better
 

00:22:23.409 --> 00:22:25.909
perspective that's much better
right so in this case an incoming call I

00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919
right so in this case an incoming call I
 

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:28.710
right so in this case an incoming call I
can add an action button that lets me

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720
can add an action button that lets me
 

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.529
can add an action button that lets me
drop the call right and now imagine that

00:22:31.529 --> 00:22:31.539
drop the call right and now imagine that
 

00:22:31.539 --> 00:22:33.299
drop the call right and now imagine that
this is in the peak it slid down I'm

00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:33.309
this is in the peak it slid down I'm
 

00:22:33.309 --> 00:22:34.889
this is in the peak it slid down I'm
reading I'm playing a game or something

00:22:34.889 --> 00:22:34.899
reading I'm playing a game or something
 

00:22:34.899 --> 00:22:35.549
reading I'm playing a game or something
I don't want to talk to that person

00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559
I don't want to talk to that person
 

00:22:35.559 --> 00:22:37.440
I don't want to talk to that person
ignore I didn't even have to leave the

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:37.450
ignore I didn't even have to leave the
 

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.149
ignore I didn't even have to leave the
game right so if I had to click on the

00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159
game right so if I had to click on the
 

00:22:39.159 --> 00:22:40.769
game right so if I had to click on the
notification go into the phone app and

00:22:40.769 --> 00:22:40.779
notification go into the phone app and
 

00:22:40.779 --> 00:22:42.119
notification go into the phone app and
now I'm in a different context and I've

00:22:42.119 --> 00:22:42.129
now I'm in a different context and I've
 

00:22:42.129 --> 00:22:44.850
now I'm in a different context and I've
lost like my sort of mental space back

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:44.860
lost like my sort of mental space back
 

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.490
lost like my sort of mental space back
there like to go back to it so this is

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:47.500
there like to go back to it so this is
 

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.619
there like to go back to it so this is
something you definitely do the users do

00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:49.629
something you definitely do the users do
 

00:22:49.629 --> 00:22:52.139
something you definitely do the users do
for the users to give them more choices

00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:52.149
for the users to give them more choices
 

00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:54.269
for the users to give them more choices
and give them more actionable

00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:54.279
and give them more actionable
 

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:56.700
and give them more actionable
notifications and this is how you add

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:56.710
notifications and this is how you add
 

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.369
notifications and this is how you add
them this is actually I think the

00:22:59.369 --> 00:22:59.379
them this is actually I think the
 

00:22:59.379 --> 00:23:00.869
them this is actually I think the
deprecated call but it fits on the slide

00:23:00.869 --> 00:23:00.879
deprecated call but it fits on the slide
 

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.970
deprecated call but it fits on the slide
so if you try to do this it'll tell you

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:02.980
so if you try to do this it'll tell you
 

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.710
so if you try to do this it'll tell you
to do something else slightly different

more actions you add the smaller the

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:24.820
more actions you add the smaller the
 

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.759
more actions you add the smaller the

your again using the Builder pattern you

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:17.860
your again using the Builder pattern you
 

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.070
your again using the Builder pattern you
would build your notification and that

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080
would build your notification and that
 

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.560
would build your notification and that
would render is a small regular

picture style that all it it just wraps
 

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:34.500
picture style that all it it just wraps
the bitmap and then there's a text

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:34.510
the bitmap and then there's a text
 

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.240
the bitmap and then there's a text
example the same sort of thing you can

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:36.250
example the same sort of thing you can
 

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.180
example the same sort of thing you can
wrap the text example and this is again

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:39.190
wrap the text example and this is again
 

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.690

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.560
devices getting a little complicated but
if you're already creating this problem

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:19.570
if you're already creating this problem
 

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.030
if you're already creating this problem
you almost certainly have a server

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:21.040
you almost certainly have a server
 

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.680
you almost certainly have a server
that's that's causing these events to

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:22.690
that's that's causing these events to
 

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.560
that's that's causing these events to
come out and probably you're using GCM

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:25.570
come out and probably you're using GCM
 

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.320
come out and probably you're using GCM
so if you're already doing that then the

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.330
so if you're already doing that then the
 

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:29.970
so if you're already doing that then the
flow is pretty simple the server does

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:29.980
flow is pretty simple the server does
 

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.070
flow is pretty simple the server does
some event happens somebody creates a

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080
some event happens somebody creates a
 

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.260
some event happens somebody creates a
calendar event it sends over a shot to

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:34.270
calendar event it sends over a shot to
 

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.980
calendar event it sends over a shot to
the two devices they post notifications

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:36.990
the two devices they post notifications
 

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.230
the two devices they post notifications
you catch the dismiss intent so you know

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240
you catch the dismiss intent so you know
 

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.820
you catch the dismiss intent so you know
how to set the I'll show you in a second

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:41.830
how to set the I'll show you in a second
 

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.550
how to set the I'll show you in a second
how you set a dismiss dismiss pending

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:44.560
how you set a dismiss dismiss pending
 

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.040
how you set a dismiss dismiss pending
intent so that the person dismisses the

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.050
intent so that the person dismisses the
 

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:48.300
intent so that the person dismisses the
intent the application gets that

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:48.310
intent the application gets that
 

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.520
intent the application gets that
callback it sends the GCM message at

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:50.530
callback it sends the GCM message at
 

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.620
callback it sends the GCM message at
server and says hey is dismissed and the

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:52.630
server and says hey is dismissed and the
 

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.510
server and says hey is dismissed and the
server says oh well I should send that

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520
server says oh well I should send that
 

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.860
server says oh well I should send that
out to all the rest of them so it sends

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:55.870
out to all the rest of them so it sends
 

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.960
out to all the rest of them so it sends
it all their devices again and the phone

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:57.970
it all their devices again and the phone
 

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:58.830
it all their devices again and the phone
says I already got it

00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840
says I already got it
 

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.570
says I already got it
but the tablet's like oh that's good

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:00.580
but the tablet's like oh that's good
 

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.680
but the tablet's like oh that's good
information I'll cancel that

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:01.690
information I'll cancel that
 

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.030
information I'll cancel that
notification so the user doesn't have to

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:03.040
notification so the user doesn't have to
 

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.030
notification so the user doesn't have to
worry about it okay so this is how you

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:06.040
worry about it okay so this is how you
 

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.360
worry about it okay so this is how you
do it so in your GCM again if you're

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:09.370
do it so in your GCM again if you're
 

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:10.410
do it so in your GCM again if you're
creating this problem you're probably

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:10.420
creating this problem you're probably
 

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.640
creating this problem you're probably
already using GCM in your GCM handlers

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:13.650
already using GCM in your GCM handlers
 

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.230
already using GCM in your GCM handlers
you just add a clause that says you know

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240
you just add a clause that says you know
 

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.360
you just add a clause that says you know
you have to come up with some API for

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:18.370
you have to come up with some API for
 

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.760
you have to come up with some API for
yourself but post sounds like a good one

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:20.770
yourself but post sounds like a good one
 

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.770
yourself but post sounds like a good one
and the key bit information here is that

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:22.780
and the key bit information here is that
 

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.710
and the key bit information here is that
the post message from the server will

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720
the post message from the server will
 

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.750
the post message from the server will
include some sort of unique ID you know

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760
include some sort of unique ID you know
 

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.030
include some sort of unique ID you know
you heard about this in the previous

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:30.040
you heard about this in the previous
 

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.510
you heard about this in the previous
talk where you have this this the server

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520
talk where you have this this the server
 

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.070
talk where you have this this the server
managing these unique IDs so you can

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080
managing these unique IDs so you can
 

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.150
managing these unique IDs so you can
refer to things so this is the same

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:36.160
refer to things so this is the same
 

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.620
refer to things so this is the same
thing servers going to send down at

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:37.630
thing servers going to send down at
 

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.850
thing servers going to send down at
unique ideas so that all the devices

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:38.860
unique ideas so that all the devices
 

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.250
unique ideas so that all the devices
agree and then the deutsches

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:41.260
agree and then the deutsches
 

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.780
agree and then the deutsches
independently are going to create these

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:42.790
independently are going to create these
 

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.820
independently are going to create these
delete intents so this is basically a

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:44.830
delete intents so this is basically a
 

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.610
delete intents so this is basically a
pending intent wrapper around this

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:47.620
pending intent wrapper around this
 

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.340
pending intent wrapper around this
unique ID and then it's going to post

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:50.350
unique ID and then it's going to post
 

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:55.730
unique ID and then it's going to post
the notification okay so when when the

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740
the notification okay so when when the
 

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.270
the notification okay so when when the
notifications dismissed

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:57.280
notifications dismissed
 

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.310
notifications dismissed
there'll be some intent service you have

00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320
there'll be some intent service you have
 

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.940
there'll be some intent service you have
and depending a tab will fire into that

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:02.950
and depending a tab will fire into that
 

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.670
and depending a tab will fire into that
service and you'll have a dismiss action

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:05.680
service and you'll have a dismiss action
 

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.280
service and you'll have a dismiss action
and you pull out that unique ID because

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:08.290
and you pull out that unique ID because
 

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:09.450
and you pull out that unique ID because
I'll you have it back in your hand right

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:09.460
I'll you have it back in your hand right
 

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.530
I'll you have it back in your hand right
you don't really have to save it

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:10.540
you don't really have to save it
 

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.960
you don't really have to save it
anywhere it's sort of as part of this

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:12.970
anywhere it's sort of as part of this
 

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.910
anywhere it's sort of as part of this
state okay so then you build your

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:14.920
state okay so then you build your
 

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.620
state okay so then you build your
message send it off again if you're

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:16.630
message send it off again if you're
 

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:17.970
message send it off again if you're
using GCM there's well there's more

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:17.980
using GCM there's well there's more
 

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.140
using GCM there's well there's more
stuff around this but you probably

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:19.150
stuff around this but you probably
 

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.580
stuff around this but you probably
already have it so this is just a couple

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:20.590
already have it so this is just a couple
 

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:24.450
already have it so this is just a couple
lines to add and then again back in the

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:24.460
lines to add and then again back in the
 

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.530
lines to add and then again back in the
receive we already have our post

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:25.540
receive we already have our post
 

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.540
receive we already have our post
receiver we're just gonna add a cancel

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:27.550
receiver we're just gonna add a cancel
 

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.120
receiver we're just gonna add a cancel
receiver and again we'll get the unique

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:30.130
receiver and again we'll get the unique
 

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:32.220
receiver and again we'll get the unique
ID in this very simple sample we're

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:32.230
ID in this very simple sample we're
 

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:33.160
ID in this very simple sample we're
using the

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:33.170
using the
 

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.050
using the
as the notification I do so I can just

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:35.060
as the notification I do so I can just
 

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.820
as the notification I do so I can just
call directly into no man to take cancer

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:36.830
call directly into no man to take cancer
 

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:40.030
call directly into no man to take cancer
that you can imagine a situation we do

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:40.040
that you can imagine a situation we do
 

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.920
that you can imagine a situation we do
it look up and mash keys or something

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:41.930
it look up and mash keys or something
 

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:46.480
it look up and mash keys or something
more complicated okay so the last thing

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:46.490
more complicated okay so the last thing
 

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.150
more complicated okay so the last thing
in this section is about ongoing

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:49.160
in this section is about ongoing
 

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.450
in this section is about ongoing
notifications so ongoing notifications

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:52.460
notifications so ongoing notifications
 

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.520
notifications so ongoing notifications
are these things that you cannot dismiss

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:54.530
are these things that you cannot dismiss
 

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.440
are these things that you cannot dismiss
right you sort of swipe em they're stuck

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:56.450
right you sort of swipe em they're stuck
 

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.480
right you sort of swipe em they're stuck
there and this sounds like a great idea

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:58.490
there and this sounds like a great idea
 

00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:59.980
there and this sounds like a great idea
right like I can pin something to the

00:28:59.980 --> 00:28:59.990
right like I can pin something to the
 

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.960
right like I can pin something to the
top and make it unless miss Abul and

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:01.970
top and make it unless miss Abul and
 

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:05.470
top and make it unless miss Abul and
then I've always got that spot it turns

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:05.480
then I've always got that spot it turns
 

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.860
then I've always got that spot it turns
out that this really annoys users so

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:07.870
out that this really annoys users so
 

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.570
out that this really annoys users so
there are how many do we hear like 1.4

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:10.580
there are how many do we hear like 1.4
 

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.090
there are how many do we hear like 1.4
billion users a lot of them are not like

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:13.100
billion users a lot of them are not like
 

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.040
billion users a lot of them are not like
you and they use their phones in ways

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.050
you and they use their phones in ways
 

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:16.600
you and they use their phones in ways
that you have you would never have

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:16.610
that you have you would never have
 

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.010
that you have you would never have
predicted and so there's a lot of

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:18.020
predicted and so there's a lot of
 

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.720
predicted and so there's a lot of
different workflows that people use in

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:19.730
different workflows that people use in
 

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.690
different workflows that people use in
the shade and one of them for example is

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:22.700
the shade and one of them for example is
 

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.150
the shade and one of them for example is
to just deal with the top thing you deal

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:25.160
to just deal with the top thing you deal
 

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.350
to just deal with the top thing you deal
with it get rid of it deal with it

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360
with it get rid of it deal with it
 

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.700
with it get rid of it deal with it
you're out of it the nice thing is that

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:27.710
you're out of it the nice thing is that
 

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.080
you're out of it the nice thing is that
the next one pops up automatically and

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:29.090
the next one pops up automatically and
 

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:30.760
the next one pops up automatically and
you get the action buttons out and the

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:30.770
you get the action buttons out and the
 

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.940
you get the action buttons out and the
full view right so in some sense the

appropriate metadata that tells us about
the people there's a we we tried to make

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:15.380
the people there's a we we tried to make
 

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.749
the people there's a we we tried to make
this easy possible so we gave you a lots

00:36:16.749 --> 00:36:16.759

00:36:16.759 --> 00:36:18.309
this easy possible so we gave you a lots
of different ways we accept many

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319
of different ways we accept many
 

00:36:18.319 --> 00:36:21.549
of different ways we accept many
different kinds of you our eyes so in

00:36:21.549 --> 00:36:21.559
different kinds of you our eyes so in
 

00:36:21.559 --> 00:36:23.650
different kinds of you our eyes so in
the most simplest level if you use

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:23.660
the most simplest level if you use
 

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.180
the most simplest level if you use
telephone numbers as an identifier which

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:25.190
telephone numbers as an identifier which
 

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:28.720
telephone numbers as an identifier which
people do just give us that that's it so

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:28.730
people do just give us that that's it so
 

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.940
people do just give us that that's it so
if the person is important to me it is

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:30.950
if the person is important to me it is
 

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.109
if the person is important to me it is
almost certainly the case with their

00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:32.119
almost certainly the case with their
 

00:36:32.119 --> 00:36:33.460
almost certainly the case with their
phone number ended up in my contacts

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:33.470
phone number ended up in my contacts
 

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.170
phone number ended up in my contacts
somehow but you may not have put it

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:35.180
somehow but you may not have put it
 

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.440
somehow but you may not have put it
there but somebody did maybe I did so if

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:38.450
there but somebody did maybe I did so if
 

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.329
there but somebody did maybe I did so if
you have if that's all you have don't

00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:40.339
you have if that's all you have don't
 

00:36:40.339 --> 00:36:42.640
you have if that's all you have don't
ask for contacts permission just give us

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:42.650
ask for contacts permission just give us
 

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:44.950
ask for contacts permission just give us
that and we'll check it and it doesn't

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960
that and we'll check it and it doesn't
 

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.089
that and we'll check it and it doesn't
hurt to add it if they have that

00:36:46.089 --> 00:36:46.099
hurt to add it if they have that
 

00:36:46.099 --> 00:36:47.559
hurt to add it if they have that
person's not in contact so you won't do

00:36:47.559 --> 00:36:47.569
person's not in contact so you won't do
 

00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:49.599
person's not in contact so you won't do
anything right doesn't matter

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:49.609
anything right doesn't matter
 

00:36:49.609 --> 00:36:51.220
anything right doesn't matter
and then also same thing if you have an

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:51.230
and then also same thing if you have an
 

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:53.799
and then also same thing if you have an
email address you can do that so if you

00:36:53.799 --> 00:36:53.809
email address you can do that so if you
 

00:36:53.809 --> 00:36:56.170
email address you can do that so if you
send us mail to URI will see that we'll

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:56.180
send us mail to URI will see that we'll
 

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.940
send us mail to URI will see that we'll
say oh I wonder if that email address is

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:57.950
say oh I wonder if that email address is
 

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:01.019
say oh I wonder if that email address is
what we know about we'll look it up okay

00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:01.029
what we know about we'll look it up okay
 

00:37:01.029 --> 00:37:03.430
what we know about we'll look it up okay
and the last one is more complicated so

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440
and the last one is more complicated so
 

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.230
and the last one is more complicated so
if you're already dealing with the

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240
if you're already dealing with the
 

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.670
if you're already dealing with the
contacts database for some reason let

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:06.680
contacts database for some reason let
 

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.839
contacts database for some reason let
your social app and you're doing

00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:07.849
your social app and you're doing
 

00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:09.309
your social app and you're doing
contacts thinking or whatever you

00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:09.319
contacts thinking or whatever you
 

00:37:09.319 --> 00:37:11.769
contacts thinking or whatever you
already have tons of code for the

00:37:11.769 --> 00:37:11.779
already have tons of code for the
 

00:37:11.779 --> 00:37:14.380
already have tons of code for the
contacts manager right so there's no

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:14.390
contacts manager right so there's no
 

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:16.509
contacts manager right so there's no
this is a highly abbreviated sample

00:37:16.509 --> 00:37:16.519
this is a highly abbreviated sample
 

00:37:16.519 --> 00:37:17.710
this is a highly abbreviated sample
because otherwise it would be like five

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720
because otherwise it would be like five
 

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.030
because otherwise it would be like five
slides but the key bits here are

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.040
slides but the key bits here are
 

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.040

when you go to do a look-up on a contact

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.050
when you go to do a look-up on a contact
 

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:25.780
when you go to do a look-up on a contact
you have to ask for this thing called

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:25.790
you have to ask for this thing called
 

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:28.210
you have to ask for this thing called
the lookup key and that's something you

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:28.220
the lookup key and that's something you
 

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.430
the lookup key and that's something you
normally wouldn't have pulled out and

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440
normally wouldn't have pulled out and
 

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.710
normally wouldn't have pulled out and
once you have it then you have the ID

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720
once you have it then you have the ID
 

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.920
once you have it then you have the ID
and the lookup key to this static

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:35.930
and the lookup key to this static
 

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:37.750
and the lookup key to this static
function called get lookup your eye and

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760
function called get lookup your eye and
 

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.580
function called get lookup your eye and
that builds a URI for you and then you

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:39.590
that builds a URI for you and then you
 

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.410
that builds a URI for you and then you
hand us that and the reason you want to

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:41.420
hand us that and the reason you want to
 

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.290
hand us that and the reason you want to
do that is because the lookup URI is

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:44.300
do that is because the lookup URI is
 

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.090
do that is because the lookup URI is
more stable to certain kinds of

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.100
more stable to certain kinds of
 

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.470
more stable to certain kinds of
rearrangements of the contacts database

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:47.480
rearrangements of the contacts database
 

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.450
rearrangements of the contacts database
so things might be moving around in the

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:49.460
so things might be moving around in the
 

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.160
so things might be moving around in the
contacts database you want to make sure

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:51.170
contacts database you want to make sure
 

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.020
contacts database you want to make sure
that you give us a URI that locks you

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:53.030
that you give us a URI that locks you
 

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.760
that you give us a URI that locks you
get back to the right person in a stable

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:54.770
get back to the right person in a stable
 

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.820
get back to the right person in a stable
way so there's all those ways to tell us

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:57.830
way so there's all those ways to tell us
 

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:03.610
way so there's all those ways to tell us
about people ok so just to recap every

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:03.620
about people ok so just to recap every
 

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.220
about people ok so just to recap every
single time you write the code

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:05.230
single time you write the code
 

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:08.500
single time you write the code
notification manager notify I want you

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:08.510

to think is the user gonna be happy
 

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.850
to think is the user gonna be happy
about this or am I gonna annoy them and

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:12.860
about this or am I gonna annoy them and
 

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.830
about this or am I gonna annoy them and
if I know them too much how long does it

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:14.840
if I know them too much how long does it
 

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.080
if I know them too much how long does it
be before they've an or install me okay

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:17.090
be before they've an or install me okay
 

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.760
be before they've an or install me okay
and that's that's like the first thing

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:22.430
the worst way to get you sample code
 

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:23.860
the worst way to get you sample code
because it's part of the framework it's

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:23.870
because it's part of the framework it's
 

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:25.070
because it's part of the framework it's
like the thing that we used

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:25.080
like the thing that we used
 

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.250
like the thing that we used
things that I believe there is an effort

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260
things that I believe there is an effort
 

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.750
things that I believe there is an effort
afoot to make it a real sample out of

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760
afoot to make it a real sample out of
 

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.220
afoot to make it a real sample out of
this I'll be helping next week probably

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:31.230
this I'll be helping next week probably
 

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:34.940
this I'll be helping next week probably
with that so this link for now you can

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:34.950
with that so this link for now you can
 

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.790
with that so this link for now you can
go look at the code and hopefully we'll

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800
go look at the code and hopefully we'll
 

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.560
go look at the code and hopefully we'll
have something a better story at some

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:39.570
have something a better story at some
 

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:49.320
have something a better story at some
point in the near future so thank you

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:49.330
 

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:52.230
tonight I talked superfast so we have

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240
tonight I talked superfast so we have
 

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.160
tonight I talked superfast so we have
some time for questions if you have

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.170
some time for questions if you have
 

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:57.210
some time for questions if you have
questions I can't see it slides up Larry

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:57.220
questions I can't see it slides up Larry
 

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:01.280
questions I can't see it slides up Larry
hi right here my question has to do with

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:01.290
hi right here my question has to do with
 

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.100
hi right here my question has to do with
what happens when the user turns off

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:04.110
what happens when the user turns off
 

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:08.250
what happens when the user turns off
notifications for an application yes so

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:08.260
notifications for an application yes so
 

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:12.660
notifications for an application yes so
if they ban the notification they just

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:12.670
if they ban the notification they just
 

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.710
if they ban the notification they just
don't get delivered basically the

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720
don't get delivered basically the
 

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.970
don't get delivered basically the
notification manager will drop them on

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:14.980
notification manager will drop them on
 

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:19.320
notification manager will drop them on
the floor right so does GCM still

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:19.330
the floor right so does GCM still
 

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.480
the floor right so does GCM still
deliver the notification the phone and

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:21.490
deliver the notification the phone and
 

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:25.140
deliver the notification the phone and
then the phone not show it or oh yes yes

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:25.150
then the phone not show it or oh yes yes
 

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.330
then the phone not show it or oh yes yes
can I get to know at the GCM level that

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:27.340
can I get to know at the GCM level that
 

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.270
can I get to know at the GCM level that
my push was reject so if you're using

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280
my push was reject so if you're using
 

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.010
my push was reject so if you're using
the GCM library it's a post your

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:32.020
the GCM library it's a post your
 

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:35.910
the GCM library it's a post your
notifications for you yeah they'll still

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920
notifications for you yeah they'll still
 

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.830
notifications for you yeah they'll still
get dropped on the floor GCM won't know

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:37.840
get dropped on the floor GCM won't know
 

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.150
get dropped on the floor GCM won't know
either because GCM is kind of inside

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:39.160
either because GCM is kind of inside
 

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.500
either because GCM is kind of inside
your package so it doesn't know anything

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:40.510
your package so it doesn't know anything
 

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.300
your package so it doesn't know anything
more than you do know but if it's sent

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:42.310
more than you do know but if it's sent
 

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.040
more than you do know but if it's sent
from my server with my server gets some

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:44.050
from my server with my server gets some
 

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:48.270
from my server with my server gets some
kind of right so my understand I maybe

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280
kind of right so my understand I maybe
 

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.500
kind of right so my understand I maybe
we should follow up afterwards but my

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:49.510
we should follow up afterwards but my
 

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.000
we should follow up afterwards but my
understanding of it is that the GCM

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:51.010
understanding of it is that the GCM
 

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:52.820
understanding of it is that the GCM
thing is a library within your package

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:52.830
thing is a library within your package
 

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.170
thing is a library within your package
so that's actually doing the posting of

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:55.180
so that's actually doing the posting of
 

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.160
so that's actually doing the posting of
the notifications like they don't get

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:56.170
the notifications like they don't get
 

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.480
the notifications like they don't get
posted by Play services they get posted

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:57.490
posted by Play services they get posted
 

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:00.180
posted by Play services they get posted
by you and so they I think there's no

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:00.190
by you and so they I think there's no
 

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:01.800
by you and so they I think there's no
information there I don't think GCM

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:01.810
information there I don't think GCM
 

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.930
information there I don't think GCM
would be able to know I'm specifically

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:03.940
would be able to know I'm specifically
 

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.060
would be able to know I'm specifically
asking about notification that my

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.070
asking about notification that my
 

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:06.720
asking about notification that my
back-end

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:06.730
back-end
 

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.240
back-end
will send to their device using GCM oh I

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:09.250
will send to their device using GCM oh I
 

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:10.890
will send to their device using GCM oh I
see so that's yeah the user doesn't know

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:10.900
see so that's yeah the user doesn't know
 

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.390
see so that's yeah the user doesn't know
about those that's not a user feature so

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400
about those that's not a user feature so
 

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.040
about those that's not a user feature so
they wouldn't block those that's a it's

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:14.050
they wouldn't block those that's a it's
 

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:15.780
they wouldn't block those that's a it's
a may be a releasing the term

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:15.790
a may be a releasing the term
 

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:17.580
a may be a releasing the term
notification so the message that comes

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:17.590
notification so the message that comes
 

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.460
notification so the message that comes
from GCM is a back-end thing the user

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:20.470
from GCM is a back-end thing the user
 

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:23.010
from GCM is a back-end thing the user
has no sort of visibility into that at

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:23.020
has no sort of visibility into that at
 

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.170
has no sort of visibility into that at
all really notification blocking is

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:25.180
all really notification blocking is
 

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.450
all really notification blocking is
about the UI in the shade where their

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:27.460
about the UI in the shade where their
 

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.290
about the UI in the shade where their
shows official thank you there's one

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:31.300
shows official thank you there's one
 

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:37.930
shows official thank you there's one
back here I think so to see

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:37.940
 

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.630
thank you do you have any best practices

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640
thank you do you have any best practices
 

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.220
thank you do you have any best practices
for the watch notification says it

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:42.230
for the watch notification says it
 

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:44.950
for the watch notification says it
doesn't work any different watch watch

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960
doesn't work any different watch watch
 

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:50.440
doesn't work any different watch watch
oh yes yes I was I had some slides on

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:50.450
oh yes yes I was I had some slides on
 

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.760
oh yes yes I was I had some slides on
that and I ended up taking them out

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:51.770
that and I ended up taking them out
 

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:52.660
that and I ended up taking them out
because I thought I was going to be

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:52.670
because I thought I was going to be
 

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.029
because I thought I was going to be
overtime so there's a couple things

00:41:55.029 --> 00:41:55.039
overtime so there's a couple things
 

00:41:55.039 --> 00:41:55.599
overtime so there's a couple things
about that

00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:55.609
about that
 

00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:57.640
about that
I think a lot of the same principles

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:57.650
I think a lot of the same principles
 

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.630
I think a lot of the same principles
apply right if you're wearing a watch

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640
apply right if you're wearing a watch
 

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.220
apply right if you're wearing a watch
you know that like the vibration is

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:03.230
you know that like the vibration is
 

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.190
you know that like the vibration is
pretty oh no you can't ignore it it's

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200
pretty oh no you can't ignore it it's
 

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.640
pretty oh no you can't ignore it it's
it's an even more grabby sort of way to

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:09.650
it's an even more grabby sort of way to
 

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:11.020
it's an even more grabby sort of way to
interrupt someone so you should be

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:11.030
interrupt someone so you should be
 

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.460
interrupt someone so you should be
thinking extra hard about whether you're

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:12.470
thinking extra hard about whether you're
 

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:13.539
thinking extra hard about whether you're
gonna annoy them but you should be

00:42:13.539 --> 00:42:13.549
gonna annoy them but you should be
 

00:42:13.549 --> 00:42:15.279
gonna annoy them but you should be
thinking about that anyway some devices

00:42:15.279 --> 00:42:15.289
thinking about that anyway some devices
 

00:42:15.289 --> 00:42:16.809
thinking about that anyway some devices
are louder than others and you don't

00:42:16.809 --> 00:42:16.819
are louder than others and you don't
 

00:42:16.819 --> 00:42:18.130
are louder than others and you don't
really know whether how annoying it's

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:18.140
really know whether how annoying it's
 

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.289
really know whether how annoying it's
gonna be the one extra bit is that

00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:20.299
gonna be the one extra bit is that
 

00:42:20.299 --> 00:42:23.589
gonna be the one extra bit is that
there's this set local only flag on the

00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599
there's this set local only flag on the

there's this set local only flag on the
Builder that if for whatever reason

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:25.460
Builder that if for whatever reason
 

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.069
Builder that if for whatever reason
you're generating notifications kind of

00:42:27.069 --> 00:42:27.079
you're generating notifications kind of
 

00:42:27.079 --> 00:42:28.809
you're generating notifications kind of
trapped in the device like it's about

00:42:28.809 --> 00:42:28.819
trapped in the device like it's about
 

00:42:28.819 --> 00:42:30.400
trapped in the device like it's about
the device maybe and there's no reason

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:30.410
the device maybe and there's no reason
 

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.279
the device maybe and there's no reason
to send it to the watch like like

00:42:33.279 --> 00:42:33.289
to send it to the watch like like
 

00:42:33.289 --> 00:42:34.150
to send it to the watch like like
usb-connected

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160
usb-connected
 

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.440
usb-connected
for example that's a great one right and

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:35.450
for example that's a great one right and
 

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:36.549
for example that's a great one right and
you plug it in you don't see that on

00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:36.559
you plug it in you don't see that on
 

00:42:36.559 --> 00:42:38.710
you plug it in you don't see that on
your watch so you call set local only

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720
your watch so you call set local only
 

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.020
your watch so you call set local only
true and that then it won't get bridge

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:41.030
true and that then it won't get bridge
 

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:42.730
true and that then it won't get bridge
to the watch that's your way to sort of

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:42.740
to the watch that's your way to sort of
 

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.069
to the watch that's your way to sort of
keep it from getting to the watch thank

00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079
keep it from getting to the watch thank
 

00:42:45.079 --> 00:42:58.210
keep it from getting to the watch thank
you yep that's what in the middle

00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:58.220
 

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.610
yes I can hear you about the livestream

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:00.620
yes I can hear you about the livestream
 

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:08.770
yes I can hear you about the livestream
oh so so I noticed you mentioned trying

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:08.780
oh so so I noticed you mentioned trying
 

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.390
oh so so I noticed you mentioned trying
to take advantage of setting the

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400
to take advantage of setting the
 

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.460
to take advantage of setting the
priority to something like minima or low

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:12.470
priority to something like minima or low
 

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.410
priority to something like minima or low
right which wouldn't necessarily know

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:14.420
right which wouldn't necessarily know
 

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:19.150
right which wouldn't necessarily know
users right would that end up leading to

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.160
users right would that end up leading to
 

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.480
users right would that end up leading to
lower click-through rates but on the

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:22.490
lower click-through rates but on the
 

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.070
lower click-through rates but on the
other side they let me get your app

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:24.080
other side they let me get your app
 

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.110
other side they let me get your app
uninstalled right that's sort of the

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:26.120
uninstalled right that's sort of the
 

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.360
uninstalled right that's sort of the
trade-off okay so I don't think so

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:28.370
trade-off okay so I don't think so
 

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:32.440
trade-off okay so I don't think so
because well like I mentioned there was

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:32.450
because well like I mentioned there was
 

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:38.100
because well like I mentioned there was
some academic research and I'm blanking

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:38.110
some academic research and I'm blanking
 

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:42.720
some academic research and I'm blanking
there was a paper by Maria Oliver out of

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:42.730
there was a paper by Maria Oliver out of
 

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:45.850
there was a paper by Maria Oliver out of
the Spanish telecom company that was

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:45.860
the Spanish telecom company that was
 

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.550
the Spanish telecom company that was
recently at a conference about this

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560
recently at a conference about this
 

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.740
recently at a conference about this
exact and I think I think that's the the

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:50.750
exact and I think I think that's the the
 

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.510
exact and I think I think that's the the
trade-off you're assuming is that that

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.520
trade-off you're assuming is that that
 

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.760
trade-off you're assuming is that that
I'll lower my click-through rates versus

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:54.770
I'll lower my click-through rates versus
 

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:55.840
I'll lower my click-through rates versus
annoyance right that those things aren't

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:55.850
annoyance right that those things aren't
 

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:57.640
annoyance right that those things aren't
leaked it turns out that if you present

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:57.650
leaked it turns out that if you present
 

00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.140
leaked it turns out that if you present
the notifications at the right time you

00:43:59.140 --> 00:43:59.150
the notifications at the right time you
 

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:00.370
the notifications at the right time you
actually get a higher click-through rate

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:00.380
actually get a higher click-through rate
 

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.710
actually get a higher click-through rate
so and this makes sense if you think is

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720
so and this makes sense if you think is
 

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.350
so and this makes sense if you think is
sort of mental model mental experiment

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:05.360
sort of mental model mental experiment
 

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.390
sort of mental model mental experiment
if I'm driving down the road and my

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400
if I'm driving down the road and my
 

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.300
if I'm driving down the road and my
phone tries to tell me to read an

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:10.310
phone tries to tell me to read an
 

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:13.660
phone tries to tell me to read an
article not gonna do it right but if I'm

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:13.670
article not gonna do it right but if I'm
 

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.550
article not gonna do it right but if I'm
sitting the doctor's office waiting

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:15.560
sitting the doctor's office waiting
 

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.240
sitting the doctor's office waiting
right and I'm bored Oh an article yeah

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:19.250
right and I'm bored Oh an article yeah
 

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.350
right and I'm bored Oh an article yeah
I'll totally read that right so you can

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:20.360
I'll totally read that right so you can
 

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.250
I'll totally read that right so you can
totally imagine how that would play out

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:21.260
totally imagine how that would play out
 

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.620
totally imagine how that would play out
in real life so I don't think this is I

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:23.630
in real life so I don't think this is I
 

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:24.760
in real life so I don't think this is I
don't think they're on been done on a

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:24.770
don't think they're on been done on a
 

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:26.500
don't think they're on been done on a
seesaw there they're unrelated so I

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:26.510
seesaw there they're unrelated so I
 

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:28.060
seesaw there they're unrelated so I
think it really depends on what kind of

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:28.070
think it really depends on what kind of
 

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.310
think it really depends on what kind of
content you're posting and exactly what

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:30.320
content you're posting and exactly what
 

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.360
content you're posting and exactly what
the interaction is gonna be and you

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:31.370
the interaction is gonna be and you
 

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:32.860
the interaction is gonna be and you
really need to think about it but it

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:32.870
really need to think about it but it
 

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.210
really need to think about it but it
might be the case that if you stick it

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:34.220
might be the case that if you stick it
 

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.770
might be the case that if you stick it
in the shade without drawing attention

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:35.780
in the shade without drawing attention
 

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.690
in the shade without drawing attention
to it that they'll just find it at the

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:37.700
to it that they'll just find it at the
 

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.820
to it that they'll just find it at the
right time the time that's right for

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:39.830
right time the time that's right for
 

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:41.140
right time the time that's right for
them when they pull down the shade in a

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:41.150
them when they pull down the shade in a
 

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:42.160
them when they pull down the shade in a
sort of triaging

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:42.170
sort of triaging
 

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:43.840
sort of triaging
so that might be your golden moment

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:43.850
so that might be your golden moment
 

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:48.390
so that might be your golden moment
right

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400
 

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.839
okay I think we're okay on one more

00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:51.849
okay I think we're okay on one more
 

00:44:51.849 --> 00:44:52.410
okay I think we're okay on one more
won't work

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:52.420
won't work
 

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.620
won't work
lastly okay yeah hopefully this week

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:55.630
lastly okay yeah hopefully this week
 

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:58.259
lastly okay yeah hopefully this week
quick basically I'm wondering why not

00:44:58.259 --> 00:44:58.269
quick basically I'm wondering why not
 

00:44:58.269 --> 00:45:00.390
quick basically I'm wondering why not
tell the developers that their

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400
tell the developers that their
 

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.859
tell the developers that their
notifications are being blocked by users

00:45:01.859 --> 00:45:01.869
notifications are being blocked by users
 

00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:04.859
notifications are being blocked by users
so basically like user turns off my

00:45:04.859 --> 00:45:04.869
so basically like user turns off my
 

00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:06.569
so basically like user turns off my
notifications I might want to know

00:45:06.569 --> 00:45:06.579
notifications I might want to know
 

00:45:06.579 --> 00:45:08.670
notifications I might want to know
because maybe I need that feedback that

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680
because maybe I need that feedback that
 

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.730
because maybe I need that feedback that
I'm right right right yeah okay so so

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:11.740
I'm right right right yeah okay so so
 

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:12.960
I'm right right right yeah okay so so
that's a good that's a good question so

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:12.970
that's a good that's a good question so
 

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:14.160
that's a good that's a good question so
how do you know if you're annoying the

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:14.170
how do you know if you're annoying the
 

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.769
how do you know if you're annoying the
users before you get blocked I think the

00:45:16.769 --> 00:45:16.779
users before you get blocked I think the
 

00:45:16.779 --> 00:45:20.130
users before you get blocked I think the
reason we don't close that loop is we're

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:20.140
reason we don't close that loop is we're
 

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.720
reason we don't close that loop is we're
worried about sort of retribution or

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:21.730
worried about sort of retribution or
 

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:22.980
worried about sort of retribution or
wherever we don't want to obviously

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:22.990
wherever we don't want to obviously
 

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:24.359
wherever we don't want to obviously
you're having a bad time you and the

00:45:24.359 --> 00:45:24.369
you're having a bad time you and the
 

00:45:24.369 --> 00:45:25.589
you're having a bad time you and the
user we don't want to get in the middle

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599
user we don't want to get in the middle
 

00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:27.749
user we don't want to get in the middle
of that but I think there's signals you

00:45:27.749 --> 00:45:27.759
of that but I think there's signals you
 

00:45:27.759 --> 00:45:30.089
of that but I think there's signals you
can get before that happened right you

00:45:30.089 --> 00:45:30.099
can get before that happened right you
 

00:45:30.099 --> 00:45:32.279
can get before that happened right you
can you can post delete intents you can

00:45:32.279 --> 00:45:32.289
can you can post delete intents you can
 

00:45:32.289 --> 00:45:33.809
can you can post delete intents you can
post you know of course when they launch

00:45:33.809 --> 00:45:33.819
post you know of course when they launch
 

00:45:33.819 --> 00:45:35.880
post you know of course when they launch
your other intents and I think if you

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:35.890
your other intents and I think if you
 

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:39.059
your other intents and I think if you
are clever about watching how soon they

00:45:39.059 --> 00:45:39.069
are clever about watching how soon they
 

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:41.099
are clever about watching how soon they
react to your notifications and things

00:45:41.099 --> 00:45:41.109
react to your notifications and things
 

00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:42.720
react to your notifications and things
like that you can get some soft

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:42.730
like that you can get some soft
 

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.870
like that you can get some soft
engagement numbers before the bad stuff

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880
engagement numbers before the bad stuff
 

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:51.059
engagement numbers before the bad stuff
happens all right thank you very much

00:45:51.059 --> 00:45:51.069
happens all right thank you very much
 

00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:54.900
happens all right thank you very much
I'll be around for office hours
