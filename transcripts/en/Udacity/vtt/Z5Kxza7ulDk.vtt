00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.250
As far as relationships are concerned,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.270
there's three main categories of relationships in UML.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.725
There are dependencies, depicted by dashed lines with an arrowhead,

00:00:09.725 --> 00:00:14.380
indicating that the class at one end uses the class as the other end.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.800
The solid lines without arrowheads are associations.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.970
And that says that class at one end affects or

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.630
has a instance of the class at the other end.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.020
The solid line can be adorned with a diamond.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.049
The diamond is used indicate this has a or

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.770
aggregation embellishment to the association.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.030
Third main category relationship is the generalization relationship.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.800
The class at one end is a kind of a class at the other end.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.950
In this case there is a solid line but it has that triangle at the end of it.
