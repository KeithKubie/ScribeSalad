sorrel snow guru Lin said you chaired
 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.780
sorrel snow guru Lin said you chaired
the Nobel Committee for chemistry and

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790
the Nobel Committee for chemistry and
 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.940
the Nobel Committee for chemistry and
have just announced another price of

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
have just announced another price of
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.390
have just announced another price of
this year which is about the tiny

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
this year which is about the tiny
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.390
this year which is about the tiny
molecular machines how small only yes

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400
molecular machines how small only yes
 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.859
molecular machines how small only yes
very very small they're so small you

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
very very small they're so small you
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.200
very very small they're so small you
can't see them you can't see them by eye

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210
can't see them you can't see them by eye
 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.790
can't see them you can't see them by eye
you can't even see them by a light

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
you can't even see them by a light
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.910
you can't even see them by a light
microscope so they are on the nanometer

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
microscope so they are on the nanometer
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.080
microscope so they are on the nanometer
so 1 to 10 nanometer large an anonymizer

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090
so 1 to 10 nanometer large an anonymizer
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.939
so 1 to 10 nanometer large an anonymizer
if you take a millimeter and divide it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
if you take a millimeter and divide it
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.190
if you take a millimeter and divide it
in 1 million parts each part is in

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
in 1 million parts each part is in
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.270
in 1 million parts each part is in
Automator 1 million part for the first

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
Automator 1 million part for the first
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000
Automator 1 million part for the first
row yeah there were ten one to ten

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010
row yeah there were ten one to ten
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.560
row yeah there were ten one to ten
thousand times smaller than the human

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
thousand times smaller than the human
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.090
thousand times smaller than the human
hair yes and you mentioned also that the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
hair yes and you mentioned also that the
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.720
hair yes and you mentioned also that the
dream is always to construct such tiny

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
dream is always to construct such tiny
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.680
dream is always to construct such tiny
machines so how come they overcome huge

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
machines so how come they overcome huge
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.700
machines so how come they overcome huge
challenges

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
challenges
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.170
challenges
yeah that's a very good question because

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180
yeah that's a very good question because
 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.270
yeah that's a very good question because
I think the dream started in the end of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
I think the dream started in the end of
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.990
I think the dream started in the end of
the 1950s we find - lectures where he

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
the 1950s we find - lectures where he
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.580
the 1950s we find - lectures where he
gave a challenge to the scientists

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590
gave a challenge to the scientists
 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.850
gave a challenge to the scientists
exactly yes to construct molecules that

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
exactly yes to construct molecules that
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.090
exactly yes to construct molecules that
could act as machines and there are two

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
could act as machines and there are two
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.070
could act as machines and there are two
obstacles one obstacle is this thing

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
obstacles one obstacle is this thing
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.990
obstacles one obstacle is this thing
that you need to have parts that are

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
that you need to have parts that are
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.080
that you need to have parts that are
freely movable either physically movable

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
freely movable either physically movable
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.899
freely movable either physically movable
or you need some kind of ISO mais

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909
or you need some kind of ISO mais
 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.520
or you need some kind of ISO mais
isomerize able bonds that's one

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
isomerize able bonds that's one
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649
isomerize able bonds that's one
challenge and the other challenge is

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
challenge and the other challenge is
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.530
challenge and the other challenge is
that molecular systems always want to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
that molecular systems always want to
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.480
that molecular systems always want to
reach equilibrium and fluctuate around

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
reach equilibrium and fluctuate around
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.340
reach equilibrium and fluctuate around
it and they do have all the random

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
it and they do have all the random
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.890
it and they do have all the random
motions so it's a main challenge to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
motions so it's a main challenge to
 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.039
motions so it's a main challenge to
create motion in one define direction so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
create motion in one define direction so
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.749
create motion in one define direction so
when you put in energy you want your

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
when you put in energy you want your
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.020
when you put in energy you want your
system to either rotate or move in the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
system to either rotate or move in the
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.420
system to either rotate or move in the
direction you have desired they're not

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
direction you have desired they're not
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.300
direction you have desired they're not
randomly so then yes you want to have

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310
randomly so then yes you want to have
 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.210
randomly so then yes you want to have
them silent in equilibrium but they also

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
them silent in equilibrium but they also
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.359
them silent in equilibrium but they also
wanted to stop the movement the Brawn

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369
wanted to stop the movement the Brawn
 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.310
wanted to stop the movement the Brawn
Brownian movement yeah or at least

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
Brownian movement yeah or at least
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.690
Brownian movement yeah or at least
overcome it because you can't really

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700
overcome it because you can't really
 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.300
overcome it because you can't really
stop it it's there - but you have to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
stop it it's there - but you have to
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.999
stop it it's there - but you have to
come around it and one way they found to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
come around it and one way they found to
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.880
come around it and one way they found to
come over around it was to use assumed

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890
come over around it was to use assumed
 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.340
come over around it was to use assumed
to it molecules so that when you waste

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350
to it molecules so that when you waste
 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.070
to it molecules so that when you waste
your energy they come in a frustrated or

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080
your energy they come in a frustrated or
 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.890
your energy they come in a frustrated or
10 state and when they relax they will

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900
10 state and when they relax they will
 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.160
10 state and when they relax they will
be more prone to relax in one direction

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
be more prone to relax in one direction
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.840
be more prone to relax in one direction
compared to the other because of their

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850
compared to the other because of their
 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.090
compared to the other because of their
asymmetry and once they have relaxed

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100
asymmetry and once they have relaxed
 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:30.880
asymmetry and once they have relaxed
they can't get back what does fuel them

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890
they can't get back what does fuel them
 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.610
they can't get back what does fuel them
how come they move they move because we

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620
how come they move they move because we
 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.110
how come they move they move because we
give them energy so they are not

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120
give them energy so they are not
 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.140
give them energy so they are not
autonomous they are moved at will from

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150
autonomous they are moved at will from
 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.420
autonomous they are moved at will from
their user so we put in a light source

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430
their user so we put in a light source
 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.780
their user so we put in a light source
we put in heat or we put in chemical

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790
we put in heat or we put in chemical
 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.240
we put in heat or we put in chemical
energy so they are like the man-made

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250
energy so they are like the man-made
 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.160
energy so they are like the man-made
motors you have to put in some kind of

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170
motors you have to put in some kind of
 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.970
motors you have to put in some kind of
fuel and the jeweller's so mostly they

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980
fuel and the jeweller's so mostly they
 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.770
fuel and the jeweller's so mostly they
talked about plants for example they

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780
talked about plants for example they
 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.060
talked about plants for example they
also live by light successfully putting

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070
also live by light successfully putting
 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.240
also live by light successfully putting
the item so is there a dream to

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250
the item so is there a dream to
 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.860
the item so is there a dream to
construct living molecules I don't think

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870
construct living molecules I don't think
 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.750
construct living molecules I don't think
that this type of event will eat in

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760
that this type of event will eat in
 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.520
that this type of event will eat in
living Molly we've been living me the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530
living Molly we've been living me the
 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.250
living Molly we've been living me the
something can also replicate itself and

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260
something can also replicate itself and
 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.460
something can also replicate itself and
there is nothing in those molecules that

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470
there is nothing in those molecules that
 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.560
there is nothing in those molecules that
we award today that allowed them to

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570
we award today that allowed them to
 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.479
we award today that allowed them to
replicate themselves machines and nano

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489
replicate themselves machines and nano
 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.760
replicate themselves machines and nano
molecules

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770
 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.950
there is also a lot of science fiction

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960
there is also a lot of science fiction
 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.460
there is also a lot of science fiction
about that and then the nano robots are

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470
about that and then the nano robots are
 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.860
about that and then the nano robots are
the main heroes of science fiction

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870
the main heroes of science fiction
 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.450
the main heroes of science fiction
stories and also they pose a threat when

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460
stories and also they pose a threat when
 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.330
stories and also they pose a threat when
they start to self-replicate themself so

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340
they start to self-replicate themself so
 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.830
they start to self-replicate themself so
what do you think about those machines

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840
what do you think about those machines
 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.710
what do you think about those machines
are the big promise or a big threat I

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720
are the big promise or a big threat I
 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.750
are the big promise or a big threat I
think they're mainly a big promise

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760
think they're mainly a big promise
 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.970
think they're mainly a big promise
because they don't have this property or

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980
because they don't have this property or
 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.830
because they don't have this property or
self-replication so they cannot really

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840
self-replication so they cannot really
 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.520
self-replication so they cannot really
take over and they are all controlled by

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530
take over and they are all controlled by
 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.350
take over and they are all controlled by
an energy input so if you don't want

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360
an energy input so if you don't want
 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.970
an energy input so if you don't want
them to do something you can just stop

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980
them to do something you can just stop
 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.060
them to do something you can just stop
the energy input and they will stop

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070
the energy input and they will stop
 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.690
the energy input and they will stop
working and now they are with us here so

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700
working and now they are with us here so
 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.240
working and now they are with us here so
what is the next step what what is

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250
what is the next step what what is
 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.610
what is the next step what what is
really the dream and the vision now I

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620
really the dream and the vision now I
 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.680
really the dream and the vision now I
think one of our Lords put this very

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690
think one of our Lords put this very
 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.570
think one of our Lords put this very
nicely when we call him that this is the

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580
nicely when we call him that this is the
 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.229
nicely when we call him that this is the
start of a new molecular era so we think

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239
start of a new molecular era so we think
 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.720
start of a new molecular era so we think
this is a very right time to worry this

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730
this is a very right time to worry this
 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.180
this is a very right time to worry this
Nobel Prize because this is when it

and so you have to play tricks to get

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259
and so you have to play tricks to get
 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.409
