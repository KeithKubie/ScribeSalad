ANKUR KOTWAL: You've
got a great brand,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.610
and you want everything on
your app or site to match it.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.010
With custom styling, you can
change the look of your maps

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.920
to suit your needs.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.380
Hi, I'm Ankur Kotwal.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.490
And in this episode,
I'm going to show you

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.880
how awesome the Google
Maps API custom styling is.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.950
We'll also look at
a new tool to help

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.250
you create your own styles.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.340
So let's start off by looking
at what custom styling is.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.880
So here is a normal Google map.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.660
It looks cool in the
daytime, but here's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.510
how it could look at night.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.550
Now, let's say you
have an app that's used

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.660
for tracking bicycle rides.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.370
And in that use case,
providing a great experience

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.250
in the evening is just as
important as the daytime.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.890
Wouldn't it be great to
have the app automatically

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.320
switch to the Night theme on
the map at the appropriate time?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.250
Now, when we saw
that happen, it's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.250
important to see that that
style was applied to the map

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.340
instantly.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.680
We didn't need to tear
down and rebuild the map.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.930
It just immediately
adjusted to the new style.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.830
Custom styling puts you in
control of the colors that

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.230
are used in the map.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.320
You can use this to
enforce your branding,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.060
to match your taste
in colors, or focus

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.380
on what's more important.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.900
You describe a custom
style using JSON.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.700
And you only have to do it
once, because the same style

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.250
format is supported across
the web, Android, and iOS.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.360
Now, since it's
just a JSON file,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.350
you can store it
where you'd like.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.970
It can ship with your app,
or you can download and apply

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.270
the style dynamically
at run time.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.490
So how do you create
a custom style?

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.070
Well, some developers
will tell you

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.410
that you should create these
JSON files in Vim, Emacs,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.040
Sublime Text, so whatever
your favorite text editor is.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.260
And you could.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.240
But for those of us that
want something more visual,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.770
we've created a
Styling Wizard for you.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.050
The Styling Wizard is
available at this URL,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.590
and it's a tool that makes it
easy to build your own custom

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.300
map styles.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.030
Now, what we've done here
is group the styling options

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.830
into logical categories.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.660
And when you change
these values,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.310
the Styling Wizard reflects
that change immediately.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.570
What's cool is that the Styling
Wizard includes a few default

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.660
styles.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.870
The Night style is useful
for those evening use cases,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.060
like our bike ride app.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.170
And Silver is great
if you want to provide

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.530
a subtle or toned-down look.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.230
But my favorite by far
is the Retro style.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.730
So once you've created
your style with the Wizard,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.520
you're going to
want to apply it.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.930
Now, we're going to look
at a few code snippets

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.720
to show you how easy it
is to apply the styles

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.060
across all three platforms.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.600
Let's start with the web.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.620
To modify the styles
of the default

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.330
map types, set the style
array in the Maps MapOptions,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.010
either at the time
of construction

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.010
or by calling map.setOptions.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.380
On Android, to
style your map, call

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.100
googleMap.setMapStyle and pass
in a MapStyleOptions object.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.820
That's going to contain your
style declarations in the JSON

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.900
format.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.720
You can also load the JSON from
a raw resource or a string.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.220
On iOS, to apply custom
map styles to the map,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.330
call GMSMapStyle to create
a GMSMapStyle instance.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.060
You can pass in a URL
for a local JSON's file

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.150
or a JSON string containing
style definitions.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.530
Then just assign the
GMSMapStyle instance

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.420
to the MapStyle
property of the map.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.080
Earlier, I stated that
you can use custom styles

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.330
to focus on what's important.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.690
Let me explain what
I meant by that.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.830
Custom styling allows
you to hide labels,

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.670
or vary road density, or even
toggle points of interest.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.450
And the way you do this
is by tweaking the style

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.680
options in the Styling Wizard.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.510
What we do is click More
Options, select a category,

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.779
and then tweak as appropriate.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.290
You can also use the predefined
styles as a starting point

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.570
and then create your
own unique map style.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.820
So there you have it.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.030
Custom styles are a great
way to tailor your maps

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.340
to your unique taste and brand.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.350
The Styling Wizard makes it easy
to create custom map styles,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.540
and then you can apply
them just as easily

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.800
at run time on the
web, Android, and iOS.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.430
To learn more, check out
the docs at this link.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.150
And to get started, check
out the sample code here.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.720
Share your styled maps
with the hashtag #mapstyle.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.830
We're looking forward
to seeing your styles.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.770
Thanks for watching.
