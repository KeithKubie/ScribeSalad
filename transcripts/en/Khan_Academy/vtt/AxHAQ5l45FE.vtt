00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.010
The Ubas are moving
from Houston to Egypt.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.260
They pack their belongings
in rectangular crates

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.270
and hire a boxcar to ship the
crates across land and sea.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.740
The crates are made specifically
to fit inside the boxcar

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.050
with their bases facing down.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.850
Each crate has a base 5 meters
long by 1.5 meters wide.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.760
So let me draw that.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.120
So crate is 5 meters
long, and 1.5 meters wide,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.060
and has a height of 2 meters.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.830
So its height might look
something like this.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.200
So it has a height of 2 meters.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.120
So that's each of the crates.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.120
And they're designed
to fit inside a boxcar.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.620
So this is a crate
right over here.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.554
I'll do my best to draw a crate.

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:47.470
And they give us the
dimensions of the boxcar.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.610
A boxcar is 15 meters long.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.110
So let me draw a boxcar here.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.640
So it's 15 meters long.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.560
Maybe I'll try to make sure
I can fit it on the page.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.010
So that this whole
distance would be 5 meters,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.480
and then another 5 meters here,
and then another 5 meters here.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.040
So that would be 15 meters long.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.420
So you could fit three of the
crates along an edge like that.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.720
And then, they tell us
that it is 3 meters wide.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.310
So this is 1.5 meters wide.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.450
So you could put two of
these to get you to 3 meters.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.130
Let me draw this so
we can see what's

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.570
going on behind the scenes.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.960
So you could go 3 meters
wide for a boxcar,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.550
and then it is 4 meters high.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.830
So each of these
are 2 meters high.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.690
So you could stack one more.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.190
And so you have 2
meters plus 2 meters.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.350
This entire distance right over
here is going to be 4 meters.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.687
And I could draw the rest
of the boxcar like this.

00:01:58.687 --> 00:02:01.270
So there's a couple of ways to
think about how many crates you

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.570
could fit in a boxcar.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.070
One way would be just the way
that we're doing it right now.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.310
We could visualize.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.009
How many can you fit in this
direction along the length?

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.039
How many can you
fit along the width?

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.250
And how many can you
fit along the height?

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.571
And essentially, if we
multiply those three numbers,

00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:17.320
we would have counted
the number of crates

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.640
that could fit inside.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.150
So you could fit 1,
2, 3 along the length.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.450
So that'd be 3.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.040
You could fit 2 along the width.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.210
1.5 and 1.5 gets you to
3 meters, so times 2.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.160
And then you could fit 2
along the height, so times 2,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.060
gets us to 3 times 2
is 6 times 2 is 12.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.190
You can fit 12
crates in the boxcar.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.070
Now, another way you could have
done it is you could say, OK,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.664
they're telling us that
these are designed to fit.

00:02:46.664 --> 00:02:48.580
So we really just have
to compare the volumes.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.620
How many times
more is the volume

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.410
of the box car than the crate?

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.160
I like doing it
this way more, just

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.580
to make sure that the
dimensions actually work out,

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.510
so that you could
actually squeeze these in.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.180
Because if the
dimensions aren't right,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.994
even if the boxcar is 12
times the volume of one

00:03:03.994 --> 00:03:05.410
of the crates, if
the crates don't

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.076
have the right
dimensions, you might not

00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:09.989
be able to squeeze exactly
12 crates in there.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.280
But they're telling us that
it is the exact dimensions.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.830
So we could figure out the
dimensions of the boxcar, then

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.090
the dimensions of the crate.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.580
And then we could figure out
how much larger the boxcar is,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.510
how many times larger.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.270
Let's do the boxcar
in this blue color.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.950
The boxcar is 15 meters long, 3
meters wide, and 4 meters high.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:36.430
So boxcar volume is equal
to 15 in cubic meters.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.330
So there's 15 meters times
3 meters times 4 meters.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.350
So this is going to
be in cubic meters.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.170
So this is going to be--
let's see, 15 times 3 is 45.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.940
45 times 4 is 180 cubic meters.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.400
That's the boxcar volume.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.600
And then what's the
volume of the crate?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.140
Well, the crate volume--
if we do our math right,

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.640
it should come out
to 1/12 of this,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.306
because that's what
we just figured out,

00:04:05.306 --> 00:04:08.530
is 5 times 1.5 times 2.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.800
So 5 times 1.5 times 2.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.610
Well, 1.5 times 2 is 3, times
5 is 15, so 15 cubic meters.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.460
So how many times larger is
the boxcar than the crate?

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.340
Well, what's 180 divided by 15?

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.770
Well, it's exactly 12.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.790
10 times 15 is 150.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.470
And then 2 times 15 is 30.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.800
150 plus 30 is 180.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.960
So notice, 180
divided by 15 is 12.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.760
So either way, however
you think about it--

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.850
I find this one to be a
little bit easier to kind

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.580
of just visualize
the boxes-- you

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.960
can fit 12 crates in the boxcar.
