00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:21.820 align:start position:0%
though the characters as well and they
 

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.450 align:start position:0%
though the characters as well and they
added<00:27:22.090><c> a</c><00:27:22.570><c> momager</c><00:27:23.140><c> he</c><00:27:23.470><c> headed</c><00:27:23.890><c> the</c><00:27:24.010><c> IROC</c>

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:28.300 align:start position:0%
as much because they added that
 

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
as much because they added that

you put it before the last there but the

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
way they cut it in the last third just
 

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
way they cut it in the last third just
felt<00:28:50.980><c> like</c><00:28:51.070><c> it</c><00:28:51.250><c> really</c><00:28:51.430><c> was</c><00:28:51.640><c> flowing</c><00:28:52.060><c> and</c>

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:52.270 align:start position:0%
felt like it really was flowing and
 

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.970 align:start position:0%
felt like it really was flowing and

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:53.980 align:start position:0%
moving and building and and it's
 

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
moving and building and and it's
probably<00:28:54.370><c> why</c><00:28:54.460><c> I</c><00:28:54.490><c> like</c><00:28:54.550><c> the</c><00:28:54.790><c> movie</c><00:28:55.030><c> more</c><00:28:55.180><c> than</c>

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:55.330 align:start position:0%

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:47.590 align:start position:0%
interesting though how it just seems to
 

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
interesting though how it just seems to
start<00:31:47.860><c> with</c><00:31:48.100><c> Atari</c><00:31:48.519><c> though</c><00:31:48.850><c> I</c><00:31:49.149><c> don't</c><00:31:49.510><c> think</c><00:31:49.690><c> I</c>

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:49.750 align:start position:0%
start with Atari though I don't think I
 

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.509 align:start position:0%
start with Atari though I don't think I
saw<00:31:49.960><c> much</c><00:31:50.200><c> in</c><00:31:50.409><c> the</c><00:31:50.500><c> way</c><00:31:50.620><c> of</c><00:31:50.740><c> pop</c><00:31:50.980><c> culture</c><00:31:51.340><c> going</c>

saw much in the way of pop culture going
 

00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:53.850 align:start position:0%
saw much in the way of pop culture going
further<00:31:51.850><c> back</c><00:31:52.000><c> than</c><00:31:52.360><c> that</c><00:31:52.419><c> and</c><00:31:53.350><c> I'm</c><00:31:53.529><c> like</c><00:31:53.710><c> is</c>

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:53.860 align:start position:0%
further back than that and I'm like is
 

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
further back than that and I'm like is
that<00:31:54.010><c> because</c><00:31:54.309><c> Halliday</c><00:31:54.880><c> designed</c><00:31:55.330><c> the</c>

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:55.510 align:start position:0%
that because Halliday designed the
 

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:58.049 align:start position:0%
that because Halliday designed the
system<00:31:55.720><c> or</c><00:31:56.260><c> just</c><00:31:56.529><c> people</c><00:31:56.860><c> can't</c><00:31:57.519><c> think</c><00:31:57.789><c> back</c>

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:58.059 align:start position:0%
system or just people can't think back
 

00:31:58.059 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
system or just people can't think back
further<00:31:58.450><c> than</c><00:31:58.600><c> Atari</c><00:31:59.169><c> cuz</c><00:31:59.500><c> it's</c><00:31:59.679><c> video</c><00:31:59.950><c> games</c>

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.010 align:start position:0%
further than Atari cuz it's video games
 

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.430 align:start position:0%
further than Atari cuz it's video games
well<00:32:00.700><c> I</c><00:32:00.730><c> think</c><00:32:00.880><c> it</c><00:32:01.240><c> probably</c><00:32:01.960><c> makes</c><00:32:02.080><c> it</c><00:32:02.200><c> the</c><00:32:02.289><c> to</c>

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
well I think it probably makes it the to
 

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.259 align:start position:0%
well I think it probably makes it the to
like<00:32:02.649><c> he</c><00:32:02.830><c> grew</c><00:32:03.010><c> up</c><00:32:03.100><c> in</c><00:32:03.309><c> that</c><00:32:03.460><c> era</c><00:32:03.850><c> he</c><00:32:04.149><c> was</c>

00:32:04.259 --> 00:32:04.269 align:start position:0%
like he grew up in that era he was
 

00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
like he grew up in that era he was
obsessed<00:32:04.600><c> with</c><00:32:04.659><c> that</c><00:32:04.870><c> time</c><00:32:05.110><c> so</c><00:32:05.860><c> he</c><00:32:06.100><c> made</c><00:32:06.250><c> the</c>

00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:06.429 align:start position:0%
obsessed with that time so he made the
 

00:32:06.429 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
obsessed with that time so he made the
world<00:32:06.610><c> kind</c><00:32:06.909><c> of</c><00:32:06.970><c> focused</c><00:32:07.330><c> on</c><00:32:07.480><c> Bandhan</c><00:32:07.809><c> the</c>

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:07.929 align:start position:0%
world kind of focused on Bandhan the
 

00:32:07.929 --> 00:32:09.750 align:start position:0%
world kind of focused on Bandhan the
die-hard<00:32:08.169><c> fans</c><00:32:08.679><c> will</c><00:32:08.860><c> probably</c><00:32:08.980><c> really</c><00:32:09.549><c> be</c>

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
die-hard fans will probably really be
 

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
die-hard fans will probably really be
into<00:32:10.419><c> this</c><00:32:10.539><c> but</c><00:32:10.960><c> again</c><00:32:11.049><c> there's</c><00:32:11.350><c> are</c><00:32:11.500><c> things</c>

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:11.710 align:start position:0%
into this but again there's are things
 

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.470 align:start position:0%
into this but again there's are things
we<00:32:11.799><c> don't</c><00:32:11.980><c> recognize</c><00:32:12.250><c> so</c><00:32:12.460><c> I</c><00:32:12.490><c> just</c><00:32:12.760><c> like</c><00:32:13.299><c> more</c>

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
we don't recognize so I just like more
 

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
we don't recognize so I just like more
current<00:32:13.990><c> so</c><00:32:14.470><c> the</c><00:32:14.679><c> generation</c><00:32:15.100><c> like</c><00:32:15.429><c> a</c><00:32:15.460><c> blur</c>

00:32:15.659 --> 00:32:15.669 align:start position:0%
current so the generation like a blur
 

00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
current so the generation like a blur
this<00:32:15.880><c> would</c><00:32:16.000><c> they</c><00:32:16.149><c> would</c><00:32:16.330><c> go</c><00:32:16.450><c> back</c><00:32:16.480><c> proudly</c>

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:17.110 align:start position:0%

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.730 align:start position:0%
the yeah maybe
I<00:32:34.000><c> guess</c><00:32:34.240><c> the</c><00:32:34.419><c> tone</c><00:32:34.659><c> of</c><00:32:34.690><c> this</c><00:32:34.960><c> film</c><00:32:35.230><c> versus</c><00:32:35.649><c> the</c>

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:35.740 align:start position:0%
I guess the tone of this film versus the
 

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
I guess the tone of this film versus the

00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:42.429 align:start position:0%
book is that the book people the tone of

the<00:32:42.610><c> film</c><00:32:42.639><c> just</c><00:32:43.090><c> seems</c><00:32:43.269><c> more</c><00:32:43.960><c> like</c><00:32:44.409><c> just</c>

00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
the film just seems more like just
 

00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:46.409 align:start position:0%
the film just seems more like just
here's<00:32:45.460><c> a</c><00:32:45.519><c> bunch</c><00:32:45.669><c> of</c><00:32:45.760><c> stuff</c><00:32:45.820><c> don't</c><00:32:46.179><c> take</c><00:32:46.299><c> it</c>
