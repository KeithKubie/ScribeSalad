RYAN LOREN: So Eric, thanks
so much for being

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.730
here at Google today.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.080
ERIC ROBERSON: Ryan, thank
you very much.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.420
RYAN LOREN: Second time
is a charm, I heard.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.300
ERIC ROBERSON: I'm getting
more and more

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.390
familiar with the stage.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.920
I handed in my application
to Google.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.610
I love the building so much.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.466
Hopefully, I'm just waiting
for a call back.

00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.230
I knew I should've got
rid of that iPhone.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.945
That's another story.

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:21.950
I'm getting an Android
any second now.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.230
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.170
That'll probably put
it over the top.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.650
Just kidding.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.270
Just wanted to talk.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.950
We're celebrating Black
History Month tonight.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.140
And I'm so happy you're here,
hosting the event.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.120
ERIC ROBERSON: Thank you.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.300
RYAN LOREN: I heard you were
Mr. Black Teen Universe.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.820
ERIC ROBERSON: Mr. Black Teenage
World was actually the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.640
title, yes.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.790
RYAN LOREN: World.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.760
So the whole world,
not just the US.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.530
But everywhere.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.509
ERIC ROBERSON: They put like one
person from overseas and

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:46.480
was like, we've got it.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.790
We've found the world.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.610
But yeah, I was 16
years old, man.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.400
And my sister, who I give a
lot of credit for me even

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.090
doing art in any form
or fashion,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.190
because she was so talented.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.270
She was in a lot of pageants
that my mom and my father were

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.746
putting her in.

00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:06.140
And my mom found a pageant
for teenage boys.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.000
And I got up there
and embarrassed

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.210
myself, and won the state.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.560
And then I won the national.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.120
And it gave me a full
scholarship to Howard

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.400
University.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.640
So that was the great
part that came out

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.290
of it, also as well.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.700
RYAN LOREN: Yeah.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.905
I'm sure that couldn't have hurt
your image of yourself.

00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:23.600
Mr. World.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.470
ERIC ROBERSON: Mr.
Teenage World.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.670
RYAN LOREN: But in seriousness,
can you explain

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.070
how did that affect your
trajectory from there?

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.060
Was that a big moment, or was
it just something you did?

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.110
ERIC ROBERSON: It was
a huge moment.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.920
It was a huge moment.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.790
I think one, I've always said
that I was somehow going to go

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.500
to college on a scholarship,
whether it was playing

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.940
football or doing something.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.020
And at the same time, going into
my junior year, where at

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.320
that point I was drawing,
designing clothes, doing

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.430
theater, making music,
skateboarding, BMXing, I was

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.670
just all over the place in
everything I wanted to do.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.270
So to gain a scholarship by
pretty much singing, for the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.710
most part--

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.490
I had to do other things
in the pageant--

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.860
it really said, Mom and Dad, I
think I'm not going to be a

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.330
political science major.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.090
I think I want to try--

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.890
there wasn't an R&amp;B major.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.350
Can I major in being
Al B. Sure?

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.130
I couldn't do it.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.595
So I grew up doing theater.

00:02:23.595 --> 00:02:26.910
So I went as a musical
theater major.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.885
And going to Howard, it was one
of the best decisions ever

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:31.250
in my life.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.410
RYAN LOREN: Can you talk about
Howard, and the role of

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.750
historically black colleges
and universities, and also

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.640
what Black History Month
means to you?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.870
ERIC ROBERSON: Indeed.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.380
You're walking down hallways
that Donnie

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.490
Hathaway hummed down.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.430
You're going into practice
rooms that Roberta

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.860
Flack played in.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.440
You're standing on a stage
reading a monologue that

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.450
Phylicia Rashad read
a monologue on.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.050
Just the history of it.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.320
And I learned very early
on to be very prepared.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.370
Because at any second, Q-Tip
from a Tribe Called Quest or

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.030
Bill Cosby or Muhammad Ali will
walk down the hallway or

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.600
across the yard.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.860
But at the same time, my friends
were getting signed.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.190
If anybody remembers,
and if I ever--

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.620
the group Shai, "Fall in Love"
song, we were friends.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.360
They were our buddies
at Howard.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.470
And they handed their
record to a DJ.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.510
And two weeks later, they
were on Arsenio Hall.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.350
And five weeks later, they had
finished the album in a week.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.280
Handed in in the album, sold
three million copies.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.530
And I handed them my demo
and said, just hand it

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.380
to somebody in LA.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.750
Before you know it, I
was flying there.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.220
And in my sophomore year,
I got a record deal.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.230
And so it was just a very
working environment.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.590
One of my professors, the
late, great, amazing Al

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.580
Freeman, who played Elijah
Muhammad in the "Malcolm X"

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.050
movie, was one of my teachers.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.280
And he shot it while teaching.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.140
So I'm like, uh, I'm going to
LA next week to try to meet

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.400
with Warner Brothers
for a record deal.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.890
Like, how could he be like, no,
stay here and work on your

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.090
studies, when he's like, I'm
going to meet with Spike.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.860
It was just a working
environment.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.480
Marlon Wayans was a good
friend of mine.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.079
He was doing movies and going
to class at the same time.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.300
So I think I needed
to see that.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.710
And it was the first lesson
of learning how to balance

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.330
everything.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.430
RYAN LOREN: Yeah.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.810
That's a lot going on at once,
and I think inspiring to see.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.440
ERIC ROBERSON: Yeah,
very much.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.320
RYAN LOREN: So thanks
for sharing that.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.840
ERIC ROBERSON: No problem.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.260
RYAN LOREN: So can you
talk about how--

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.920
you had the deal with Warner--

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.790
and you were, in my mind, you
were kind of a trailblazer of

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.090
independent music.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.990
People were doing it.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.710
But you've been able to
do it and sustain it.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.620
ERIC ROBERSON: I think my
career has been able to

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.570
overshadow how many times I've
been dropped from record

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.090
labels, or just how unsuccessful
I was.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.065
Getting a contract signed was
one thing, but getting that

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:03.600
album out is a whole 'nother
tricky monster.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.040
And I remember having a song on

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.290
Billboard, and it's growing.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.750
In school, I remember telling
my parents, I

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.070
can't make it to class.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.050
I've got a video out, and
just all these people

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.270
are grabbing me.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.810
I literally can't make
it to class.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.810
I can't do this.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.830
So I took off two years.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.500
And then the Warner Brothers
situation didn't work out.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.790
I went to Island,
and the Island

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.190
situation didn't work back.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.220
And my mom was like, you're
going to go back to that

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.190
school, and you are going to
get your scholarship back.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.960
I was like, all right.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.800
I went in there, I literally
sang to everybody.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.940
Like, please give me my
scholarship back.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.840
I'll get straight
As, I promise.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.900
And amazingly, I went back.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.390
But it was crazy because I went
back and it's like, oh,

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.800
there's that kid that had
that record deal.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.560
Like the whispers walk across
the yard, like, oh, that's

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.790
that kid that fell off.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.485
Wasn't he in that video?

00:05:58.485 --> 00:05:59.880
That was a long time ago.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.130
I wonder if he still
got money.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.680
So the humbleness, it made me
a better student, a better

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.270
singer, a more humble artist,
a more focused everything,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.420
every aspect.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.740
And I will tell you, if I had
this huge record and just took

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.300
off, I wouldn't be doing
music right now.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.890
I wasn't talented enough
at the time.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.140
I didn't know how to
handle everything.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.440
So I had to go back.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.250
And going back to school and
graduating was like the

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.715
hardest thing I've ever
done in life.

00:06:31.715 --> 00:06:33.830
It really was.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.830
But it was a great decision.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.020
And even with that, I went back
to college, and I started

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.510
writing songs for
other people.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.400
I lent a song to 112.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.520
And there was a group
called [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.125
on Warner Brothers.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:48.350
So I was placing songs
and still recording.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.150
And it just got to the point
where, for me, the deals

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.930
weren't working out.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.000
And I had just too many songs
that just made it

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.820
too much for me.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.580
It all started with, I had a
real bad break up, and I just

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.380
closed the studio doors
and started recording.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.150
And those songs weren't--

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.850
I wasn't going to give
to somebody else.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.170
So that's how my independent
career started.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.710
RYAN LOREN: That's cool.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.803
Would you mind sharing a couple
of the song titles that

00:07:09.803 --> 00:07:11.160
fall under that category?

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.470
ERIC ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.000
There was a whole album called
"Esoteric." And it's crazy

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.840
because it was a healing
record for me.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.460
So when the album came out, and
the songs like, what are

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.880
some of the song titles--
"Newborn Child," which is

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.090
saying I'll cry like a newborn
child, which I was

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.020
doing at the time.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.815
When the album came out, and I
would meet women, they'd be

00:07:33.815 --> 00:07:35.330
like, this record
is so beautiful.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.480
And I'm like, what
do you mean?

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.850
This is about pain, you
horrible person.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.680
Don't ever listen to my record,
you don't understand.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.370
But I had to realize that people
could relate to what I

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.120
was going through.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.410
And it helped me heal, but
it helped them heal.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.800
There was a song called
"Miles Away" on it

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.190
that was really important.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.350
And really, the record,
"Esoteric" means only meant to

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.550
be understood by a chosen few.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.050
And that to me was my career.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.350
I wasn't trying to
change the world.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.070
I wasn't trying to win
everybody over.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.970
I was trying to just do
music for someone

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.620
who would feel this.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.590
Because I always felt like my
music career and my love life

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.710
were parallel.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.980
They always have been.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.970
And as a songwriter,
I was doing great.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.430
I had songs for everybody
and their mother.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.080
I was writing all these songs.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.270
I was doing very, very well.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.150
But was I fulfilled in
what I was doing?

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.510
I feel like I was a soul artist
writing, a lot of

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.200
times, compromising, or just
missing, as a fan, missing

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.440
what was on the radio.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.630
So I said, all right, let me
start doing what I feel like

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.600
I'm missing.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.230
And I think that's what I'm
still doing to this day.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.560
RYAN LOREN: That's great.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.770
As someone--

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.240
I mean, I'll be real with you.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.710
I have healed from your music.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.810
And that's why I first
got into you.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.796
"Past Paradise," "Find the Way,"
those are songs that

00:08:57.796 --> 00:08:59.220
when you listen to, you're
like, man, he's

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.520
been through it.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.470
Thanks.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.150
ERIC ROBERSON: Make
checks payable to

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.500
Eric Roberson, whoever.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.980
You can just fill it out.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.820
My father's back there.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.070
He'll accept the checks.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.460
And I'll tell you, I hope--

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.140
I say this respectfully.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.620
I got a text earlier, and I
could show you for whoever

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.650
doesn't believe me, a guy who I
was talking to who's in the

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.290
industry, and he's struggling
in his travels.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.290
And he says, man, you
write great songs

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.188
about passing up vaginas.

00:09:30.188 --> 00:09:33.380
And I was like, what a great,
horrible compliment.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.510
That was amazingly horrible.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.860
Incredible at the same time.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.700
But for me, I realized
a long time ago.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.440
What I will tell you is that the
lyrics come, and I can't

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.720
take credit for them.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.500
They come, and then I learn
what they mean.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.770
And then I try to be good
enough to follow them.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:51.770
You know what I mean?

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.210
And that's been my
whole career.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.410
So it's like I write a song
and go, wow, this sounds

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.630
pretty good.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.040
And then the lyrics
are stable.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.450
And then I learn what that
song meant for me.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.380
"Find the Way" was important,
because it was--

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.070
if anyone listens to "Find the
Way," it's a song of mine.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.910
And it's like I sang it
two parts, one high

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.980
note and one low note.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.846
And I panned the high one all
the way to the right, and I

00:10:17.846 --> 00:10:19.160
panned the low one all
the way to the left.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.440
And the high one meant
to be emotion.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.660
And the low note meant
to be reality.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.190
And as a man, I was
battling that.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.730
Sometimes we meet a young lady,
and we're so used to our

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.120
routine, she could
be the soul mate.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.190
But I've got that game.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.260
I've got to put that game on
her, that I'm just ruining--

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.540
like, can I stop the game
for two seconds just

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.190
to see who she is?

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.480
And I've been lucky enough
to write about

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.520
it, or my break ups.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.280
I made a decision a long time
ago when I went back to Howard

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.090
that every subject that came to
mind, or everything I went

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.830
through, I'll put to music.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:58.020
So every argument, every great
day, every whatever would be

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:58.710
put to music.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.550
And I lost a lot of girlfriends
that way.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.120
It came with the good and bad.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.670
You wrote that for me?

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.950
You wrote that about me?

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.760
It was the same thing, literally
24 hours apart.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.130
But it's something
I decided to do.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.890
And if God allowed me to have
certain thoughts and lyrics

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.460
and melodies, how dare
I not use them.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.560
RYAN LOREN: Yeah, no,
that's incredible.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.160
So what's your process?

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.600
Do you just wake up with
something in your head?

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.465
Or does it vary?

00:11:27.465 --> 00:11:29.730
Because I know sometimes people
say, oh, I woke up in

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:30.670
the middle of the night.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.200
Sometimes I actually sat down.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.140
Does it change?

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.250
ERIC ROBERSON: It changes.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.930
I'm a fisherman of creativity.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.230
So I'm just under the
belief that the

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.860
idea, it already exists.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.370
I just have to find it
and make it tangible.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.290
So a lot of my records are
written in the bathroom.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.380
I'll leave it up to you think
what's happening in the

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.920
bathroom when I'm
writing them.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.530
But every aspect from shaving
to showering to other

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.554
S words that fit.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.800
RYAN LOREN: Situating.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.000
ERIC ROBERSON: Soaping up.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.480
Situating, yeah.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.470
It's funny because before, I
was very much a slave to

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.110
creativity.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.780
I was very much like, if a idea
came and I was at the

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.930
Thanksgiving table with my
family who I haven't seen all

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.040
week, I would get up right then
and go in the studio.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.810
I was very much like, I have
an idea, and everyone must

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.190
respect the idea.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.490
Now, I believe that it's
going to come back now.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.940
So now having kids and having a
wife, I realized that it's a

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.090
great idea, but I'm pushing
my son on the swing.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.460
And he's too young
to be left here.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.880
It'll come back.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.670
And it comes back.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.180
It comes back.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.780
But I'm always writing,
always.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.340
My phone is full of lyrics.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.520
And I'm always writing letters,
and I feel like you

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.210
should just write in general to
stay in shape for when the

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.110
idea comes.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.830
RYAN LOREN: Definitely.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.960
You mentioned your kids.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.140
Just two more questions.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.490
One is, what's one thing you
learned about yourself since

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.490
you've become a father, which
was two years ago, ish?

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:05.630
ERIC ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.090
I have a two-year-old and a
seven-month-old and I'm not

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.475
going to cry in front
of all these people.

00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:13.983
The thing I learned
about myself.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.780
Man, I don't know.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.680
There's a lot I learned
about my kids.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.660
But I learned that I can
be a morning person.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.630
I probably, for the last 20
years, have averaged waking up

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.370
at 12:00 to 1:00 in
the afternoon.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:40.110
And now, my sons get up 7:30,
6:00, whatever in the morning.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.770
But I learned it's another
level of love, man.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:48.240
But it's tough, because I have
great parents who, I knew the

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.610
example of incredible love.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.550
I have amazing nephews
and nieces.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.030
And I mean, I was
crazy over them.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.825
So I knew that it could exist,
where it wasn't just more of

00:13:57.825 --> 00:14:00.590
an a-ha moment.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.480
But if anything, I learned that
you can balance it all.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.150
I will tell everybody out
there, there was a guy

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.020
recently who I was just working

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.535
with, who was a cameraman.

00:14:10.535 --> 00:14:12.490
And he travels a lot.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.440
He just got married.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.440
He said, my wife wants
to have a kid.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.100
But man, I'm just traveling
too much.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.310
And I'm like, it's
going to fit.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.780
It's going to make
its way, man.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.500
Don't hold off for that.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.780
I don't think we
really waited.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.570
I didn't push it away.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:30.500
But now, my last two records, I
recorded with a lot of time,

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.980
my son was on my lap,
either one of them.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.670
Because I've got to get
this idea done.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.810
I want to spend time with him.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.820
And he wants to spend
time with me.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.760
Let's go in the studio.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.200
And it just works.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.880
It just works.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:47.050
And I look forward to having
them on tour with me, and the

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.130
first time they actually
write a song, or

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:49.560
something like that.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.800
I look forward to all that.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.850
So I feel, what I may have
learned, is just that my

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.550
dreams are coming true
more and more.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.953
RYAN LOREN: Excellent.

00:14:55.953 --> 00:14:56.760
That's wonderful.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.030
So speaking of the studio, last
question, what's coming

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.140
up next for you?

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.870
I've heard United Tenor
is in the mix.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:04.860
ERIC ROBERSON: And I'm
not going to cry

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.930
about this one, either.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.850
I have to say that first.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.970
Because if I don't say
it, I will cry.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.810
I started doing music because
of three influences.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.700
And one was A Tribe
Called Quest.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.350
Number two was Stevie Wonder.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.650
And another was a group
called Commissioned.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.230
It was a gospel group from
Detroit called Commissioned.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.950
Thank you.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.980
And one of the founders of that
group was a guy named

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.530
Fred Hammond.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.570
Amazing vocalist,
amazing writer.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.880
And not only just musically,
but I remember as a kid,

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.420
hearing their music and going,
whatever that is,

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.920
I want to do that.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:44.020
And I've had chances of meeting
Fred Hammond for many

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.300
years, and I passed
up every time.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:52.730
And my staff and some friends
surprised me with a meeting.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.440
I'm in a restaurant, thinking
I'm about to be interviewed by

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.750
Tom Joyner.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.000
And in walks Fred Hammond.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.370
I'm like, I try to run away.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.680
And I was like, aw,
you got me.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.720
Man.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.300
And just because I wanted to be
able to tell him like, yo,

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.670
my career means so much--

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.285
not going to cry.

00:16:08.285 --> 00:16:09.160
Here we go.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.720
Toughen up, toughen up--

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.970
because of you.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:12.780
I have this career.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.950
And I didn't know if I was where
I needed to be at yet to

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.180
really understand.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.440
I didn't want to just hear,
oh, that's cool, man.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.540
Thanks a lot.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.160
What are we going to eat?

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.490
I didn't want that
to be blown over.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.190
And so we kept in touch.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.510
And a couple months ago,
he said, I got an idea.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.140
I want to form a new group.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.140
And I would love for you to
be a member of the group.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.530
And I as like, uh, OK.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.030
I mean, I'll play the piccolo
on an album for free.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.080
I'll pay to do it.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.540
And it's not only
just me and him.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.240
It's Dave Hollister from the
group Blackstreet, an amazing

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.450
solo artist who, I'm a huge
fan of Dave, and another

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.936
amazing artist in Brian Courtney
Wilson, who I'm

00:16:46.936 --> 00:16:47.910
friends with already.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:48.950
I met him years ago.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.470
And we kept in touch.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:51.840
And we all went to Dallas.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.250
And over the last month or so,
we traveled back and forth.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.110
And we recorded an
incredible album.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.710
And so the group's called
United Tenors, or UT.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.300
The album comes out
March 26th.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.099
We had our first concert
last Saturday.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:07.760
We shot a music video, had
a live performance

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.359
for a crowd in Dallas.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:13.585
And we cried through
the whole show.

00:17:13.585 --> 00:17:18.079
Like, all four of us are
just literally--

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.860
it's a dream come true, really,
in every aspect.

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:26.010
We performed four songs,
and we played

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.300
the rest of the record.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.750
So while we're singing,
we're crying.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:29.750
While we're playing
the records for

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.730
people, we're crying.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.320
Someone said something amazing
on stage, so we're crying.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.700
So we're literally, when you see
the video, we're all like

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.880
this with towels on our face
through the whole performance.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.300
But it's tears of joy.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.770
And we're probably not going to
stop crying anytime some.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.992
In all honesty, probably 10, 20
shows in, we're still going

00:17:48.992 --> 00:17:53.470
to be just like, I just so
appreciate this opportunity.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.500
And it's a gospel album.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.400
I pride myself on it.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.780
I never hid the fact that
I'm a Christian.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.990
And I feel that there's been a
ministry in all of my music.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.870
So it's really cool to be doing
a gospel album, and then

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.000
with two of my heroes
and a very good

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.940
friend of mine, as well.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.750
RYAN LOREN: Yeah.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:11.500
That's incredible.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.850
Thanks for sharing that.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.740
I'm really honored to have you
all here today to the point

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.880
where I might cry with you.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.550
ERIC ROBERSON: Tears of joy.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.970
Everybody, everybody, pass
the tissues out.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.670
RYAN LOREN: So Eric, thanks
so much for being here.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:25.520
ERIC ROBERSON: Ryan,
always a pleasure.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.420
RYAN LOREN: Looking forward
to tonight.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:26.810
ERIC ROBERSON: Always.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.060
Thank you.
