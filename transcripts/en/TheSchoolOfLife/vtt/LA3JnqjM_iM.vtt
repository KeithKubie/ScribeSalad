00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.140
You spot someone out in the street of the park

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.540
and by chance, see them again later.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.140
They look amazing.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.100
You hope they might smile at you,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.040
and without you even quite realizing,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.140
one side of your mind races ahead with extreme scenarios

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.980
that have absolutely no place in a sensible, respectable life.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.820
It can be worrying.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.500
Are you, or even worse, are you increasingly becoming something of a sleazebag?

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:34.300
The possibility is appalling in an era deeply alive to the dangers of unreciprocated desire,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.160
and yet, the very fact we have this worry is a good sign.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.300
To be concerned that one's desires might horrify another person

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.600
is a signal of a basic moral sense.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.340
Exploitative people don't ever agonize they might be such a thing.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.620
An erotic fantasy isn't a prelude to forcing one's unsolicited attention on another person;

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.320
it's a mature admission that nothing is ever going to happen.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.980
Erotic thoughts belong to a larger family of daydreams;

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.120
that is, wishes that one's life were richer in possibilities than it actually is.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.760
The inventor of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, made an instructive observation about babies and daydreams.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.840
Imagine a baby who wakes up in the middle of the night.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.340
It's dark and the mother isn't there, and it starts crying.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.560
It's going to take a few minutes before the mother can come along and see what's the matter.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.480
In those few minutes, the baby is alone with its distress.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.200
To an adult, it might not seem such a long time, but to an infant, the delay could be devastating.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.220
In a healthy scenario, the baby pulls off a remarkable feat:

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.660
it's able to imagine the mother being there, even when she isn't.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.880
The baby fantasizes that it's not alone, that things are better than they are,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.400
and that can be enough to hold things together for a while.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.260
Fantasy comes to the rescue when there aren't any better options about.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.180
Daydreaming is a safety net that stops us going crazy from a sense of missing out.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.880
Rather than worrying only about the risks of daydreams,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.200
we should be concerned about what happens when people can't have them.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.920
It's the inability to fantasize that may lead people to act out, rather than dream their wishes.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.160
Fantasy is a critical safety valve.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.660
It's a frank admission of the goodness and appeal of so much one hasn't got.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.400
And perhaps, we can get more ambitious about daydreams.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.580
We call them "sleazy" to draw attention to their unwanted, erotic component.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.760
But the act of wondering about someone else can potentially extend far beyond the body

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.500
to broader daydreams about personality, character, and ultimately, a love of a whole being.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.900
When we fear we are "sleazebags"-- as we must, if we're decent people--

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.160
we should honor our daydreams for what they really are:

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.040
melancholy, slightly pitiful, highly normal,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.020
and yet clever ways of coping.
