let's do some integer and rational

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850
let's do some integer and rational
 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.880
let's do some integer and rational
number problems so this first one here

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890
number problems so this first one here
 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.810
number problems so this first one here
the tick marks on the number line

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:07.820
the tick marks on the number line
 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.240
the tick marks on the number line
represent evenly spaced integers and

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
represent evenly spaced integers and
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.799
represent evenly spaced integers and
just in case you forgot what integers

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
just in case you forgot what integers
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.230
just in case you forgot what integers
mean that essentially is the counting

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
mean that essentially is the counting
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.390
mean that essentially is the counting
numbers including zero and the negative

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
numbers including zero and the negative
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.790
numbers including zero and the negative
counting numbers so one two three four

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
counting numbers so one two three four
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.220
counting numbers so one two three four
those are all integers zero is an

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
those are all integers zero is an
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.689
those are all integers zero is an
integer negative one negative two

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
integer negative one negative two
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.849
integer negative one negative two
negative three and so on and so forth

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
negative three and so on and so forth
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.529
negative three and so on and so forth
there's all integers you might imagine

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539
there's all integers you might imagine
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.990
there's all integers you might imagine
the whole numbers those are also another

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000
the whole numbers those are also another
 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.319
the whole numbers those are also another
way of saying the integers so they say

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329
way of saying the integers so they say
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.160
way of saying the integers so they say
find the values of a B C D and E so

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
find the values of a B C D and E so
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.340
find the values of a B C D and E so
these are evenly spaced and this is zero

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
these are evenly spaced and this is zero
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.240
these are evenly spaced and this is zero
right here and this is twenty one let's

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250
right here and this is twenty one let's
 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.590
right here and this is twenty one let's
see how many tick marks it takes us to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
see how many tick marks it takes us to
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.720
see how many tick marks it takes us to
go from zero to twenty one we have one

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
go from zero to twenty one we have one
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.850
go from zero to twenty one we have one
tick mark one two three four five six

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860
tick mark one two three four five six
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.450
tick mark one two three four five six
seven tick marks so seven tick marks

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460
seven tick marks so seven tick marks
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.910
seven tick marks so seven tick marks
take us to twenty one and they're evenly

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
take us to twenty one and they're evenly
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.340
take us to twenty one and they're evenly
spaced they tell us that evenly spaced

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
spaced they tell us that evenly spaced
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.630
spaced they tell us that evenly spaced
tick marks

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
tick marks
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.420
tick marks
so if seven of these take us to 21 there

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
so if seven of these take us to 21 there
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.280
so if seven of these take us to 21 there
must be three each must be a jump of

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
must be three each must be a jump of
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.260
must be three each must be a jump of
three this must be 3 6 9 12 15 18 and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
three this must be 3 6 9 12 15 18 and
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.109
three this must be 3 6 9 12 15 18 and
then BAM 21 the way I figured I said

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
then BAM 21 the way I figured I said
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.480
then BAM 21 the way I figured I said
seven tick marks gets us to 21 21

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
seven tick marks gets us to 21 21
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.710
seven tick marks gets us to 21 21
divided by 7 tick marks is 3 so each of

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720
divided by 7 tick marks is 3 so each of
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.749
divided by 7 tick marks is 3 so each of
those increment by 3 so this goes to 0

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
those increment by 3 so this goes to 0
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.090
those increment by 3 so this goes to 0
and then this must be 3 to the left of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
and then this must be 3 to the left of
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.780
and then this must be 3 to the left of
that so it's negative 3 right there so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
that so it's negative 3 right there so
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.960
that so it's negative 3 right there so
what are a B C and D a is negative 3 a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
what are a B C and D a is negative 3 a
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.080
what are a B C and D a is negative 3 a
is equal to negative 3 right there

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
is equal to negative 3 right there
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.330
is equal to negative 3 right there
that's a 3 B is equal to 3 right there C

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
that's a 3 B is equal to 3 right there C
 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.350
that's a 3 B is equal to 3 right there C
is equal to 9 right there D is equal to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
is equal to 9 right there D is equal to
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.740
is equal to 9 right there D is equal to
12 and E is equal to 15 not too bad all

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
12 and E is equal to 15 not too bad all
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.219
12 and E is equal to 15 not too bad all
right determine what fraction of the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
right determine what fraction of the
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.490
right determine what fraction of the
whole

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
whole
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.420
whole
each shaded region represents all right

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
each shaded region represents all right
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.499
each shaded region represents all right
let's see here we have 3 I guess you

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
let's see here we have 3 I guess you
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.830
let's see here we have 3 I guess you
could say 3 sections of this pie so in

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
could say 3 sections of this pie so in
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.900
could say 3 sections of this pie so in
our denominator which is the bottom of

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
our denominator which is the bottom of
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.150

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.120
our fraction we'll write there's 3
possible pieces and only one of the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130
possible pieces and only one of the
 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.060
possible pieces and only one of the
possible three sections is shaded so one

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070
possible three sections is shaded so one
 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.910
possible three sections is shaded so one
third is shaded so this first one is

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920
third is shaded so this first one is
 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.100
third is shaded so this first one is
one-third the second one is how many

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
one-third the second one is how many
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.740
one-third the second one is how many
sections do we have and all the sections

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
sections do we have and all the sections
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.640
sections do we have and all the sections
are equally equal sized so we have 1 2 3

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
are equally equal sized so we have 1 2 3
 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.490
are equally equal sized so we have 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 sections 12

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500

times 4 28 plus let's see I have 2 this
 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:49.460
times 4 28 plus let's see I have 2 this
is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 &amp; 2 so how many twos

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470
is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 &amp; 2 so how many twos
 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.720
is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 &amp; 2 so how many twos
are there that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730
are there that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.130
are there that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
twos so that's 8 times 2 that's 16 so 28

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140
twos so that's 8 times 2 that's 16 so 28
 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.699
twos so that's 8 times 2 that's 16 so 28
plus 16 28 plus 10 is 38 plus another 6

order from least to greatest so let's do
Part A I might not do all of these for

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790
Part A I might not do all of these for
 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.270
Part A I might not do all of these for
the sake of time 1/2 1/3 and 1/4 so if

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280
the sake of time 1/2 1/3 and 1/4 so if
 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.970
the sake of time 1/2 1/3 and 1/4 so if
you think about a pie over going on this

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980
you think about a pie over going on this
 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.070
you think about a pie over going on this
if you dig a pie and divide it into just

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080
if you dig a pie and divide it into just
 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.010
if you dig a pie and divide it into just
two pieces one half is half of that

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020
two pieces one half is half of that
 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.420
two pieces one half is half of that
whole pie that right there is one half

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430
whole pie that right there is one half
 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.040
whole pie that right there is one half
this right here 1/4 1/4 is just take the

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050
this right here 1/4 1/4 is just take the
 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.050
this right here 1/4 1/4 is just take the
same pie you take the same pie 1/4 is

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060
same pie you take the same pie 1/4 is
 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.410
same pie you take the same pie 1/4 is
just that so clearly 1/2 is greater than

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420
just that so clearly 1/2 is greater than
 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.330
just that so clearly 1/2 is greater than
1/4 or 1/4 is less than 1/2 is less than

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340
1/4 or 1/4 is less than 1/2 is less than
 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.860
1/4 or 1/4 is less than 1/2 is less than
1/2 I'll write it like that and

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870
1/2 I'll write it like that and
 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.140
1/2 I'll write it like that and
one-third is right in between if you did

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150
one-third is right in between if you did
 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.290
one-third is right in between if you did
1/3 it's maybe harder to visualize here

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300
1/3 it's maybe harder to visualize here
 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.380
1/3 it's maybe harder to visualize here
but if this is 1 1/2 if we divided this

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390
but if this is 1 1/2 if we divided this
 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.770
but if this is 1 1/2 if we divided this
into thirds one-third is less than this

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780
into thirds one-third is less than this
 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.230
into thirds one-third is less than this
so if we divided this into thirds three

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240
so if we divided this into thirds three
 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.640
so if we divided this into thirds three
equal sections one-third would be just

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650
equal sections one-third would be just
 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.530
equal sections one-third would be just
like that right here and one-third is

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540
like that right here and one-third is
 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.960
like that right here and one-third is
more than that ok there's multiple ways

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970
more than that ok there's multiple ways
 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.320
more than that ok there's multiple ways
we could visualize this so 1/4 is less

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330
we could visualize this so 1/4 is less
 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.770
we could visualize this so 1/4 is less
than 1/3 which is less than 1/2 in

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780
than 1/3 which is less than 1/2 in
 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.130
than 1/3 which is less than 1/2 in
general the larger your denominator the

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140
general the larger your denominator the
 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.530
general the larger your denominator the
smaller the fraction I have only 1 out

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540
smaller the fraction I have only 1 out
 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.690
smaller the fraction I have only 1 out
of 4 that's less than 1 out of 3 and

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700
of 4 that's less than 1 out of 3 and
 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.340
of 4 that's less than 1 out of 3 and
that's even less than 1 out of 2 which

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350
that's even less than 1 out of 2 which
 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.710
that's even less than 1 out of 2 which
would be even less than 1 out of 1 so

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720
would be even less than 1 out of 1 so
 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.570
would be even less than 1 out of 1 so
that's our first one we put that in

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580
that's our first one we put that in
 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.940
that's our first one we put that in
order 1/4 1/3 1/2 let me just do Part C

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950
order 1/4 1/3 1/2 let me just do Part C
 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.380
order 1/4 1/3 1/2 let me just do Part C
just for the sake of time so we have 39

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390
just for the sake of time so we have 39
 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:28.130
just for the sake of time so we have 39
39 over 60 we have 49 over 80 and we

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140
39 over 60 we have 49 over 80 and we
 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.180
39 over 60 we have 49 over 80 and we
have a 59 over 100 so the easiest way to

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190
have a 59 over 100 so the easiest way to
 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.350
have a 59 over 100 so the easiest way to
do this if you had a calculator you

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360
do this if you had a calculator you
 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.940
do this if you had a calculator you
would actually just divide each of these

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950
would actually just divide each of these
 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.380
would actually just divide each of these
numbers out and you would get a decimal

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390
numbers out and you would get a decimal
 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.510
numbers out and you would get a decimal
and it's very easy to compare decimal

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520
and it's very easy to compare decimal
 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.060
and it's very easy to compare decimal
numbers

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070
numbers
 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.530
numbers
let's see if we can do this a little bit

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540
let's see if we can do this a little bit
 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.320
let's see if we can do this a little bit
more artfully so we can approximate it

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330
more artfully so we can approximate it
 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.360
more artfully so we can approximate it
and then we could we could say that this

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370
and then we could we could say that this
 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.320
and then we could we could say that this
is a little bit less so 39 over 60 it's

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330
is a little bit less so 39 over 60 it's
 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.200
is a little bit less so 39 over 60 it's
almost I'll link those squiggly equal

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210
almost I'll link those squiggly equal
 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.410
almost I'll link those squiggly equal
signs for almost it's approximately 40

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420
signs for almost it's approximately 40
 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.520
signs for almost it's approximately 40
over 60 which is equal to 2/3 so this is

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530
over 60 which is equal to 2/3 so this is
 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.000
over 60 which is equal to 2/3 so this is
almost 2/3 a little bit less than 2/3

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010
almost 2/3 a little bit less than 2/3
 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.540
almost 2/3 a little bit less than 2/3
this right here 49 over 80 49 over 80

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550
this right here 49 over 80 49 over 80
 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.360
this right here 49 over 80 49 over 80
it's almost 50 over 80 so it's almost

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370
it's almost 50 over 80 so it's almost
 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.820
it's almost 50 over 80 so it's almost
5/8 and then this right here 59 over 80

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830
5/8 and then this right here 59 over 80
 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.860
5/8 and then this right here 59 over 80
59 over 100 sorry

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870
59 over 100 sorry
 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.060
59 over 100 sorry
it's almost equal to 60 over 100 which

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.070
it's almost equal to 60 over 100 which
 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.740
it's almost equal to 60 over 100 which
is equal to 3/5 and just to get a sense

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750
is equal to 3/5 and just to get a sense
 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.600
is equal to 3/5 and just to get a sense
of at least now we might be able to do

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610
of at least now we might be able to do
 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.840
of at least now we might be able to do
it in our head 2/3 that's approximately

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:33.850
it in our head 2/3 that's approximately
 

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:39.480
it in our head 2/3 that's approximately
equal to 0.66 repeating you say 667

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.490
equal to 0.66 repeating you say 667
 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.460
equal to 0.66 repeating you say 667
roughly equal to that that's the 2/3

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:41.470
roughly equal to that that's the 2/3
 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.230
roughly equal to that that's the 2/3
right there let me do it in that color

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240
right there let me do it in that color
 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.990
right there let me do it in that color
so you know what I'm talking about so

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000
so you know what I'm talking about so
 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.610
so you know what I'm talking about so
this is approximately 0.667 not exactly

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:50.620
this is approximately 0.667 not exactly
 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.680
this is approximately 0.667 not exactly
we're estimating this right here 5/8 so

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:55.690
we're estimating this right here 5/8 so
 

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.050
we're estimating this right here 5/8 so
the way I always think of eighths is 1/8

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.060
the way I always think of eighths is 1/8
 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.850
the way I always think of eighths is 1/8
is 0.125 so 5/8 like let me just divide

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:02.860
is 0.125 so 5/8 like let me just divide
 

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.920
is 0.125 so 5/8 like let me just divide
it right here let me just do the work so

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:04.930
it right here let me just do the work so
 

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.340
it right here let me just do the work so
if we take 8 goes into 5 put some

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:08.350
if we take 8 goes into 5 put some
 

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.060
if we take 8 goes into 5 put some
decimals right here 8 goes into 5 0

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:12.070
decimals right here 8 goes into 5 0
 

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:17.330
decimals right here 8 goes into 5 0
times 0 times 8 is 0 5 minus 0 is 5

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340
times 0 times 8 is 0 5 minus 0 is 5
 

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:22.140
times 0 times 8 is 0 5 minus 0 is 5
bring down this is 0 8 goes into a 50 6

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.150
bring down this is 0 8 goes into a 50 6
 

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:28.800
bring down this is 0 8 goes into a 50 6
times 6 times 8 is 48 50 minus 48 is to

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:28.810
times 6 times 8 is 48 50 minus 48 is to
 

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:34.860
times 6 times 8 is 48 50 minus 48 is to
bring down to 0 8 goes into 20 2 times 2

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:34.870
bring down to 0 8 goes into 20 2 times 2
 

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.630
bring down to 0 8 goes into 20 2 times 2
times 8 is 16 subtract you get a 4 bring

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640
times 8 is 16 subtract you get a 4 bring
 

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.469
times 8 is 16 subtract you get a 4 bring
down this 0 48 goes into 40 five times

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479
down this 0 48 goes into 40 five times
 

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:47.970
down this 0 48 goes into 40 five times
so this right here is 0.625 not exactly

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:47.980
so this right here is 0.625 not exactly
 

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.530
so this right here is 0.625 not exactly
it's a little bit less than this this is

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:49.540
it's a little bit less than this this is
 

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.990
it's a little bit less than this this is
a little bit less than that

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000
a little bit less than that
 

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.560
a little bit less than that
and 3/5 is pretty straightforward 3/5 is

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:54.570
and 3/5 is pretty straightforward 3/5 is
 

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.540
and 3/5 is pretty straightforward 3/5 is
the same thing as 6/10 which is

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:56.550
the same thing as 6/10 which is
 

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.560
the same thing as 6/10 which is
approximately equal to 0.6 so this is a

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:00.570
approximately equal to 0.6 so this is a
 

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.240
approximately equal to 0.6 so this is a
little bit less than 0.6 this is a

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:02.250
little bit less than 0.6 this is a
 

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.820
little bit less than 0.6 this is a
little bit less than 0.6 2/5 is a little

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:04.830
little bit less than 0.6 2/5 is a little
 

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.640
little bit less than 0.6 2/5 is a little
bit less than 0.6 6 7 so if you put them

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:07.650
bit less than 0.6 6 7 so if you put them
 

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.410
bit less than 0.6 6 7 so if you put them
in order this is the smallest then this

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420
in order this is the smallest then this
 

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.630
in order this is the smallest then this
one then that one so let me write it

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640
one then that one so let me write it
 

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.540
one then that one so let me write it
down so the smallest is the smallest is

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:14.550
down so the smallest is the smallest is
 

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:20.000
down so the smallest is the smallest is
59 over 100 followed by 49 over 80

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.010
59 over 100 followed by 49 over 80
 

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.440
59 over 100 followed by 49 over 80
followed by the largest the largest

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:24.450
followed by the largest the largest
 

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.720
followed by the largest the largest
which is 39 over 60 which might be a

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:26.730
which is 39 over 60 which might be a
 

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:27.920
which is 39 over 60 which might be a
little unintuitive because this actually

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:27.930
little unintuitive because this actually
 

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.240
little unintuitive because this actually
has a smallest number in the numerator

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.250
has a smallest number in the numerator
 

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.310
has a smallest number in the numerator
but it also has a smallest number in the

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320
but it also has a smallest number in the
 

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.510
but it also has a smallest number in the
denominator so you actually have to work

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:32.520
denominator so you actually have to work
 

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.560
denominator so you actually have to work
it out and see that they're actually

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:33.570
it out and see that they're actually
 

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.010
it out and see that they're actually
reasonably close to each other let's do

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:37.020
reasonably close to each other let's do
 

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.700
reasonably close to each other let's do
problem number 5 find the opposite of

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:40.710
problem number 5 find the opposite of
 

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.410
problem number 5 find the opposite of
each of the following and when they say

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:42.420
each of the following and when they say
 

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.750
each of the following and when they say
opposite I think they mean find the

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760
opposite I think they mean find the
 

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.610
opposite I think they mean find the
negative or find the reflection on the

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620
negative or find the reflection on the
 

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.980
negative or find the reflection on the
number line so we essentially just have

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:48.990
number line so we essentially just have
 

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.600
number line so we essentially just have
to multiply all of these numbers by

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:50.610
to multiply all of these numbers by
 

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.340
to multiply all of these numbers by
negative 1 so for Part A the opposite of

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:54.350
negative 1 so for Part A the opposite of
 

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.560
negative 1 so for Part A the opposite of
1.200 one would be negative one point

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:57.570
1.200 one would be negative one point
 

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:02.079
1.200 one would be negative one point
zero zero one for Part B the negative of

00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:02.089
zero zero one for Part B the negative of
 

00:10:02.089 --> 00:10:05.780
zero zero one for Part B the negative of
5-11 well we could write it it's going

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:05.790
5-11 well we could write it it's going
 

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.170
5-11 well we could write it it's going
to be negative one times

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180
to be negative one times
 

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.550
to be negative one times
well what's 5 minus 11 5 minus 11 is

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560
well what's 5 minus 11 5 minus 11 is
 

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.610
well what's 5 minus 11 5 minus 11 is
negative six negative six this number

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:16.620
negative six negative six this number
 

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.320
negative six negative six this number
right here is negative six so the

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.330
right here is negative six so the
 

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.750
right here is negative six so the
opposite of negative six negative one

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760
opposite of negative six negative one
 

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.040
opposite of negative six negative one
times negative six it's going to be

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.050
times negative six it's going to be
 

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.360
times negative six it's going to be
equal to six part C X plus y the

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:26.370
equal to six part C X plus y the
 

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.940
equal to six part C X plus y the
opposite is going to be negative one

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:28.950
opposite is going to be negative one
 

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.460
opposite is going to be negative one
times X plus y we're going to just

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:31.470
times X plus y we're going to just
 

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.350
times X plus y we're going to just
written negative times X plus y you

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360
written negative times X plus y you
 

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.140
written negative times X plus y you
distribute the negative 1 this is equal

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:36.150
distribute the negative 1 this is equal
 

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.680
distribute the negative 1 this is equal
to negative x and then negative 1 x plus

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:39.690
to negative x and then negative 1 x plus
 

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.750
to negative x and then negative 1 x plus
y minus y finally Part D negative 1

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760
y minus y finally Part D negative 1
 

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.870
y minus y finally Part D negative 1
times X minus y all right I'm just

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880
times X minus y all right I'm just
 

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.100
times X minus y all right I'm just
taking the negative everything so I'm

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.110
taking the negative everything so I'm
 

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.930
taking the negative everything so I'm
taking the negative of this and so this

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940
taking the negative of this and so this
 

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.090
taking the negative of this and so this
is going to be equal to negative 1 times

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.100
is going to be equal to negative 1 times
 

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.950
is going to be equal to negative 1 times
X negative x then negative 1 times minus

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:57.960
X negative x then negative 1 times minus
 

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.740
X negative x then negative 1 times minus
y or negative Y that's plus y or we

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:00.750
y or negative Y that's plus y or we
 

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.920
y or negative Y that's plus y or we
could write this as Y minus X and that's

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:03.930
could write this as Y minus X and that's
 

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:04.889
could write this as Y minus X and that's
actually a neat thing

00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:04.899
actually a neat thing
 

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:06.809
actually a neat thing
to remember later on when you're

00:11:06.809 --> 00:11:06.819
to remember later on when you're
 

00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:08.699
to remember later on when you're
manipulating things algebraically the

00:11:08.699 --> 00:11:08.709
manipulating things algebraically the
 

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:12.090
manipulating things algebraically the
negative of X minus y is y minus X we

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.100
negative of X minus y is y minus X we
 

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.530
negative of X minus y is y minus X we
just did that right there the negative

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:13.540
just did that right there the negative
 

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.489
just did that right there the negative
of a minus B is B minus a you just swap

00:11:17.489 --> 00:11:17.499
of a minus B is B minus a you just swap
 

00:11:17.499 --> 00:11:18.840
of a minus B is B minus a you just swap
the two when you take the negative and

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:18.850
the two when you take the negative and
 

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.480
the two when you take the negative and
we just proved it for you right there

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:20.490
we just proved it for you right there
 

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.239
we just proved it for you right there
all right let's do a couple of these

00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:23.249
all right let's do a couple of these
 

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:26.519
all right let's do a couple of these
simplify the following absolute value

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:26.529
simplify the following absolute value
 

00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:28.889
simplify the following absolute value
expression absolute value is essentially

00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:28.899
expression absolute value is essentially
 

00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:31.079
expression absolute value is essentially
telling you the distance from zero so

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:31.089
telling you the distance from zero so
 

00:11:31.089 --> 00:11:35.400
telling you the distance from zero so
for example for example if that's zero

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:35.410
for example for example if that's zero
 

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.829
for example for example if that's zero
if I have the number for how far is four

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839
if I have the number for how far is four
 

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:40.739
if I have the number for how far is four
from zero the absolute value of four

00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:40.749
from zero the absolute value of four
 

00:11:40.749 --> 00:11:43.350
from zero the absolute value of four
well it's four from zero so you just say

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360
well it's four from zero so you just say
 

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.819
well it's four from zero so you just say
it's four so the absolute value of

00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:44.829
it's four so the absolute value of
 

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.470
it's four so the absolute value of
positive numbers is just the number and

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480
positive numbers is just the number and
 

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.769
positive numbers is just the number and
it let's add negative three how far is

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:49.779
it let's add negative three how far is
 

00:11:49.779 --> 00:11:52.980
it let's add negative three how far is
negative three from zero well I don't

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:52.990
negative three from zero well I don't
 

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.999
negative three from zero well I don't
care whether it's to the left or the

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:54.009
care whether it's to the left or the
 

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:56.519
care whether it's to the left or the
right of zero it's just three away from

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:56.529
right of zero it's just three away from
 

00:11:56.529 --> 00:11:58.619
right of zero it's just three away from
zero it's three to the left so this is

00:11:58.619 --> 00:11:58.629
zero it's three to the left so this is
 

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:00.449
zero it's three to the left so this is
going to be three so one way to think

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:00.459
going to be three so one way to think
 

00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:02.369
going to be three so one way to think
about absolute value is whether it's

00:12:02.369 --> 00:12:02.379
about absolute value is whether it's
 

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:04.559
about absolute value is whether it's
positive or negative it becomes positive

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:04.569
positive or negative it becomes positive
 

00:12:04.569 --> 00:12:07.590
positive or negative it becomes positive
it's that far from zero so let's do

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600
it's that far from zero so let's do
 

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.259
it's that far from zero so let's do
these so eleven minus the absolute value

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:10.269
these so eleven minus the absolute value
 

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:12.900
these so eleven minus the absolute value
of negative four this is equal to eleven

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:12.910
of negative four this is equal to eleven
 

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.730
of negative four this is equal to eleven
minus the absolute value of negative 4

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:14.740
minus the absolute value of negative 4
 

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.710
minus the absolute value of negative 4
is just 4 which is equal to seven I'll

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720
is just 4 which is equal to seven I'll
 

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.679
is just 4 which is equal to seven I'll
do every other one of these problems the

00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:22.689
do every other one of these problems the
 

00:12:22.689 --> 00:12:25.169
do every other one of these problems the
absolute value of negative five minus 11

00:12:25.169 --> 00:12:25.179
absolute value of negative five minus 11
 

00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:26.759
absolute value of negative five minus 11
so that'll be equal to the absolute

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:26.769
so that'll be equal to the absolute
 

00:12:26.769 --> 00:12:30.210
so that'll be equal to the absolute
value of negative five minus 11 is

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:30.220
value of negative five minus 11 is
 

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.970
value of negative five minus 11 is
negative 16 the absolute value of

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:32.980
negative 16 the absolute value of
 

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.769
negative 16 the absolute value of
negative 16 the absolute value of

00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:34.779
negative 16 the absolute value of
 

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:38.100
negative 16 the absolute value of
negative 16 is just 16 its 16 to the

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:38.110
negative 16 is just 16 its 16 to the
 

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.749
negative 16 is just 16 its 16 to the
left of 0 you could view it that way you

00:12:39.749 --> 00:12:39.759
left of 0 you could view it that way you
 

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.699
left of 0 you could view it that way you
can just get rid of its sign and then

00:12:41.699 --> 00:12:41.709
can just get rid of its sign and then
 

00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:44.460
can just get rid of its sign and then
finally here let's do Part II the

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:44.470
finally here let's do Part II the
 

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.079
finally here let's do Part II the
negative of the absolute value of

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:46.089
negative of the absolute value of
 

00:12:46.089 --> 00:12:49.340
negative of the absolute value of
negative 7 is equal to the negative of

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:49.350
negative 7 is equal to the negative of
 

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.449
negative 7 is equal to the negative of
what's the absolute value of negative 7

00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:51.459
what's the absolute value of negative 7
 

00:12:51.459 --> 00:12:54.480
what's the absolute value of negative 7
it's just 7 so it's equal to negative 7

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:54.490
it's just 7 so it's equal to negative 7
 

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.090
it's just 7 so it's equal to negative 7
this right here is 7 anyway hopefully

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:57.100
this right here is 7 anyway hopefully
 

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.939
this right here is 7 anyway hopefully
you found that useful
