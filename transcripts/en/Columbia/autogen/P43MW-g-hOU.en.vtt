we'll make some measurements and we'll
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.480
we'll make some measurements and we'll
discuss their significance I have here a

most people understand that if we have a

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810
most people understand that if we have a
 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.910
most people understand that if we have a
graduated cylinder with in this case 110

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
graduated cylinder with in this case 110
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.910

milliliters of water that by dropping

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
milliliters of water that by dropping
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.710
milliliters of water that by dropping
the pebble into the water the water

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
the pebble into the water the water
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.469
the pebble into the water the water
level will rise and we should be able to

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
level will rise and we should be able to
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.960
level will rise and we should be able to
determine the volume of the pebble by

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
determine the volume of the pebble by
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.020

and we can see that the water level has

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
and we can see that the water level has
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.090
and we can see that the water level has
gone up and the new water level is 130

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
gone up and the new water level is 130
 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.030
gone up and the new water level is 130
milliliters meaning that the difference

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
milliliters meaning that the difference
 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.410
milliliters meaning that the difference
130 minus 110 20 milliliters is the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
130 minus 110 20 milliliters is the
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.830
130 minus 110 20 milliliters is the
volume of the pebble milliliters we

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
volume of the pebble milliliters we
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.929
volume of the pebble milliliters we
should also understand is the same

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
should also understand is the same
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.719
should also understand is the same
volume as a little cube one centimeter

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
volume as a little cube one centimeter
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.059

milliliter while most understand that
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.369
milliliter while most understand that
one can determine the volume of a pebble

a graduated cylinder with some liquid in
 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.390
a graduated cylinder with some liquid in
it it gets a little more confusing when

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400
it it gets a little more confusing when
 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.140
it it gets a little more confusing when
we have more than one particle but it's

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150
we have more than one particle but it's
 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.229
we have more than one particle but it's
really the same principle if we were to

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239
really the same principle if we were to
 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.640
really the same principle if we were to
dump all these particles in this case a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650
dump all these particles in this case a
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.860
dump all these particles in this case a

into a liquid - surely the volume would

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599
into a liquid - surely the volume would
 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.720
into a liquid - surely the volume would
rise and what would we have done we

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
rise and what would we have done we
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.479
rise and what would we have done we
would have measured the volume of all of

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489
would have measured the volume of all of
 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.180
would have measured the volume of all of
these particles not just one but many

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190
these particles not just one but many
 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.460
these particles not just one but many

consisting of hundreds and hundreds of
 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.059
consisting of hundreds and hundreds of
thousands of particles we could do the

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069
thousands of particles we could do the
 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.220
thousands of particles we could do the
same thing by dropping the sand into a

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230
same thing by dropping the sand into a
 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.740
same thing by dropping the sand into a
water watching the water level rise in

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750

point seven grams so we've determined
 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.519
point seven grams so we've determined
one thing and that is the weight of the

one thing and that is the weight of the
 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.619

was 250 so subtracting 250 from 440

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:24.260
was 250 so subtracting 250 from 440
 

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:29.380
was 250 so subtracting 250 from 440
gives us 190 milliliters which is the

gives us 190 milliliters which is the
 

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.769
gives us 190 milliliters which is the
volume of the open space or pore space

00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:32.779

9 on your sheet which is the percentage
 

00:09:44.089 --> 00:09:47.350
9 on your sheet which is the percentage
percentage of open space and we do that

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360
percentage of open space and we do that
 

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:53.139
percentage of open space and we do that
by dividing 190 the volume of the pore

00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:53.149
by dividing 190 the volume of the pore
 

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:55.300
by dividing 190 the volume of the pore
space over the total volume the bulk

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:55.310
space over the total volume the bulk
 

00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:01.420
space over the total volume the bulk
volume of 440 and we get 43% so 43% of

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:01.430
volume of 440 and we get 43% so 43% of
 

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.670
volume of 440 and we get 43% so 43% of
volume of these particles is open space

the density remember density is the
 

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:17.170
the density remember density is the
weight divided by the volume so we could

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:17.180
weight divided by the volume so we could
 

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.690
weight divided by the volume so we could
do the bulk density which would be the

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:19.700

per cubic centimeter and of course these
beads have sunk to the bottom if they

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:20.990
beads have sunk to the bottom if they
 

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.810
beads have sunk to the bottom if they
were less dense than water they float

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:22.820
were less dense than water they float
 

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.019
were less dense than water they float
and we wouldn't be able to do the

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:26.029
and we wouldn't be able to do the
 

00:11:26.029 --> 00:11:29.820
and we wouldn't be able to do the
experiment okay so we have now shown you

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:29.830
experiment okay so we have now shown you
 

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.060
experiment okay so we have now shown you
how to measure porosity the percentage

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:34.070
how to measure porosity the percentage
 

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.010
how to measure porosity the percentage
of open space in a collection of

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:38.020
of open space in a collection of
 

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.460
of open space in a collection of
particles in this case the percentage of

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:42.470
particles in this case the percentage of
 

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.690
particles in this case the percentage of
open space in the pile of plastic beads

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:46.700
open space in the pile of plastic beads
 

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.940
open space in the pile of plastic beads
is about 43 percent we weighed the

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:50.950
is about 43 percent we weighed the
 

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.470
is about 43 percent we weighed the
particles we determine the bulk volume

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480
particles we determine the bulk volume
 

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.440
particles we determine the bulk volume
of the particles and pore space we

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:56.450
of the particles and pore space we
 

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.269
of the particles and pore space we
determine the volume of the particles

00:11:58.269 --> 00:11:58.279
determine the volume of the particles
 

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:00.610
determine the volume of the particles
the density of the particles and so

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:00.620
the density of the particles and so
 

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.699
the density of the particles and so
forth all these measurements are very

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:02.709
forth all these measurements are very
 

00:12:02.709 --> 00:12:06.760
forth all these measurements are very
important for studying groundwater and

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:06.770
important for studying groundwater and
 

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.890
important for studying groundwater and
the flow of fluids through

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:09.900
the flow of fluids through
 

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.880
the flow of fluids through
to regolith on the surface of the earth

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:12.890
to regolith on the surface of the earth
 

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.500
to regolith on the surface of the earth
we could have done the same experiment

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:15.510
we could have done the same experiment
 

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:19.580
we could have done the same experiment
with this with this sand and determined

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:19.590
with this with this sand and determined
 

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:23.840
with this with this sand and determined
its porosity and also the density of the

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:23.850
its porosity and also the density of the
 

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.020
its porosity and also the density of the
particles permeability to remind you

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.030
particles permeability to remind you
 

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.380

again is the ability of fluids to flow

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:30.390
again is the ability of fluids to flow
 

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.950
again is the ability of fluids to flow
through rock or regolith in order for

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:33.960
through rock or regolith in order for
 

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.870
through rock or regolith in order for
that to happen of course there has to be

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880
that to happen of course there has to be
 

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.200
that to happen of course there has to be
porosity but the porosity must also be

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:39.210
porosity but the porosity must also be
 

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.060
porosity but the porosity must also be
connected so that the liquid can move

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:41.070
connected so that the liquid can move
 

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.760
connected so that the liquid can move
from one place to another a good example

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:43.770
from one place to another a good example
 

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.640
from one place to another a good example
of a material that has very high

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:46.650
of a material that has very high
 

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.720
of a material that has very high
porosity but doesn't allow fluids to

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:50.730
porosity but doesn't allow fluids to
 

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.450
porosity but doesn't allow fluids to
move is styrofoam you take a Styrofoam

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:53.460
move is styrofoam you take a Styrofoam
 

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.420
move is styrofoam you take a Styrofoam
cup if you look at the walls of the

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:56.430
cup if you look at the walls of the
 

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.520
cup if you look at the walls of the
Styrofoam cup you'll see that it's made

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:58.530
Styrofoam cup you'll see that it's made
 

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:03.380
Styrofoam cup you'll see that it's made
of very tiny molds foam made from

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:03.390
of very tiny molds foam made from
 

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.930
of very tiny molds foam made from
styrene and those bubbles are not

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:05.940
styrene and those bubbles are not
 

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.840
styrene and those bubbles are not
connected they're all individually

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:08.850
connected they're all individually
 

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.170
connected they're all individually
wrapped in plastic and of course we know

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.180
wrapped in plastic and of course we know
 

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.320
wrapped in plastic and of course we know
the Styrofoam cup does not allow liquids

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:15.330
the Styrofoam cup does not allow liquids
 

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.840
the Styrofoam cup does not allow liquids
to pass through it there are some rocks

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:17.850
to pass through it there are some rocks
 

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.060
to pass through it there are some rocks
such as pumice that has similar

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:20.070
such as pumice that has similar
 

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.930
such as pumice that has similar
properties very very light and airy lots

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:23.940
properties very very light and airy lots
 

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.190
properties very very light and airy lots
of open space but the air space is not

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200
of open space but the air space is not
 

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.360
of open space but the air space is not
connected at all so permeability is the

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:32.370
connected at all so permeability is the
 

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:37.640
connected at all so permeability is the
ability of fluids to move within sand

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:37.650
ability of fluids to move within sand
 

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.910

important piece of information that we

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240
important piece of information that we
 

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.480
important piece of information that we
need in order to use Darcy's law which

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:53.490
need in order to use Darcy's law which
 

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.300
need in order to use Darcy's law which
allows us to calculate the rate at which

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:56.310
allows us to calculate the rate at which
 

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.950
allows us to calculate the rate at which
water flows in the subsurface until next
