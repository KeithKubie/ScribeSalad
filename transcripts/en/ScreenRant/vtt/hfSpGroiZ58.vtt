00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.620
The main goal of most movies is to tell a
great story that emotionally impacts the audience

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.710
in some way.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.780
Viewers know what they’re watching isn’t
“real,” but if the filmmakers do their

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.650
job, it will feel that way.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.340
One way of knowing that a narrative has connected
with moviegoers is if people cry during a

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.390
specific scene.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.190
Throughout history, there is no shortage of
movies that can start up the waterworks, and

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.410
that’s what this video is all about.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.070
Here are 10 famous movie scenes that will
make anyone cry.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.070
Up

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.920
Not every film can come out of the gates like
this.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.149
The opening segment of Pixar’s Up chronicles
the love between Carl and Ellie, as the two

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.290
childhood friends grow to become a happily
married couple dreaming of seeing the world

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.290
together.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.110
As they get older, Ellie unfortunately dies
of an undisclosed illness, leaving Carl feeling

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990
lonely and extremely sad.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.701
Nobody expected what was sold as a fun adventure
movie to start with this sequence, and the

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:57.720
results ripped our hearts right out.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.470
The beautiful musical score by Michael Giacchino
helps the scene resonate even more, and the

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.830
tears were out in full force.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.670
The Lion King

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.200
Disney has a history of emotionally devastating
the audience, and The Lion King is no exception.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.500
The scene that gets viewers all the time is
Mufasa’s death scene, with Simba trying

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.890
to wake his father up following the wildebeest
stampede.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.740
Few things are as heartbreaking as a child
telling his dead parent “You gotta get up,”

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.140
before realizing the tragedy of what has happened.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.200
Main characters dying have been a part of
films for years, and at times it’s necessary

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.340
to propel the plot forward, but it doesn’t
make scenes like this any easier to watch.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.729
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.250
After embarking on a journey across Middle
earth with Frodo and Sam, audiences became

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.610
very attached to the two friends and enjoyed
seeing them together.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.659
This is why it absolutely wrecked viewers
when at the end of Return of the King, Frodo

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.220
says farewell to his beloved companion and
sails off to the land of the elves with Gandalf.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.620
The Hobbits had been through so much together
in their quest; it was impossible to imagine

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.620
one without the other.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.810
After all, Frodo wouldn’t have made it that
far without Sam.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.390
More than a decade later, this scene still
makes fans cry.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.110
Knowing it’s coming doesn’t make it any
better.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.330
Toy Story 3

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.790
The Toy Story trilogy had plenty of emotional
moments, but few can match up to the whammies

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.520
served up in Toy Story 3.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.500
For those who grew up with the franchise,
watching Andy’s toys all hold hands in the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.890
incinerator thinking they’re about to die
is brutal, but the movie’s end had a whole

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.160
other thing coming.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.770
Before he drives off to college, Andy makes
a stop at Bonnie’s to give the young girl

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.580
his collection of toys, providing each one
with an individual introduction.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.830
By the time he gets to Woody and Buzz, it’s
more than a little dusty in the theater as

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.450
the young adults bid adieu to their childhoods.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.450
E.T.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.110
– The Extra Terrestrial

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.040
Steven Spielberg films are built on a sense
of heart, which is why the director has been

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.819
a fan-favorite for decades.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.940
One of his most popular films remains E.T.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.840
– The Extra Terrestrial, in large part because
of the bond formed between Elliot and E.T.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.530
The two helped each other in several ways,
and that made their goodbye all the more emotional.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.680
All of the kids in the movie had a tough time
seeing their friend go, but Elliot’s is

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.019
the most impactful.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.280
Just thinking about E.T. saying, “I’ll
be right here” is enough to make anyone

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.280
tear up.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.819
It’s a good thing that proposed sequel never
got off the ground.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:16.989
I Am Legend

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.659
A surefire way to get an emotional response
out of the audience is to hurt or kill an

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.030
animal, and I Am Legend served up a doozy.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.379
Dr. Robert Nevelle’s lone companion in an
abandoned New York is his German shepherd

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.530
Sam, who keeps him sane and is a loyal friend.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.489
So when Sam got attacked by some infected
dogs, viewers had to bear themselves for the

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.489
inevitable.

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.239
Noticing that his pet is going to transform
into a bloodthirsty monster, Nevelle has no

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.879
choice but to mercifully take Sam’s life.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:49.790
The pain on Will Smith’s face accurately
reflects how we feel watching this scene.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.790
Saving Private Ryan

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.520
The brotherhood between soldiers in the military
is strong, and the team shown in this modern

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.640
classic certainly feels like a family by the
end of it.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.569
Tom Hanks’ John Miller was the glue that
kept it together, always doing the right thing

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.250
and keeping his focus on the mission at hand.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.319
During the final battle when Miller met his
end, it certainly struck a chord, and even

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.640
the most-hardened men got choked up.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.069
He yearned to go back home, and now he’ll
never get that chance.

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.980
If that wasn’t enough, the time jump showing
James Ryan as an elderly man asking his wife

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.030
if he’s led a good life is all we need to
weep.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.870
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.490
Who says movie tears have to always be sad?

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.110
The return of Star Wars was a monumental occasion,
and fans got misty-eyed just from watching

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.790
the trailers for Episode 7.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.340
The scene that reduced most to giddy fanboys
was when Han Solo and Chewbacca made their

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.430
way on the Millennium Falcon for the first
time since 1983.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.630
With Han proclaiming, “Chewie, we’re home,”
millions of viewers cheered and got swept

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.710
up in the moment.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.030
No matter how many times a Star Wars fan sees
this, they’re always overcome with joy and

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.380
cry out of happiness.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.910
Few could have predicted an Episode 7 would
ever happen, which made this sweet and unbelievable.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.860
Terminator 2: Judgment Day

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.280
At the emotional core of James Cameron’s
sequel is a touching father/son dynamic between

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.550
the T-800 and young John Connor.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.780
As the cyborg protects the future savior of
humanity, they form a bond that pays off in

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.080
unexpected ways.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.780
After the T-1000 is defeated, the T-800 has
to sacrifice himself so no traces of Skynet

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.250
are left in the present day.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.860
Despite John’s pleas, there’s no other
way and the Terminator has to be terminated.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.520
As the robot gets lowered into the steel,
we’re right there with John, crying our

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.520
eyes out.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.870
The well-timed thumb’s up is a nice touch
to cap it all off.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.280
Who says cyborgs don’t have a heart?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.430
Good Will Hunting

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.889
This drama focuses on the dynamic between
the troubled Will Hunting and his therapist

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.620
Sean, who tries to help him overcome his past
traumas.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.030
After many sessions of opening up and be honest
with each other, their time comes to a close

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.009
with an emotional look at Will’s file.

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.440
Revealing that he too was the victim of physical
abuse from his father, Sean repeatedly tells

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.400
Will that none of the bad things that have
happened are his fault.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.000
That one line over and over again becomes
Will’s big breakthrough, as he’s able

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.729
to release his pain and move on with his life.

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.340
For viewers, this is a satisfying conclusion
to Will’s arc.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.229
Those are just some of the scenes that can
get moviegoers reaching for the tissues.

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:18.270
