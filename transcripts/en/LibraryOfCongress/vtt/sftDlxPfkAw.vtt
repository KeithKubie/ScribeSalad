00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:18.060
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.360
&gt;&gt; Susan Mordan White: All
right, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.010
So welcome to our 11:00 session
of docent training today.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.500
We are very happy to have
with us Janice McKelvey,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.030
who is a longtime volunteer
with the Library of Congress,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.460
and also was a volunteer over
the Capitol Visitor Center.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.330
And one of the things that
Janice took upon herself was

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.170
to find more out about
what the Library was

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.030
like when it was housed over
in the Capitol Building.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.210
So she's done an immense
amount of research on her own.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.110
She's spoken with
historians, and spent hours

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.410
over in the archives

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.370
at the Capitol putting all
this great information together

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.670
for us.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.680
So we thank Janice
for being here today,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.610
and sharing a Capitol tour
of the Library of Congress.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.910
&gt;&gt; Janice McKelvey:
Thank you, Susan.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.210
&gt;&gt; Susan Mordan White:
Thank you.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.510
&gt;&gt; Janice McKelvey: So I have
spoken with many of you all.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.850
As you all know,
I'm a coordinator,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.360
so I'll be working
with all of you.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.030
And I really, really
look forward to that.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.220
This is one of the best
times of year at the Library

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.780
with the new class graduating.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.540
It's just very exciting,
lots of fun, very festive.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.700
So, as Susan mentioned,
I was a volunteer,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.960
still a volunteer also here,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.420
but a coordinator,
an employee as well.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.940
And I did volunteer

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.810
at the Capitol Visitor
Center for several years.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.540
And actually I'm doing that
again a little bit in January.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.220
So, yes, I became really
interested in the spaces

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.470
that where the Library was in
the Capitol during that time.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.740
The main point of my
presentation, which I'll go

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.040
into in just a moment, is

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.780
that the Thomas Jefferson
Building did not spring

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.080
from the head of Zeus.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.130
There is a very rich
architectural tradition behind

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.430
the Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.100
And, so, that is my main goal.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.050
I want you to understand
that tradition.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.070
Maybe or maybe not share
it with your groups.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.370
That's fine.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.670
But it's just important
to understand

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.230
that there's a context
for this building.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.890
So let's get right to it.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.880
I acknowledge this, as I
mentioned, let me just go

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.140
through the aims
of my presentation,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.090
and also to mention
that, if it's possible,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.970
if we can hold questions
until the end,

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.620
unless I am so unintelligible
that you really need

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.780
to clarify something,
or if I make no sense.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.630
Okay? But just for time's
sake that we can do that.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.550
And then I'm happy to stay
afterwards to answer questions.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.420
And, of course, you will be
seeing me regularly in your job,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.440
your newly minted
jobs, as docents.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.840
So here's the thing.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.390
The main points of
my presentation are

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.180
that the Library of Congress
that Benjamin Latrobe,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.630
as you all know, who was the
first architect of the Capitol,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.330
started a century-long
process with Thomas Jefferson.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.850
They started architectural
and iconographic traditions

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.810
which continued through
the innovative designs

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.860
of Charles Bulfinch and Thomas
Walter, eventually resulting

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.890
in our magnificent Thomas
Jefferson Building today.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.410
These traditions include
homage and tribute

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.670
to ancient cultures'
advancements in, and methods of,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.260
the transmission of learning.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.060
Okay? The Library became
a symbol of patriotism

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.020
and accomplishment early.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.490
And I'm talking 1808.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.390
And we are going to look at
that in detail in just a moment.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.680
Careful attention to storing
and preserving printed materials

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.100
in beautiful and majestic, as
well as very functional spaces.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.970
Okay? The adaptation of
neo-classical design conventions

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.010
to American themes
and landscape,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.750
including the introduction
of Roman gods and goddesses

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.830
to celebrate American
achievement,

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.210
and the use of the
allegorical female

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.870
to represent noble
human attributes.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.180
The use of innovative and
cutting edge technology not only

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.350
to preserve the collections
and safeguard them from fire,

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.150
in particular, but
also to make the space

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.850
as noteworthy architectural
achievements.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.630
And also to provide as much
natural light as possible.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.920
There are many, many artistic
continuities between the Capitol

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.760
and the Thomas Jefferson
Building.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.800
And many of the same
artists, particularly

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.980
in the late 19th century,
early 20th century,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.560
that worked on the Jefferson
Building went on to work

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.160
at the Capitol, or
worked at the Capitol,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.460
worked at the Jefferson
Building,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.760
and went back and forth.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.920
So I will talk about
that as I go along, too.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.990
So those are the main
aims of my presentation.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.100
Let's start on in.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.890
Okay. Thomas Jefferson brings
neo-classical architecture

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.490
to the United States.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.880
This is, again, as he did
this in the early 1800s,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.310
this is a tradition that, of
course, we live with today.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.050
He designed the very
first expression

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.570
of neo-classical architecture,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.520
which is the Virginia
State Capitol right here.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.620
And indeed he ripped off
this design completely

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.070
from the Maison Cafe,
which is in Nimes, France.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.060
So he just took the
Maison Cafe and lifted it,

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.860
and put it in Richmond, Virginia
as the Virginia State Capitol.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.730
In a letter to Pierre
L'Enfant, 1791,

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.530
Jefferson expressed a desire

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.010
for a Capitol building designed
after, quote, "One of the models

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.590
of antiquity which have
had the approbation

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.430
of thousands of years."

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.100
Jefferson believed that American
taste could improve by exposure

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.190
to copies of classical
Roman architecture adapted

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.780
to our new country.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.330
He also believed that the
Capitol could provide the

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.960
premier example of architecture
in the United States.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.640
And he hoped this style would be
copied throughout the country.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.530
And, of course, as we all know,
it was to a certain extent.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.160
He put a huge amount of
care and attention to detail

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.460
in the design of the Capitol.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.110
Some scholars say as much
as he did to Monticello.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.410
I'm not sure.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.710
But it's important
for you all to know

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.610
that that he was
extremely detail oriented

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.320
in making those decisions.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.390
In 1807, Benjamin Latrobe
writes to Thomas Jefferson,

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.100
and I quote, "It is no
flattery to say that YOU,"

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.390
and the caps are
Latrobe's, y, o, u, in caps,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.880
"have planted the
arts in your country.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.810
The works already erected in
this city are the monuments

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.390
of your judgment and of
your zeal and of your taste.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.910
The first," and again
the caps are Latrobe's,

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.590
"sculpture that adorned an
American public building

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.700
perpetuates your love and
protection of the arts."

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.090
Okay? So Thomas Jefferson has a
role in our Jefferson Building

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.600
that is quite apart
from the Library.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.150
What he is doing is
establishing a tradition

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.010
which then is carried through
into our building today,

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.130
and its design and construction.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.470
Okay. So let's start
at the beginning.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.380
William Thornton is the very
first architect of the Capitol.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.240
In 1797, much of the
central facade of Thornton,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.820
today central facade
particularly on the east side,

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.010
is Thornton's other works
in our area, of course,

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.420
and by Thornton our Octagon
House and Tudor Place

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.390
and Woodlawn Plantation.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.240
By the way, he was born
in 1759 in Jost Van Dyke

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.760
in the British Virgin Islands.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.980
He was a physician, an inventor,
a painter and an architect.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.730
And his design for the Capitol
was indeed accepted in 1793.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:32.140
He was inspired by the Louvre
and also by the Pantheon.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.680
And this is his original design.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.980
This dome, as you know,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.650
is definitely not the
dome we have today.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.160
But this facade is the facade
that really remains today.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160
Can everybody see my cursor?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.350
Okay. So the original
north wing of the Library.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.840
You may be familiar
with this print.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.130
This is the William
Russell Birch drawing.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.430
Very, very famous.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.370
I think it's even
still on display

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.740
and opposite Jefferson's
Library.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.040
So here we are.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.330
This is the east
front, northeast front,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.840
where the Senate is today.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.780
This is the Senate
wing looking west.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.810
So this is down the mall.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.130
Are we clear?

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.340
Okay. Now here this
photograph was taken

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.060
by me in January of 2016.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:25.140
So the Library of Congress
was originally located

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.440
in these offices.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.990
And just to orient you,
you can see the dome.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.290
We are now looking west.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.670
So this is the west front.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:33.970
Excuse me.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.270
We're looking east.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.250
This is the west front
that faces the mall.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.530
Is everybody okay?

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.000
So the Library of Congress
was originally located

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.770
in this space.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.930
And it is indeed difficult

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.650
to overstate the
importance of that space.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.680
By the way, today, and for many
years, it has been the offices

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.470
of the Republican
Senate leadership.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.710
Of course, today is
Senator McConnell.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.740
Okay. So here we
have a floor plan.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.350
This is a configuration
that was done by Bill Allen

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.640
and his seminal work
on the Capitol.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.850
So, again, this is that west
Senate front where the Library

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.270
of Congress was located,
the Clerk of the House,

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.530
and so forth, the
Senate gallery level,

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.830
[inaudible] hall, et cetera.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.460
Now, again, it is hard

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.390
to overstate the
importance of these rooms.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.720
First of all, the House of
Representatives first met here,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.230
gaveled to order, on
November the 17th 1800

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.250
by Theodore Sedgwick
of Massachusetts.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.160
The Library of Congress
was established there.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.420
The election of 1800,
the very famous election

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.590
of Thomas Jefferson as
president, was decided.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.770
Remember that election
was thrown

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.070
to the House of Representatives.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.530
So these rooms not only home
to the Library of Congress,

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.410
but many, many important
historical events

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.710
happened there.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.190
And also the Supreme Court

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.870
and the Senate shared
this space as well.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.040
Okay?

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.780
Senator McConnell's staff
very graciously let me

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.520
in their reception area.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.860
I took these pictures
before the inauguration.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.270
So actually in the reception
room looking down the mall.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.240
This is the construction of the
bleachers for the inauguration.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.320
This is the reception area.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.910
The staff, bless their hearts,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.100
said that this fireplace
that's there was original,

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.340
and survived the burning
of the Capitol in 1914.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.160
Not totally clear on that.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.270
But that's what they told me,
so I'll just go with that not.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.150
Not sure though.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.750
Next, we have Benjamin
Latrobe becomes architect

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.310
of the Capitol, indeed
before the fire.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:49.070
Benjamin Latrobe an absolute
genius architect, engineer,

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.970
artist, absolutely
brilliant man.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.320
He was born in Yorkshire,
England.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.680
One of the first formally
trained architects

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.020
in the United States.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.010
He was also a painter,
by the way.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.840
He traveled widely throughout
Europe, mastered German, French,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.940
ancient and modern
Greek, and Latin.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.120
He emigrated to the U.S.
in 1796, designed the Bank

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.780
of Pennsylvania, as you
see here, the first example

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.710
of Greek Revival architecture
in the United States.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.420
He also designed the
Baltimore Basilica,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.490
the first Roman Catholic
cathedral in the United States.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.980
You can see similarities
with Jefferson--

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.940
that education, that
travel in Europe.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.240
All of those things.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.540
You just know immediately

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.010
that these two are
going to become friends.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.890
And, indeed, their
partnership lives with us today.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.250
Their partnership, as we
will see, affects a lot

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.330
of the decisions that went into
the Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:46.100
He worked on the Capitol from
1803 until the war of 1812,

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.050
and then again starting in 1815.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.570
Other notable buildings
by Latrobe

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.050
in our area include St.
John's Episcopal Church

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.590
on Lafayette Square, St. Paul's
in my hometown of Alexandria,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.310
of course, the Baltimore
Basilica,

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.610
which I just referenced.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.200
This is widely regarded

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.540
as his real masterpiece
in this country.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.810
And then also I love the
gate to the Navy Yard,

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.260
right down the street from us.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.790
Next. All right.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.900
So this is the picture,
this is the rendering,

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.590
this is the drawing that really
inspired so much of my research.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.400
This is Benjamin Latrobe's
original design for the Library

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.680
of Congress space
in the Capitol.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.800
So where I showed you
where I oriented you

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.900
to Senator McConnell's offices,
this is Latrobe's vision

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.520
of what the Library
would be in the Capitol.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.870
It is a grand space referencing
a great culture of the past.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.290
In this case, ancient Egypt.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.490
This room is the first
Egyptian revival proposal

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:56.790
in the United States.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.670
[inaudible] Latrobe brings
which becomes, by the way,

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.020
very popular after this.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.320
This is the first example

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.180
of an Egyptian revival
room in the United States.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.130
Its innovative and unusual
architectural design features

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.770
exotic Papyrus columns.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.940
Look at these blade columns.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.180
Papyrus. This is
referencing ancient Egypt,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.570
but also Egypt's
contribution to writing,

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.050
and to the written word.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.170
And, of course, we see that
in the Jefferson Building

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.630
in our beautiful
Blashfield mural.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.620
So here we have these
exotic Papyrus columns.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.160
Note the sunlight coming in.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.410
So he's all about natural
light coming into the Library.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.230
He's got meticulous detail.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.070
Look at the fireplace
with the map

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.860
over it, the alcoves of books.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.670
Latrobe designed this
Library to fit 40,000 volumes.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:47.580
Okay? He was probably inspired
by Napoleon's conquest of Egypt,

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.520
but also perhaps by the
architecture of Freemasonry.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.580
Anybody who is familiar with
Freemasonry architecture,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.300
particularly, I would cite
the George Washington National

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.720
Masonic Memorial in
Alexandria, and, of course,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.780
the temple on 16th Street.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.620
A lot of Egyptian architecture
and references in Freemasonry.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.770
So according to Pamela Scott
in an article for, actually,

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:15.830
the Library of Congress
magazine, this was in 1995,

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.410
and the title of the article
is called "Temple of Liberty:

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.240
Building a Capitol
for a New Nation."

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.180
And I quote Pamela Scott,
"During the first five years

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.150
of Latrobe's tenure he
established that the Capitol was

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.300
to be a living catalog

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.240
of Western European
architectural traditions,

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.200
including American
contributions.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.680
The most exotic was his Egyptian
revival Library of Congress.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.520
Latrobe's curiosity

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.940
about ancient Egyptian
architecture was probably both

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.960
stimulated by Napoleon's
Egyptian campaigns of 1798

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.830
and '99, had the
Library been finished.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.180
This room was never built.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.550
Sadly it was never built.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.240
Latrobe's north wing,
so that whole north wing

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.030
that I showed you
in my photograph,

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.230
would have housed
Greek Doric columns

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.800
in the old Supreme Court below,
Ionic columns in the Senate,

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.500
columns, caryatids, three
American orders of columns,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.600
exotic lotus and Papyrus
columns of the Library.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.350
So what Latrobe was
doing was mixing

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.690
and matching American
themes along

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.670
with ancient architectural
traditions.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.210
According to ancient Renaissance
architectural theory,

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.120
and I'm quoting Pamela
Scott again,

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.910
"Columns represented peoples.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.020
Perhaps Latrobe intended
his variety of columns

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:38.680
as a symbolic statement about
America's diverse population.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:45.490
"Okay. So cavetto cornices, this
is one architectural feature,

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.650
again, had not been done.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.040
These are his cavetto cornices.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.620
I had no idea what a cavetto
cornice was, so I looked it up.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.810
And here are some in the
Temple of Isis in Egypt.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.860
So this is what this looks like.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:01.950
And, of course, he's also paying
homage to the Ancient Library

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:05.850
of Alexandria in Egypt.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:13.550
Okay. Now these are some
very beloved features

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.850
that are in the Capitol still.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.150
As a matter of fact,

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.300
what Benjamin Latrobe does is
taking ancient architectural

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.340
traditions, and Americanizing
them.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.900
Very famously, the
Corn Cob Capitals,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.850
which you can see
in the Senate foyer.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.250
We also have tobacco
leaves right here.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.560
This is in the Senate Rotunda.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.500
And we have Water Leaf
Capitals in the Senate gallery.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.800
These were never built.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.230
But what I'm trying to show you
is how Latrobe has taken ancient

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.510
traditions and Americanized
them in his vision.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:48.950
Now this is his, I love this,
this is his west front design

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:54.600
for the Capitol, and with
the propylaea, again,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.280
sort of referencing
ancient Greece.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.640
And this is the very first
rendering that I can find

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.440
of Minerva-Athena
on Capitol Hill.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:08.220
This is Latrobe's vision of
what Athena, and what she was

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.220
to be done, she was to be placed
right here on the west front.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.880
So this begins the very
long tradition, as you know,

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.340
of Minerva appearing on
Capitol Hill, or Athena,

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.740
depending on how you look at it.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.690
So moving.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.520
Now let's go to the fire.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:32.970
Indeed. I am going to quote
the architecture, excuse me,

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.080
the architect of
the Capitol website

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.090
in a description of the fire.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.590
This is the best I found.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.760
And this dispels a lot
of myths that, indeed,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.030
a lot of us were taught, a lot
of us who have been docents

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.860
for a while, a lot
of us were taught.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:50.360
So just take careful
attention on the order

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.340
in which the British
go through the Capitol.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.550
If you hear, which I
still do, Capitol guides

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.120
and other tour guides
say that the Library

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.250
of Congress books
were transported

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.420
to what it's now Statuary
Hall and used as kindling,

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.100
that is absolutely false.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.400
Absolutely false.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.700
So it's up to you as
to whether you want

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.080
to correct our colleagues
or not on that.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.960
So I am going to
quote the architect

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.540
of the Capitol website.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.260
"The British focused
their destructive work

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.200
on the principal rooms
forgoing the lobbies,

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.920
halls and staircases.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.920
Thus securing their
escape route.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.700
In the south wing, soldiers
ignited a giant bonfire."

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.360
So here we are, the south
wing, "Giant bonfire

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.620
of furniture slathered with
gunpowder paste in the Hall

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.920
of the House

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.890
of Representatives,"
now Statuary Hall.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.800
"The heat from the
fire grew so intense

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.880
that it melted the glass
skylights, and destroyed much

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.260
of the carved stone in the room,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.240
including Giuseppe Franzoni's
life-size marble statue

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.170
of Liberty," which we'll
talk about in a moment.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.940
It's located above
the speaker's rostrum.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.830
"Downstairs the Clerk's office
was transformed into an inferno

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.520
of burning documents
and furniture.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.220
The fire produced a heat so
great that it forced the British

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.850
to retreat from the south
wing, leaving half the rooms

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.150
on the first floor unscathed."

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:13.620
Okay? "In the Supreme Court
chamber, on the first floor

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.950
of the north wing, which
is right here, troops piled

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.340
up furniture from nearby rooms

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:22.400
to create another great bonfire
severely damaging the Doric

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.700
stone columns.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.380
Upstairs the large room,
that then housed the Library

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.730
of Congress," which remember
this is looking west,

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.590
so the Library of Congress
we can't see from here,

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:36.730
because this is the eastern
rooms, "Upstairs the large room,

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.680
that then housed the Library
of Congress's collection

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.370
of over 3,000 books, served
as ready stockpile of fuel.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.660
The space burned so fiercely
that it endangered a portion

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.470
of the exterior stone wall.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.390
From the Library wind
spread from the flames

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:54.020
to the Senate chamber," which
was essentially right in here,

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:59.010
"where damage to the art and
architecture was severe."

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.310
So clearly, as you know,

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.050
the fire was obviously
extremely destructive.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.900
But it could have
been much worse.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.220
And I would need to pay
tribute to Benjamin Latrobe,

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.520
also to the rainstorm.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.910
You all may know
that a rainstorm

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.820
within 24 hours helped
to put out the fire.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:17.200
But Latrobe insisted on marble
and stone for the Capitol,

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.710
at great expense, by the way.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.890
But that was an insistence
on fireproof materials

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:26.280
for the Capitol, too, in
the eventualities of fire.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:32.960
So, as you know, surviving
the 1814 fire in the Capitol,

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.540
the old Supreme Court
technically did survive.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.930
This is, again, one of
Latrobe's masterpieces.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.880
This ceiling is unbelievable.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.190
It survived, but he
deemed it unsafe.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.080
And, so, it was rebuilt.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.480
Also these columns,
as we've seen.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.630
And then this is the
foyer as you walk

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.480
into the north wing,
that Senate foyer.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.780
This all survived the fire.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.520
And actually this was an
escape route for the British.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:04.420
After the Capitol burns, of
course, Congress relocates

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.780
to Blodgett's Hotel, I'm sure
you all have studied about that,

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.090
which wasn't a hotel at all.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.700
And then eventually, in July
1815, the cornerstone is laid

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.730
for the old brick
Capitol, which is located

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.880
where the Supreme
Court is today.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:26.980
Okay now. So rebuilding
the Capitol after the fire.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.410
This statue is magnificent.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:34.660
And it is still in
the old Supreme Court.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.560
It is representative of a
decision that was made in 1805

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.070
after a particularly generous
appropriation from Congress.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.760
Latrobe and Thomas Jefferson
decide that the Capitol,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.680
they decided together, that the
Capitol would indeed incorporate

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.630
themes from ancient
Greece and Rome.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:59.760
Okay? And, so, in doing so what
they did was they wrote a friend

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.200
of Jefferson's, a man named
Philip Mazzei, who was in Italy,

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.650
and they arranged for the
transportation of a number

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.240
of sculptors from Italy
to the United States,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.500
including the Franzoni brothers.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:17.960
Now Giuseppe Franzoni came
up with a plan for a statue

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.250
like this before
the fire of 1814.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.840
But, unfortunately,
it was not executed.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.430
After the fire he
had passed away.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.970
So his brother Carlo,
actually, finishes this statue.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:33.760
It is called "Justice."

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.110
It is in 1817.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.370
And it's still in the
old Supreme Court.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.360
Now a lot of elements in
this statue, or this group

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.830
of figures I should say,

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.490
carry through to the
Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.490
So right away there are
a number of innovations

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:55.770
that Giuseppe Franzoni
decides to incorporate.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:00.710
Number one, here we have Justice
as a seated female figure,

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.050
or as a female figure
with her scales.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.830
Heretofore, Justice had had,

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.290
as you've probably
seen, a blindfold.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.780
But Franzoni decides to
turn this around completely

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.610
on its end, and clear-eyed
Justice.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.340
This is one of the first
examples that we can find,

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.480
certainly in the United States,
where Justice is clear-eyed.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.600
And scholars have
interpreted this

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.030
as in America Justice's
clear-eyed,

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:29.440
she doesn't need a
blindfold to be impartial.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.740
She is clear-eyed.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.040
She knows what she's doing.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.510
She will always be fair

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:38.010
and execute justice
clear-eyed without a blindfold.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:46.210
Also, heretofore, here we
have before, as you all know,

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.830
Minerva, or Athena Minerva, is
usually depicted with an owl.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:54.710
But here the owl is
seated with Justice.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.370
The owl is with Justice.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:02.150
And, indeed, the books,
Wisdom, has an American Eagle.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.200
So, again, we are taking ancient
Greek and Roman traditions

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.010
and Americanizing them.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:11.090
So in this statue the learning

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.700
and education is
really the property,

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.120
if you will, of America.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.310
In other words, we're
taking that

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.260
and mixing up those metaphors.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.170
So here we have Justice with
her new clear-eyed fashion,

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.840
with her scales.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.140
She also has the sword,
which we see later.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.490
She's looking towards a
[inaudible]-eyed figure,

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:36.790
a genius figure.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.090
And we all I'm sure know

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.640
about Philip Martiny's
magnificent genius figures

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.940
in the Great Hall.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.170
Here is a male genius
figure with wings with a

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.830
of the United States
Constitution,

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.580
and the light of truth.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:54.070
So this statue begins so
many icons that are present

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.130
in Capitol Hill and
America, and certainly

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.650
in the Thomas Jefferson
Building.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.480
This is 1817.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.700
Next, we have Liberty
by Enrico Causici.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:09.430
The original Liberty statue
burned during the fire

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.780
of 1814, but it was rebuilt.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.630
This is in Statuary Hall today.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.200
It's almost 14 feet high.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.450
This is an allegorical
female representing liberty,

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.170
holding the Constitution
in her right hand,

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:25.000
and an American Eagle
to her right.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.880
The serpent representing
wisdom on her left wrapped

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.810
around a column section.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:34.070
This replaced Giuseppe
Franzoni's seated Liberty,

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:36.500
as I mentioned, that
was destroyed by fire.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.400
And this isn't plaster,
by the way.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.080
There were always intentions
to make this in marble,

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.880
or to copy it and
make it in marble.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.180
But it never happened.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.990
However, Clio, if you
go to Statuary Hall,

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.160
one of the most beloved statues,
actually, in the building.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.460
I love Clio.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.010
And we owe a lot to Clio for
the Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.770
Here we have Clio,
the muse of History,

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.190
standing on her winged
chariot, or car.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.400
That's why it's called
the "Car of History."

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.140
The car stands on a marble
globe, where the signs

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.240
of the zodiac are
carved in relief.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.400
The chariot wheel is
the face of a clock.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.750
The workings of which
were installed

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.460
by the very famous clock
maker Simon Willard in 1834.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.320
She's turning the
pages of a book,

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.020
representing the importance of
learning throughout history.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.820
I hope these themes are
sounding familiar to you.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:28.310
George Washington is
on here on relief,

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.500
one of the very first
examples in the United States

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:36.100
of a real historic figure
connected to an allegorical one.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.630
And, again, I hope
this sounds familiar.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.340
Clio was commissioned
for the House chamber.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.940
And she stays there today.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:51.520
So here we have Charles
Bulfinch who is hired

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.550
to redesign the Capitol
after the fire.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.010
He is most famous for the
Massachusetts Statehouse,

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:58.310
you may know.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.270
He was born in Boston in 1763.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.500
He died in 1844.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.850
His most famous commission,
as I mentioned, the Statehouse

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:09.060
of Massachusetts
of 1795 to 1798.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.980
That's quite a bit before
when he comes to Washington.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.170
He's hired by President James
Monroe and the Commissioner

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.940
of Public Buildings in 1818
to replace Benjamin Latrobe

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.000
as the architect of the Capitol.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.830
He continued the
restoration of the two wings,

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.420
which were reopened in 1819.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.530
He designed the domed
center of the Capitol,

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:33.590
and oversaw its construction
between 1818 and 1826.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.560
Andrew Jackson terminated
his employment

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.590
and the position in 1829.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:44.620
And, so, here we have Charles
Bulfinch's finished Capitol

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.390
design as of 1832.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.910
Now here we have the east
front of the U.S. Capitol.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:54.210
This is by John Rubens Smith.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.950
So today our Library would
essentially be right here,

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.250
the Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.070
This is the east front.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:04.020
And then, of course,
here is the west front.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.810
Now, 1832, notice that
there's cows and pigs grazing,

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:12.300
and the trees, and the bucolic
setting that the Capitol was in.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.310
What I'm about to show
you is Bulfinch's design

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:19.160
for the Library of Congress,
which is now moved from here,

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:25.350
from this north wing, it's moved
to the center, to the center.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:29.340
And here is his design.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:34.440
Now this is the only extant
drawing of Bulfinch's Library.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.370
The only extant drawing.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.690
Note it's a grand
magnificent space.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:43.320
In its day it also was
a tourist destination.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.190
It is finished in 1824.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.600
Bulfinch is very,
very aware of fire

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.750
and how books provide
excellent kindling.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.360
So he designed a stove,
this is his drawing,

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.940
a stove that is vented,
actually, out through the floor,

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.450
that has no flames,
here it is, for warmth.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:06.300
And I'm going to quote William
Allen right now, who wrote,

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:10.260
as I said, the seminal work on
the construction of the Capitol,

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.630
or one of the seminal works,
actually, the most recent."

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:15.190
These columns were
designed after the Tower

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:16.710
of the Winds in Greece.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.190
Each Capitol took
over 40 days to carve.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.860
The Library was designed to
hold 40,000 books arranged

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.230
in deep alcoves off
the main level,

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:30.170
and shallow alcoves here."

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:33.180
George Waterston, who, actually,
was Librarian of Congress,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.820
one of our Librarians of
Congress, but he then,

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.970
this is afterwards, in
1842 he writes a guide

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.040
to Washington, like
a travel guide.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.100
And I'm quoting him.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.160
Quote, "Several presents
have been made

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.510
to the Library since its origin.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.720
Among these there was a
splendid and valuable collection

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.340
of medals designed by [foreign
name], and executed by order

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.640
of the French government.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.340
The series commences in
1796, and ends in 1815,

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.430
and embraces all the
battles and events

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.080
which occurred during
the reign of Napoleon."

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.090
"Marble bust of Washington,
Jefferson, Lafayette,

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.190
Judge Marshall, John
Quincy Adams, Van Buren,

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:14.750
and plaster busts of Jackson
and [inaudible], and a medallion

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.460
of Madison, most of them
standing on pedestals,

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.450
are placed in different
parts of the room."

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:25.170
So the key point that that
account gives you is the Library

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.200
is a space to receive gifts
from foreign governments,

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.520
it's a space, which we
heard about a little bit

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.680
with Elizabeth [inaudible]
presentation, it's a space

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.730
to receive gifts and to display
important statues and icons

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.540
and art, particularly related
to American patriotism.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.060
Okay? Now another first-hand
account, Robert Mills,

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.800
architect of, I hope you
know, the Treasury Building,

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.080
so many buildings in Washington.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.660
And I'm quoting Robert Mills.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:02.230
"A melancholy reminiscence, over
the mantelpiece at the south end

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:07.170
of the room, a fine portrait of
Columbus and America's Vespucci.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.170
On each of side door leading

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.760
to the balcony are two
beautiful marble busts,

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.700
one of Thomas Jefferson by the
celebrated Giuseppe Ceracchi."

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.850
The Jefferson bust had on
its pedestal cherub heads

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:24.050
and the signs of the zodiac, and
an inscription in Latin saying,

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:28.470
quote, "To the supreme
order of the universe

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.880
under whose watchful
care the liberties

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.420
of North America were
finally achieved,

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.430
and whose tutelage the name

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:40.730
of Thomas Jefferson will descend
forever blessed to posterity."

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:43.460
I love that quote.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.070
Can you tell?

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.240
Important to note that in
Bulfinch's Library volumes were

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.080
arranged according to Thomas
Jefferson's original scheme.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.590
Okay? Memory, reason
and imagination.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.150
Very important to understand

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:01.000
by his original scheme
and classification.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.990
Okay. And another date,
I'm hoping you all remember

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.070
in your tours, is 1851,
the major fire that,

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:12.340
just for the record, it had
nothing to do with Thomas,

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.710
excuse me, Charles Bulfinch.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:18.980
It was caused by a chimney
that backed up onto the Library

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.560
that was not properly
maintained by Congress.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.560
There's a lot of documentation
about writing letters--

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.560
this chimney is dangerous,
there's a hole,

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.860
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:32.440
And sure enough sparks flew
through the hole in the chimney,

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:38.070
entered the wall of the Library,
and things went on from there.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.440
Okay. So, as you all know,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.680
two-thirds of Jefferson's
books are burned,

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.660
two-thirds of the
library is burned,

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.970
Charles Bulfinch's
magnificent structure is gone.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:54.000
Enter Thomas Ustick Walter,
again, an architectural genius,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.280
born in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.310
He received early
training in masonry.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.840
His father was a Mason, and
he was also a Freemason,

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.510
as was Benjamin Latrobe.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.670
He apprenticed in the Office
of William Strickland.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:11.170
He was fourth architect of
the Capitol from 1851 to 1865.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.350
Next to the Capitol,
his most famous

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:18.710
and acclaimed building is
Girard College, among the last

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.040
and grandest examples

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.890
of the Greek Revival
movement in the United States.

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:25.040
He was one of the founders
and the second president

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.540
of the American Institute
of Architects.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.330
He was architect of the Capitol

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:34.010
when the 1851 fire
consumed the Library.

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:35.770
And, so, he is tasked

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.850
with rebuilding the
Library of Congress.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:44.590
So here is his floorplan
that he comes up with.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:49.000
And, so, just to orient you all,
here is the Capitol Rotunda.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.990
He designs a Library here.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.990
This is the central section,
so this is the very center

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.790
where Bulfinch's
Library was located.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:01.440
He also designs a north
wing and a south wing,

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.210
and then with reading rooms and
committee rooms for Congress.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.510
Are we oriented?

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:10.410
So this is the west center,
west facade of the Capitol.

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:11.710
Are we clear?

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.760
Okay. Excellent.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.880
Okay. Here are some
of his renderings.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.150
So this is south looking north.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.790
So this is a cross-section,
south looking north.

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:26.590
This is that main central space
that I'm just about to show you.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.070
And here is another one.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:32.330
The main central space,
north wing and south wing.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:37.400
Now, just to clarify, the main
central space was constructed,

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:42.620
as we'll see finished in
1852, actually in 1853.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.370
The north and south
wings were not done

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:47.230
until after the Civil War.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.470
Okay. So moving right along.

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:50.770
All right.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.730
Get comfy for a moment
because we are looking

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:57.680
at Walters' design
for the Library

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.020
of Congress as it was built up.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:04.620
But these are original drawings.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.920
We are looking at one

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.410
of the greatest architectural
masterpieces

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:10.410
in the United States
at the time.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:11.760
No question about it.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.080
It took him only three
weeks after the 1851 fire

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.290
to design one of the most
extraordinary examples

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:18.930
in American architecture.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.570
And I'm going to quote
Bill Allen again.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:24.740
Quote, "A sparkling
incombustible cast iron Library

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.960
free of any wood, except for
might be used for furnishing."

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.550
So while this was not
the very first iron room

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:35.100
in the United States, it
was one of the very first.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.600
It also had the very first
iron roof in the United States.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.670
The entire thing is iron.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:44.450
Okay? It is open to great
acclaim to the general public

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:48.840
on August the 23rd, 1853,
and was an amazing feat

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.450
of design and construction.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.330
Finished in 18 months.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.670
In a letter to the Secretary of
the Interior at the end of 1852,

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:59.610
Walters describes
the color scheme.

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:01.430
And I quote.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:06.070
"All of the plain surfaces of
the ceiling, both horizontal

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:09.650
and vertical, to be gilded
in three shades of gold leaf,

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:13.060
so disposed as to give
effects to the depth

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.030
and effects to the panels.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.650
All the ornamental
moldings, pendants and drops

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:21.150
of the ceiling to be
finished in gold bronze,

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.120
and the prominent parts
to be tipped with gold,

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.840
burnished so as to produce
decided and sparkling effect

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.230
against the dead gold surfaces."

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.500
By the way, these are
all skylights here.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.070
So the ceiling he's
referencing is this.

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:36.410
"The large consoles,"
each of which, by the way,

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:41.260
weighed three tons, they're
here, okay, "The large consoles

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:44.470
to be painted in light bronze
green, tipped with gold bronze,

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:46.960
and burnished gold for the
purpose of giving relief

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.960
to the fruits and foliage.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.190
All of the cases, railings
and remaining iron were

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:54.660
to be finished with light gold
bronze, tipped on all the parts

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.100
which received the strongest
light with burnished gold."

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.560
Have you counted the
number of shades of gold?

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.130
Eleven. Okay.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.280
It must have looked
like Eldorado.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.890
It must have looked, seriously.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:12.200
And here is a picture
of the finished product.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.580
Most of the photographs
I'm going

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.240
to show you are maddeningly
undated.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.430
This has been a real
challenge to me

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:21.020
as a researcher,
very, very difficult.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.760
In general what I have
done is I'm assuming

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.280
that the more pristine the
photograph, like this one,

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.860
the less clutter, the less
stuff, is before 1870.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.160
And you all know why.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.340
After 1870 things
clutter up very quickly.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:43.670
Okay? So the photographs
you're going to see I culled

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.470
from New York Public Library,
from Architect of the Capitol,

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.570
from the U.S. Capitol
Historical Society,

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.410
and our own collections.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.630
So it opens, as I mentioned,
in 1853 to great acclaim.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.100
Let's look at some of
the contemporary accounts

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.260
of what people are saying
about Walters' masterpiece.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.020
The Daily National
Intelligencer,

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.180
August 15th, 1853.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.960
Quote, "The Congress
Library will be in order

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.320
for the Tuesday opening when the
public will be admitted to one

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.310
of the most gorgeous and
beautiful halls in the world.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:16.380
At first view of this enchanting
room, thousands will experience,

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.790
as we did, a glow of
rapturous delight,

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:22.870
not unmixed with something
of a selfish sentiment

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:25.070
of congratulations
that as citizens

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:28.520
of Washington we are endowed
with so great a privilege

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.830
as this Library affords,

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:35.270
a source of national
pride and patriotism."

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:36.570
Sound familiar?

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.570
I hope. Next, the evening star.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.980
Quote, "The Congressional
Library room, a grand affair,

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.140
this morning the newly built
and splendid reorganized Library

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.290
of Congress was thrown
open to the public.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.810
And a large number of ladies
and gentlemen availed themselves

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.060
of the opportunity
to take a look at it.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.520
It is a gorgeous hall indeed.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.440
And it is fitted up in a style
of unequaled magnificence.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.270
Every article of furniture
and other workmanship is

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:03.600
of American manufacture."

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.610
Again, source of
pride and patriotism.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:10.350
And, next, "Life in
Washington, Life Here and There"

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:11.650
by Mary Jones [inaudible].

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.420
So, again, we're back
in the travelogue mode.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.980
"Life Here and There."

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.360
This is October of 1857.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.280
"There is hardly any object
in our city more suggestive

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.940
or more frequented than the
magnificent reading room

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.660
of the Library of Congress.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.120
Designed by eminent
architecture Mr. Walter,

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.340
whose glass ceiling veined by
cornicing, fluting in garlands,

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.210
seems bright like burnished
gold mingled in wreaths

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.410
of gilded leaves and lilies.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:42.740
When we paid our last visit, we
found it gaily peopled as usual.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:46.140
Couch is filled with groups
conversing in customary library

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.290
under tone, which is, of
course, a drowsy murmur.

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.590
In spite of the early hour,

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:55.480
we saw in the various
alcoves scores of mute readers

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.060
who sometimes lifted up
a glance as we passed,

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:05.130
and then like Dante's ghosts
relapsed into their penance."

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.430
Now I love that.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.290
"Dante's ghost relapsed
into their penance."

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:11.590
Note what is missing here.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:14.860
And note the differences between
this, the Bulfinch Library and,

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.820
indeed, some of like the Thomas
Jefferson Building today.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.990
Note the absence of
lots of decoration.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:23.850
You are not seeing
statuary here.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:27.770
Clearly the Walters'
Library the stars

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:31.190
of the show are the
iron and the books.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:32.800
The iron and the books.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.670
He is not going into
that ancient Roman

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:37.970
and Greek tradition.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:39.400
We do have the lilies
and the garlands,

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.700
and all those kinds of things.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.800
But we don't have
representational sculpture.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.560
We don't have displays here.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.690
It's a masterpiece
in and of itself.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.690
The star of the show--
the iron and the books.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:55.140
Now here are other photographs.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.550
This, indeed, is the north
wing after the Civil War.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:00.560
I know that it's north wing.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.020
I'm surmising that, oh, I
know it's after the Civil War,

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.460
because the north
wing wasn't done then.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.180
But I believe this was taken
probably on the opening

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.630
of the north wing,
because it was the first

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.440
to open, because it's empty.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.170
It's totally empty.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:16.720
And note, this is
very important,

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.350
Walters' original drawings
only had three stories.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.170
But things are already
starting to happen,

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:27.310
because we have a fourth story
here, okay, that was built out.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:34.330
And this, I am 99% sure, I've
done a lot of research on this,

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.030
this is the south wing.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:37.480
This had not been identified.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.310
This was not identified
as the south wing.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:41.730
But, as we'll see later on,
I took other photographs

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.160
that I know were the south wing
after it's demolished, and,

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.120
indeed, I matched
up the windows.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.700
So this is the south wing.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:54.100
Okay? This is as we move along.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.390
You will see there's a reference

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.640
to Librarian Spofford's
table here.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.280
And note all the
books underneath.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.540
So this is Spofford's desk.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:07.970
And we'll see in
photographs as we go along.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:14.060
Okay? There's a long story with
this, which I won't go into.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.170
The point of this though is
I thought this was later.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:22.310
I thought this was probably
around 1870 or 1869.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:26.360
But what's really interesting,
and important from my research,

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.510
is that the Library is now,
for the first time, a display.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.330
There's this painting
randomly on display.

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.970
So I started researching,
"What in the world is this?

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.270
Who did it?

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.570
Why is it there?"

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:39.870
So I'll shorten the story.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.600
Happy to go into
it in more detail.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.900
But here's the deal.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.480
It's Albert Bierstadt's
Mount Hood.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.830
And this was painted in 1865.

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:53.020
Albert Bierstadt, you may or
may not know, has two paintings

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:58.420
in the Capitol, which I'm going
to skip ahead for a moment,

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.670
two paintings in the Capitol--
the "Discovery of the Hudson"

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.100
and "Entrance into Monterey."

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:07.890
And if you go to the
Capitol on the east side,

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:11.850
the south east steps, that
magnificent staircase,

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:15.420
these two paintings
are on display.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.920
It's a long story.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.740
But Albert Bierstadt had
a ten-year-long campaign

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:24.430
to get commissioned to
do art in the Capitol.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.920
What he was trying to do
was follow in the footsteps

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.920
of his mentor Emanuel Leutze's

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.990
"Westward Course Empire Takes
Its Way," which was commissioned

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:37.880
in 1862, this is Montgomery
Meigs helping this,

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.360
and William Henry Powell's
"Battle of Lake Erie."

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.710
Both of these are
also still on display.

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:46.520
And those two artists received
really expensive commissions.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.650
So Bierstadt decides, Well, of
course, I should get one, too."

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:53.110
So there's wonderful
correspondence.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:56.060
He becomes friends with
congressmen at that time

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.760
and Senator Rutherford B. Hayes,

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.130
which we all know
what happens to him.

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:02.700
So Bierstadt goes on a
campaign to get commissioned.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:07.970
So it is my theory that,
as part of his campaign,

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:11.690
he has Mount Hood
displayed in the Library

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:14.430
so to give Congress
the opportunity

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:17.210
to see and sample his work.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:19.300
Fortunately, I've done
a lot of research.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.330
The Portland Museum of Art, by
the way, now has this painting.

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:24.180
I was in touch with
the curators.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.540
And, so, now I can date
this photograph to 1866,

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.500
because that is the
time Bierstadt was here

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.540
and after the painting was done.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.960
So an interesting story.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.120
And, actually, there's
some further research

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.710
to be done on that.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:43.370
So, as we have talked about,
the Library is a destination.

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:44.670
It's a tourist destination.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:48.320
Harper's Weekly has
several renderings taken

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.620
from photographs.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.990
This one I just love in 1871.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:56.470
This is right before, of course,
the march to declutter happens.

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:57.770
I love this.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:59.510
This is undated.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:03.860
But there's a handwritten
note on the photograph.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.160
Thank heavens.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.460
It's adorable.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:10.060
It says, "Charge Desk
Librarian Spofford's Table."

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.360
Sure enough.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.670
So Librarian Spofford
apparently,

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:15.930
and I'm sure you all have read
accounts or that [inaudible] to,

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:19.310
that Librarian Spofford,
if anybody told him,

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:21.470
"I need to see a copy of
this book," he would be able

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:25.440
to find it immediately
at his charge desk.

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:32.180
Here we have a painting
that then becomes a print.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.880
It's very famous.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.910
It was done in 1897.

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:39.930
It's a colored reproduction
that was done in 1839.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:42.650
So we have here Spofford.

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:45.410
The man on the left holding
a lamp is, where is he,

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:48.230
he's right here, David
Hutcheson, Assistant Librarian.

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:52.470
And then Robert Tharin is
identified, I can't see my,

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:56.050
right here, the bearded man, the
sixth Auditor of the Treasury.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:57.960
So we can see the clutter.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.980
This is 1897.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.390
So this was done right
before the Thomas Jefferson

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:03.970
Building opened.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:08.120
And this could very well be
the very last photograph taken

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.210
before Librarian Spofford
moves across the street.

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.950
Note here he is.

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:16.440
Here everything is
packed up, ready to go.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.560
Nothing is in the
alcoves anymore.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.820
So I think this is one sort

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.950
of last grand photograph
before the Library moves

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.250
to the Jefferson Building.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.880
Now what do you think, who
knows, what happens to one

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.270
of the greatest architectural
masterpieces

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:35.410
in American history-- Thomas
Walters' iron Library?

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:36.710
What happened to it?

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:38.860
Anybody know?

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.780
Summarily destroyed.

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.820
Completely.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:44.850
And this was by design.

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:48.120
Congress decided that they
wanted committee rooms.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.350
And, so, they completely
demolished the iron Library.

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:54.350
And it was all sold for scrap.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:59.420
Not one piece survives to even
document the eleven shades

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.100
of gold that I talked
about earlier.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.630
Not one piece.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.670
I found this photograph
and its companions

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:06.690
in the Kiplinger
collection, actually,

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:09.020
of the D.C. Historical Society.

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:12.760
And this is 1801.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.320
Very, very sad.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:19.190
So you can see that now.

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:21.870
This is before and after.

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.140
This is the Library
before the demolition,

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.560
and after the demolition.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:33.110
And then this is the
photograph that I matched things

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:35.640
up to identify the south wing.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:38.800
So here we have an
unidentified photograph.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.280
But I took the demolition
photograph that I found

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.950
through the Architect
of the Capitol's Office,

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:46.190
I matched up the windows.

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:51.210
So here we have window, which is
different than the north wing.

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:53.140
So this could be
the very first time

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.880
that a photograph is
identified as the south wing.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.910
John Cole was very
excited about that.

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:00.900
Here we have the
north wing again.

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:04.920
Sort of the transition
when it was pristine,

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.300
the March to Declutter
right before the move,

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.650
and then the demolition
of the north wing.

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:12.570
The only thing that
survived they moved the tile.

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:14.970
I took this photograph myself.

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:18.200
So if we're off the Rotunda
of the Capitol today,

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:25.080
I took this photograph, if you
go out the center west exit door

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.600
of the Rotunda, and you look,

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.750
you will see these
Hall of Columns.

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:32.800
Speaker Ryan's office
is off here.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.170
And then, of course,
as I referenced,

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:38.120
the Senate leadership
is off here.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.450
So, essentially,
Speaker Ryan's office,

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.140
I went and had nice chats.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:45.170
Oh, I did want to point out,
too, a little tangential,

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:49.350
but the Law Library of the
Library of Congress was housed

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:50.650
in the old Supreme Court,

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.990
in Latrobe's old
Supreme Court chamber

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:55.470
until the 1940s, actually.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:57.400
So you can see here's
Latrobe ceiling.

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.590
But everything is
chockfull of books.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:05.420
And, apparently, the
Supreme Court was very intent

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:08.520
on the Library staying
in the Capitol.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.210
So moving right along.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:13.560
Here we have our magnificent
Jefferson Building.

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.190
And, as you know, I just
thought it's fun to understand

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:17.740
that this is the
[inaudible] façade.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.770
And this is the Opera Garnier.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:25.170
And enter, as you all
know, are Casey brothers.

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:28.360
So Thomas [inaudible] Lincoln
Casey, I don't need to describe

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.420
who he is as I have
another presentation,

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.920
but I do want to point out.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.370
This is very important.

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:34.670
Some of you all may
or may not know.

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:36.560
Thomas Lincoln Casey
comes from a very,

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:40.660
very renowned artistic family,

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:43.010
not only himself,
but also his wife.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.210
His wife's father was
Robert Weir, who, indeed,

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:52.420
painted the "Embarkation of
the Pilgrims" that you see

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.680
in the Capitol Rotunda.

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.660
Edward Pearce Casey, of course,
his son, as you all know,

00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.410
decorate the Thomas
Jefferson Building.

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:03.860
So I found an essay in
our beautiful Library

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:07.220
of Congress coffee table
book called "The Decorators."

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.650
And I quote.

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:12.300
"The Library of Congress, Thomas
Casey's wife was the daughter

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.320
of Robert, [inaudible] a
well-known 19th-century painter

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:19.420
and professor of drawing at West
Point between 1834 and 1876,

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:22.540
where he instructed artist
James Whistler, many generals

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.990
of the Civil War, by the way,
including Ulysses S. Grant,

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:30.320
who was a very, very fine sketch
artist and drawer himself.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.780
This is Robert Weir's
most famous work.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.630
"General Casey undoubtedly
paced the Capitol corridors,

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.090
especially those of the Senate
wing with its walls and ceilings

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:42.340
of mural decoration by
Constantino Brumidi.

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.320
In fact, the aged artist,
Brumidi, was still at work

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.890
on the Rotunda frieze in the
Capitol that bears his name

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.350
when General Casey
arrived in Washington.

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:54.030
The General must have known
that it was Montgomery Meigs

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:55.350
who first commissioned Brumidi."

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.650
So it's really important

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:58.530
to understand there's
connections here.

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:01.870
Montgomery Meigs is
supervising the construction

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:04.360
of the extensions to the
Capitol and the Capitol dome.

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.130
They're designed
by Thomas Walter.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:10.630
Montgomery makes the decision
to decorate the Capitol very,

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:15.230
very highly with the work of
Constantino Brumidi with lots

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:16.720
of Greek and Roman architecture.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.600
It's like we have
Montgomery Meigs with Brumidi

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.720
in the same way that
Thomas Jefferson partnered

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.020
with Latrobe.

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.720
It's a very similar
relationship.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:29.230
Meigs new Thomas Casey.

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:30.540
They served together.

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:33.240
They went to West Point.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.950
Okay. So the connections,

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:38.740
you have the Thomas Jefferson
Building built out and decorated

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.690
by the Casey family
in the tradition

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:44.250
of high decoration
of the Capitol.

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:46.280
Unlike what Thomas
Walter wanted.

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:50.090
As you saw, he was not about
lots and lots of decoration.

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:54.830
So here Thomas Casey, as you
all may or may not remember,

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:57.440
he supervised the construction

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.140
of the old Executive
Office Building,

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.750
the Eisenhower Executive
Office Building.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.450
Here we have the State
Department Library,

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:07.640
the law Library and
the Indian Treaty Room.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.040
General Casey was
undoubtedly familiar

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.670
with Walters' iron Library.

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.110
He was in charge
of this building.

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:15.870
And he was there for 11 years.

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:18.970
So maybe it's a romantic
assumption on my part,

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:22.090
but I would like to think
that Casey was influenced

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:25.610
by the iron Library in
building out these spaces.

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:27.800
Of course, Casey was not
the original architect.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.600
That was Alfred Mullet of
the old Executive Office.

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:31.900
It's the Eisenhower.

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.200
I grew up with it as the
old Executive Office.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.260
The Eisenhower Executive
Office Building.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.940
But I'd like to think that in
building it out, he is using,

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.260
because all of this
material is iron,

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.300
all three of these spaces
are completely iron.

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.800
So let's look at some
other similarities.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.460
Constantino Brumidi was
told by Montgomery Meigs

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:53.280
that he wanted the halls
of the Capitol to be based

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.250
on the Loggia of the
Vatican decorated by Raphael.

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:59.330
So here we have the
Loggia of the Vatican.

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:01.990
Here we have the very
famous Brumidi corridors

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:03.290
of the Capitol.

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:05.460
And then, of course, here's
our northwest corridor

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:09.000
in the Library of Congress.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.750
And then here we
have Justice again.

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:13.140
Here is our clear-eyed view

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.420
of Justice looking
towards her Genius

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:16.740
and the copy of the
Constitution.

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:20.650
And here we have Elihu Vedder's
Justice, although in here it's

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:26.090
"Government," in Elihu Vedder's
fantastic [inaudible] series

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.440
"Good Government, Bad
Government," that we refer to.

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.920
So here's Justice clear-eyed in
that same tradition established

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:36.020
by Franzoni all those years ago.

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:40.640
Next we have Clio,
our "Car of History."

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.050
My favorite.

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:44.820
Of course, she's all about
the importance of learning

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:50.440
and history through time,
and how the flight of time

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.280
and the importance of
books and education,

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.920
all of those things in time.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:57.040
Here we have our own "History"
done by Daniel Chester French,

00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.120
and a very similarly
themed "Fight of Time"

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.810
by Paul Flanagan,
the Flanagan clock.

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:06.270
So Clio, in one magnificent
piece of sculpture,

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:07.910
in our Thomas Jefferson
Building,

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:11.490
she has two with those
very similar themes.

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:14.550
And next we have
the Americanization

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.450
of design elements.

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:19.110
Here I've gone through
Latrobe's Americanization

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:22.930
of classic architecture,

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:25.500
in particular the
the Corn Cob Capitals

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.640
and the tobacco water
leaves, et cetera.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:28.940
And, of course, our Putti.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:35.110
This is taking a very classical
icon and Americanizing it

00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:40.020
with the jobs that are popular
in the late 19th century.

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.770
And, of course, Minerva.

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:43.980
Here we have Latrobe's Minerva.

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.930
Here we have Brumidi's
"Apotheosis"

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:47.610
in the Apotheosis of Washington.

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:51.100
Here we have Minerva
instructing many

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.210
of the founders of our country.

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:55.430
Nobody did it better
than Brumidi

00:54:55.430 --> 00:55:00.430
in taking classical Roman and
Greek themes, and putting them

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:05.750
with American counterparts
and merging the two.

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:07.230
Absolute genius.

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:09.040
And then here we
have our Minerva.

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.630
And, of course, our
Minerva she's won the war

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:12.930
against ignorance.

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:14.230
So she's helmetless.

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:15.530
And, by the way, this is
one of the only portrayals

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:18.610
of Minerva I have found
where her helmet is off.

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:21.520
So this is really a kind
of innovation I think

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.650
that Vedder introduced.

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:26.220
But she's all ready with
that helmet just in case

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:28.430
that darkness of ignorance
is going to descend again.

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:32.340
And then, of course, we
have Brumidi's Neptune

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:35.120
in the Apotheosis of Washington,
and our Neptune fountain

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.870
out front, which,
in my own opinion,

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:40.170
is one of the most magnificent
pieces of sculpture in the city,

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:43.310
and people don't really
refer to it particularly.

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:45.970
But I never tire, I'm
sure you all don't either,

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:47.610
of just gazing at it.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.140
It's amazing.

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:52.270
So next things are changing.

00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:58.130
So Thomas Crawford did the
pediment called, excuse me,

00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:00.820
"The Progress of Civilization."

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:04.600
And this is the north Senate
pediment on the Capitol.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.900
So it's the northeast pediment.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.780
You see it when you walk into
the Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:13.800
In Crawford's depiction
"Native Americans" the progress

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.150
of civilization really
is the conquering

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:17.980
of Native American peoples.

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.690
And I won't go into all of
the figures that do that.

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:22.890
But that's the point.

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:25.610
Things change in the
Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:28.910
So, of course, Philip Martiny's
Native Americans are portrayed

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:30.210
very differently.

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:33.040
And Olin Levi Warner's
"Tradition" with Chief Joseph

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.220
at the feet of oral tradition.

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:38.810
So Capitol art is evolving

00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:41.010
over into the Thomas
Jefferson Building,

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:44.250
and really creating
different messages.

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:48.020
Next, since this is the entire
pediment, Thomas Crawford's

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.690
"Progress of Civilization" as
the northeast pediment, and,

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:53.180
basically, it is about
the conquering of peoples.

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:54.480
Here we have, of course,

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.770
you know Edwin Blashfield's
vision is very, very different.

00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:03.870
But the titles of the two pieces
really do invite comparison.

00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:07.970
"Progress of Civilization,"
"Evolution of Civilization."

00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:11.610
So I think it's very clear
that a statement is being made

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:15.020
by the decorators of the
Thomas Jefferson Building

00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:19.040
that they are going in a
very different direction.

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:22.860
Okay. And then, of course,
you all may or may not know,

00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:25.110
the Statue of Freedom
on the roof

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:30.470
of the Capitol was originally
designed with a Liberty Cap.

00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:34.460
This is, of course, an ancient
Roman symbol of manumission,

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.990
of freeing slaves essentially.

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:39.960
But Jefferson Davis
nixed that design.

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.260
He said, "Absolutely not.

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.560
Period. End of story."

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:46.100
So Crawford was forced
to redesign the headdress

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:48.670
that exists today on
the Statue of Freedom.

00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:52.690
Now as Ford Peatross
in our docent training,

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:54.580
is Ford going to be doing?

00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:55.980
Yes. Oh, okay.

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:57.280
At least in our docent training,

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.620
he pointed out the
Liberty Cap is

00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:02.130
in the Thomas Jefferson
Building in a place of honor.

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:05.120
And I'm quoting, from memory,
but I'm quoting him saying,

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.630
"If we think that
that's a coincidence,

00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:07.930
or if there's no connection.

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:10.110
No, no, no, no, no,"
Again, the decorators

00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:14.180
of the Jefferson Building are
making statements that are very,

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:17.480
very different than what
we found at the Capitol.

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:22.560
And, interestingly, who is in
charge of decorating the space

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:25.630
of the iron Library,
those committee rooms

00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:27.870
and what is now Paul
Ryan's office, et cetera,

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:29.460
but our own Elmer Garnsey.

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.230
We all know Elmer Garnsey.

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:34.530
Here is his magnificent
"NE Pavilion" painting.

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:36.870
Of course, Elmer Garnsey,
just to refresh your memory,

00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:40.230
was tasked with installing
the art here

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:43.010
in the Jefferson Building,
or across the street.

00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:45.830
So I went over to Paul
Ryan's suite of offices,

00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:50.730
and the first thing the staffer
pointed out to me, this we used

00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:52.030
to be the House District
Committee room,

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:54.380
the first thing he pointed out
was, "Here's the Liberty Cap.

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:55.680
Do you know about
the Liberty Cap?

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.350
Yeah. It was nixed
by Jefferson Davis,

00:58:58.350 --> 00:59:00.990
but here it is back
again in the Capitol."

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:03.120
And, of course, this is
post-Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:07.910
So here we have Elmer
Garnsey, who is clearly annoyed

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:10.190
about what happened
with the Liberty Cap,

00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:13.560
his icon at the Capitol,
it's in a place of honor

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.160
in the Jefferson
Building, and, good heavens,

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.450
he's going to bring
it back to the Capitol

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:19.960
after the iron Library
is demolished.

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.490
I think this is fun.

00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:22.790
The "Pompeiian Maidens."

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:25.800
So Montgomery Meigs
instructs Constantino Brumidi

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.750
to model Pompeiian maidens
on the House of the Vetti

00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:33.810
in the Ixion Room in Rome,
or in Italy I should say.

00:59:33.810 --> 00:59:37.110
So Brumidi takes it and adapts
it for the Naval Committee.

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:40.830
All of a sudden the Pompeian
maiden is floating in the water,

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:42.860
because it's the
Naval Committee Room.

00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:45.020
So he adapts that.

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:48.750
Here is George Willoughby
Maynard, our "Pompeiian Maiden"

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:50.050
in the Jefferson Building.

00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:52.090
And then sure enough George
Willoughby Maynard goes back

00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:55.830
across the street, and
puts "Pompeiian Maidens,"

00:59:55.830 --> 00:59:58.990
and I took this right outside
of Paul Ryan's offices.

00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:03.190
So we have four incarnations
of our maidens.

01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:05.010
The only reason I put this

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.950
in is finally these wood
doors were done in 1908,

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:11.140
and Thomas Casey, it's
all different icons

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.900
and different subjects
that it's celebrating,

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.390
but Thomas Casey is
included in these doors.

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:18.880
These were never installed
formally in the Capitol.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.080
But I think it's interesting
that Casey has made it,

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:28.260
and a nice tribute to
his engineering prowess.

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:35.800
I'm finishing with Kenyon
Cox and his son Allyn Cox.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.100
Oh, before that.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.400
I'm sorry.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.700
Paul Wayland Bartlett.

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.000
Excuse me.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.730
Paul Wayland Bartlett, as
you all know, "Michelangelo"

01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:46.100
and "Christopher Columbus"
some view that he goes

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:49.120
across the street to the
Capitol to do the "Apotheosis

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.920
of Democracy" in 1911 to 1914.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.110
Highly recommend you take
a very good look at it.

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:58.520
This is considered to be Paul
Wayland Bartlett's masterpiece.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.090
Many, many, many
of the sculptors,

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:04.930
or several I should say, several
of the sculptors that you find

01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:06.550
who had done work in
the Jefferson Building,

01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:08.830
you will find their
work also represented

01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:10.820
in the Statuary Hall collection,

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:13.890
and also in art throughout
the Capitol.

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:17.370
And, lastly, now we get
to Kenyon and Alan Cox.

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:19.080
You all, I hope, are
familiar, of course,

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.550
with Kenyon Cox's
"Science" and "Art."

01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:24.780
And then Cox had one
of the finest muralists

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:30.040
of his day his son, Allyn Cox,
painted the Cox corridors,

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.340
which are on the House side.

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.640
In other words, they're
the counterparts

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.030
to the Brumidi corridors
on the Senate side.

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:37.930
And they're fantastic.

01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:40.820
They're all different
scenes of American history.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:44.070
And I found it very touching
and wonderful that, indeed,

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:47.950
he pays homage to Walter's iron
Library in the Cox corridors.

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:52.270
Remember Allyn Cox did this
in the 1970s, in the 1970s.

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:55.310
The Cox corridors are
relatively recent.

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:57.620
Okay. So that's finishes up.

01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:01.020
I'm sure you thought
this would never end.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.190
So just to summarize.

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:05.780
The Thomas Jefferson Building
has a magnificent historic

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:09.510
context starting with
Benjamin Latrobe's 1808 vision

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:13.050
of what this Library could
be as a symbol of patriotism,

01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:14.470
as a symbol of greatness,

01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:16.810
the symbol of the
importance of learning.

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:19.610
Charles Bulfinch's, I
would say underrated,

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:21.590
Library has that same vision,

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:25.230
and also ties it to
ancient cultures.

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:26.530
And then, of course,

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:29.220
Thomas Walters' magnificent
iron Library.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:31.610
Incredibly functional,

01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:34.860
an absolute architectural
masterpiece,

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.490
as is our magnificent
Thomas Jefferson Building.

01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:40.330
So that concludes
my presentation.

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:42.150
And I can take questions I hope.

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:43.450
Thank you.

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:44.750
I apologize.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.220
I'm sure I'm over the hour.

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.330
But, anyway, questions?

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:49.630
Yes?

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:52.310
&gt;&gt; Janice, in the Walter
design of the Library--

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:53.610
&gt;&gt; Janice McKelvey: Yes, sir?

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:56.000
&gt;&gt; Were the north and
south wings connected

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.840
to the west front, or were
they actually separate rooms?

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.820
In other words, if
I were alive then,

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.140
and were on the second
floor level

01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:04.440
in the [inaudible] of books--

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.740
&gt;&gt; Janice McKelvey: Right.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.720
&gt;&gt; And I wanted to find, I
was say in the north wing--

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.020
&gt;&gt; Janice McKelvey: Right.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.430
&gt;&gt; And I discovered that
there was a volume I needed

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:12.900
in the west front--

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.200
&gt;&gt; Janice McKelvey:
Yes, there were.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.500
&gt;&gt; So you could just
walk [inaudible]--

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.800
&gt;&gt; Janice McKelvey: Yes.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.720
But not, I don't believe, the
fourth, because the fourth floor

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.650
of those north and
south wings was not

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:22.840
in Walter's original plan.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.750
So if you were up on that
fourth floor, you would have

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:28.050
to go downstairs, and then--

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:29.350
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:30.650
Yeah.

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:31.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:33.250
&gt;&gt; Janice McKelvey: Yes.

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:34.550
Other questions?

01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:35.850
Yes, sir?

01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:37.150
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:38.450
Yes.

01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:39.750
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.050
Yes.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.350
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:03:42.350 --> 01:03:43.650
Yes.

01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.260
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.080
Absolutely.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.520
And Tom Hoban, who is
one of my colleagues,

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.020
does a wonderful presentation

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.530
on the construction
of the building.

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:57.650
And also, according to Tom,
who's done extensive research

01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:59.730
on this, Edward Pearce
Casey, the interior

01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:02.570
of our magnificent
Jefferson Building is Edward

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:03.870
Pearce Casey's.

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:07.710
And what I want to do more
research on myself, personally,

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:12.850
is to look at how Casey is
going back to Brumidi, or not,

01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:17.150
because the decision was made
to highly decorate the Capitol,

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:19.670
and to highly decorate
the Jefferson Building.

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:21.460
They are all together.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.660
They know each other's work.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:28.340
So that's my own personal,
more scholarship needed.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.640
Other question?

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.440
Yes?

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.480
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.780
Yes.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.080
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.380
Yes.

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.680
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.480
And is a tourist destination.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:50.540
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.840
Yes.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.140
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.780
Yes. It is my understanding
that is true.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.560
I've spoken with
John Cole about this.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.860
But, yes. Yeah.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:03.410
That's the best answer I know.

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:08.090
And the Bulfinch Library I
know that it was accessible.

01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:10.000
To what extent that
was open to the public.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.560
But, again, there wasn't
very much here, particularly

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.860
in the Bulfinch years.

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:18.370
So that is a space that was a
destination in and of itself,

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:23.090
because it's one of the only
in Washington at the time.

01:05:23.090 --> 01:05:24.680
I mean so much of the
construction happened.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.010
Yes? Again.

01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:27.310
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:29.110
Yes.

01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:32.660
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.310
Yes.

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:36.650
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:38.450
Yes.

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:48.120
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.420
No.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.720
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.020
No, they don't.

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.320
And that's not their
fault, because most tours

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.770
of the Capitol, who's
been on one lately?

01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:59.230
Okay. Most tours of the Capitol
only include three spaces--

01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:01.890
the Crypt, the Rotunda
and Statuary Hall.

01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:04.680
And, so, it's not in
their purview to go

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.030
to where the Library was.

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:11.020
I have heard some of
them say things like,

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.320
and this is a few years ago,

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.190
I've heard them make
reference saying

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:17.760
that Thomas Jefferson
gave his Library

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.380
to start the Library
of Congress.

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:20.680
You may have heard that, too.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.220
They're still a little
murky, I think,

01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.430
some of those guides
on those details.

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:28.690
But, no, their reference
is very, very minimal.

01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:30.140
But, again, that's
not their fault.

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:34.240
That's just because
they're not in those spaces.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.280
The interns I know they
have more accessibility

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.580
to the building.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.860
But I don't believe
they mention it either.

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.660
Yeah. Yes?

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:52.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.340
I have it in my notes.

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:54.640
I can't remember exactly.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.780
But it was well over
40,000 books.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.500
That's a good question.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:01.310
I know it's in here somewhere.

01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:04.050
But, yes. I mean huge, huge.

01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:06.340
Other questions?

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:07.640
Okay. Thank you so much.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.940
Enjoy your lunch.

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.240
