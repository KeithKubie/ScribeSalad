00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120
our issuer ID can be found on the
 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.110
our issuer ID can be found on the
merchant dashboard and for that going to

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120
merchant dashboard and for that going to
 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.379
merchant dashboard and for that going to
the account management page and copy

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389
the account management page and copy
 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.649
the account management page and copy
your issuer ID and we're gonna paste it

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:34.659
your issuer ID and we're gonna paste it
 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:38.309
your issuer ID and we're gonna paste it
here and the next one that we have is

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319
here and the next one that we have is
 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.709
here and the next one that we have is
the private key so the private key if

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:40.719
the private key so the private key if
 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:42.420
the private key so the private key if
you have the same name that I have which

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430
you have the same name that I have which
 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.939
you have the same name that I have which
is warps private key that p12 you can

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949
is warps private key that p12 you can
 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.399
is warps private key that p12 you can
leave this assist or if you change the

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409
leave this assist or if you change the
 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.300

the origins is a list of URLs that are

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240
the origins is a list of URLs that are
 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.589
the origins is a list of URLs that are
used to allow the safe to wall button to

load on your page on our case we're

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460
load on your page on our case we're
 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.800
load on your page on our case we're
going to be running the sample under

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810
going to be running the sample under
 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.219
going to be running the sample under
localhost 8080 so we have that URL here

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229
localhost 8080 so we have that URL here
 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.829
localhost 8080 so we have that URL here
but if we need to run it on another you

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:22.839
but if we need to run it on another you
 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:25.019
but if we need to run it on another you
are like we're gonna be running it also

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:25.029
are like we're gonna be running it also
 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:29.939
are like we're gonna be running it also
on the on App Engine then we can just

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949
on the on App Engine then we can just
 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:36.170
on the on App Engine then we can just
copy here and PHP that appspot.com

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180
copy here and PHP that appspot.com
 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.269
copy here and PHP that appspot.com
and that way it will so load on that URL

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279
and that way it will so load on that URL
 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:46.290
and that way it will so load on that URL
then we have four values here for the

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300
then we have four values here for the
 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.139
then we have four values here for the
loyalty class ID and object ID and the

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:49.149
loyalty class ID and object ID and the
 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:51.420
loyalty class ID and object ID and the
same for the offer these values you

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430
same for the offer these values you
 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.459
same for the offer these values you
don't need to change but since we've

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:53.469
don't need to change but since we've
 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.439
don't need to change but since we've
been running the QuickStart to test then

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449
been running the QuickStart to test then
 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.179
been running the QuickStart to test then
we already have the subjects created on

00:05:57.179 --> 00:05:57.189
we already have the subjects created on
 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:59.730
we already have the subjects created on
our account so what we'll do here is

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740
our account so what we'll do here is
 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.200
our account so what we'll do here is
that we'll modify them and you can

that we'll modify them and you can
 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.029
that we'll modify them and you can
modify them after you've created if you

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039
modify them after you've created if you
 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.950
modify them after you've created if you
can you want to keep making changes to

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960
can you want to keep making changes to
 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.860
can you want to keep making changes to
it so loyalty class PHP I think I have

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870
it so loyalty class PHP I think I have
 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.899
it so loyalty class PHP I think I have
probably ten of them so let me put 20

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909
probably ten of them so let me put 20
 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.439
probably ten of them so let me put 20
here to make sure that I don't have that

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449
here to make sure that I don't have that
 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.899
here to make sure that I don't have that
already so I'm gonna be creating we're

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909
already so I'm gonna be creating we're
 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.149
already so I'm gonna be creating we're
gonna be creating a loyalty class PHP 20

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159
gonna be creating a loyalty class PHP 20
 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:25.050
gonna be creating a loyalty class PHP 20
and object ID loyalty object PHP 20 so

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060
and object ID loyalty object PHP 20 so
 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.290
and object ID loyalty object PHP 20 so
after we do this then we are ready to

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300
after we do this then we are ready to
 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.250
after we do this then we are ready to
run the QuickStart

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260
run the QuickStart
 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.490
run the QuickStart
so how can you run the QuickStart we

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500
so how can you run the QuickStart we
 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.890
so how can you run the QuickStart we
have the QuickStart is we can either run

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900
have the QuickStart is we can either run
 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.920
have the QuickStart is we can either run
it using Apache or we can run it using

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930
it using Apache or we can run it using
 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.280
it using Apache or we can run it using
App Engine so on our local server we're

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290
App Engine so on our local server we're
 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.290
App Engine so on our local server we're
gonna use Apache to show you how it runs

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300
gonna use Apache to show you how it runs
 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.540
gonna use Apache to show you how it runs
and then we'll upload it to App Engine

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550
and then we'll upload it to App Engine
 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.400
and then we'll upload it to App Engine
then we can use it on our web service

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410
then we can use it on our web service
 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.870
then we can use it on our web service
API so here local the first thing that

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880
API so here local the first thing that
 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.490
API so here local the first thing that
you need to do is if you're gonna run it

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500
you need to do is if you're gonna run it
 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.440
you need to do is if you're gonna run it
using Apaches make sure you have a patch

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450
using Apaches make sure you have a patch
 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.900
using Apaches make sure you have a patch
of running Apache installed if you don't

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910
of running Apache installed if you don't
 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.350
of running Apache installed if you don't
have it then install it on the Mac by

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360
have it then install it on the Mac by
 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.390
have it then install it on the Mac by
default it's already installed so how

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400
default it's already installed so how
 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.610
default it's already installed so how
you you make sure that it's there it's

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620
you you make sure that it's there it's
 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.400
you you make sure that it's there it's
just it's Apache CTL so I have it

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410
just it's Apache CTL so I have it

running I have it on my computer here
 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.550
running I have it on my computer here
and I'm gonna start my but before we do

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560
and I'm gonna start my but before we do
 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.980
and I'm gonna start my but before we do
that you need to make sure that you that

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990
that you need to make sure that you that
 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.920
that you need to make sure that you that
you have on your Apache config file in

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930
you have on your Apache config file in
 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:30.900
you have on your Apache config file in
here first we have the port here listen

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910
 
 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.970
 
we have it running on port 8080 which is

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:33.980
we have it running on port 8080 which is
 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.530
we have it running on port 8080 which is
here and then we also have a new

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:38.540
here and then we also have a new
 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.290
here and then we also have a new
directory root for our for our site in

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.300
directory root for our for our site in
 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.930
directory root for our for our site in
this case here we have wallet objects

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:43.940
this case here we have wallet objects
 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.570
this case here we have wallet objects
QuickStart PHP so you'll need to have

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:46.580
QuickStart PHP so you'll need to have
 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.180
QuickStart PHP so you'll need to have
some rewrite rules that you can

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.190
some rewrite rules that you can
 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.980
some rewrite rules that you can
copy/paste from our documentation so

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.990
copy/paste from our documentation so
 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.290
copy/paste from our documentation so
don't worry about this just copy/paste

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:53.300
don't worry about this just copy/paste
 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.290
don't worry about this just copy/paste
what we have and this will allow some of

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:56.300
what we have and this will allow some of
 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.870
what we have and this will allow some of
the the paths to work also we need to

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:00.880
the the paths to work also we need to
 

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.070
the the paths to work also we need to
make sure that we have PHP enabled so

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080
make sure that we have PHP enabled so
 

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.170
make sure that we have PHP enabled so
just make sure that you uncomment the

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:08.180
just make sure that you uncomment the
 

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.860
just make sure that you uncomment the
PHP module' here on the config and you

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:11.870
PHP module' here on the config and you
 

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.760
PHP module' here on the config and you
also need to have mod rewrite so you

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:15.770
also need to have mod rewrite so you
 

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.530
also need to have mod rewrite so you
also need to uncomment the rewrite

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:17.540
also need to uncomment the rewrite
 

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.530
also need to uncomment the rewrite
module so uncommon those if you don't

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:20.540
module so uncommon those if you don't
 

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.140
module so uncommon those if you don't
have them uncomment it modify your

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.150
have them uncomment it modify your
 

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.300
have them uncomment it modify your
rewrite rules and then save your file

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:25.310
rewrite rules and then save your file
 

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.510
rewrite rules and then save your file
so I already did all of that and then

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:28.520
so I already did all of that and then
 

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.020
so I already did all of that and then
you can start Apache so to do that

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.030
you can start Apache so to do that
 

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.660
you can start Apache so to do that
Apache control start

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:34.670
Apache control start
 

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.720
Apache control start
and I'm gonna run it here using pseudo

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:37.730
and I'm gonna run it here using pseudo
 

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:44.290
and I'm gonna run it here using pseudo
and now this is running on port 8080 so

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:44.300
and now this is running on port 8080 so
 

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:51.220
and now this is running on port 8080 so
no let's go into my browser and Apache

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:51.230
no let's go into my browser and Apache

we created this as the directory then we
 

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.590
we created this as the directory then we
have to run it like this with the wallet

00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600
have to run it like this with the wallet

see on ours on our demo we have two

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:05.660
see on ours on our demo we have two
 

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.690
see on ours on our demo we have two
steps we have the first step allows us

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:07.700
steps we have the first step allows us
 

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.270
steps we have the first step allows us
to insert a class and the second step

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:10.280
to insert a class and the second step
 

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.510
to insert a class and the second step
allows us to save the object to our

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:13.520

on it call insert type loyalty and then
I'll show you in the code what that's

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000
I'll show you in the code what that's
 

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.160
I'll show you in the code what that's
doing and then on the second line where

and display the button back to the page
so that's for that index then let's look

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:24.500
so that's for that index then let's look
 

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.889
so that's for that index then let's look
at what the job insert and web service

00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:26.899
at what the job insert and web service
 

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:30.040
at what the job insert and web service
API are doing to do to look at that

API are doing to do to look at that
 

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:35.650
API are doing to do to look at that
first we can see where is the I can't

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:35.660
first we can see where is the I can't
 

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.259
first we can see where is the I can't
see okay so here's the insert first

00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:38.269
see okay so here's the insert first
 

00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:40.629
see okay so here's the insert first
insert PHP is the one that's gonna be

00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639
insert PHP is the one that's gonna be
 

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:44.319
insert PHP is the one that's gonna be
handling the insert Handler so in here

00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:44.329
handling the insert Handler so in here
 

00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:47.379
handling the insert Handler so in here
we say if the case loyalty what we're

00:16:47.379 --> 00:16:47.389
we say if the case loyalty what we're
 

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:50.949
we say if the case loyalty what we're
gonna do is insert we're gonna call the

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959
gonna do is insert we're gonna call the
 

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:54.879
gonna do is insert we're gonna call the
REST API and call the insert method with

00:16:54.879 --> 00:16:54.889
REST API and call the insert method with
 

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.350
REST API and call the insert method with
a new loyalty class that we're

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360
a new loyalty class that we're
 

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.240
a new loyalty class that we're
generating and the same will happen of

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:58.250
generating and the same will happen of
 

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:03.519
generating and the same will happen of
course for the offer class if we do the

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:03.529
course for the offer class if we do the
 

00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:05.520
course for the offer class if we do the
jot here

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:05.530
jot here
 

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.550
jot here
you can see here we have also a type oil

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:08.560
you can see here we have also a type oil
 

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.740
you can see here we have also a type oil
tea in this case we're generating a

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:10.750
tea in this case we're generating a
 

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.260
tea in this case we're generating a
loyalty object and we're adding that

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:13.270
loyalty object and we're adding that
 

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.230
loyalty object and we're adding that
object to our to our payload and then

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240
object to our to our payload and then
 

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.530
object to our to our payload and then
we're creating the here we're creating

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:19.540
we're creating the here we're creating
 

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.390
we're creating the here we're creating
the job and we're signing it and then

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400
the job and we're signing it and then
 

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.320
the job and we're signing it and then
sending it back

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:22.330
sending it back
 

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.030
sending it back
we're just echoing that back to the page

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:24.040
we're just echoing that back to the page
 

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.180
we're just echoing that back to the page
which is how the button gets displayed

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:27.190
which is how the button gets displayed
 

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.930
which is how the button gets displayed
on the page and the last thing that we

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:30.940
on the page and the last thing that we
 

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.750
on the page and the last thing that we
have is the web service so the web

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760
have is the web service so the web
 

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.450
have is the web service so the web
service PHP here let's see what this is

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:39.460
service PHP here let's see what this is
 

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.910
service PHP here let's see what this is
here okay so in here what we're doing is

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:41.920
here okay so in here what we're doing is
 

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.830
here okay so in here what we're doing is
that we're getting the request from

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840
that we're getting the request from
 

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.880
that we're getting the request from
Google and we're checking the parameters

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:47.890
Google and we're checking the parameters
 

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.500
Google and we're checking the parameters
so if you look at the documentation

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:49.510
so if you look at the documentation
 

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.740
so if you look at the documentation
you'll see that the request includes the

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:52.750
you'll see that the request includes the
 

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.840
you'll see that the request includes the
wallet user information in this case we

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:54.850
wallet user information in this case we
 

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:57.000
wallet user information in this case we
have first name last name all of the

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.010
have first name last name all of the
 

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.230
have first name last name all of the
information that we selected on the

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240
information that we selected on the
 

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.810
information that we selected on the
merchant dashboard so we have first name

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:00.820
merchant dashboard so we have first name
 

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.750
merchant dashboard so we have first name
here we're putting it here and then

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760
here we're putting it here and then
 

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.880
here we're putting it here and then
we're checking that first name and this

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:05.890
we're checking that first name and this
 

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.860
we're checking that first name and this
is only for testing purposes so we can

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:07.870
is only for testing purposes so we can
 

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.380
is only for testing purposes so we can
send different codes as the first name

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:10.390
send different codes as the first name
 

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.510
send different codes as the first name
and then test different responses on the

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520
and then test different responses on the
 

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.620
and then test different responses on the
app so in this case we're saying if the

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:15.630
app so in this case we're saying if the
 

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.140
app so in this case we're saying if the
first name includes success then we're

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:19.150
first name includes success then we're
 

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.120
first name includes success then we're
gonna return a success otherwise we're

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:21.130
gonna return a success otherwise we're
 

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.810
gonna return a success otherwise we're
gonna return an error in error code so

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:24.820
gonna return an error in error code so
 

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.510
gonna return an error in error code so
if its success we are generating the

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520
if its success we are generating the
 

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.210
if its success we are generating the
loyalty object and we're putting it in

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:30.220
loyalty object and we're putting it in
 

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.450
loyalty object and we're putting it in
the response and then sending that back

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460
the response and then sending that back
 

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.330
the response and then sending that back
if it's not success then we are

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:36.340
if it's not success then we are
 

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.240
if it's not success then we are
generating we have a web service

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:39.250
generating we have a web service
 

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.280
generating we have a web service
response error which can be either

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:41.290
response error which can be either
 

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.710
response error which can be either
invalid linking ID or account already

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720
invalid linking ID or account already
 

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.390
invalid linking ID or account already
linked and this is only for testing

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400
linked and this is only for testing
 

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.490
linked and this is only for testing
purposes of course this would you would

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:47.500
purposes of course this would you would
 

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.110
purposes of course this would you would
need to make sure that you're returning

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120
need to make sure that you're returning
 

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.720
need to make sure that you're returning
the correct application code and you can

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:51.730
the correct application code and you can
 

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.540
the correct application code and you can
see those in our documentation and if

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:54.550
see those in our documentation and if
 

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.430
see those in our documentation and if
I'm returning that it's the wrong data

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440
I'm returning that it's the wrong data
 

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.710
I'm returning that it's the wrong data
or the wrong format then we can also

00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720
or the wrong format then we can also
 

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.660
or the wrong format then we can also
return which fields are invalid in this

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:00.670
return which fields are invalid in this
 

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.710
return which fields are invalid in this
case we have zip code and phone once we

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720
case we have zip code and phone once we
 

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.390
case we have zip code and phone once we
have that we also create the response

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400
have that we also create the response
 

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.420
have that we also create the response
body and the response body is also a job

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:09.430
body and the response body is also a job
 

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.510
body and the response body is also a job
to get signed and then gets also echoed

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520
to get signed and then gets also echoed
 

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.560
to get signed and then gets also echoed
back to the response

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:14.570
back to the response
 

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:18.460
back to the response
so this is how a high level of

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:18.470
so this is how a high level of
 

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.940
so this is how a high level of
integration works with a web service API

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:20.950
integration works with a web service API
 

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:25.900
integration works with a web service API
also in the let's see we have the header

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:25.910
also in the let's see we have the header
 

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.770
also in the let's see we have the header
that PHP includes the let me see where

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:29.780
that PHP includes the let me see where
 

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:35.530
that PHP includes the let me see where
that is and here includes the where we

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:35.540
that is and here includes the where we
 

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.630
that is and here includes the where we
create the clot the Google client and

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640
create the clot the Google client and
 

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.600
create the clot the Google client and
we're using the Google client library

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:40.610
we're using the Google client library
 

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:44.800
we're using the Google client library
for PHP and here we set our account we

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:44.810
for PHP and here we set our account we
 

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.740
for PHP and here we set our account we
were private key and our service account

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:47.750
were private key and our service account
 

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.750
were private key and our service account
email address to do the authentication

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760
email address to do the authentication
 

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.090
email address to do the authentication
so this is handling the authentication

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:52.100
so this is handling the authentication
 

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.140
so this is handling the authentication
getting your credentials and it's also

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:55.150
getting your credentials and it's also
 

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.580
getting your credentials and it's also
saving the token in session and then

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:57.590
saving the token in session and then
 

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.190
saving the token in session and then
refreshing and if the token expires so

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200
refreshing and if the token expires so
 

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.930
refreshing and if the token expires so
all of that is that is done using the

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:01.940
all of that is that is done using the
 

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.910
all of that is that is done using the
the API client library so you don't need

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:03.920
the API client library so you don't need
 

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.470
the API client library so you don't need
to worry about how that works other than

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480
to worry about how that works other than
 

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.030
to worry about how that works other than
that just look through the code and and

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.040
that just look through the code and and
 

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.430
that just look through the code and and
the ideas that you guys also also the

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440
the ideas that you guys also also the
 

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.200
the ideas that you guys also also the
verticals are really important here if

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.210
verticals are really important here if
 

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.570
verticals are really important here if
you look at the verticals loyalty for

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:19.580
you look at the verticals loyalty for
 

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.150
you look at the verticals loyalty for
instance you see how we're creating the

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:22.160
instance you see how we're creating the
 

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.250
instance you see how we're creating the
loyalty class and also the loyalty

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:24.260
loyalty class and also the loyalty
 

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.100
loyalty class and also the loyalty
object and these are fields that we have

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:27.110
object and these are fields that we have
 

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.440
object and these are fields that we have
here's test values so the idea is for

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:29.450
here's test values so the idea is for
 

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.080
here's test values so the idea is for
you to go and modify some of this and

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.090
you to go and modify some of this and
 

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.550
you to go and modify some of this and
play with the values and see how that

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:33.560
play with the values and see how that
 

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.380
play with the values and see how that
displays on the app once you start

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:35.390
displays on the app once you start
 

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:39.790
displays on the app once you start
getting that modified so this is it for

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:39.800
getting that modified so this is it for
 

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.300
getting that modified so this is it for
the video today we hope you find this

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:43.310
the video today we hope you find this
 

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.900
the video today we hope you find this
