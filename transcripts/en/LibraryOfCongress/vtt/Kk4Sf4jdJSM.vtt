    years the Library of

00:27:28.293 --> 00:27:30.560
words about a number of people 
who can't 

00:27:30.561 --> 00:27:37.127
    be with us here because of 
the floods in Texas. Children's

    thoughts are with them and

all who have been affected.
          Now you would not be 

00:27:56.861 --> 00:28:01.092
here if you did not love books.
          And we wouldn't be 

00:28:01.093 --> 00:28:03.683
here if the United States 
Congress did 

00:28:03.684 --> 00:28:08.260
    not love books.
          The members of 

00:28:08.261 --> 00:28:12.242

Thank you.
          The National Book 

00:38:40.838 --> 00:38:43.768
Festival is not only a 
celebration of 

00:38:43.769 --> 00:38:47.467
    books and reading but also 
of literacy itself.

00:38:47.468 --> 00:38:51.168
          Life in these 
demanding times can be very 

00:38:51.169 --> 00:38:53.319
difficult for 
    those who have never learned

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.289
 to read, and unfortunately 
there are 

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:59.120
    too many people in that 
number. In this country and 

00:38:59.121 --> 00:39:03.720
around the 
    world. The latest estimate 

00:39:03.721 --> 00:39:09.121
is about 65% of adults in the 
world are

00:39:09.122 --> 00:39:13.454
    aringing foundationally 
illiterate. At the library it's 

00:39:13.455 --> 00:39:16.056
important 
    of our mission to combat 

00:39:16.057 --> 00:39:19.763
illiteracy and a culture of 
reading, one 

00:39:19.764 --> 00:39:23.186
    of the most generous support
ers of American culture, history

00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:26.854
 and 
    the arts in this country is 

00:39:26.855 --> 00:39:30.171
Mr. David Rubenstein, co-chair 
of the 

00:39:30.172 --> 00:39:36.156
    National Book Festival and 
primary donor. The Kennedy 

00:39:36.157 --> 00:39:39.936
Center, the 
    National Zoo, the Washington

00:39:41.231 --> 00:39:45.236
 monument and the new National 
museum 

00:39:45.237 --> 00:39:48.220
    African-American History and
 Culture. His work can also be 

00:39:48.221 --> 00:39:49.505
seen 
    all across the country and 

00:39:49.506 --> 00:39:54.080
the world. He is a tire the 
promoteer of 

00:39:54.081 --> 00:39:59.682
    literacy and believes in 
books, lines and opportunities 

00:39:59.683 --> 00:40:03.175
and 
    success that are linked and 

00:40:03.176 --> 00:40:06.052
I trust they are for all of you 
here 

00:40:06.053 --> 00:40:10.837
    tonight. His dedication of 
increasing literacy across the 

00:40:10.838 --> 00:40:12.218
world 
    led to his creation and 

00:40:12.219 --> 00:40:14.772
support of the Library of 
Congress 

00:40:14.773 --> 00:40:17.917
    literacy award, and I know 
invite you to watch another 

00:40:17.918 --> 00:40:21.088

    have prepared about the 

00:40:21.089 --> 00:40:24.226

    Literacy Awards.
                    &gt;&gt; Carla 

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:24.206
thank you very much for your 
kind words and your 

00:44:24.207 --> 00:44:27.253
    dedication to the National 
Book Festival and the cause of 

00:44:27.254 --> 00:44:28.969
literacy
    literacy, we're thrilled 

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:32.103
that you're the librarian of 
Congress, 

00:44:32.104 --> 00:44:36.035
    I'm thrilled you came here 
from Baltimore my home down.

00:44:36.036 --> 00:44:39.928
          It's hard to believe, 
you saw that film it's not just 

00:44:39.929 --> 00:44:42.736
a 
    global problem, it's an 

00:44:42.737 --> 00:44:47.033
American problem. 45000000 
Americans are 

00:44:47.034 --> 00:44:52.987
    functionally illiterate, 
about 330 million earns, 4

00:44:54.518 --> 00:44:56.819
5000000 are 
    functioning you illiterate. 

00:44:57.123 --> 00:45:00.937
Which means they can't read 
beyond a  

00:45:00.938 --> 00:45:06.938
    5th grade level, the chance 
of having an economic success in

00:45:10.048 --> 00:45:13.808
dramatically.
          That is real tragedy 

00:45:13.809 --> 00:45:16.324
situation, in our country we 
talk about 

00:45:16.325 --> 00:45:19.725
    the income gap and the grow
ing income gap but it's a grow

00:45:19.726 --> 00:45:22.871
ing 
    literacy gap and the income 

00:45:22.872 --> 00:45:27.962
gap is directed to the literacy 
gap, 

00:45:27.963 --> 00:45:33.370
    anyplace we can do something
 we have no chance of closing 

00:45:33.371 --> 00:45:36.470
the gap.
          For example, if you 

00:45:36.471 --> 00:45:41.385
are illiterate, your chance of 
beinga 

00:45:41.386 --> 00:45:46.570
    juvenile delinquent is 
dramatically increased -- and 

00:45:46.571 --> 00:45:49.717
theistics 
    showed roughly 2/3 people 

00:45:49.718 --> 00:45:51.855
who are in our prison system are

00:45:51.856 --> 00:45:55.856
    functionally illiterate. 
It's a sad situation and we have

00:45:56.156 --> 00:45:59.018
 not made 
    ago much progress as we 

00:45:59.019 --> 00:46:00.386
shaft.
          Suppose in your case 

00:46:00.387 --> 00:46:03.255
everybody here I presume is 
literate, I 

00:46:03.256 --> 00:46:06.118
    hope everybody is, but 
suppose you couldn't read, think

00:46:06.371 --> 00:46:10.036
 about your 
    life, how would be different

00:46:10.471 --> 00:46:12.755
 if you couldn't read, you've 
gone 

00:46:12.756 --> 00:46:16.089
    through your entire life and
 couldn't read, you would more 

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:19.160
likely 
    part of our criminal justice

00:46:19.161 --> 00:46:21.597
 system, a lower income for your

00:46:21.598 --> 00:46:25.723
    family but the pleasure you 
get from your reading will be 

00:46:25.724 --> 00:46:28.590
gone. 
    For me one of migrate 

00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:31.255
pleasures in my life is reading 
and I can't 

00:46:31.256 --> 00:46:35.070
    imagine my life without the 
ability to read. Think about 

00:46:35.071 --> 00:46:37.113
your own 
    life, how would your life be

00:46:37.387 --> 00:46:38.509
 different if you couldn't read.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.358
    That's the problem we have 
with 45000000 Americans and it's

00:46:42.361 --> 00:46:42.924
 grow
    growing.

00:46:42.925 --> 00:46:49.317
          Not just illiteracy 
but the problem of aliteracy, 

00:46:49.318 --> 00:46:52.601
there are 
    people that can read but 

00:46:52.602 --> 00:46:56.692
don't read. 31 respect of 
American males 

00:46:56.693 --> 00:47:00.581
    last year who are literate 
did not read a single book.

00:47:00.582 --> 00:47:06.671
          In fact 26% of all 
Americans who could read didn't 

00:47:06.672 --> 00:47:09.217
read a 
    book at all last year, and 

00:47:09.218 --> 00:47:11.617
40% of all high school graduates
 who 

00:47:11.618 --> 00:47:14.034
    can read did not read a book
 at all last year.

00:47:14.035 --> 00:47:17.819
          Reading is very 
important but reading books is a

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.865
 special 
    pleasure, the National Book 

00:47:19.866 --> 00:47:23.298
Festival emphasizes not just 
literacy 

00:47:23.299 --> 00:47:28.417
    but the value and importance
 of reading, so I hope when you 

00:47:28.418 --> 00:47:29.986
leave 
    here tonight and finish the 

00:47:29.987 --> 00:47:32.437
book Festival tomorrow for those
 who 

00:47:32.438 --> 00:47:36.558
    are going, think of how 
privilegeed you are to be able 

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:39.496
to read and 
    how sad your life would be 

00:47:39.497 --> 00:47:41.766
if you couldn't read so, all of 
us 

00:47:41.767 --> 00:47:45.105
    should be thrilled with our 
parents, teachers who taught us 

00:47:45.106 --> 00:47:47.905
how to 
    read and we should be sad we

00:47:47.906 --> 00:47:49.736
 have so many people in this 
country 

00:47:49.737 --> 00:47:53.990
    that can't get the pleasure 
of reading to all of us have -- 

00:47:53.991 --> 00:47:57.178
so to 
    the extend tent one thing 

00:47:57.179 --> 00:48:00.154
you can do after you leave the 
Festival 

00:48:00.155 --> 00:48:04.986
    to contribute to somebody 
with your time, energy, ideas, 

00:48:04.987 --> 00:48:07.002
money to 
    help support the effort to 

00:48:07.003 --> 00:48:10.838
eradicate and reduce illiteracy 
and 

00:48:10.839 --> 00:48:16.344
    reduce and dramatically 
reduce aliteracy, it's a tragedy

00:48:16.345 --> 00:48:18.776
 situation 
    that we all deal with and 

00:48:18.777 --> 00:48:20.779
the income gap in this country 
is not 

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:24.017
    going away until the 
literacy gap goes away. Thank 

00:48:24.018 --> 00:48:25.467
you.

          Ladies and gentlemen, 
please welcome Margot Lee 

00:52:10.263 --> 00:52:12.263
Shetterly.

00:52:14.427 --> 00:52:16.427
          (Applause).
          &gt;&gt; 

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:27.218
It is such an honor for me to be
 here in a roomful of 

00:52:27.219 --> 00:52:32.241
    writers, so many of my heros
 tonight.

00:52:32.242 --> 00:52:36.286
          America may be the 
only country founded in the 

00:52:36.287 --> 00:52:39.891
world by a 
    bunch of writers, Jefferson,

00:52:40.138 --> 00:52:44.121
 Hamilton, Franklin, their pros 
and 

00:52:44.122 --> 00:52:50.121
    ideas of the nature of human
ity and freedom, it's admireed 

00:52:50.122 --> 00:52:50.984
and 
    influential writing in the 

00:52:50.985 --> 00:52:53.520
history of the world. It's a 
work of 

00:52:53.521 --> 00:52:58.152
    imagination, so it's no 
surprise that we, as citizens

00:53:01.239 --> 00:53:03.239
 devote so 
    much of our lives of telling

00:53:05.156 --> 00:53:06.623
 American dream and American 
story.

00:53:06.624 --> 00:53:11.169
          Growing up in Virginia
 I could never seem to find my 

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:13.021
story 
    in American history. I 

00:53:13.022 --> 00:53:17.841
remember elementary school and 
junior high 

00:53:17.842 --> 00:53:23.981
    school and dreading those 
days -- there was slavery and 

00:53:23.982 --> 00:53:25.555
Martin 
    Luther King and that was 

00:53:25.556 --> 00:53:27.955
about it. Black history in the 
classroom 

00:53:27.956 --> 00:53:34.325
    was a discussion of racial 
violence and shame, the idea of 

00:53:34.326 --> 00:53:38.743
the 
    color of their skin, my 

00:53:38.744 --> 00:53:41.467
forbearers were considered less 
than full 

00:53:41.468 --> 00:53:43.205
    citizens and less than fully
 human.

00:53:43.206 --> 00:53:49.605
          The textbooks offered 
cursory information but nothing 

00:53:49.606 --> 00:53:51.705
about 
    black Americans as 

00:53:51.706 --> 00:53:55.788
individuals, who I knew at first
 hand were 

00:53:55.789 --> 00:54:03.187
    engaged in the life, liberty
 and pursuit of happenness.

00:54:03.188 --> 00:54:06.718
          We're the stories of 
protagonist.

00:54:06.719 --> 00:54:10.436
          I grew up in the world
 dreamed of a better future and 

00:54:10.437 --> 00:54:13.670
found 
    ways great and small to 

00:54:13.671 --> 00:54:15.418
fight against injustice. They 
did all they 

00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:20.117
    could to help people do 
their best work, whether it was 

00:54:20.118 --> 00:54:23.717
cleaning 
    other people's houses as my 

00:54:23.718 --> 00:54:30.068
grandmother did or calculating 
    trajectoryies as I wrote 

00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:33.334
about in hidden figures.
          Business people who 

00:54:33.335 --> 00:54:39.355
pulled their resources to 
provide -- 

00:54:39.356 --> 00:54:41.956
          There was the chemist

00:54:45.221 --> 00:54:46.138
 George Washington carve serand 
he was 

00:54:46.139 --> 00:54:49.120
    the black scientist that 
everyone heard about during 

00:54:49.121 --> 00:54:52.685
class and 
    they had him working over 

00:54:52.686 --> 00:54:55.886
time during black history month.
          I could not

00:55:42.614 --> 00:55:45.952
.
          &gt;&gt; I recently moveed 

00:55:45.953 --> 00:55:49.597
to Charlotte's individual 
Virginia, so 

00:55:49.598 --> 00:55:53.989
    today not only am I working 
as a writer and historian, I'm 

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.405
living 
    history in a way that's 

00:55:56.406 --> 00:55:59.958
terrifying and fascinating and I
 thought 

00:55:59.959 --> 00:56:02.597
    would never occur in my 
lifetime --

00:56:46.649 --> 00:56:48.649
          &gt;&gt; 

00:56:53.204 --> 00:56:53.258
          &gt;&gt; 
          &gt;&gt; 

00:56:53.259 --> 00:56:55.259
          &gt;&gt; 

00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:52.783
          &gt;&gt; But it's also about
 so very much more --

00:58:05.127 --> 00:58:07.430
 I believe that 
    one of the reasons why the 

00:58:07.431 --> 00:58:11.755
push to remove these statutes 
was so 

00:58:11.756 --> 00:58:16.342
    strong right now because it 
symbolizeed --

00:58:16.343 --> 00:58:18.343
          &gt;&gt; 

00:59:06.649 --> 00:59:10.012
          &gt;&gt; It's a necessary 
condition for progress and for 

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:10.028
social 
    change.

00:59:10.029 --> 00:59:14.369
          Now I know that 
storytelling, that most human of

00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:18.508
 activities, 
    storying telling determines 

00:59:18.509 --> 00:59:22.793
the meaning of our past and the 
    trajectory of our future, --

00:59:23.045 --> 00:59:25.492
 no one knew that better than 
our 

00:59:25.493 --> 00:59:28.062
    finding writers, they wrote 
our country

00:59:58.756 --> 01:00:00.756
.
          &gt;&gt; 

01:00:03.737 --> 01:00:05.737
          &gt;&gt; 

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:24.939
          &gt;&gt; Ladies and 
gentlemen, please welcome Scott 

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.940
Turow,

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.735
.
          &gt;&gt; Tough act to follow

01:00:31.736 --> 01:00:33.736
.

01:01:37.869 --> 01:01:39.869
           &gt;&gt; INSTRUCTOR:

01:04:34.378 --> 01:04:40.879
          &gt;&gt; They were not true.
          Meaning -- they did 

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.743
not offer the clues 
about surviveing in the world 

01:04:43.744 --> 01:04:48.449
which I apparently 
expected from them -- it's a 

01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:54.312
given of every child to 
learn there is no Santa clauses 

01:04:54.313 --> 01:04:59.934
or superheros but in 
real life I realizeed there 

01:04:59.935 --> 01:05:07.330
could not be a peary 
mason -- I -- couldn't possibly 

01:05:07.331 --> 01:05:13.569
have kept his job if 
every week he lost to pair to R 

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:16.183
Perry mason.
          This struggle between 

01:05:16.184 --> 01:05:20.183
hope and reality, 
child and adult led to an 

01:05:20.184 --> 01:05:23.999
internal dialogue that 
went inside me for many years, 

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.956
which I all thely -- 
the burden of proof, my hero the

01:05:31.089 --> 01:05:35.825
 defense lawyer sand
sandy stern, my own answer, is 

01:05:35.826 --> 01:05:43.386
long passed his child 
yearing years, when he finds 

01:05:43.387 --> 01:05:47.166
himself baby sitting 
for Sam, --

01:06:01.534 --> 01:06:05.965
          No stern said finally,
 not always -- it 

01:06:05.966 --> 01:06:12.833
does on TV the boy said. This 
was offered in part as 

01:06:12.834 --> 01:06:16.303
reputation -- that is what 
television is showing you

01:06:16.304 --> 01:06:19.466
you.
          Why didn't it win? It 

01:06:19.467 --> 01:06:22.583
does not always lose
lose, it wins often but not 

01:06:22.584 --> 01:06:27.185
every time. Why not? 
Sometimes the other side is 

01:06:27.186 --> 01:06:31.557
stronger, sometimes both 
sides are good in part, 

01:06:31.558 --> 01:06:36.239
sometimes neither, stern 
thought, how much does good win 

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:42.071
Sam asked, a lot? A 
a lot said stern, he meant to 

01:06:42.072 --> 01:06:46.487
say as often as it 
loses but he felt it was 

01:06:46.488 --> 01:06:49.759
inappropriate and not 
correct. There was no brutal 

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.566
honest with a child.
          The conversations have

01:06:54.003 --> 01:06:57.265
 been the obsessions 
of my adult years, decideing 

01:06:57.266 --> 01:07:01.117
what is good in the 
first place and defining the 

01:07:01.118 --> 01:07:06.989
circumstances in which 
it's entitle to triumph, how to 

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:12.524
deal with the bad 
and -- they were I realize now 

01:07:12.525 --> 01:07:15.318
the themes I was 
writing about when I made my 

01:07:15.319 --> 01:07:18.473
first serious efforts 
at fiction in College, and they 

01:07:18.474 --> 01:07:23.359
remained my core 
emotion concerns and drove me 

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.994
from academic life to 
law school in my late 20's.

01:07:26.995 --> 01:07:33.138
          Furthermore, like all 
of my beloved fellow 

01:07:33.139 --> 01:07:36.569
writers at this wonderful 
Festival, I found out that 

01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:39.371
the questions and the stories I 
have written about 

01:07:39.372 --> 01:07:43.075
them reoccupy not only me but 
many other Americans 

01:07:43.076 --> 01:07:45.253
-- no surprise really --

01:07:48.509 --> 01:07:54.856
 the law has been the bind
binding fabric of America, that 

01:07:54.857 --> 01:07:58.730
is because we're not 
a country, a group of people 

01:07:58.731 --> 01:08:02.262
drawn together by the 
common places of geography or 

01:08:02.263 --> 01:08:05.255
even language, our 
fellowship in the United States 

01:08:05.256 --> 01:08:12.507
is based on a larger 
mutual adherence of ideas that 

01:08:12.508 --> 01:08:16.091
the government must 
be subordinates of law and the 

01:08:16.092 --> 01:08:20.177
greatest ideal of all 
the one that Thomas Jefferson 

01:08:20.178 --> 01:08:26.007
and his coauthors 
borrowed mainly that all persons

01:08:26.008 --> 01:08:30.860
 are createddial.
          Our biggest idea is 

01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:33.108
that government must 
treat every citizen with the 

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:38.876
same concern and 
respect and guarantee to each 

01:08:38.877 --> 01:08:41.507
citizen an equal voice 
in the governance of the nation 

01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:42.575
we have formed 
together.

01:08:42.576 --> 01:08:45.823
          So my story as I 
understand it is part of 

01:08:45.824 --> 01:08:49.326
that much larger story, the one 
we tell together 

01:08:49.327 --> 01:08:55.130
every day and the one that we 
must always strive to 

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:58.386
make ever trueer. Thank you. 
          (Applause)

01:09:15.092 --> 01:09:15.145
.
          Ladies and gentlemen, 

01:09:15.146 --> 01:09:17.146
please welcome

01:10:01.043 --> 01:10:04.941
Refresh ma Saujani.
          My parents became two 

01:10:04.942 --> 01:10:10.728
of thousand refugee 
that's got status to come to 

01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:16.898
this country, my father 
worked as a machinist in the 

01:10:16.899 --> 01:10:22.254
plant and my mother 
sold cosmetics. My father would 

01:10:22.255 --> 01:10:25.232
send his day after 
day after day and get rejection 

01:10:25.233 --> 01:10:30.451
after rejection -- 
until one day a recruiter said 

01:10:30.452 --> 01:10:34.900
why don't you change 
your name to Mike and my father 

01:10:34.901 --> 01:10:36.415
did and he got a job
job.

01:10:36.416 --> 01:10:42.580
          Every night no matter 
how tired my dad was

01:10:42.581 --> 01:10:44.581
was, he

01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:15.130
.

01:11:17.112 --> 01:11:22.176
I had like a 1% chance of win 
ago thousand 

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:25.197
page policy book and the on the 
record thing my 

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:30.000
friends and I knew how to do was
 build a website and 

01:11:30.001 --> 01:11:35.490
we built one -- and it was the 
best experience of my 

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:41.300
life.
          And I lost. I was 

01:11:41.301 --> 01:11:47.615
broke, humiliated, I was 
-- I pissed off everybody in the

01:11:47.616 --> 01:11:52.162
 democratic 
establish , but when I went to 

01:11:52.163 --> 01:11:54.915
bed that night, the 
faces that I kept seeing over 

01:11:54.916 --> 01:11:59.285
and over again, were 
actually the ones that I had 

01:11:59.286 --> 01:12:06.016
never met on the 
campaign trail, the members of 

01:12:06.017 --> 01:12:09.715
Congress in this room 
as you understand, when you run 

01:12:09.716 --> 01:12:13.565
for office you go 
into a lot of schools, I would 

01:12:13.566 --> 01:12:15.566
see hundreds of boys,

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:26.280
are the girls -- and 
this question of where the girls

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:29.803
 started is a 
question and became my obsession

01:12:30.097 --> 01:12:34.436
 because it didn't 
make sense to me --

01:13:02.801 --> 01:13:07.162
          I also knew that our 
families were 

01:13:07.163 --> 01:13:13.160
changing. That 45% of the 
breadwinners in our 

01:13:13.161 --> 01:13:17.418
country were women and it's 
women in towns and 

01:13:17.419 --> 01:13:21.665
parishes that put food on the 
table and may for the 

01:13:21.666 --> 01:13:24.812
mortgage, so why were they 
disappearing from this 

01:13:24.813 --> 01:13:27.412
industry? And I realizeed it 
wasn't you always this 

01:13:27.413 --> 01:13:34.112
way -- in the 1980's almost 40 %
% of computer 

01:13:34.113 --> 01:13:38.650
science majors were women and 
today it's less than 

01:13:38.651 --> 01:13:41.581
18%.
          If you're asinico 

01:13:41.582 --> 01:13:44.966
would think an industry 
becomes more powerful, we push 

01:13:44.967 --> 01:13:48.730
women out.
          So the failed 

01:13:48.731 --> 01:13:50.731
politicians and

01:13:52.051 --> 01:13:54.850
 non-codeer, I 
don't code, I started to do 

01:13:54.851 --> 01:13:57.816
something about it, and 
I started an organization girls 

01:13:57.817 --> 01:14:02.831
who code, to offer 
free programs to teach them to 

01:14:02.832 --> 01:14:06.324
get a shot at The 
American Dream, and five years 

01:14:06.325 --> 01:14:11.779
later we reached 40
40,000 girls in all 50 states 

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:16.567
and as much as I'm a 
feminist with a capital F I 

01:14:16.568 --> 01:14:21.919
don't believe in gender 
parityiy, I believe when we we 

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.854
teach girls to code we 
give them to Marne up to the 

01:14:25.855 --> 01:14:28.953
middle class and make 
sure there is no innovation that

01:14:29.384 --> 01:14:32.370
 will be left on the 
sidelines. I see this every day.

01:14:32.371 --> 01:14:36.643
 I see this in 
Jazmine who lives in California,

01:14:37.507 --> 01:14:42.505
 her mom works at 
Burger King, every day Jazmine 

01:14:42.506 --> 01:14:46.735
would take two buss, 
two trains to learn how to code.

01:14:46.736 --> 01:14:50.264
          In our program you can
 build whatever you 

01:14:50.265 --> 01:14:55.987
want. Jazmine decideed to build 
an app called whacky 

01:14:55.988 --> 01:14:57.988
worlds to teach kids

01:15:02.651 --> 01:15:09.496
 SAT words -- she built an app 
not for herself but to help 

01:15:09.497 --> 01:15:13.138
others.
          I think about Courtney

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.140
, in Ohio,

01:15:20.462 --> 01:15:24.682
 there's 
no WIFI in the homes, no WIFI in

01:15:24.683 --> 01:15:28.431
 the schools but 
still every week 40 girls meet 

01:15:28.432 --> 01:15:33.794
in a local library to 
learn how to cold to get a shot 

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.062
at The American 
Dream.

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:39.058
          The same look that I 
see in Courtney's 

01:15:39.059 --> 01:15:43.075
eyes is a look that I saw in my 
father's eyes. He 

01:15:43.076 --> 01:15:46.335
would do anything and everything
 for me to have a 

01:15:46.336 --> 01:15:53.149
shot and The American Dream. 
This is possible. I 

01:15:53.150 --> 01:15:56.446
feel blessed that we've had an 
opportunity to write 

01:15:56.447 --> 01:16:00.112
a book because year after year 
after year we have to 

01:16:00.113 --> 01:16:03.819
turn girls away, and I want to 
make sure girls 

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:08.092
across the country have a shot 
to march up into the 

01:16:08.093 --> 01:16:12.060
middle class, I also believe 
that in a moment when 

01:16:12.061 --> 01:16:16.164
we feel that diverseity is under
 attack, when we just 

01:16:16.165 --> 01:16:22.333
recently learned about Katherine
 Johnson and the 

01:16:22.334 --> 01:16:23.864
tremendous contribution that she
 had made to the 

01:16:23.865 --> 01:16:28.603
history of computer science, if 
you don't know who 

01:16:28.604 --> 01:16:31.817
the women are, it's important 
now more than ever 

01:16:31.818 --> 01:16:35.367
before to set the record 
straight to make sure that 

01:16:35.368 --> 01:16:38.670
girls see themselves in these 
future jobs, which is 

01:16:38.671 --> 01:16:43.183
why I'm so proud in this book 
that not only do we 

01:16:43.184 --> 01:16:47.352
talk about Katherine and ada and
 grace, we talk 

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:55.753
about Sophia, -- so feea who is 
Latina, Lucy who has 

01:16:55.754 --> 01:17:00.629
braids and loves games.
          Every American girl 

01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:02.999
can see themselves in 
the stories in our book. 

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.815
          And I truly believe 
that through this we 

01:17:06.816 --> 01:17:11.731
can change the world one book 
and one girl at a time

01:17:11.732 --> 01:17:13.732
time. Thank you. 
          (Applause)

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:28.575
.
          &gt;&gt; 

01:17:34.551 --> 01:17:36.423
Ladies and gentlemen, please 
welcome 

01:17:36.424 --> 01:17:40.114
Diana gabecause doing -- Diana

01:17:43.514 --> 01:17:46.952
 gabadone,.
          Thank you very much 

01:17:46.968 --> 01:17:50.748
for being here tonight 
and thanks for having me. Be 

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:55.044
relaxed they said.
          Be casual they said.

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:59.019
          Do it in seven minutes
 they said.

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:01.020
          Okay. 

01:18:04.256 --> 01:18:08.523
Some of you may know means good 
evening in German and the reason

01:18:08.726 --> 01:18:11.966
 I say that is 
because most of you have no idea

01:18:12.713 --> 01:18:17.479
 how close we came 
to having everyone in this room 

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:21.800
know what that meant 
-- the time of the American 

01:18:21.801 --> 01:18:27.204
revolution, Benjamin 
Franklin who is one of the major

01:18:27.205 --> 01:18:29.922
 cents of the 
revolution at that point so many

01:18:31.021 --> 01:18:33.587
 citizens were 
German it should be the official

01:18:34.146 --> 01:18:39.112
 language of the new 
United States, that motion went 

01:18:39.113 --> 01:18:43.687
to Congress, was 
voted on and was lost by one 

01:18:43.688 --> 01:18:45.397
vote, and here we all 
are.

01:18:45.398 --> 01:18:50.635
          And from a variety of 
different places, my 

01:18:50.636 --> 01:18:55.030
story became "The American 
Story"," other than the 

01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:58.469
obvious about who my parents, 
grandparents etc were 

01:18:58.470 --> 01:19:01.334
-- that's much too long a story 
to tell you.

01:19:01.335 --> 01:19:05.282
          The short form when I 
went to Germany to 

01:19:05.283 --> 01:19:10.978
do a book tour I was having 
lunch with the Germans 

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:13.956
and they said how did you come 
to write these books 

01:19:13.957 --> 01:19:18.263
and I told them and he were 
shocked -- shocked, to 

01:19:18.264 --> 01:19:22.663
hear that I had thrown away a 
perfectly good PhD in 

01:19:22.664 --> 01:19:27.034
science, I have a PhD in 
quantitative behavior 

01:19:27.035 --> 01:19:30.201
ecology which is animal behavior
 with a lot of 

01:19:30.202 --> 01:19:33.162
statistics, don't worry about it
. My dissertation 

01:19:33.163 --> 01:19:37.900
was entitleed selection in 
opinion.  » REPORTER:^-- 

01:19:37.901 --> 01:19:44.800
          -- or as my husband 
says why birds build 

01:19:44.801 --> 01:19:48.400
nests where they do and who care
s anyways.

01:19:48.401 --> 01:19:54.063
          Well, the Germans were
 more shocked to 

01:19:54.064 --> 01:19:59.786
find I threw away a PhD and 12 
years of a career as 

01:19:59.787 --> 01:20:01.917
a successful scientist but I did
 not go back to 

01:20:01.918 --> 01:20:05.318
school and got a degree in how 
to write a novel, 

01:20:05.319 --> 01:20:11.334
they said no one in Germany 
would care to write a 

01:20:11.335 --> 01:20:14.663
novel without getting a PhD in 
literature, and I 

01:20:14.664 --> 01:20:22.235
said that's probably why 2/3 of 
your -- are American 

01:20:22.236 --> 01:20:25.104
authors.
          The thing is as I was 

01:20:25.105 --> 01:20:28.619
talking to Scott 
Turow before and we were agree

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:31.618
ing the only way to 
write is to write and that's 

01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:34.434
what were my thoughts 
when I started writing a novel. 

01:20:34.435 --> 01:20:38.586
So the question was 
what would I write -- the 

01:20:38.587 --> 01:20:40.882
easiest thing to write is 
historical fiction because I was

01:20:41.855 --> 01:20:45.689
 a research 
Professor, I knew my way around 

01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:49.117
the library, it's 
easier to look things up than to

01:20:49.963 --> 01:20:53.363
 make things up and 
I can steal things from the 

01:20:53.364 --> 01:20:56.815
historical record.
          I said where should I 

01:20:56.816 --> 01:21:01.162
set this book -- I 
have no background -- so I was 

01:21:01.163 --> 01:21:05.598
looking for a time 
and place and I happen to see a 

01:21:05.599 --> 01:21:09.782
long Dr. Who rerun 
on possible television, I gather

01:21:09.785 --> 01:21:13.758
 some of you are 
familiar with Dr. Who, he's the 

01:21:13.759 --> 01:21:15.563
time Lord who travel
travels through space and time 

01:21:15.564 --> 01:21:21.116
and picks up 
companions -- in this particular

01:21:21.132 --> 01:21:27.631
 show it picked up a 
young man who appeared in his 

01:21:27.632 --> 01:21:29.784
kilt, I said that's 
kind of fetching.

01:21:29.785 --> 01:21:33.019
          And I found myself 
still thinking about 

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:37.908
this the next day in Church and 
I said well you know 

01:21:37.909 --> 01:21:40.465
it didn't matter where you set 
this book so you need 

01:21:40.466 --> 01:21:44.713
to start somewhere why not 
Scotland 18th century, 

01:21:44.714 --> 01:21:48.527
so that's where I began, having 
no plot, no outline 

01:21:48.528 --> 01:21:53.164
and no characters, nothing but a
 rather vague images 

01:21:53.165 --> 01:21:57.590
of a nothing of a man in a kid 
which is a powerful 

01:21:57.591 --> 01:22:01.236
and come pegging image which all
 the easy lazyies 

01:22:01.237 --> 01:22:03.739
here can tell you.
          Going back to the 

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:09.001
Germans one of my later 
books was quite lucky and I one 

01:22:09.002 --> 01:22:12.565
the international 
prize for fiction and I went to 

01:22:12.566 --> 01:22:14.412
Germany to get the 
award.

01:22:14.413 --> 01:22:18.850
          They had me interview 
in the and toward 

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:22.265
the end I was talking to a nice 
gentleman and he 

01:22:22.266 --> 01:22:27.671
said I read all of your works, 
your characters are 

01:22:27.672 --> 01:22:32.685
three dimensional, I'm thinking 
yes, yes, go on, and 

01:22:32.686 --> 01:22:36.500
he said there's this one thing I
 wonder, can you 

01:22:36.501 --> 01:22:40.906
explain to me what is the appeal
 of a man in a 

01:22:40.907 --> 01:22:43.086
equipment?
          I was very tired or I 

01:22:43.087 --> 01:22:46.019
might not have said 
it but I said I suppose it's the

01:22:46.266 --> 01:22:50.111
 idea you can be up 
against the wall with him in a 

01:22:50.112 --> 01:22:55.412
minute.
          So, you may be wonder

01:22:55.413 --> 01:22:58.950
ing what this has to 
do with the American story.

01:23:02.353 --> 01:23:05.313
But it actually has a lot to do 
with it, 

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:11.012
which is to say, not only did I 
not get a PhD in 

01:23:11.013 --> 01:23:15.312
literature, the only thing I 
knew about writing book

01:23:15.313 --> 01:23:20.181
books is they should have 
conflict, 12 hours of 

01:23:20.182 --> 01:23:21.713
English literature in College, 
it seemed to be 

01:23:21.714 --> 01:23:27.513
enough. I went to the library 
looking for conflict 

01:23:27.514 --> 01:23:32.365
-- and so that became the 
material for my first book 

01:23:32.366 --> 01:23:35.081
and then for the second book, I 
was going to write 

01:23:35.082 --> 01:23:38.317
this book for practice, I wasn't
 going to show or 

01:23:38.318 --> 01:23:41.955
tell anyone what I was doing -- 
but things happen, 

01:23:41.956 --> 01:23:45.281
and I had an agent before I 
finished and I told him 

01:23:45.282 --> 01:23:48.462
I think there's more to this 
story and I should stop 

01:23:48.463 --> 01:23:54.588
and he said okay, luckily 
several people wanted to 

01:23:54.589 --> 01:23:58.823
buy it, they said do you think 
she could write three

01:23:58.824 --> 01:24:03.484
three, being an agent I think 
she could, so I 

01:24:03.485 --> 01:24:08.950
proceeded. Well as you may know 
the Highland Scotts 

01:24:08.951 --> 01:24:11.919
lost that one big time and as 
you result many of 

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.166
them came to the Americas, most 
of them involuntary

01:24:15.167 --> 01:24:18.857
involuntarily. And here they 
rested, so at the time 

01:24:18.858 --> 01:24:22.304
of the American revolution, one 
out of every three 

01:24:22.305 --> 01:24:26.563
was a Scott and we have several 
signers of 

01:24:26.564 --> 01:24:30.931
declaration and so forth.
          The people reading my 

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:38.480
second book -- -- 
they said we want to read about 

01:24:38.481 --> 01:24:41.485
Scotland, I said 
tough, the story went across the

01:24:41.887 --> 01:24:45.462
 ocean, now we're in 
America. That's where the story 

01:24:45.463 --> 01:24:49.513
developed over the 
next six books and became 

01:24:49.514 --> 01:24:52.581
increasingly interested in 
how many different people 

01:24:52.582 --> 01:24:55.110
contributeed to "The 
American Story"," we're working 

01:24:55.111 --> 01:24:58.562
our way through the 
several years of the American 

01:24:58.563 --> 01:25:05.936
revolution and quakeers 
and Germans and with the 

01:25:05.937 --> 01:25:13.631
Highlands, also with the 
Africans were were there, most 

01:25:13.632 --> 01:25:17.389
of them involuntaryily 
as well, Highlanders and African

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:23.032
s had much in common 
most being involuntaryily there,

01:25:23.725 --> 01:25:27.763
 there was quite a 
lot of cultural overlap in part 

01:25:27.764 --> 01:25:31.415
going through the 
music and songs they had. You 

01:25:31.416 --> 01:25:37.863
will find something -- 
it's contributeed to American 

01:25:37.864 --> 01:25:39.516
jazz.
          What's interesting is 

01:25:39.517 --> 01:25:44.800
you'll find that 
very same thing mock highlanders

01:25:44.801 --> 01:25:47.472
 who never seen 
Africa and came up with them on 

01:25:47.473 --> 01:25:49.146
their own.
          Another interesting 

01:25:49.147 --> 01:25:54.982
thing as the Gales 
came as seven attitude, still 

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:58.119
they were white which 
was kind of an advantage at the 

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:01.316
time, and therefore 
they were in some cases made 

01:26:01.317 --> 01:26:05.113
over seeers of the other 
slaves, I count them as slaves 

01:26:05.114 --> 01:26:08.785
as well, on 
plantations and the like, and 

01:26:08.786 --> 01:26:11.227
the interesting thing 
was that many of the black 

01:26:11.228 --> 01:26:16.200
people there learned to 
speak gay like because they're 

01:26:16.201 --> 01:26:19.902
over seeers and we 
were treated as newly arriveed 

01:26:19.903 --> 01:26:24.564
people coming in from 
the Highlanded being met by 

01:26:24.565 --> 01:26:31.416
black inhabitats on the 
docs and hearing them speak -- 

01:26:31.417 --> 01:26:35.532
what happened to you 
the sun must be terrible.

01:26:35.533 --> 01:26:39.118
          The thing is there's 
this cross 

01:26:39.119 --> 01:26:42.118
fertilization always -- from the
 very beginning, 

01:26:42.119 --> 01:26:46.064
several members of my family 
bought into the 

01:26:46.065 --> 01:26:50.178
American revolution on both 
sides, my father's side 

01:26:50.179 --> 01:26:57.880
of the family landed in sant 
Faye in 17 --

01:27:16.666 --> 01:27:21.205
 English 
is the language that cases down 

01:27:21.206 --> 01:27:24.065
the alley -- and 
this is pretty much true.

01:27:24.066 --> 01:27:31.718
          However, as Shetterly 
said earlier, the 

01:27:31.719 --> 01:27:36.233
roots of our language, our 
revolution, our culture 

01:27:36.234 --> 01:27:42.118
go back to -- Washington and 
Jefferson made as much 

01:27:42.119 --> 01:27:45.681
of an impact as they did in part
 because of what 

01:27:45.682 --> 01:27:48.232
they said as well as what they 
meant by it. 

01:27:48.233 --> 01:27:54.036
          And so we kind of beat
 Germany out by then 

01:27:54.037 --> 01:27:55.053
and became a nation of English 
speakers.

01:27:55.054 --> 01:27:58.466
          The funny thing is a 
lot of the philosophy 

01:27:58.467 --> 01:28:02.484
of the American revolution arose
 from the English 

01:28:02.485 --> 01:28:05.514
club men and this was where they
 got their 

01:28:05.515 --> 01:28:10.383
socialization, they all belong 
to society, some were 

01:28:10.384 --> 01:28:14.231
philosophical and some studyied 
literature, others 

01:28:14.232 --> 01:28:20.915
had other views in mind, whose 
goal was drinking, 

01:28:20.916 --> 01:28:23.933
they had a particular song that 
they sang at each 

01:28:23.934 --> 01:28:27.216
one of their meetings, thank --

01:28:41.132 --> 01:28:44.120
Which should be 18th century 
equivalent 

01:28:44.121 --> 01:28:48.681
of let's all get drunk and have 
sex. 

01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:09.857
And the morale of that is the 
words matter

01:29:09.858 --> 01:29:11.692
matter. 
          (Applause).

01:29:11.693 --> 01:29:13.693
          &gt;&gt; 

01:29:27.202 --> 01:29:27.217
Ladies and gentlemen, please 
welcome 

01:29:27.218 --> 01:29:30.798
David Mccol Lou.

01:29:46.267 --> 01:29:49.251
David McCullough.
                    &gt;&gt; What a 

01:29:49.252 --> 01:29:52.955
wonderful night and what a 
privilege we all are to be here,

01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:56.969
 look at these 
fabulous words up here,

01:30:03.482 --> 01:30:05.845
 Library of Congress National 
Book Festival, we have a Library

01:30:05.846 --> 01:30:08.304
 of Congress, we 
have a National Book Festival, 

01:30:08.305 --> 01:30:12.301
and to take part in 
it as one of the writers, for me

01:30:12.563 --> 01:30:17.100
 is a very high 
privilege and I am pleased to 

01:30:17.101 --> 01:30:20.685
say that I've been 
involve with this event since 

01:30:20.686 --> 01:30:28.883
its beginning in 2001 
-- and all enthusiasm I can to 

01:30:28.884 --> 01:30:32.065
keep it going and 
keeping it going indefinitely.

01:30:32.066 --> 01:30:36.317
          I want to say thank 
you to Dr. Hayden, and 

01:30:36.318 --> 01:30:41.300
all of those who work with you, 
for the marvelous 

01:30:41.301 --> 01:30:43.847
contribution you make, you the 
staff, the Library of 

01:30:43.848 --> 01:30:49.083
Congress to our country and to 
its better In so many 

01:30:49.084 --> 01:30:52.500
ways.
          I have been devoteing 

01:30:52.501 --> 01:30:57.116
my working life to 
the American story for over 50 

01:30:57.117 --> 01:30:59.117
years, and I'm

01:31:01.802 --> 01:31:04.633
 every 
grateful that I somehow had the 

01:31:04.634 --> 01:31:08.301
good fortune to 
wonder into this way of life, 

01:31:08.302 --> 01:31:15.265
this way of 
contributing what I can. To the 

01:31:15.266 --> 01:31:20.518
bet Of our country.
          I've done this on on 

01:31:20.519 --> 01:31:25.801
paper, in classrooms, 
on television, and on the stage,

01:31:25.802 --> 01:31:30.633
 and in every way I 
can to convey that history isn't

01:31:30.802 --> 01:31:37.719
 about boring 
statistics and quotations and 

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:42.436
memorizeing dates, it 
isn't just about politics and 

01:31:42.437 --> 01:31:47.869
military, history is 
human, it is about people, when 

01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:53.385
in the course of 
human events are declaration 

01:31:53.386 --> 01:31:55.819
begins, the operative 
word there is human.

01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:59.767
          I've had wonderful 
responses from readers 

01:31:59.768 --> 01:32:04.903
and television viewers and 
students -- I've lectureed 

01:32:04.904 --> 01:32:08.319
in Colleges and Universityies 
all over the country.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.220
          And the compliments I 
take very much to 

01:32:12.221 --> 01:32:13.604
heart.
          Including one that 

01:32:13.605 --> 01:32:18.685
happened in the most un
unexpected way just two years 

01:32:18.686 --> 01:32:24.565
ago in Boston where we 
had that horrendous lizard 

01:32:24.566 --> 01:32:27.931
series of 9 feet of snow 
in a matter of about a month or 

01:32:27.932 --> 01:32:31.100
less, it was a 
blizzard every two or three days

01:32:32.367 --> 01:32:35.057
 with brief interval
intervals where we could try to 

01:32:35.058 --> 01:32:38.635
get out to get food 
and provisions to survive. We 

01:32:38.636 --> 01:32:42.483
were living in back 
bay at the time, and we would 

01:32:42.484 --> 01:32:46.179
make up a list and we 
would go over and get what we 

01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:50.004
needed, and one 
particularly bad series of storm

01:32:50.005 --> 01:32:53.714
s it -- hit and we 
got a list of everything we 

01:32:53.715 --> 01:32:57.086
needed and I went over 
when the break came in the 

01:32:57.087 --> 01:33:02.972
weather and the market 
was a mad house, the premium try

01:33:03.635 --> 01:33:05.045
ing to get enough to 
get by.

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:11.162
          And it was as if the 
rushes were in 

01:33:11.163 --> 01:33:13.163
Russians were in

01:33:15.433 --> 01:33:17.584
 road island or something -- I 
got 

01:33:17.585 --> 01:33:21.300
everything on the list except 
the sash should yous, 

01:33:21.301 --> 01:33:24.685
you know, you can't survive 
without them.

01:33:24.686 --> 01:33:30.596
          So I saw a fellow 
walking by with a market 

01:33:30.597 --> 01:33:35.097
label on his shirt, I said 
excuse me could you 

01:33:35.098 --> 01:33:39.951
please help me to find the ca 
should yous I said -- 

01:33:39.952 --> 01:33:43.634
he said follow me, and there it 
was -- the whole

01:33:52.264 --> 01:33:54.963
 bin -- 
the same fellow came up to me 

01:33:54.964 --> 01:34:01.248
and he said, excuse me 
I don't mean to both you but 

01:34:01.249 --> 01:34:06.800
your voice, were you by 
any chance the anyway ray torof 

01:34:06.801 --> 01:34:09.077
Ken's Civil War 
series, and I said yes I was.

01:34:09.078 --> 01:34:14.247
          And he said I want to 
thank you from the 

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:17.080
bottom of my heart because when 
that series first 

01:34:17.081 --> 01:34:19.448
came on the air I was suffering

01:34:22.734 --> 01:34:25.087
 terribly from insome 
na.

01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:37.697
He said I heard your voice and 
went right 

01:34:37.698 --> 01:34:40.912
out. So I hope I don't have that
 effect on you 

01:34:40.913 --> 01:34:43.081
tonight.
          I found my vocation 

01:34:43.082 --> 01:34:47.081
here in the Library of 
Congress. I had wanted to be a 

01:34:47.082 --> 01:34:51.718
writer, I had gone to 
Yale University and majored in 

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:57.869
English, I thought I 
would want to be like -- and 

01:34:57.870 --> 01:35:04.364
write plays or novels, 
I had no expectation whatsoever 

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:06.934
of writing biography 
or history.

01:35:06.935 --> 01:35:10.382
          When I got out of 
College I couldn't make 

01:35:10.383 --> 01:35:15.651
up my mind if I wanted to be a 
writer, painter or 

01:35:15.652 --> 01:35:20.068
architect, I said I know what 
I'll do I'll go to New 

01:35:20.069 --> 01:35:22.137
York and something will happen. 
I wound up working 

01:35:22.138 --> 01:35:25.035
for time and life for six and a 
half years and 

01:35:25.036 --> 01:35:28.731
learned a a hell of a lot about 
writing and getting 

01:35:28.732 --> 01:35:30.812
work done and getting it done on
 time.

01:35:30.813 --> 01:35:34.265
          And then Kennedy was 
running for President 

01:35:34.266 --> 01:35:39.350
and when he called on people to 
do something for 

01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:43.215
your country I took that to 
heart, quit my job, came 

01:35:43.216 --> 01:35:47.485
down here to Washington and 
wound up working for the 

01:35:47.486 --> 01:35:52.430
U.S. information agency it was a
 very exciteing time, 

01:35:52.431 --> 01:35:57.610
not only because we were working
 for mer ridiculous 

01:35:57.611 --> 01:36:01.384
but on the new frontier.
          I was put in charge of

01:36:03.982 --> 01:36:07.247
 the magazine of the 
arAbe world, I had a limited you

01:36:07.285 --> 01:36:13.821
 budget that I had 
to keep working. I had to search

01:36:13.822 --> 01:36:21.297
 out the resources 
photographs, the magazine was 

01:36:21.298 --> 01:36:25.170
called life in America
America, it was based on life 

01:36:25.171 --> 01:36:29.297
magazine, sold on the 
new stands, and I came top the 

01:36:29.298 --> 01:36:30.960
Library of Congress 
to try and find wonderful 

01:36:30.961 --> 01:36:35.280
material that we could use 
in the magazine that was free. 

01:36:35.516 --> 01:36:43.650
And while I was here 
working one day, I passed the 

01:36:43.651 --> 01:36:45.786
department of public 
photographs, I went by the table

01:36:46.335 --> 01:36:50.880
 and on the table 
was this wolf asoft Of 

01:36:50.881 --> 01:36:53.077
photographs taken by a

01:36:57.763 --> 01:37:00.646
 -- 
          I grown up in 

01:37:00.647 --> 01:37:04.832
Pittsburgh and I heard about 
the flood all my life and -- but

01:37:05.001 --> 01:37:07.262
 I didn't know 
anything about it, all I knew 

01:37:07.263 --> 01:37:12.381
was when we were kids 
we used to put a Lake of gravyiy

01:37:12.384 --> 01:37:18.665
 in the mashed poets 
and break poets and make it -- 

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:23.765
break it with our 
fork and say -- I looked at 

01:37:23.766 --> 01:37:27.851
these photographs absaid 
what in the world happened, I 

01:37:27.852 --> 01:37:28.849
couldn't believe the 
devastation.

01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:34.448
          That was the worst 
man-made disaster that 

01:37:34.449 --> 01:37:40.281
ever hit the country until then.
          Over 2500 people died,

01:37:40.282 --> 01:37:47.050
 as many died in the 
tower in New York at 911.

01:37:47.051 --> 01:37:51.135
          And I got interested 
in it and I took a 

01:37:51.136 --> 01:37:55.166
book out of the library, this 
library, and it was -- 

01:37:55.167 --> 01:37:59.212
it wasn't very good, the author 
didn't seem to 

01:37:59.213 --> 01:38:03.012
understand the geography of 
western Pennsylvania, I 

01:38:03.013 --> 01:38:08.312
knew that, so I took another 
book out, I thought no, 

01:38:08.313 --> 01:38:14.512
-- so when I was in College, 
Thorton wilder was 

01:38:14.513 --> 01:38:20.381
asked how do you come up to 
write plays and novels 

01:38:20.382 --> 01:38:22.251
you've written, he said I 
imagine the story that I 

01:38:22.252 --> 01:38:24.882
would like to see produceed on 
stage or to read in a 

01:38:24.883 --> 01:38:28.312
book and if I can't find that I 
write it so I can 

01:38:28.313 --> 01:38:31.449
read it or write it so I can see
 it performed on 

01:38:31.450 --> 01:38:33.850
stage.
          So I said to myself, 

01:38:33.851 --> 01:38:40.409
why don't you write, 
try to write the book about the 

01:38:40.410 --> 01:38:43.412
Johns town flood 
that you wouldn't it to read, 

01:38:43.413 --> 01:38:48.084
and I've done that 
with every subject I have 

01:38:48.085 --> 01:38:52.362
undertaken since I have 
done this work. I've never done 

01:38:52.363 --> 01:38:55.761
historyic research, I 
have never taken more of history

01:38:55.762 --> 01:38:59.579
 than what was 
required, I have no graduate 

01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:02.436
degrees and I never 
thought of myself as a historian

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:08.277
, I'm called a 
historian and I'm always 

01:39:08.278 --> 01:39:12.563
complimented by that, but 
I'm a writer, a writer of what 

01:39:12.564 --> 01:39:16.863
really happened the 
best I can. The writing I've 

01:39:16.864 --> 01:39:19.665
done in College and the 
courses I've taken and the 

01:39:19.666 --> 01:39:23.784
writing I've done in that 
time in my life I realizes you 

01:39:23.785 --> 01:39:28.001
have to understand 
the people. Who was involved, 

01:39:28.002 --> 01:39:31.017
what were they like, 
how what were they thinking, how

01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:35.140
 were they raised, 
where did they come fork what 

01:39:35.141 --> 01:39:38.557
were their problems 
and adversityies they faced P. 

01:39:38.558 --> 01:39:43.962
history is about 
people. And because I was in 

01:39:43.963 --> 01:39:47.282
Washington, during the 
Kennedy years, Kennedy as many 

01:39:47.283 --> 01:39:50.061
of you may remember 
or know was asked about what he 

01:39:50.062 --> 01:39:52.080
was reading and he 
was reading

01:39:55.333 --> 01:39:58.366
 the guns of August, so I went 
out of way 

01:39:58.367 --> 01:40:02.467
and I got it. I thought wow, 
this is the kind of 

01:40:02.468 --> 01:40:05.731
history book I would like to 
read more of. So I 

01:40:05.732 --> 01:40:09.149
began reading people like Bruce 
catman and others 

01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:12.163
and I realizeed that writers can
 write history.

01:40:12.164 --> 01:40:18.265
          And Barbara tuckman in
 one of her essays 

01:40:18.266 --> 01:40:20.981
about brighting history said 
there's no secret of 

01:40:20.982 --> 01:40:25.353
writing history or teaching 
history tell stories, 

01:40:25.354 --> 01:40:30.166
"The American Story". Which is 
hardly been even half 

01:40:30.167 --> 01:40:34.266
told, so far.
          For one thing too much

01:40:34.332 --> 01:40:37.911
 attention has been 
focused on politics in the 

01:40:37.912 --> 01:40:42.031
military, yes it's of the 
utmost importance but they by no

01:40:42.451 --> 01:40:47.981
 means are they 
human story. That involves 

01:40:47.982 --> 01:40:52.386
poetry, music, art, 
science, medicine, finance, it 

01:40:52.387 --> 01:40:56.518
involves luck, we 
never talk about a part luck has

01:40:56.776 --> 01:40:59.798
 played in history, 
and it involves individual human

01:40:59.799 --> 01:41:01.912
 beings that made a 
difference.

01:41:01.913 --> 01:41:06.900
          What began to interest
 metrically once I 

01:41:06.901 --> 01:41:10.900
got into writing -- as soon as I
 did the research 

01:41:10.901 --> 01:41:15.746
much of which I did here, I've 
done research for 

01:41:15.747 --> 01:41:18.885
everyone of my books here at the
 Library of Congress 

01:41:18.886 --> 01:41:21.517
to a large degree or to a small 
but important degree

01:41:21.518 --> 01:41:26.649
degree. My book on the Wright 
brothers was done 

01:41:26.650 --> 01:41:33.336
almost entirely amazing 
collection of letters and 

01:41:33.337 --> 01:41:38.788
diaryies kept by their mother, 
brother or sister, 

01:41:38.789 --> 01:41:41.917
kept right here, and they could 
write because their 

01:41:41.918 --> 01:41:46.446
father raised them to express 
themselves in the 

01:41:46.447 --> 01:41:48.299
English language as best as 
possible, on paper and 

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:52.462
on their feet. They never had 
completed high school 

01:41:52.463 --> 01:41:55.982
and yet you read those letters 
here and you think oh 

01:41:55.983 --> 01:41:59.816
my goodness, the vocabulary, the
 use of the commands 

01:41:59.817 --> 01:42:02.182
of the language and you realizes
 we got a lot of 

01:42:02.183 --> 01:42:06.635
work to do just to catch up with
 the kind of high 

01:42:06.636 --> 01:42:09.434
school and bringing up that 
those young men 

01:42:09.435 --> 01:42:12.165
experiences.
          They live inside a 

01:42:12.166 --> 01:42:16.423
house that had no 
running water, no indoor 

01:42:16.424 --> 01:42:20.166
plumbing, no central heat, 
no telephone phone, but it was a

01:42:20.198 --> 01:42:24.840
 house full of books
books. Because their father 

01:42:24.841 --> 01:42:29.122
believed you had to read 
and you have to read above your 

01:42:29.123 --> 01:42:33.069
left lane. So there 
were no children's books, all 

01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:37.663
real books, and they 
read all their lives. I'm not in

01:42:38.163 --> 01:42:42.162
 any way demeaning 
children's books, they stick 

01:42:42.163 --> 01:42:44.163
with you.

01:42:56.245 --> 01:43:01.065
When I went in grade school we 
were told 

01:43:01.066 --> 01:43:05.783
we could go and visit the school
 library. And this 

01:43:05.784 --> 01:43:09.517
was in kindergarten.
          And we went in and we 

01:43:09.518 --> 01:43:19.431
were thrilled. And 
the librarian, we all sat down 

01:43:19.432 --> 01:43:23.886
and she said did you 
all brick your library shoes? 

01:43:29.585 --> 01:43:34.834
My mother didn't tell 
me I had to have library shoes, 

01:43:34.849 --> 01:43:40.313
I felt so awful and 
insecure -- I can't come into 

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:45.886
any of these libraryies 
without knowing if I haveny 

01:43:45.887 --> 01:43:49.472
library shoes on.
          The books sticks with 

01:43:49.473 --> 01:43:53.313
you -- it's part of 
growing up, it's part of 

01:43:53.314 --> 01:43:58.679
discovery. The books that 
influenced me more than any 

01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:03.363
other is the engine that 
could -- you work together and 

01:44:03.364 --> 01:44:06.500
persevere -- not 
alone.

01:44:10.235 --> 01:44:13.771
Often wondered about why I do 
why I do and 

01:44:13.772 --> 01:44:17.289
whether I have some weird ways 
of going about it, 

01:44:17.290 --> 01:44:22.013
and I'm a little reluctant to 
talk about it openly 

01:44:22.014 --> 01:44:27.531
until recently I thought what 
the hell, hit it, I've 

01:44:27.532 --> 01:44:31.979
never undertaken a subject I 
never you knew about -- 

01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:37.703
to me the writing, the research 
the thinking that 

01:44:37.704 --> 01:44:41.686
goes into the work is an 
adventure, working on a 

01:44:41.687 --> 01:44:44.885
detective case, it's setting 
foot on a continent 

01:44:44.886 --> 01:44:49.883
where I never set foot in my 
life. And I love that.

01:44:49.884 --> 01:44:56.966
          I also have felt very 
strongly that I want

01:44:56.967 --> 01:45:00.287
wanted to give people who don't 
get sufficient 

01:45:00.288 --> 01:45:02.704
credit for the first time bring 
them back, bring 

01:45:02.705 --> 01:45:07.918
them on stage, with lighting on 
them, and bring some 

01:45:07.919 --> 01:45:15.550
of these seemingly peripheral 
people up to the front 

01:45:15.551 --> 01:45:23.337
like Abigail Adams or -- the 
wife of the Brooklyn 

01:45:23.338 --> 01:45:27.615
bridge -- and to point to all of
 us we can't forget 

01:45:27.616 --> 01:45:34.416
these people. John Adams, always
 up stage by the two 

01:45:34.417 --> 01:45:37.246
strong Virginiaians on either 
side but when you 

01:45:37.247 --> 01:45:40.962
think of what he did in his life
 and he was the only 

01:45:40.963 --> 01:45:46.563
founding father present who 
never owned a slave out 

01:45:46.564 --> 01:45:53.313
of principle, he would not own a
 slave nor would 

01:45:53.314 --> 01:45:56.461
Abigail allow him to own a slave
. And the first 

01:45:56.462 --> 01:46:02.182
President after John Adams was 
their son John Quincy 

01:46:02.183 --> 01:46:06.283
Adams. The oldest Constitution 
we have in our 

01:46:06.284 --> 01:46:10.175
country is not our National 
Constitution, it's the 

01:46:10.176 --> 01:46:12.543
Constitution of Massachusetts 
and he wrote it and in 

01:46:12.544 --> 01:46:14.062
that Constitution there's a 
clause about the 

01:46:14.063 --> 01:46:18.116
importance of education, the it 
applies as much 

01:46:18.117 --> 01:46:22.216
today as it did then and 
hopefully will always apply

01:46:22.217 --> 01:46:25.850
apply.
          I felt very strongly 

01:46:25.851 --> 01:46:31.048
that the Wright 
brothers, we would learn -- the 

01:46:31.049 --> 01:46:37.266
first airplane was 
felony by the Wright brothers 

01:46:37.267 --> 01:46:38.819
and it changed the 
world.

01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:43.065
          What about them? What 
were they like? How 

01:46:43.066 --> 01:46:47.220
did they go up? What did they 
believe? One thing 

01:46:47.221 --> 01:46:51.018
they believed was to have 
purpose in life.

01:46:51.019 --> 01:46:54.615
          Don't just go along 
thinking this all 

01:46:54.616 --> 01:47:00.049
about material acquisitions or 
getting a lot of 

01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:02.831
property or becoming famous or 
something, no, have 

01:47:02.832 --> 01:47:08.853
purpose. And mod he is city. 
Remember modest city? 

01:47:21.662 --> 01:47:25.011
The write 
brothers never bragged a word 

01:47:25.012 --> 01:47:28.313
about what they 
achieveed. They never said 

01:47:28.314 --> 01:47:32.028
anything derogatory about 
their rivals, never, because 

01:47:32.029 --> 01:47:34.113
that's the way they 
were raised.

01:47:34.114 --> 01:47:39.265
          And to be loyal, and 
to be honest, to hell 

01:47:39.266 --> 01:47:43.781
the truth, and it's a way many 
of us, most of us, 

01:47:43.782 --> 01:47:46.913
would you think were raised and 
we still believe 

01:47:46.914 --> 01:47:50.350
that. And we also still believe 
that our story as a 

01:47:50.351 --> 01:47:54.067
country is a story of progress.
          It doesn't always come

01:47:54.314 --> 01:47:58.481
 easyily, it doesn't 
always come instantly, it isn't 

01:47:58.482 --> 01:48:01.312
always apparent 
right away, but it is progress.

01:48:01.313 --> 01:48:06.029
          When I was working on 
my book about I 

01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:09.583
don't understandtown, I spent a 
lot of time in I 

01:48:09.584 --> 01:48:11.584
don't understandtown and I heard
 about the

01:48:14.183 --> 01:48:19.250
 engineer 
who brought the -- one of the 

01:48:19.251 --> 01:48:21.251
earlyiest

01:48:22.954 --> 01:48:27.315
 mills the 
country. And this fellow was 

01:48:27.316 --> 01:48:31.759
working on new machine 
and devices, his famous line 

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:36.415
after working on new 
pieces of machinery, he said 

01:48:36.416 --> 01:48:39.431
let's start it up and 
see why she doesn't work.

01:48:39.432 --> 01:48:41.983
          That's what we're 
about.

01:48:41.984 --> 01:48:46.118
          It's called the 
empirical method.  You do 

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:49.484
-- you try something and if 
doesn't work you study 

01:48:49.485 --> 01:48:53.664
why and then you fix it and then
 maybe it will work. 

01:48:53.665 --> 01:48:58.678
It's been true all along.
          And we are constantly 

01:48:58.679 --> 01:49:01.674
make progress which 
we don't recognize as progress 

01:49:01.675 --> 01:49:04.463
because we're in the 
thick of it, as everybody all 

01:49:04.464 --> 01:49:06.764
was.
          When you think for 

01:49:06.765 --> 01:49:11.155
example of what's 
happened in our country in our 

01:49:11.156 --> 01:49:15.845
lifetime in medicine, 
it's utterly phenomenal, I think

01:49:16.286 --> 01:49:18.511
 the future 
historians may very well looking

01:49:19.401 --> 01:49:23.347
 back at our time 
say to themselves that's what 

01:49:23.348 --> 01:49:26.662
the real history was 
then, that's the history being 

01:49:26.663 --> 01:49:29.631
made and it comes 
from ideas, it comes from 

01:49:29.632 --> 01:49:35.863
education, it comes from 
imagination and genius, yes. It 

01:49:35.864 --> 01:49:38.740
does happen because 
some people really have that 

01:49:38.741 --> 01:49:42.562
touch of genus, and 
they should be part of history.

01:49:42.563 --> 01:49:48.800
          Those doctors names 
don't figure at all we 

01:49:48.801 --> 01:49:52.262
should know who they are and 
what they did, just as 

01:49:52.263 --> 01:49:56.101
our painters and our writers.
          The arts aren't the 

01:49:56.102 --> 01:49:59.480
main dish of history, 
and shouldn't be treated as

01:50:02.906 --> 01:50:04.906
 --

01:50:08.475 --> 01:50:14.132
 it's part of the main 
dish, they are indeed what will 

01:50:14.133 --> 01:50:17.513
last longest. 
Kennedy said it, when it's all 

01:50:17.514 --> 01:50:21.397
said in done it may 
be what we did to contribute to 

01:50:21.398 --> 01:50:24.082
the human Spirit and 
very few of our presidents have 

01:50:24.083 --> 01:50:27.631
ever ever R ever 
known how to use the English 

01:50:27.632 --> 01:50:29.350
language as effectively 
as John Kennedy.

01:50:29.351 --> 01:50:34.169
          I thank my lucky stars
 that I quit my job 

01:50:34.170 --> 01:50:38.276
in New York and came to this 
city when I did. It not 

01:50:38.277 --> 01:50:42.275
only changed my out look, it 
changed my life but 

01:50:42.276 --> 01:50:47.300
it's given me ambitions to 
expand the experience of 

01:50:47.301 --> 01:50:50.415
being alive through the 
experience of history, the 

01:50:50.416 --> 01:50:55.647
experience of our story in a way
 that probably would 

01:50:55.648 --> 01:50:59.197
never H have happened if I not 
taken that step and 

01:50:59.198 --> 01:51:04.050
that adventure. And every time I
 come into this 

01:51:04.051 --> 01:51:06.481
library I thank goodness we live
 in a society, in a 

01:51:06.482 --> 01:51:08.482
country that puts

01:51:10.013 --> 01:51:11.313
 the library on our Acropolis 
right 

01:51:11.314 --> 01:51:15.128
here with our capital because 
that's the way it 

01:51:15.129 --> 01:51:18.815
should be, that's how we should 
feel about it, and I 

01:51:18.816 --> 01:51:23.267
know we all have favorite 
libraryies in our hometowns
