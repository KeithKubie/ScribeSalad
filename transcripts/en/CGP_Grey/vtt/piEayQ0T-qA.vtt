00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.550
# China, Hong Kong &amp; Macau, Oh My!

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.820
Welcome to Hong Kong: the island city of China
packed with seven million people at unbelievable

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.820
density.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.750
But if you, dear tourist, start from Victoria
Harbor and head toward the mainland you'll

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.890
find that while Hong Kong is China she doesn't
act like it.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.580
To cross the bridge your passport must be
checked and stamped and checked and stamped.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.749
Not because you're a suspicious foreigner:
Mainland Chinese can't just stroll across

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.029
either, but rather because Hong Kong has her
own immigration policy.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.119
And Hong Kong isn't the only isolated island,
there's nearby Macau with her own passport-checking

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.160
bridge and a ferry between them -- which also
checks passports.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.960
Travel from Hong Kong to Macau to the mainland
and back and you'll end up with three stamps,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.930
and that goes for everyone: Hong Kongese can't
just live in Macau and Macanese can't just

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.630
live in Hong Kong and they both can just live
on the mainland.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.170
Yet it's all China.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.829
And inconvenient travel isn't the only speciality
of these sister islands.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:45.829
They also have:

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.079
* Separate governments and political parties.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.079
* Separate police.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.079
* Separate money.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.079
* Postal systems.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.079
* Schools.
* and languages.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.640
Hong Kong even has her own Olympic team which
competed in the 2008 *Beijing* olympics which

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.600
doesn't make any kind of sense.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.079
The only things these sister islands don't
have that other countries do:

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.239
1) Their own armies.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.980
Though that isn't unique with modern countries,
and…

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.900
2) Formal diplomatic relations.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.340
Though even this unclear as both are members
of international trade organizations.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.290
And other countries have 'embassies' in Hong
Kong and Macau, sure China won't let them

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.970
be called embassies, those are only for **mighty
Beijing** -- they're called *consulates* even

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.340
if they're bigger than Beijing's embassy.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090
All this makes Hong Kong and Macau, as mentioned
in a previous video, the most country-like

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.000
countries that aren't countries.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.540
So why are they China?

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.560
China says so.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.280
It's called 'One China, Two Systems' -- though
fast-counters in the audience will see it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.560
should be called 'One China, *Three* Systems.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.890
Also there's China's special economic zones
(where capitalism runs free) making it more

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.660
like 'One China *Four* Systems' -- and if
China got her way it might be 'One China,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.660
*Five* Systems'.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.549
But we can't talk about everything so back
to China, Hong Kong, and Macau (oh my!)

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.670
China ended up having these two essentialy
city-states, as always, because Empire.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.140
Portugal showed up in Asia in the 1500s and
didn't exactly make friends.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.860
China and Portugal skirmished until Portugal
used Bigger-pile-of-money diplomacy to bribe

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.590
a local Chinese official into turning over
the islands of Macau as a trading port.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.520
Later, Britannia found China and discovered
she had many of lovely things like silks and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.950
porcelain and precious, precious tea that
Britannia craved.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.250
In return China wanted from Britannia… to
be left alone and Britannia nobly agreed to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.410
respect China's independence and soverenty.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.410
OOPS!

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.410
OPIUM WARS!

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.000
Nothing generates demand like addiction -- which
Britannia was happy to supply.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.430
And, her bigger-gun diplomacy secured Hong
Kong as a base through which the drugs must

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.430
flow.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.250
Later in a world where telegraphs and lightbulbs
were newfangled a lease gave control of Hong

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.060
Kong to Britannia for 99 years or quote "as
good as forever", kicking the transfer problem

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.569
down the generations to be delt with by the
unimaginably futuristic society of the 1990s.

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.810
Thus these sister cities grow up under the
influence of their Emperiffic parents.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.400
Hong Kong had English common law and lived
in Britannia's org chart as one of her many

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.100
crown colonies and Macau had Portuguese civil
law.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.380
And the parental effect is still seen today:
visit Hong Kong and she is clearly Britannia's

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.340
daughter what with her love of business and
international finance (and lasers!) and english-accented

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.430
language and near-identical transport system.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.740
Macau had a more troubled adolescence, as
her bigger sister stole the spotlight with

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.840
her trading skills.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.210
But Macau eventually grew up to be the gambling
capital of the world.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.080
She's Las Vegas x10 with a mixture of Portugal
and China.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.680
But Empires come and empires go, and the 90s
eventually arrived, meaning Britannia's lease

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.780
expired.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.819
Portugal claimed the treaty gave her control
of Macau *forever* but China disagreed and

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.590
the UN was in a no-empires-no-longer mood,
and frankly had Portugal complained too much,

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.069
China could have used her own bigger-army
diplomacy at this point to resolve the situation.

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.370
So the transfer was going to happen: but the
world was nervous about China, what with the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.740
*lingering communism* and all, so the deal
was the Empire's daughters would go *but*

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.430
they had to remain basically independent,
to which China agreed as long as everyone

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.180
else agreed to call them China.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.240
The situation was a bit like if the US had
to give Alaska back to Russia and Russia *super*

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.390
promised to leave Alaska self-governing.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.570
You couldn't blame the locals for being nervous.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.970
But, unlike what you'd expect in this case
China has mostly left the little sister islands

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.970
alone.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.980
So everything is dandy...

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.980
*however*...

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.010
The handover came with its own version of
the as-good-as-forever clause.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.510
China didn't agree to leave Hong Kong and
Macau alone *for all time*, only fifty years,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.560
again passing political problems to a future
generation.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.709
(Hopefully one that's actually unimaginably
futuristic this time).

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.829
Anyway, assuming such provincial concerns
as these are not rendered irrelevant by the

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.199
singularity, what happens in the 2040s?

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.059
Will Hong Kong and Macau remain tiny city-states
or will they lose their independence and be

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.059
absorbed?

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:31.300
Only China knows, and China does not say.
