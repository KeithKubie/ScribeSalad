00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:01.641
- [Voiceover] Let's give
ourselves some practice

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:03.766
adding mixed numbers.

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:07.550
So let's say I want to add
two, let me write it this way.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.206
Let's say I want to add
two and four sevenths

00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:17.206
plus three and two sevenths,
three and two sevenths.

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:20.959
I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:24.297
and try to think about
what this is going to be.

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:26.844
Well there's a couple of ways
that you could tackle it.

00:00:26.844 --> 00:00:28.791
One way, you could say, well let me just

00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:30.614
add the nonfraction parts.

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:35.614
You could say that two plus
three is equal to five,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.930
and then you could say that
four sevenths plus two sevenths

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.753
is equal to well four
sevenths plus two sevenths

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.133
is gonna be equal to six sevenths.

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.374
Hey, wait, wait, wait, how
did I, how did I do that?

00:00:49.374 --> 00:00:51.254
How did I just only add the fraction parts

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:52.613
or add the whole parts?

00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:54.029
Well the way I did that is because

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:55.968
two and four sevenths is the same thing

00:00:55.968 --> 00:00:59.694
as two plus four sevenths.

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:03.188
Two and four sevenths, same
thing as two plus four sevenths.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:06.694
And then plus three and two
sevenths is the same thing

00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:09.910
as three plus two sevenths,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.232
so all I did over here,
two and four sevenths

00:01:12.232 --> 00:01:13.474
plus three and two sevenths,

00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:16.771
is two plus four sevenths
plus three plus two sevenths.

00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:20.730
And you can swap the
order in how this happens.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.713
So you could take, you
could just switch the order

00:01:23.713 --> 00:01:28.693
and say this is going to be
two plus three, two plus three,

00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:33.693
plus four sevenths, plus two sevenths.

00:01:37.644 --> 00:01:40.964
And what we just figured out was that

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:44.586
two plus three is equal
to five, right over here,

00:01:44.586 --> 00:01:46.409
and that four sevenths plus two sevenths

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.409
is equal to six sevenths, just like that.

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.266
Now let's do a more interesting example.

00:01:55.266 --> 00:02:00.266
Let's do, let's say that I
have three and three fifths,

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:09.623
three and three fifths
plus five and four fifths.

00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:17.683
Now what is this going to be equal to?

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:19.668
Well if you do the same technique,

00:02:19.668 --> 00:02:24.126
if you add the three plus the five,

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:26.007
you're going to get eight,

00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:31.007
and then if you add the three
fifths plus four fifths,

00:02:31.022 --> 00:02:33.147
you would get seven fifths.

00:02:33.147 --> 00:02:35.666
So you get eight and seven fifths.

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:37.883
And this wouldn't be wrong.

00:02:37.883 --> 00:02:39.427
This is eight and seven fifths,

00:02:39.427 --> 00:02:40.983
if you add these two things together,

00:02:40.983 --> 00:02:42.805
but it's a little bit strange here

00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:45.580
because seven fifths
is bigger than a whole.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.797
So to get a better sense of what number's

00:02:47.797 --> 00:02:49.306
really being represented here,

00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:50.641
I want to rewrite this.

00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:52.162
So eight and seven fifths,

00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:55.807
this is the same thing as eight plus,

00:02:55.807 --> 00:02:57.560
and instead of seven fifths,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.045
we could say this is the
same thing as five fifths,

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:02.877
which is a whole, plus two fifths.

00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:06.708
Now why is that interesting?

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:08.589
Because five fifths, notice
five fifths plus two fifths,

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:10.330
that's seven fifths right over there.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.756
Or you can consider five fifths to be one,

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:15.508
so this is eight plus one, which is nine,

00:03:15.508 --> 00:03:19.995
and two fifths, nine and two fifths.

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:22.055
So all I did here, I added it the same way

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:25.004
that I did the first
problem a few seconds ago.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:28.626
But when I realize this fraction
part is greater than one,

00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:31.273
I separated it into
one and then a fraction

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:32.527
that is less than one,

00:03:32.527 --> 00:03:34.547
and that whole, I was able to add

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.009
to the eight to get to nine,

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.087
and then I would have
two fifths left over.

00:03:38.087 --> 00:03:40.804
Eight and seven fifths,
because five fifths is a whole,

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:43.474
is the same thing as nine and two fifths.

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:46.933
So if I wanted to write this
in, I guess, a clearer way,

00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:48.442
I would say this is nine and two fifths.

00:03:48.442 --> 00:03:50.242
Three and three fifths
plus five and four fifths

00:03:50.242 --> 00:03:51.751
is nine and two fifths,

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:53.504
and once again, we say wait,
three plus five is only eight,

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:54.630
how did I get a nine?

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.929
Well that's because three
fifths plus four fifths

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:59.361
is greater than one.
