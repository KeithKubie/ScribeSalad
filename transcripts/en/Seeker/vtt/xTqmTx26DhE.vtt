00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.920
There's been a lot of outcry as the FDA just
approved a genetically modified animal for

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.411
human consumption for the first time. Sure,
tweak 80 percent of U.S. food, but keep your

00:00:09.411 --> 00:00:15.940
test tubes off our salmon!

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.910
organisms
GMOs incite heat on both sides. Many believe

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.570
genetically modified organisms are more efficient
than cross-breeding plants for many generations

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.000
and crossing fingers; while detractors believe
we shouldn't genetically modify the food we

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.690
eat and should keep it "natural." I use finger
quotes not to make fun, but because what "natural"

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.989
means in this context is confusing for many,
if not most people, even the FDA get's confused

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:43.989
about it!

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.780
Now, joining the list of tomatoes, potatoes,
soy/tofu, rice, cotton, corn (so much corn),

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.719
canola oil, squash, alfalfa, and mosquitoes,
is GM salmon. According to AquAdvantage, the

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.629
company that modified the fish, the salmon
contains genes from "Chinook salmon and an

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.729
eel-like species," which means it will grow
all year, and at a faster rate than natural

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.500
salmon. It will, of course, need to eat more
food to grow at such a rate, but will only

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.070
live in fish farms so won't be competing with
natural varieties. According to the FDA, "there

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.509
are no biologically relevant differences in
the nutritional profile of AquAdvantage Salmon

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.460
compared to that of other farm-raised Atlantic
salmon." And now that they've been approved

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.630
for human consumption, they'll swim their
way onto some store shelves and on top of

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.659
our bagels. This has, unsurprisingly, caused
a huge outcry from anti-GMO activists. Some

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.790
stores are even refusing to sell the genetically
modified fishes.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.380
According to pretty much every scientific
group or organization on the planet, GM organisms

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.829
are completely 100 percent safe for humans.
There are more than 600 studies on it, all

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.790
saying GMOs are safe. And yet, people are
still nervous, and I get why, you're messing

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.210
with my food man!

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.140
Most GM grains sold in the US are used for
animal feed, though according to Consumer

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.119
Reports, pretty much every human food sample
they tested contained GMOs, except those which

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.680
explicitly said otherwise; that included cereals,
baby formula, veggie burgers, and popular

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.770
chip brands. GMOs were found in products labeled
"organic" and "natural" because those labels

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.770
don't mean anything and aren't regulated.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.379
According to the FDA this salmon, dubbed a
"frankenfish" by the activist groups, is safe

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.120
to eat, and will allegedly pose no threat
to the environment. The FDA approval requires

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.440
the salmon to live only in fish farms, but
even if one did escape, 95 percent of the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.150
fish are sterile. Cross your fingers any escapee
isn't one of the five percent. Some GM grains

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.760
like canola have been created which don't
reproduce at all; like Jurassic Park's "Lysine

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.160
Contingency" the GMOs can't live in the wild
without the "special sauce" the lab uses to

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160
grow them. But c'mon you guys, shouldn't that
have been step 1?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.879
Not an afterthought. We already have GM plants
growing in nature all over the U.S., and no

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.670
one knows what's going to happen there.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.250
This isn't the only GMO animal in the research
and approval pipeline. A line of goats was

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.769
created whose milk can prevent deadly diarrhea
in children, the company is marketing it to

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.420
the government of Brazil, where children still
die from diarrhea. A species of chicken was

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.069
modified which suppresses the replication
of bird flu virus, and pigs are also being

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.120
bred that are resistant to swine flu!

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.950
All this sounds pretty good, but, it seems
to me, people get increasingly uncomfortable

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.319
as the animals come closer to their tables...
In a partnership between Harvard Medical,

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.180
University of Missouri and the University
of Pittsburgh a GM pig was created which produces

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.819
higher omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s are essential
for health, but are not synthesized by mammals.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.330
Instead, they're found in microorganisms,
algae, plankton and worms; fish get their

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.760
omega-3s from algae too!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.790
By modifying a worm enzyme for a pig species,
this pig is now a source of omega-3s!

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.670
There are plans to modify cattle to stop them
growing sharp horns which can be dangerous

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.390
for farmhands and other cows, and mix various
traits from different cow species to produce

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.819
more milk, more beef or whatever is required.
GM meat is here. It's right. Here.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.060
Supporters and company representatives say
as the population continues to increase exponentially,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.010
humanity needs food sources that have a lesser
impacts on the environment. Transgenic animals

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.670
-- those with genes from other species -- had
yet to be rated as "safe for human consumption"

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.500
until now. But, according to allllllll the
science that's fit to print, GMOs are safe,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.240
and this fish is heading out, but how do you
feel about them?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.240
Are you concerned about GMOs?

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.240
Would you buy a GMO salmon?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.300
GMOs are everywhere now, but people still
have a misunderstanding of what they are.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:45.100
