&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And, welcome.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.740
I'm Aditia and I'm here on behalf of the Personal
Growth Washington Group.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.070
And also in partnership with Optimize Your
Life.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.070
That's OYL.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.629
You can find them at go/oyl.

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.130
And we're proud to bring to you today Dr.
Temple Grandin.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.789
Who I believe most of you probably are already
familiar with.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.630
So she's Professor of Animal Studies at Colorado
State University.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.250
And a world renowned expert in animal welfare.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.920
Particularly in the agriculture industry.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.280
And on autism advocacy.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040
So we're really happy to have her today.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.710
And thanks for joining us.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.540
And with that I'll present Dr. Grandin.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.600
[applause]

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.640
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well, it's really good to
be here today.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.770
And let's just start talking a little bit
about what autism is.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.690
Autism is a developmental disorder.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.051
And it varies from very severe when there's
no speech to very, very mild, where it just

00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:08.990
merges into a personality variant.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.860
And when you get into the very mild you will
have Steve Jobs, and you will have Einstein.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.490
He had no speech 'til he was three.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.050
Nikola Tesla who invented the electric power
plant.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.990
So at one end of the spectrum it's probably
just a personality variant.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.940
Other end of the spectrum, a very, very severe
handicap.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.210
And if you were to get rid of all of the genetics
that makes autism, well, probably anywhere

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.140
from 25 to 50 percent of the people that work
here.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.180
You're not gonna get any new employees.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.440
It's gonna be just that simple.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.510
And there's many other people in Silicon Valley
that I know are on the spectrum.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.890
Big names but I won't mention them by name
'cause they're still living.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.400
And all of the information I've gotten on
Steve Jobs has come from publicly available

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.580
sources like the book, Business Week Magazine,
and other sources.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.620
He was a kid that had a lot of problems in
school.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.620
He was teased.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.830
And he had to switch to another school.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.560
He was very lucky to go into the Cupertino
Valley High School, where there was lots of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.610
other tech people.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.779
And people doing interesting things in their
garage.

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.650
And he got into a computer club.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.310
You know, we're gonna look at how do we get
some of these kids that are kinda floundering

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.379
around, into really good things?

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.620
Well, it's through shared interests.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.090
The way Steve Jobs got into the industry was
getting into a computer club.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.560
Other people with similar, like interests.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.900
And the genetics of autism is real complicated.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.439
It's a whole lot of little tiny small gene
variations.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:44.630
And as you have, people get married and have
kids and the more it concentrates, the more

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.010
likely you are to get autism.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.469
In its mild form, it can give you an advantage.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.609
In it's very severe form, a lot of problems.

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.590
And one of the big problems that educators
have is a lot of special educators, they're

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.790
well trained to work with the more severe
kids.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.200
But they don't know what to do with the smart
math geek kids.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.299
Lucky ones, they'll get off into advanced
placement.

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.010
The unlucky ones, they'll make 'em drill 'em
over and over and over again, over and over

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.200
again on the same stuff.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.109
And they're going to get really bored and
they're gonna hate school.

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.719
And that's not gonna be a good thing.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:22.040
Around here, I know that a lot of the companies
around here reach out to the high schools.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.529
But then I go out to the Midwest and I see
smart kids that ought to be working here.

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:26.930
And they're going absolutely no where.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.560
They're getting addicted to video games.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.209
And they're ending up on Social Security in
the basement playing video games.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.980
And if they were getting programming jobs.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.629
Designing video games that'd be one thing.

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.699
But that's where a lot of them are just simply
aren't going there.

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.219
Now I want you to think about different ways
of thinking.

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:48.870
You know, most of, a lot of people here, you're
mathematical thinkers.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.389
And I am an extreme visual thinker.

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.810
And I wanna talk about how different kinds
of minds can work together on projects.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.959
'Cause there are different ways of thinking.

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.449
I've done a lot of work with animals.

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.689
And being an extreme visual thinker helped
me.

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.379
Because to understand animal, you gotta totally
get away from verbal language.

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.359
It's a world of pictures.

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.669
A world of sound.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.949
A world of little detailed sensory sensations.

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.479
It's not abstract.

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.240
Now when Van Gogh painted "Starry Night",
I don't think he realized that he was painting

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.600
mathematics into "Starry Night."

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.630
You see, underneath language, there's all
the fun stuff.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.500
Mathematics, art, things like that.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.150
And some statisticians got a hold of this
and found mathematics in it.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.370
There's also a type of Alzheimer's where as
the person's frontal cortex and language parts

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.610
of the brain get wrecked, visual thinking
comes out.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.860
And this painting was done by somebody with
Alzheimer's.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.360
And then eventually the whole brain is trashed.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.800
And then you've got thinking in details.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.090
You see, the kind of thinking that I have
is bottom up.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:07.410
I form concepts by putting specific pictures
into file folders in my brain.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.240
Everything is learned by specific example.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.270
Rather than having a big overriding theory.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.189
So this is kind of a classic gestalt test.

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:20.050
And the person on the spectrum, they can identify
the little letters a lot faster than the big

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.050
letters.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.770
Now there's some fascinating research that
shows that the normal brain drops out details.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.710
Well, you know in programming, details are
really important.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.710
Things are not gonna work.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.229
So if you take somebody on the autism spectrum
and you put them in a scanner.

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.080
And you have them read out of a book, the
scanner gets all turned on in the part of

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.340
the brain where the words are processed.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.500
Take the Asperger, which is this milder autism.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.080
And put 'em in there.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.860
You get the syntax, the whole, and the detail
of the words.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.280
But then you take the normal person.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.669
Guess what happens.

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.229
You lose all the detail of the words.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.949
Now one of the big problems we have today
in trying to work on policy and a lot of things,

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:06.159
is you've got policy makers now that have
totally gotten separated from the ground.

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.919
From the real things out there on the ground.

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.599
Out there in a physical world.

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.569
The physical world is where I work.

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:16.639
I don't understand what you do in programming.

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.080
But I understand things like, you've got a
big valve and there's a solenoid to turn that

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.080
valve.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.439
Is that valve gonna work or is it stuck because
it's been sitting there for five years and

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:28.479
has never been turned?

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.420
That's the kinda stuff I understand.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:37.350
And I was asked in previous section if there's
any things that I'm concerned about.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.889
Where we could have major screw ups.

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.129
Lemme tell you right now.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.189
The power grid security.

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:43.189
That's one of 'em.

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:47.449
And the other big one is somebody wants to
make an all electronic car with electronic

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.449
brakes.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.900
I'm not very big on that.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.479
I think there's certain things that I want
made the old fashioned way.

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.419
Brakes that work no matter what.

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:03.569
Steering where I can still steer and I can
turn the whole thing off if I absolutely have

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:04.569
to.

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.909
I'm sure everybody heard about how they, the
Israeli intelligence agency hacked into the

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:12.950
Iran nuclear centrifuges and made 'em run
really fast so they destroyed themselves.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.130
And that was run off a standard industrial
controller.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.060
Well, how can I avoid to have that not happen
to a power plant?

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.220
And spin a power plant too fast and break
it?

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.509
Well, how about an old fashioned '50s style
control.

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.819
Goes too fast, it shuts down.

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:30.569
It gets too hot, it shuts down.

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:35.080
In other words, some controls where a computer
has absolutely nothing to do with it.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.610
To make sure that something bad doesn't happen.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.110
And the thing is, I don't understand that
computer stuff.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.669
But I understand a lot of the old physical
stuff.

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:48.999
And we're gonna get into some other examples
of that.

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:52.789
Now right here, when I first started my work
with cattle, I noticed that sometimes the

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:55.009
cattle would go up the chute.

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:56.379
And sometimes they wouldn't.

00:07:56.379 --> 00:07:58.919
Well, why wouldn't they go into this veterinary
facility?

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:02.120
Because the flag was there waving.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.010
Sometimes the most obvious is the least obvious.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:11.340
They wanna rip up the whole facility rather
than simply move the flag.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.770
It's so obvious.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.770
Alright.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.509
Let's think about some more things.

00:08:15.509 --> 00:08:17.819
The Japanese nuclear power plant accident.

00:08:17.819 --> 00:08:21.340
I read everything I could find about that.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.689
And I'm going "How could they have done this?"

00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:27.219
How could they have let four reactors burn
up?

00:08:27.219 --> 00:08:29.349
Because they live by the sea.

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:34.010
And they put the emergency generators that
run the really important cooling pump that

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.350
keeps the plant from blowing up, in the basement.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:42.140
So when the seawall was breached, the basement
filled up full of water.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.200
Guess what happens.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.590
Electric power boards, diesels.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.190
They do not work under water.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.710
And that's why four nuclear power plants melted
down.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:59.230
Well, I'm now beginning to find out that the
problem is, they really didn't see it.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.630
I can't design a nuclear power plant.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.500
But I can visualize all kinds of physical
things that could go wrong.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.400
Like generators getting flooded.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.530
I wouldn't make that mistake.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.560
Let's look at another mistake, that the visual
thinker can discover.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.950
Airbags killin' babies and children.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:16.950
OK.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.400
So you follow the spec.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.510
It's gotta hold an adult man with no seatbelt.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.060
Well, then it kills babies.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.550
And I wouldn't have made that mistake either.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.430
But I'm really beginning to think that there's
different kinds of minds.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.370
And the problem is, they just didn't see it.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.180
OK, and my cattle work.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.120
Look at how that animal like walked right
onto that sunbeam.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.660
It seems so obvious when you look at that
picture.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.390
But it wasn't obvious.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.540
And when I first started working on this,
I talked about these things.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.310
And this was back in the early '70s. people
thought I was crazy.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.530
To even think about what a cattle was looking
at.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.340
So I'd get down the chutes and I'd see, what
are the animals seeing?

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.590
Down in the chutes?

00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.870
Look at the shadows.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.090
I always get asked, do the cattle know they're
gonna get slaughtered?

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:07.870
That's a question I had to answer very early
in my career.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.650
And not gonna show any slaughter pictures.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:10.740
Don't worry.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:17.300
I, and, I found they behaved the same way
at the Swift Plant as they behaved at a veterinary

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.910
chute out on a ranch or a feed yard.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:19.910
No.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.660
They are afraid of things like, it's too dark.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.430
There's a reflection on a piece of metal.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.430
There's a puddle.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.640
They can see people walkin' by.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.540
And if you get rid of these distractions,
then they walk right up the chute.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.540
No.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.950
They were afraid of visual things that they
saw.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:41.570
Well, let's look at things like which way
is the animal pointing its ears?

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.820
That seems pretty obvious.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:50.340
But sometimes things that are obvious aren't
all that obvious.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.340
OK.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.230
What exactly is photo realistic visual thinking?

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.040
It's pictures in your head like movies.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.290
Just a picture a young autistic man sent to
me to show how he has movies in his head.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.300
And those are 16 millimeter movie reels.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.890
Those are really, really dated.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.920
And one thing I liked in the HBO movie is
they showed all my projects accurately.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.290
I actually did build that optical illusion
room.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.700
Well, I wouldn't have gotten interested in
things like that if I hadn't had a science

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.990
teacher expose me to those things.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.240
Now let's think about different kinds of thinking.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.490
And when I wrote my book my early book, "Thinking
In Pictures", I realized my thinking was different

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.170
when I asked people about church steeples.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.650
Think about a church steeple.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.040
How does it come into your mind?

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.600
I was shocked to find out that most people
get this vague generalized one.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.570
I always see specific ones.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:45.120
My concept of what a church steeple is, is
a whole bunch of different pictures of specific

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.120
ones.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.810
How did I figure out that a dog was not a
cat.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.760
Well, kind of I just sorted them by size.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.050
But then when our next door neighbors got
a dachshund, I had to figure, why wasn't a

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.370
dachshund a cat?

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.250
Well, I looked at her nose.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:05.700
And the nose was the visual feature that every
dog had that was different from the cats.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.560
No cat had a dog's nose.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.800
So then I can even put the little dachshund
in the dog file folder.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.740
Well, it kinda just flashed up in my mind
that churches do.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.740
Sort of like Google for images.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.840
And they just come up in my mind.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.910
These still pictures.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.190
You see, nothing is abstract for me.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.120
Everything is specific.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.950
Would you like a snowstorm?

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.410
Would you like a rainstorm?

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:32.410
Would you like a wedding procession?

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:33.410
I can give you that.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:38.450
I can pull it up out of memory and put that
in the picture.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.450
Now being this kind of visual thinker helped
me in my livestock stuff, 'cause I could actually

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.290
test run equipment.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.270
And now I'm thinking about right now, I'm
seeing, I'm kind of imagining this picture.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.460
This poor Japanese guy.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.690
He's up on some catwalk and he's looking down
at the drowned generators and he's going,

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.610
I don't know what the F--- word is in Japanese.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.170
But he's going "We're in so much trouble right
now.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.890
It's not funny."

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.450
Now you might wonder why is this curved?

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.160
Cattle have a knack for behavior to go back
to where they come from, that's why it's curved.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.820
Half the cattle in this country are handled
in the equipment I designed.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.720
I think that's doing pretty good for somebody
they thought was mentally retarded.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:23.270
Because when I got into my 20s, I had gigantic
motivation to prove to people I wasn't stupid.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.990
Now let's say you take some of these kids,
kinda geeky.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.730
You know they're on the mild end of the autism
spectrum.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.180
And they've gotten labeled with autism.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.110
Often times parents and teachers don't make
'em do enough stuff.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.350
I'm seeing kids that are smart graduate from
college and they don't know how to order food

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.720
at a restaurant.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720
They don't know how to shop.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.310
They don't know how to do laundry.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.410
They don't know how to shake hands.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.220
They don't know how to say please and thank
you.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.770
They've got to be taught these basic skills.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.160
Because you don't pick up the social things
naturally.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.980
You gotta be taught.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.960
Now in the '50s, all kids were taught.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.080
Really rigidly taught social rules.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.860
So there's a lot of older people with Asperger's
coming out of the woodwork now.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:08.040
Because their son or their granddaughter or
their grandson was diagnosed with Asperger's.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.200
And now granddad or dad realizes he has it.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:17.430
I had a NASA space scientist come up to me,
it was about six weeks ago, and he had a grandson

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.970
that was diagnosed with autism.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.580
And he said "You know what?

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.140
I've got it, too.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.750
And half the people in NASA have it."

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:29.160
So I'm getting concerned that some of our
smartest people aren't going down the right

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160
track.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.700
Because it takes a totally different kind
of education to train the smart person on

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.810
the spectrum compared to somebody that's got
very severe handicaps.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.500
And they're not gonna be working at Google.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.940
You see it's a very very big spectrum.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.540
It's a continuous trait.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.930
There's the dip vat they designed, they did
for the movie.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.960
Which I originally designed for John Wayne's
feed yard.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.380
The John Wayne, the cowboy.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.240
And there's one of my drawings.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:02.070
Now when you're a weird nerd, the only way
I could sell myself was showing off my work.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.550
And I remember going to an ag engineering
meeting.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:09.130
And nobody wanted to talk to me 'cause I was
just like a crazy geeky weird lady.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.680
And I pulled out one of these drawings and
they were like "Oh, you did that?

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.680
Oh, you did that?"

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.030
You know, then I started to get some respect.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.810
And that's how I sold projects.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.490
By showing my work.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.720
And this is another one of my drawings.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.040
They actually put these drawings in the movie
and that really turned me on.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.850
Now I teach a class where I have students
actually lay out cattle facilities.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.200
Where they have to do an exercise in visual
thinking.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.940
And one of the things you gotta learn is how
to relate the line on a drawing to the actual

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.550
thing.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.010
The line on a drawing and then you've got
the thing.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.160
And that's something that took me a while
to learn that.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.660
[inaudible] a great big drawing of a whole
entire Swift Plant.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.781
And I walked around that plant for two days
until every line on that drawing, I could

00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:00.780
relate to a real thing.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.780
Like this little tiny square.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.340
It's a concrete column.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.820
This big round thing, that's the water tower.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.870
This big oval thing is a big vat they salt
cure the hides in.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:16.260
You know where everything, I could, 'cause
a drawing was kind of abstract.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.540
And I had to relate that to things that are
real.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.640
So I do the same thing with my students.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.110
But then I've noticed that a really weird
thing happens.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.970
I watched the industry.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.400
And I've done work for every major meat company.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.270
My equipment's in every one of the major meat
companies.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.720
And watching the industry going from hand
drawing, going into the mid '90s.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.360
Switching over to computers.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.250
And some weird things started to happen.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.500
I started getting extremely weird mistakes
on drawings.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.780
They did not know where the center of a circle
was.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.590
They would have 25 foot long gates.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.490
I mean there's no way that's gonna work.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.180
The gates would swing wrong.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.610
'Cause they never actually used the compass.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.610
So I started tracking down these drawings.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:06.680
And in every single case, they came from a
young kid.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.480
Never built anything with his hands.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.829
Never had done any drawing by hand.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.950
I had these drawings from every single major
meat company.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:21.819
Every single time, they came out of some young
kid and the problem is, to see things right,

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:23.150
you gotta touch.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:27.230
There's a very interesting chapter that Oliver
Sachs wrote.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.170
About a man who got cataracts taken off as
an adult.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.110
And he looked at his dog and he didn't know
what it was until he felt it.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.300
He had to feel it in order to understand the
image.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.210
Now I've talked to a number of the animation
companies.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.830
I've been out, I went out to Pixar.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.750
I went out to Disney Imaginary.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.060
Very very interesting places.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.680
Boy let me tell you.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.700
Fun office at Pixar.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:52.240
I mean, they'll buy 'em tool sheds at Home
Depot and making them into offices.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.380
Really cool stuff there.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:59.030
But the other thing that was interesting is
this whole business that you have to touch

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.040
in order to draw.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.950
Like Buzz Lightyear starts out as pencil sketches
on the wall.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.330
And then they also have a 3D printer.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.990
So they can draw a 3D drawing and they can
print out a little statue of the character.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.559
And I noticed something really interesting
about those little statues.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:16.470
Where do you think they had the statues located?

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.150
They were right there next to their computers.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.720
So they could hold them and touch them.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.480
Get that touch feedback.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.460
So they wouldn't start making weird mistakes
on drawings.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.720
What does a baby do?

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.850
It touches everything.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.830
That's how it learns how to see.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.220
You know now in the future, we can get things
to where you get the real touch feedback then

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.490
maybe you don't have to be dealing with the
real things.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.520
But I get concerned here.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.970
As I walk through here.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:44.990
Everything is getting far away from the real
things.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.990
OK.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.630
We're gonna connect a computer up to a power
plant.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:53.350
Give me an old '50s style governor hooked
up to the main disconnect switch.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.460
Because that baby spins too fast, I want it
shut down.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.260
And I want it with something where there's
no way to hack it.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.023
'Cause it ain't gonna have a computer in it.

00:19:02.023 --> 00:19:03.023
Just gonna be that simple.

00:19:03.023 --> 00:19:06.130
I think there's some very important life-critical
things.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.220
And very expensive things that would break.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.160
Things that maybe that a computer should have
nothing to do with it.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.990
Now, it has to do with a lot of other things,
but not that stuff.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.050
OK.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.500
When I was a little kid, I was good at drawing.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.520
This is a drawing that a nine year old did
in perspective.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.560
A big fan of building up the kid's area of
strength.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:33.710
Because on the autism spectrum, also with
ADHD and dyslexia, you get a lot of crossover

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:34.890
between these different labels.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:40.750
Don't get hung up on your labels as to whether
your kid's PDD, autism, maybe social communication

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.750
disorder.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.600
That's a new thing they're gonna put in the
DMS5.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.600
Build up strengths.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.870
You've got uneven skills.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.150
Build up the area of strength.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.860
Can't emphasize that enough.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.280
Also diagnosis is not precise.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.910
It's a behavioral profile.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:01.180
It's not precise like a diagnosis of tuberculosis
is precise.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:07.430
You got doctors sitting around in conference
rooms, fighting each other on what the DMS5,

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.980
the next diagnostic guideline, should have.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.230
Nobody sits around a conference room and tries
to remake the diagnosis for meningitis or

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.060
some disease like that.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.060
It's precise.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:23.520
Now I used to joke around that I had a huge
internet trunk line that went deep into my

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.790
visual cortex.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.950
Yes I do.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.260
Big huge graphics card there.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.370
Well, when I got these scans, it was like
wow.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:36.870
This would explain object realistic visual
thinking that I had.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:41.270
Because to think about anything, I gotta have
a real picture in my mind.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:47.340
Now if somebody says to me, "OK, well think
about yummy food I just ate over there in

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.440
the cafeteria."

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.620
I see it.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:55.170
And it's going "Oh, wow, gourmet this and
that, this is really good."

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.990
Now another kind of mind is your minds.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.560
The mathematics mind.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.510
The pattern thinking mind.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.030
The engineering mind.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:08.360
That does very well on things like traditional
visual spatial type tasks.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.900
Where you have to rotate patterns in space.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.680
I'm not good at that.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.890
That praying mantis is made out of a single
sheet of folded paper.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.350
No taping, no cutting.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.800
What you see in the background is the folding
pattern.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.840
That's certainly not my mind.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.930
That's for sure.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.220
Now this is an important slide.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.850
These are the kind of different kinds of minds.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:35.550
Now, you know, so called normal people tend
to be more even in the skills.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:40.150
But you get people labeled with various labels,
you tend to have uneven skills.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.250
And you can have extreme photo realistic visual
thinker like me.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.710
Can't do algebra.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.660
Can't do foreign language.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.660
Just impossible.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.360
Then you get the pattern thinker.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.210
This is the music and math mind.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.860
That engineering mind.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.230
Often times loves foreign languages.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.559
Because they can pick up the patterns in the
languages.

00:21:58.559 --> 00:21:59.720
I can't do that.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.970
And a common thing you can have happen, is
you can have a little fourth grader that's

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.390
brilliant in math.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.590
And may need to be advanced ahead in math.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:12.240
But he's going to need special ed in reading
and writing composition.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.860
You don't wanna make that kid just do baby
math.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.820
You know, then you need to have some students
from the seventh grade come down and teach

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.320
the kid how to do the more advanced kinds
of math.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.660
Then you have verbal thinkers.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.320
I think our society right now is getting taken
over with too much verbal thinking.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.780
One of the big problems I think we have now
with a lot of policy makers is everything's

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.550
getting abstract.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.190
You've got students graduating in political
science.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.090
They go to Washington DC.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.820
They've never worked with anything practical
on the ground.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.680
Well, they don't think about "Well, if I do
this policy how is it gonna affect something

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.920
on the ground, out there in the real world?"

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.490
Well, just to show there are different ways
to do mathematics.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.230
And there are some people who would say that
algebra is a prerequisite for geometry.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.330
And I think that's just rubbish.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.320
Because geometry was invented first.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.760
So how could it be the prerequisite for Algebra?

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.640
And education has an awful lot of big top
down thinking.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.300
You know they get on these fads.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.100
Well, actually what works the best is having
a variety of schools.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.309
So that different thinkers can get into educational
programs that are gonna work for them.

00:23:20.309 --> 00:23:24.260
We need to be having a lot more emphasis on
what's a kid gonna do when he grows up?

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.230
You know, there's a shortage of things like
diesel mechanics.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.230
Machinists.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.940
Some of the very high skilled physical trades.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.130
There's a real shortage.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.390
We need these people.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.560
Well, you certainly need 'em to make the power
supplies for your Data Center.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.750
There's some heavy duty hardware there.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.050
You're not gonna sit and make it on a computer,
that's for sure.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:50.610
This picture shows how this, how the autistic
mind is sorting pictures into categories.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:56.380
You see to understand a concept, I have to
put specific examples into boxes in my mind.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.560
A dog will do that, for example.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.740
When I'm on the leash, I protect my owner.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.660
When I'm off the leash, I can go play.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.040
You see, that's a different picture.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.840
If you think about it that way.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.840
It's different.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.010
A horse will do that.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.490
Man on the horse, man on the ground.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.010
A horse views that as two totally different
things.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.050
If he was treated badly by a rider.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:20.430
He may have bucked you off when you tried
to ride him.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.550
But he'll be really good about doing shoeing
and veterinary work.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:27.190
Because somebody on the ground never did anything
bad to him.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.550
Now I find that when people are doing troubleshooting.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:33.260
When they're trying to figure out what's wrong
with a piece of equipment.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:39.800
People have a hard time differentiating between,
is it a people training issue or is it a equipment

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.850
design problem.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:46.040
And is it a big equipment design problem,
or is it just a glitch.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.980
You know like stuck trolleys in a meat packing
plant.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.810
That'd be just a glitch.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.450
You know, just to sort of categorize these
things out.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.050
I find a lot of people have a hard time doing
this.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.429
It's very very easy for me.

00:24:56.429 --> 00:24:57.429
Alright.

00:24:57.429 --> 00:24:59.170
Let's look at something like British Petroleum.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.250
Well, they had lots of safety rules.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.000
You go visit one of their rigs.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.820
You better have a lid on your coffee cup.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.850
You don't have a lid on your coffee cup and
you spill coffee, you might fall on the stairs

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.250
and you might hurt yourself.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:14.090
But they forgot about the stuff that's really
important.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.640
How about Process Safety?

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.830
They were doin' all kinds of bad stuff.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:19.830
Rushing.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.150
Cuttin' corners.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.770
Not doin' things right.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:24.770
Yeah.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.720
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.320
They forgot about the real important stuff.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.970
Now the thing is, both animals and people
with autism are bottom up thinkers.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.720
All the different kind of autistic minds tend
to be a bottom up thinker.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.330
Now the thing about bottom up thinking is
to be really good, you got to fill up the

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.750
database with lots of information.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.760
Like I read and I read and I read and I read.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.320
So when I go out and I do troubleshooting,
I go "Oh, well this problem at this plant,

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.700
that was sort of like the Jones plant over
there.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.990
And we did such and such.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.210
We added a light to the entrance of the restrainer
and they'd walk right in."

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.300
So you gotta fill up the database.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.541
I say to parents, get these kids out and show
them all kinds of stuff because they got a

00:26:07.541 --> 00:26:09.400
really good Google installed in their head.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.460
But you gotta fill 'em up with web pages.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.680
You gotta put web pages in them.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.930
Bottom up thinking forms concepts by categorizing
specific examples.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.850
A very important concept, educatin' these
kids.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.300
Top down thinkers get the concept first.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:31.070
But soon they're getting so far away from
the real world that the practical things that

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.510
they've, they just don't sorta get it.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:39.590
Bottom up thinking makes it easier to put
information into different categories.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:43.590
Actually there's neuroscience research that
shows that the brain makes categories.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:48.270
But these mechanisms often times they kinda
cover it up with a more top down thinking.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:53.110
We need to be working on how the different
minds can work together.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:58.510
You know, a lot of the things we need, so
many safety things, is a visual thinker to

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.580
design the safety system at the nuclear power
plant.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.110
How could you put those generators in the
basement?

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.540
Yeah, you had a backup and a backup.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.630
But they were all in the basement.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.830
So they all drowned.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.540
There was no backup to the sea wall.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:16.670
And the thing that's really bad is up on the
hill next to the plant there was a granite

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.230
slab put in the ground.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.570
And it was put there a hundred years ago and
it said "Don't Forget.

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:25.820
Tsunamis come up to here."

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.980
And the people in the town knew about that.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.940
Not good.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.910
So we need different kinds of thinkers to
work together.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.980
I mean lets go back to Steve Jobs.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.000
He wasn't a programmer.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.340
He was an artist.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.429
He was all about the user interface.

00:27:40.429 --> 00:27:42.120
Engineers have to make the inside work.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.120
You see?

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.990
This is where different minds work together.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:49.990
One of the things I loved about Google when
it first came out was I didn't have to learn

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.990
anything.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.030
It was so simple.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:56.049
You know, the last technophobes like me can
learn how to use it.

00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:58.360
That's what I like.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.049
When different kinds of minds work together
we can do really great things.

00:28:02.049 --> 00:28:07.780
I'm getting very concerned that too many smart
students are going nowhere.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.020
So one geek gets to go to heaven.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.350
He gets to come here.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:15.390
Another geek, especially out in the Midwest
is going nowhere.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.260
Some of them get so depressed, they've committed
suicide.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.370
It's just terrible.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.640
Other, they adjust to playing video games
and are on Social Security.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.700
See 'cause the problem that we have in the
schools is that this label, whether it's autism

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:33.150
or Asperger's syndrome goes all the way from
Steve Jobs or Einstein down to somebody that's

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.010
definitely not gonna be working here.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.020
It's such a big spectrum.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.980
And it's like two big kind of pieces of it.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.951
It takes one kind of education on the higher
end.

00:28:40.951 --> 00:28:44.960
And other kind of services on the lower end,
and a lot of the special educators are much

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.780
better at working with the more severe kids.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:52.170
But I'm seeing smart kids getting into a bunch
of classes with the lower functioning kids

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.450
and they're going absolutely nowhere.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:58.320
You get into school where they've taken out
all the hands-on classes.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.650
They've taken out science labs.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.940
And they've taken out art, and they've taken
out music.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.210
And they've taken out woodshop and auto shop
and all those kinds of things.

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:09.460
Those are the classes that get a lot of those
people's kids going.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.710
That's what kept me going.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.960
If I hadn't had art, I would have gone absolutely
nowhere.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.799
Another thing is, we don't have enough science
teachers.

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:21.460
I'm very, very concerned about how the public's
getting further away from science.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.170
I went into a bookstore in Seattle airport.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:28.429
And I was shocked to find out there was no
science section.

00:29:28.429 --> 00:29:30.880
They had a very big section on history and
biography.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.780
But not on science.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.120
Now that wasn't the case 10 years ago.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.640
I think this is very, very worrying.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:42.230
And I know that a lot of the companies here,
Boeing and Google have reached out to the

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.230
schools here.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:47.179
We need to be thinking about ways to get much
more out there.

00:29:47.179 --> 00:29:49.710
I think what you're doing with SketchUp's
really great.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:57.790
In fact I have a slide where I show SketchUp
and I talk about things that Wolfram Mathematica,

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.520
you know, mathematics site, and things like
that.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.940
Well, my science teacher saved me.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.840
Because he got me interested in studying.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.030
'Cause now I had a goal.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.320
Because I wanted to be a scientist.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.962
And I'm concerned that our educational system's
failing to stimulate some of these different

00:30:12.962 --> 00:30:13.962
minds.

00:30:13.962 --> 00:30:15.540
The visual thinker.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.580
The pattern thinker.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:23.929
Now, there are some educators, even 10 years
ago or so, they're worried that we're overlooking

00:30:23.929 --> 00:30:25.910
a lot of the visual spatial thinking.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.910
'Cause there's sort of a politically correct
thing now, that everybody's mind's the same.

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:34.940
Well, you get in the middle of sort of humanity,
that's more so.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:43.520
But I don't agree with Malcolm Gladwell when
he says that it's practice and access to services.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.260
Innate ability does matter.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:50.809
I had access to the exact same computer terminal
that Bill Gates had access to in 1968 the

00:30:50.809 --> 00:30:52.750
IBM Teletype.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.679
And I wanted to learn how to program that.

00:30:54.679 --> 00:30:56.170
I couldn't do it.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:57.860
I just couldn't do it.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.260
You know and I had free instruction.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.410
I had free access to the machine.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.730
It just wasn't my kind of mind.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.110
I think it's a shame schools have taken out
so many hands on classes.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.170
I think it's just terrible.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.070
These are the things that saved me.

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:20.210
Because when I did the specialized activities,
these were refuges away from teasing.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:23.090
Steve Jobs was tortured by teasing.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.180
And he ended up having to go to another school.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.400
And that saved him.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.270
You know and these kids get so depressed and
so out of it because they're just teased.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:35.620
I talked to a lady that was my age that worked
for one of the big government science labs.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.390
And she says "When I'm in with the engineers,
that's like being in with the grownups.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.090
When I got stuck over in human resources,
that was like being with the children.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:46.030
All they did was squabble and things like
that."

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:51.340
I'm very concerned that there's a lot of quirky
students, gifted students going nowhere.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.970
Because they don't have a science teacher
to help channel.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:59.330
And I think that we need these kids to figure
out the energy crisis.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:03.430
The key to, 'cause what do they do with these
kids in China and India?

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.890
They become engineers and computer scientists.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.860
I talked to a mom from India.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.530
She came up to me in a meeting maybe seven
or eight years ago.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:11.990
She goes, "Asperger kids.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.990
Naughty.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.990
Smart.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.110
Send them off to computer school.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.110
Engineering school."

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:19.360
But if they don't get exposed to these things,
they're not gonna get interested.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.160
And I'm getting very concerned about all the
video game addictions.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.140
If these things were turning into programming
games, fine.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.200
Turning into paid employment, fine.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.120
But most of the time it's not.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:34.940
There are some exceptions where they do go
into the video game field and get gainful

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:35.940
employment.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.620
I think big corporations need to invest in
the future.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:45.440
I mean, our university system is just funding
cut, cut, cut, cut.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.480
That's eating our seed corn.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.270
It's eating our country's seed corn.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:50.040
I'm very worried about that.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.670
I just wanna talk about a few things in the
work place.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.590
Where you might have somebody that's got a
little autism.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:58.090
Maybe a little Asperger's.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:02.200
Or maybe when they change the guidelines,
social communication disorder.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:08.400
And they're making this new guideline probably
so they can get out of having to pay for funding.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.799
They're doing it for that reason.

00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:15.790
See the thing is, you disconnect a few social
circuits, then you get more circuits for art

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.820
or for math and that kind of fun stuff.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:25.820
But you could also get in a lot of things,
ADHD, dyslexia, sensory issues.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.169
Can't stand loud noise.

00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:29.440
Can't stand fluorescent light 'cause I can
see 'em flicker.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.050
The whole office is flickering on and off
like a discotheque.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.650
I've gone into a lot of computer offices.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:39.840
I didn't see that so much here, but, boy,
you go in the animation companies, oh, they're

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.340
in a dark hole there 'cause they got all the
fluorescent lights off 'cause they can't stand

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.970
the flicker.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:47.750
You know loud sounds hurting the ears.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.620
Well, there's a number of people who need
a quiet place to work.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:56.190
Another problem is attention shifting slowness.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:58.090
You know, they don't multitask well.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.070
Now most of the jobs here don't require you
to multitask.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:04.419
You just sit there and you do your job.

00:34:04.419 --> 00:34:06.990
Attention shifting problems.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:11.339
And some people when they go to read, they
can see the print jiggle on the page.

00:34:11.339 --> 00:34:13.779
Because of the problem back here in the visual
cortex.

00:34:13.779 --> 00:34:18.190
With the circuits that merge shape, color,
motion, and texture.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:19.549
And to assemble that graphic file.

00:34:19.549 --> 00:34:21.999
Something's wrong with that 'cause it didn't
grow right.

00:34:21.999 --> 00:34:22.999
Print jiggles.

00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:25.099
Let me tell you some simple ways to fix that.

00:34:25.099 --> 00:34:30.379
'Cause I'm finding one out of 50 in my design
class.

00:34:30.379 --> 00:34:32.240
And these kids cannot draw.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:37.159
I ask them to just like draw that, they can't
do it.

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:38.819
And I said, "Print jiggle on the page?

00:34:38.819 --> 00:34:40.319
Do fluorescent lights flicker?

00:34:40.319 --> 00:34:41.849
Do you hate driving at night?

00:34:41.849 --> 00:34:42.849
Do you hate escalators?

00:34:42.849 --> 00:34:48.200
Well, why don't you try changing the background
color of the computer.

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.210
I mean light blue, light lavender.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:55.980
Try printing your stuff on some light gray
paper or tan paper.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.220
That sometimes helps."

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.849
And sometimes colored lenses help.

00:34:59.849 --> 00:35:00.849
Pale lavender.

00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:01.970
Pale pink.

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.210
But you gotta pick out the color that works
for you.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.270
Nobody knows why that works.

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:06.609
But it's such a simple thing.

00:35:06.609 --> 00:35:08.980
You'd be kinda stupid not to try that.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.900
And then there are some of my books.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:17.019
And one of the books I've got there is "Developing
Talents" and it's about jobs for people on

00:35:17.019 --> 00:35:18.019
the spectrum.

00:35:18.019 --> 00:35:20.269
Jobs for visual thinkers.

00:35:20.269 --> 00:35:24.349
Jobs for the engineering kinds of minds.

00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:26.440
And jobs for word thinkers.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:31.230
Because I'm getting really concerned that
there's an awful lot of talent that's going

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.230
to waste.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:36.589
Because there's all kinds of old Aspies now
and they're comin' out of the woodwork.

00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:42.099
And the reason why they got diagnosed at the
age of 50 was because they had social problems

00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:43.220
with their marriages.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.819
But they managed to get good jobs.

00:35:44.819 --> 00:35:47.569
A lot of 'em in technical fields.

00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:49.420
Lot of 'em not in technical fields.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.809
Not everybody on the spectrum is a technical
person.

00:35:52.809 --> 00:35:55.150
Maybe a half of them are technical people.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:56.670
And you got a bunch that are artists.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.329
I think we're gonna end with that.

00:35:58.329 --> 00:36:03.489
And we've got about 20 minutes to just do
some really, really interesting questions.

00:36:03.489 --> 00:36:05.329
And discussion.

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:12.710
Because that's what I really like to do.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:13.710
[applause]

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.710
OK.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:15.979
We've got a mic here.

00:36:15.979 --> 00:36:18.130
So we gotta use the mic so that the

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.130
&gt;&gt;Male: Testing.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.130
Yeah.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:21.130
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: OK.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.289
Hopefully that's working.

00:36:22.289 --> 00:36:25.000
And if nobody has a question I'll pick somebody.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
OK.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
How about right here?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.110
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Is this working?

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.110
OK.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.269
This is actually a comment.

00:36:30.269 --> 00:36:37.930
It was an interesting point that you made
about the, these computer generated designs

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:43.480
coming from young people that wouldn't actually
work.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.910
And gates that wouldn't close and things like
that.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:50.640
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: All that stuff doesn't,
and the thing is these mistakes, the old timers

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.650
didn't mistakes.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:52.839
Not these kinds of mistakes.

00:36:52.839 --> 00:36:53.839
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Well, exactly.

00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:54.839
No.

00:36:54.839 --> 00:36:57.720
I was, the reason I mention it is because
I was talking to a woman who works for the

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.479
California Department of Transportation.

00:36:59.479 --> 00:37:02.190
About maybe 10, 15 years ago.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:07.569
And she said even back then, she was seeing
designs of highways, of roads.

00:37:07.569 --> 00:37:10.789
That would literally be dangerous for people
to drive on.

00:37:10.789 --> 00:37:12.380
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well, you have downtown
Denver, and you get in the right hand lane,

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.380
you're just forced off.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.380
Ugh.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:18.550
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Well in one case, she was saying,
the way they would do the crowns and the angles,

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:22.839
the slopes, as they would design the curve
around some obstacle.

00:37:22.839 --> 00:37:28.660
So there's no car on the road today that will
stay on that road because they, they had no

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.660
concrete.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.580
The computer said it was right, so it had
to be right.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.750
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well, that doesn't mean
it's gonna be right.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:36.299
I had a drawing sent to me that was a ramp
for a meat plant.

00:37:36.299 --> 00:37:40.950
And for cattle you wanna do a three and a
half inch step and then an 18 inch run.

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.859
And so the [inaudible] going in didn't want
to form as much concrete.

00:37:43.859 --> 00:37:45.739
So they went with a six inch riser.

00:37:45.739 --> 00:37:47.770
And I was afraid the cattle would trip.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:50.809
And I said "Put it back to a three and a half
by 18 inch step."

00:37:50.809 --> 00:37:56.840
So they did that, and I get the drawings back,
and the steps went like this, and then just

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.840
straight.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.559
They forgot that when you go with less rise,
you have to have more steps.

00:38:01.559 --> 00:38:02.559
[laughter]

00:38:02.559 --> 00:38:03.559
I am not kidding.

00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:04.559
I am not kidding.

00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:06.339
Major meat company.

00:38:06.339 --> 00:38:08.009
Major name I'm not gonna say it.

00:38:08.009 --> 00:38:09.700
That you see in the grocery store.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.250
I'm going, you've got to be kidding.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:19.009
It's happening and every single time I trace
these drawings, I'll call 'em up and I get

00:38:19.009 --> 00:38:22.640
the kid on the phone and I talk to them and
I go "Did you ever build anything?

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.410
Did you ever hand draft first?"

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:25.410
No.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.220
I mean I do this discretely.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:30.519
But every single time this is what I have
found.

00:38:30.519 --> 00:38:35.519
&gt;&gt;Male #1: The other thing is that since I
did some work in early childhood education

00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:36.930
and developmental psychology.

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:40.960
One of the things, and in anthropology, one
of the things that seems to me really clear

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.299
that corroborates a little of what you've
been saying is that we've evolved over tens

00:38:45.299 --> 00:38:51.390
of millions of years for the brain to understand
how the world works as little children.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:52.859
And as infants.

00:38:52.859 --> 00:38:54.930
Through that physical touch and interaction.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.950
And without that there is this disconnect.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:57.950
[inaudible]

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.789
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: well, and I think kids need,
I just saw something in a paper the other

00:38:59.789 --> 00:39:04.069
day about giving kids blocks and having 'em
build things out of blocks.

00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:07.569
You know, I think that's actually a good thing.

00:39:07.569 --> 00:39:11.799
Because in order to see and, the brain is
works, you gotta touch.

00:39:11.799 --> 00:39:14.559
To really understand.

00:39:14.559 --> 00:39:18.069
And I think it's interesting and when you
talk with animation companies.

00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:21.460
They handle their little figurines that that
3D printer puts out.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.049
They don't put it up on some high shelf there.

00:39:23.049 --> 00:39:25.309
They were all clustered right around the keyboard.

00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:27.700
Right next to the monitor.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.809
They're holding 'em.

00:39:29.809 --> 00:39:30.809
[pause]

00:39:30.809 --> 00:39:33.130
Now what do you do.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:34.670
&gt;&gt;Male #1: [inaudible]

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:36.220
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: OK.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:42.950
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I had a question about animal dissections
in schools.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.390
'Cause you're talking about hands on learning.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:48.630
And stimulating those visual thinkers.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:51.410
But you get a lot of pushback from parents.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:55.130
They're all like "Oh, I don't want my kids
cutting open an animal."

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:58.680
And kids that are like "No, I don't like that,
that's wrong.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.160
That's wrong to cut open a pig for this."

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.160
That kind of thing.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.869
And teachers that are kinda sharing that same
idea.

00:40:03.869 --> 00:40:08.759
And I know that you're in a field where, and
you know, it's livestock handling.

00:40:08.759 --> 00:40:14.070
It's that we raise animals and then we, for
use.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:17.960
And not that they are things, but that we
have to respect these animals.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:25.900
The question is, my biology teacher, she was
the only one who continued doing dissections

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:26.900
in school.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.609
Everyone else looked at her and she was kind
of shunned.

00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:29.609
Because she thought it was so important.

00:40:29.609 --> 00:40:31.109
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: And how did you feel about
doing it?

00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:34.029
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I thought it was incredibly useful.

00:40:34.029 --> 00:40:38.779
It wasn't the same as the computer images
that show you how to do dissections.

00:40:38.779 --> 00:40:39.900
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Not the same.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.200
And let's look at another thing.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.539
One of the most attractions that most people
go to.

00:40:45.539 --> 00:40:50.109
Like in the city of Denver, more people go
to the zoo than go to the stadiums.

00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:52.049
You know, video isn't the same thing.

00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:53.229
They wanna see a real lion.

00:40:53.229 --> 00:40:54.229
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Mm-hm.

00:40:54.229 --> 00:40:55.299
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: A real tiger.

00:40:55.299 --> 00:40:58.849
It, they wanna see the real thing.

00:40:58.849 --> 00:41:04.210
And I think we can get so far removed from
the real world that it can be very bad.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:07.470
Because, when I look at some of the stuff
going on in Washington.

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:11.460
I go down to Washington DC it's like going
to the Twilight Zone.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.969
Everything is just turned into posturing.

00:41:13.969 --> 00:41:16.609
Who's gonna win.

00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:17.979
I'm a child of the '50s.

00:41:17.979 --> 00:41:19.849
Man, we built the interstate highway system.

00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:23.680
In the '60s, my generation we went to the
moon.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.219
Man, we did stuff.

00:41:25.219 --> 00:41:29.640
The problem is we've got people in NASA and
here that are still doing stuff but I get

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.670
kinda worried here as I walk through here.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:36.589
And you might forget especially at something
like a power plant, what the computer is connected

00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:37.589
to.

00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:41.329
Because I understand that big gate valve that
won't turn.

00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:45.849
You don't put diesel generators where they're
gonna get wet.

00:41:45.849 --> 00:41:49.990
That kinda stuff, I understand.

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:55.839
And I, you don't wanna get so far away from
that that you forget about that stuff.

00:41:55.839 --> 00:42:01.099
And you may need some people like me that
get some people out of heavy industry, that

00:42:01.099 --> 00:42:02.259
worked in the maintenance department.

00:42:02.259 --> 00:42:03.259
Heavy industry.

00:42:03.259 --> 00:42:05.480
And they'll go "Oh man, you need to do that.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:14.269
When that computer goes crazy that's gonna
destroy 

00:42:14.269 --> 00:42:15.269
the turbine."

00:42:15.269 --> 00:42:20.299
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I've seen that many people that
work in software industry where indeed we

00:42:20.299 --> 00:42:24.809
work with the computer in some kind of virtual
world.

00:42:24.809 --> 00:42:30.269
They have side hobbies, where they actually
work with real things.

00:42:30.269 --> 00:42:31.670
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: I think that's wonderful.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.160
I think that's good that you're doing that.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.860
&gt;&gt;Male #3: For instance, I like motorcycles.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.860
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Good.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.860
OK.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.860
Good.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:39.860
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Keeps my motorcycles [inaudible]

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.860
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: I'm glad that you're doing
things with motorcycles.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.329
&gt;&gt;Male #3: May other people do gardening and
all kinds of stuff.

00:42:42.329 --> 00:42:44.519
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: That's good, I think that's
really good.

00:42:44.519 --> 00:42:48.509
I think that's good because it kinda, you
know I think some of the local food movement

00:42:48.509 --> 00:42:53.200
is an urge to get back and connect with the
nature.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.319
And the real world.

00:42:54.319 --> 00:42:56.130
And urge to get back to those things.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.469
&gt;&gt;Male #3: My point is that people get some
balance in their life

00:42:58.469 --> 00:42:59.469
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Good.

00:42:59.469 --> 00:43:00.469
&gt;&gt;Male #3: between these virtual versus the
real world.

00:43:00.469 --> 00:43:04.890
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well I think that's really
good that you're, 'cause working on your motorcycle

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:06.229
that's a mechanical device.

00:43:06.229 --> 00:43:08.170
But I'm getting worried.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:13.559
And today when you, oh man, the politicians
they just fight.

00:43:13.559 --> 00:43:15.670
They've forgotten about doing things.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:17.329
How do we solve problems?

00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:21.859
When I was a child, I mean, man, we did stuff.

00:43:21.859 --> 00:43:25.579
There's also some research, that's so big
and expensive only government can do it.

00:43:25.579 --> 00:43:26.579
GPS.

00:43:26.579 --> 00:43:29.229
Well, the defense department put up those
satellites.

00:43:29.229 --> 00:43:31.670
The internet, that was DARPA.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.739
Advanced brain scanning, that's DARPA.

00:43:33.739 --> 00:43:35.700
I got scanned on that scanner.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.460
That was the scan that was shown on 60 Minutes.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:41.680
That's not at your hospital yet.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.079
The Boeing jet originally was a military tanker.

00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:49.049
There's some very very big research.

00:43:49.049 --> 00:43:51.329
I get worried about, the funding cutbacks.

00:43:51.329 --> 00:43:56.430
You know, there's things, you guys are doing
really great things but when you get into

00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:03.130
things that are totally new, it's like what
private company would have developed GPS satellites?

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:08.349
They, private companies can develop a little
gadget that picks up the signal.

00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:11.299
And when the military degraded the signals.

00:44:11.299 --> 00:44:14.019
Private industry figured out how to re-degrade
the signals.

00:44:14.019 --> 00:44:15.770
And make 'em real accurate.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:21.089
But private industry would have never spent
the kind of money that put that up there.

00:44:21.089 --> 00:44:28.150
You know, there's, this country's gotta get
back to doin' stuff.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:30.460
You know I look at, we canceled our shuttle
program.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.089
The Chinese are starting there.

00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:37.309
So that's turning on all the little kids over
in China, just like we were turned on back

00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:38.440
in the '60s.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.890
I worshiped the astronauts when I was a kid.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:46.760
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Yeah, its' hard to imagine that
we probably won't be back on the moon in our

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.760
lifetimes.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.760
But anyway.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:53.040
Why don't people react differently, especially
at an emotional level, to animals.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.579
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: What do you mean, react
differently?

00:44:55.579 --> 00:44:57.869
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Mmm.

00:44:57.869 --> 00:45:02.700
So some people as they grow up become more
emotionally dependent on animals.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.289
And some never want to be around animals,
or fear them.

00:45:07.289 --> 00:45:11.599
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well, in the autism group
there are some kids on the spectrum where

00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:14.059
they just totally best buddies with a dog.

00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:15.259
They really understand a dog.

00:45:15.259 --> 00:45:18.320
And there's others that don't like 'em because
they have a sensory problem.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.180
Like the dog might bark and hurt their ears.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:24.900
Or the cat might meow and that hurts their
ears.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.089
And so it's really variable.

00:45:27.089 --> 00:45:31.989
But I kind of don't, I, some people really
like animals.

00:45:31.989 --> 00:45:35.670
I find lots of times that people are highly
verbal, they don't get animals.

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:38.880
'Cause I've seen a lot of very, very good
animal trainers.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.249
The dyslexic or ADHD.

00:45:41.249 --> 00:45:45.029
But I had a student who's fabulous with animals.

00:45:45.029 --> 00:45:47.670
She was an extreme auditory thinker.

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.690
She had very, very bad problems with her visual
processing.

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:52.710
The problem that I just talked about.

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.270
And she'd listen to the animal.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.270
Like how it breathed.

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:58.940
And with tremendous auditory detail.

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.390
OK.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.349
The mic over there.

00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:11.749
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I think one of the things that
I'm hearing, at least, you saying, is that

00:46:11.749 --> 00:46:14.749
we need to get our children outside.

00:46:14.749 --> 00:46:16.769
And get the children outside.

00:46:16.769 --> 00:46:18.869
Experiencing, playing on a playground.

00:46:18.869 --> 00:46:21.130
Or playing, being out in nature.

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:23.450
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: You know the lawyers are
trying to stop all that.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:30.450
&gt;&gt;Female #1: [laughs] Because I'm too, when
I started it was called programming not system

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:31.450
engineering.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:34.670
But I was, again, one of those people that
everything I did I knew it was gonna have

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:35.670
a bug in it.

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.530
But if I went out and planted vegetables I
knew they were gonna grow.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:39.599
And what they were gonna be.

00:46:39.599 --> 00:46:41.960
It was sorta that same sorta thing.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.170
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well there's a wonderful
book called "Last Child in the Woods" by,

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:46.170
I think it's Richard Louv.

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.170
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Yeah.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:51.150
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: And we've got people are
getting totally removed from the natural world.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.530
Just wanna mention before I forget, there's
an autism meeting where I'm strictly talking

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:55.530
about autism.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.260
I'll be discussing a lot of medication issues.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:00.130
Way too many kids given way too many medications.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:02.749
It's over on Bellevue at the Meydenbauer Convention
Center.

00:47:02.749 --> 00:47:04.670
I'll be there at 8:30 tomorrow.

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:06.900
&gt;&gt;Female #1: And one other comment.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:10.559
We have a son who's dyslexic who's turned
out to be an engineer.

00:47:10.559 --> 00:47:12.930
But you know, when he went through high school.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.309
You had to constantly be at their teachers.

00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:17.059
Because he was always on a knife's edge.

00:47:17.059 --> 00:47:19.020
Because you know, was he gonna do really well?

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.510
Or was he gonna fail?

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:26.400
And it wasn't, so much depended on how the
teacher perceived his problem.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.219
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well, mentors.

00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:30.299
You see, this is where.

00:47:30.299 --> 00:47:35.519
I know several kids, talked to quite a few
situations where you had a parent or grandparent

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:39.970
or maybe a next door neighbor get the kid
interested in something like programming.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:43.579
Even teach him something really old fashioned.

00:47:43.579 --> 00:47:44.579
Like DOS.

00:47:44.579 --> 00:47:46.190
'Cause that's the only thing that momma knew.

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:49.200
But what that did is it got the spark turned
on.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.239
'Cause I'm finding with most kids.

00:47:51.239 --> 00:47:53.680
Yeah, there's some that go find the books
and do it all themselves.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.339
But most of them, there's gotta be some instruction.

00:47:56.339 --> 00:47:58.490
Otherwise he's just gonna play video games.

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:01.630
They start, well, let me show you how you
can make a game.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.789
Someone's gotta start showing 'em some things.

00:48:03.789 --> 00:48:07.959
&gt;&gt;Female #1: This son though wanted to write
graphics programs.

00:48:07.959 --> 00:48:09.219
When he was three and four years old.

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:12.990
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Alright, well then someone
needs to show him how to write graphics programs.

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.049
OK.

00:48:14.049 --> 00:48:19.779
&gt;&gt;Male #5: I hope you'll forgive me asking
a personal question.

00:48:19.779 --> 00:48:24.900
I think probably many of the people if not
most of the people in this room first learned

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.480
about you from Oliver Sachs.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.480
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Yes.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.480
That's right.

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:35.569
&gt;&gt;Male #5: And subsequently we've heard you
on the radio and on television.

00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:42.079
And I have to say, you seem much more socially
adept than the way Oliver Sachs described

00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:43.079
you.

00:48:43.079 --> 00:48:44.079
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Yeah, well that was quite
a long time ago.

00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:45.079
That was over 15 years ago.

00:48:45.079 --> 00:48:48.170
The thing is, the person on the spectrum keeps
learning.

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:49.450
You keep learning.

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:53.859
Like Clair Danes did a really good job of
being me in the '60s and the '70s.

00:48:53.859 --> 00:48:57.329
Oh and the movie is available, Amazon's got
it.

00:48:57.329 --> 00:48:59.109
Keyword Temple Grandin.

00:48:59.109 --> 00:49:00.200
[laughter]

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.632
But they, you keep learning.

00:49:02.632 --> 00:49:05.549
You see an autistic person keeps learning.

00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:07.869
You have to learn how to be in the plot.

00:49:07.869 --> 00:49:14.119
I also take antidepressant medication which
got rid of horrendous anxiety attacks and

00:49:14.119 --> 00:49:15.119
panic attacks I used to have.

00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:17.309
I take a very low dose.

00:49:17.309 --> 00:49:21.039
And I've got information on medication in
"Thinking in Pictures" and the other book

00:49:21.039 --> 00:49:25.519
over there "The Way I See It" which I think
they're gonna run out of.

00:49:25.519 --> 00:49:27.279
It's available over at Bellevue.

00:49:27.279 --> 00:49:30.450
And it's available in book stores.

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.450
OK.

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:33.089
We're gonna pick somebody.

00:49:33.089 --> 00:49:35.039
'Cause we still got some time left here.

00:49:35.039 --> 00:49:36.039
[laughter]

00:49:36.039 --> 00:49:42.619
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I just wanted to say there are
people out there that are working with this

00:49:42.619 --> 00:49:43.619
younger population.

00:49:43.619 --> 00:49:44.619
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Good.

00:49:44.619 --> 00:49:45.989
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I'm not a techy person.

00:49:45.989 --> 00:49:47.589
I'm his partner.

00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:50.529
And I have a degree in counseling and psychology.

00:49:50.529 --> 00:49:52.770
But I work from a little bit different slant.

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:56.799
And it's because I have some ADD and I have
other things going on with me.

00:49:56.799 --> 00:49:59.109
I'm a technical kind of person.

00:49:59.109 --> 00:50:01.849
Mechanical technical kind of person.

00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:06.829
So in my age group I didn't fit into those
programs 'cause I was a female.

00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:07.829
And so.

00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:08.829
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well, I fought that.

00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:09.829
I was a lady going into a man's business.

00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:11.650
And I really did put bull testicles all over
my vehicle.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:12.650
[laughter]

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:13.650
That actually happened.

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:20.260
&gt;&gt;Female #2: But I went into this field because
I have a son who has got dyslexia and ADD.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.819
And I wanted to help these kids.

00:50:21.819 --> 00:50:24.160
So I'm developing a nature therapy program.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.519
Or I have developed it.

00:50:25.519 --> 00:50:29.589
So that these kids get a chance to get out
and experience nature.

00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:32.369
And experience the physical part of that world
we're talking about . So.

00:50:32.369 --> 00:50:34.039
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well, I think that was important.

00:50:34.039 --> 00:50:36.209
Let's see, there was a question right over
there.

00:50:36.209 --> 00:50:39.719
&gt;&gt;Female #3: First, I had a comment.

00:50:39.719 --> 00:50:44.170
My mother very much enjoyed your movie, and
she felt it really helped her understand my

00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:45.170
daughter.

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.469
Who is on the spectrum.

00:50:47.469 --> 00:50:48.599
So that was very nice.

00:50:48.599 --> 00:50:52.269
She's like "Oh, I understand the sound thing
bothering her now."

00:50:52.269 --> 00:50:58.450
What I wanted to say though is, we both came
from agricultural and construction backgrounds.

00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:01.269
So we had kind of a real world start.

00:51:01.269 --> 00:51:02.869
But now he does computers.

00:51:02.869 --> 00:51:07.329
And we're struggling on getting our own kids
as much of the outdoor and the physical.

00:51:07.329 --> 00:51:10.220
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well, the real world thing
with coming in this morning you didn't know

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.539
what a concrete pump was.

00:51:11.539 --> 00:51:12.539
[laughter]

00:51:12.539 --> 00:51:14.650
Yeah, that's, you see construction stuff.

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:16.720
I don't know much of computer stuff.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:21.150
But I worked for years on with construction
stuff.

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:25.190
So I go by a construction site I'm all lookin'
at the stuff.

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:29.430
&gt;&gt;Female #3: So far we haven't found much
better than sending them up to their grandparents

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:30.619
to play with the excavator.

00:51:30.619 --> 00:51:33.259
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: The other thing I think
we need to be doing is when kids get into

00:51:33.259 --> 00:51:35.980
middle school, they gotta learn work skills.

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:38.390
They got to learn how to do assigned tasks.

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:42.670
Like when I was a young kid, all I would do
is do horse head pictures over and over again.

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:45.079
And I had to be encouraged to maybe do the
whole horse.

00:51:45.079 --> 00:51:46.740
Draw a picture of something else.

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:48.569
You gotta broaden out the skills.

00:51:48.569 --> 00:51:54.329
Another bad thing today, even for normal kids,
is kids are not doing playgroups.

00:51:54.329 --> 00:51:57.380
Three or four kids get together, make up their
own game.

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:58.809
You gotta negotiate.

00:51:58.809 --> 00:52:00.739
You gotta teach these kids turn taking.

00:52:00.739 --> 00:52:02.589
They're not learning those things.

00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:05.569
I think kids when they're 13 or 14, they need
to do some jobs.

00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:10.349
Because we're coming out with another book
"Different Not Less" about old Aspies, 50

00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:11.859
and up, that made it.

00:52:11.859 --> 00:52:15.170
They got a diagnosis because their marital
relationships were bad.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.969
But they managed to hold jobs for their whole
life.

00:52:17.969 --> 00:52:21.910
Every single one of them had middle school
and high school jobs.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.690
We're not teaching job skills.

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:24.809
I think it's just terrible.

00:52:24.809 --> 00:52:26.900
They've taken a paper route.

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.200
They can walk dogs for somebody.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.609
Because that's something they're gonna have
to do it every day.

00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:36.599
I had to learn how to use my art skills to
make cattle handling facilities that people

00:52:36.599 --> 00:52:37.599
wanted.

00:52:37.599 --> 00:52:39.859
OK there was a question right back there.

00:52:39.859 --> 00:52:44.269
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Thanks for all your influence
too.

00:52:44.269 --> 00:52:51.799
My question is, if autism and all those spectrum
disorders are genetically linked, do you think

00:52:51.799 --> 00:52:57.869
there's something environmentally or culturally,
nutritionally affecting the numbers?

00:52:57.869 --> 00:52:59.839
As well as people being aware of what they
went through?

00:52:59.839 --> 00:53:02.404
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well, I think with the milder
Asperger end, I think a lot of it is just

00:53:02.404 --> 00:53:03.404
increased detection.

00:53:03.404 --> 00:53:09.799
And I think the other thing is, in the '50s
they pounded those social rules and so they

00:53:09.799 --> 00:53:10.799
coped better.

00:53:10.799 --> 00:53:13.229
I think there is some severe autism that's
increased.

00:53:13.229 --> 00:53:15.069
Especially this regressive autism.

00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:19.259
Where the child loses language at around 18
months to age two.

00:53:19.259 --> 00:53:20.829
You know the plasticizers.

00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:23.940
There's a strong genetic, strong genetic basis.

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.819
It's complicated genetics.

00:53:25.819 --> 00:53:28.559
It's little tiny code variations within genes.

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:30.759
A whole lot of little code variations.

00:53:30.759 --> 00:53:32.529
It's not simple genetics like Down's.

00:53:32.529 --> 00:53:34.779
Or whether you have blue eyes or blond hair.

00:53:34.779 --> 00:53:36.390
It's not that simple kind of genetics.

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.920
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Do you think pesticides or other
plastics are [inaudible]?

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.170
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: Well, I think the biggest
thing is plasticizers.

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:46.309
Androgen disrupters.

00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:49.479
Like those plastic water bottles.

00:53:49.479 --> 00:53:52.589
I don't think it's the greatest idea if you're
pregnant to drink out of those or have your

00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:55.269
kid nurse out of 'em.

00:53:55.269 --> 00:53:58.719
You know I'm usually not alarmist about that
sort of stuff.

00:53:58.719 --> 00:54:01.640
But that's one thing that, I'm worried about.

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.640
That and pesticides.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.499
Some of the stuff I've read.

00:54:06.499 --> 00:54:07.789
I drink out of 'em.

00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:08.789
I'm 64 years old.

00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:10.479
I don't have to worry about it.

00:54:10.479 --> 00:54:13.219
I'll drink out of it, if it's been in the
car for two weeks and it tastes like plastic

00:54:13.219 --> 00:54:17.880
but I'm just not worried about it.

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.549
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Uh, hello.

00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:23.420
I was wondering what your thoughts are.

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.769
I guess I kinda consider myself on Asperger's
spectrum.

00:54:27.769 --> 00:54:32.559
It's kinda the whole, but it's been my whole
life, I'm high functioning, I graduated from

00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:33.979
MIT, I work here at Google.

00:54:33.979 --> 00:54:35.740
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: And what do you do?

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.209
What's your, what kind of, do you do programming?

00:54:37.209 --> 00:54:38.209
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Software engineer.

00:54:38.209 --> 00:54:40.059
So you know, surprise surprise.

00:54:40.059 --> 00:54:47.279
[laughs] But you know the whole question may
be about six to seven years of my life, ago,

00:54:47.279 --> 00:54:49.160
I heard about the term Asperger's.

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.190
Read about it at lunch.

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:52.839
Said "OK, sure that's me."

00:54:52.839 --> 00:54:55.559
But then there's a question of how much do
I share that with other people.

00:54:55.559 --> 00:54:58.420
And I'm kinda curious about your thoughts
about this.

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.769
Because I can just, I'm well on the range
where I can just, I've done my entire life.

00:55:01.769 --> 00:55:02.769
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: I don't.

00:55:02.769 --> 00:55:03.769
I don't.

00:55:03.769 --> 00:55:07.119
I even now if I meet someone on a plane I
don't disclose.

00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:08.119
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Yeah.

00:55:08.119 --> 00:55:13.309
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: I think I, there's unfortunately
still discrimination out there.

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:17.809
I've, I get worried about some of these smart
kids getting held back by labels.

00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:23.869
And you know, if somebody, I have dads come
up to me and they'll say "Well, should I get

00:55:23.869 --> 00:55:24.869
a formal diagnosis?"

00:55:24.869 --> 00:55:26.599
I'll just say "Read the books.

00:55:26.599 --> 00:55:28.009
Keep it off those electronic records.

00:55:28.009 --> 00:55:31.069
I don't want some Google app getting into
that.

00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:33.549
Really don't."

00:55:33.549 --> 00:55:36.900
And I would certainly recommend reading some
of the books.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:42.700
The stuff I've found most helpful was the
personal reports from people.

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:45.209
And some of the brain research stuff.

00:55:45.209 --> 00:55:49.390
I, but it's, I, you know, it can really wreck
your insurance.

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:50.670
It wrecked my health insurance.

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:51.670
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Really.

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:55.390
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: I was turned down by AARP,
American Association of Retired People, for

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:56.390
a broken nose.

00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:57.390
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Hm.

00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:00.440
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: You know that's BS.

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.690
And that was just used as an excuse.

00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:05.690
And it's

00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:06.690
&gt;&gt;Male #6: That was

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:10.269
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: I've, I've, but the thing
is, in the tech industry, you gotta lot of

00:56:10.269 --> 00:56:15.900
Asperger genetics because if you totally got
rid of all those genetics, you're not gonna

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:16.980
have any mathematicians.

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:22.150
So I mean, you have a lot of social yackety
yacks that aren't gonna get very much done.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:23.150
[laughter]

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:31.009
Because, the thing is, if you don't have people
in the world interested in things, you know,

00:56:31.009 --> 00:56:34.180
the social people are more interested in just
chit-chattin' and socializing.

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:35.869
Which I'm not.

00:56:35.869 --> 00:56:40.449
And one of my big concerns today is I'm seeing
too many smart kids just going nowhere.

00:56:40.449 --> 00:56:42.780
They're getting addicted to drugs.

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:44.480
They're getting addicted to video games.

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.440
They haven't been taught any job skills.

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.459
Just goin' nowhere.

00:56:47.459 --> 00:56:50.900
And the problem is, it is such a big spectrum.

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:54.440
And the kinda teaching and stuff that a mild
person needs is very different than the more

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:55.670
severe ones.

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:57.660
But it's all got the same name.

00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:01.910
And when they come out with the new DMS5,
they're gonna take the Asperger's out and

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:03.900
just call everything 'autism spectrum'.

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.449
Well, that really makes it clear as mud.

00:57:07.449 --> 00:57:08.999
Scientifically that's correct.

00:57:08.999 --> 00:57:11.910
Because it's a true continuous trait.

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:14.759
But I'm seeing that people get locked into
the labels.

00:57:14.759 --> 00:57:15.809
My kid.

00:57:15.809 --> 00:57:16.809
PDD.

00:57:16.809 --> 00:57:18.089
Pervasive Developmental Disorder or Autism?

00:57:18.089 --> 00:57:19.710
You know what, it doesn't matter.

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:20.819
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Yeah.

00:57:20.819 --> 00:57:22.690
That was about my experience.

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:25.660
That it wasn't worth getting any type of formal
diagnosis.

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:30.119
And people are saying "Why don't you call
a girlfriend."

00:57:30.119 --> 00:57:31.699
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: I would wish people

00:57:31.699 --> 00:57:35.799
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Basically my gist was, why do I,
near as I can tell there's no advantage to

00:57:35.799 --> 00:57:37.699
me getting any formal diagnosis by a doctor.

00:57:37.699 --> 00:57:38.699
&gt;&gt;Temple Grandin: No.

00:57:38.699 --> 00:57:39.699
It's a disadvantage.

00:57:39.699 --> 00:57:40.699
It can really wreck your insurance.

00:57:40.699 --> 00:57:44.770
And what I tell most people your age that
are employed in a good job like this, keep

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:46.670
it off those electronic medical records.

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:50.329
But I would read, I'd read a bunch of the
books.

00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:52.140
Maybe even go to some of the meetings.

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.969
Now why with a little kid would you get diagnosed?

00:57:54.969 --> 00:57:56.479
To get services.

00:57:56.479 --> 00:57:59.019
You see if you wanna get services for a really
young child.

00:57:59.019 --> 00:58:01.039
You got to have the diagnosis.
