00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.512
Speaking of automation, it's worth
mentioning the autofocus attribute.

00:00:05.512 --> 00:00:11.290
Autofocus automatically puts the cursor
on an input when the input is rendered,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.450
making it easy for
users to quickly begin using the form.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.940
Thus, the browsers immediately
move the focus to the input field.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.480
However, mobile browsers ignore
the autofocus attribute, so

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.720
that the keyboard
doesn't randomly appear.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.089
The Google home page, for
example, as you could see here,

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.060
uses the autofocus attribute on the
search bar, because the vast majority of

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.540
users just want to start typing
the queries as soon as the page loads.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.910
See, use autofocus when you
want to save your user's time.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.270
But be careful because it will still
keyboard focus and potentially

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.570
prevent the backspace character
from being used for navigation.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.120
Also, it's recommended that
you only autofocus inputs

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.130
that are above the fold.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.270
Otherwise, the page will scroll
down immediately upon rendering,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.350
which can be jarring.
