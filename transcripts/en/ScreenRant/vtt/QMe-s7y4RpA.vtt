00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.910
When a movie has audiences on the edge of
their seats, or falling out of them, you�d

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.400
be surprised at how much they miss.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.330
We don�t just mean mistakes or plot holes,
since viewers are just as likely to overlook

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.340
clever details the directors placed into the
film on purpose for an extra laugh � or

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.340
a mind-bending twist.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:32.230
Here are Screen Rant�s 10 Movie Details
You Definitely Missed.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.079
Kill Bill Vol. 1

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.000
Quentin Tarantino managed to keep the real
identity of Uma Thurman�s character a secret

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.910
through both Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2, referred
to by Bill only as �Kiddo,� and officially

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.680
credited as �The Bride.� It was only at
the end of Volume 2 that the heroine�s name

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.829
was revealed in full as �Beatrix Kiddo.�
But eagle-eyed viewers could have spoiled

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.790
the surprise well ahead of time, since Kiddo�s
plane ticket to Japan in the first movie shows

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.309
her name in full.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.920
Inception

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.420
Even die-hard fans of this �dreams within
dreams� heist movie may have missed one

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.370
of Inception�s most brilliant touches.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.650
Throughout the story, the team uses a single
song as a signal to wake up, with the music

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.140
growing louder and deeper as it travels down
through layers of dreams.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.570
Viewers may not notice that the entire movie�s
score is built from the same song, slowed

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.979
down to match the way it sounds while dreaming
� 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.130
in other words: telling audiences it�s time
for them to wake up as well.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.130
Inception

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.330
The movie�s ending has also been debated,
with fans wondering if the spinning top is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.630
meant to show that the movie�s hero, Cobb,
is only dreaming his happy ending.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.870
But a small detail may hold the answer: whenever
Cobb is inside of a dream � where his late

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.140
wife is around to wreak havoc � his wedding
ring returns to his finger.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.040
When awake, it disappears.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.070
Going only by that detail, the lack of the
ring in the final scene confirms it�s not

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.510
an illusion.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.189
Total Recall

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.330
Long before Inception had movie fans debating
what was real and what wasn�t, this sci-fi

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.000
adventure was playing the same trick.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.030
When a blue collar worker of the future pays
to have thrilling memories of a top secret

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.680
mission to Mars planted in his brain, his
real memories return� sending him on an

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.680
adventure to Mars.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.780
Fans have debated whether the film is real
or all in the hero�s head - but listen closely

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.469
to one Rekall lab tech who directly references
the film�s final scene (insert: �blue

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.909
sky on Mars� clip).

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:39.129
Other hints can be explained away, but this
easy to miss line is hard to argue.

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.400
Fast Five

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.632
Introduced as a new character in Fast &amp; Furious:
Tokyo Drift, the unshakable Han (pronounced

00:02:47.632 --> 00:02:50.889
�Honn�) � played by actor Sung Kang
� would go on to become a main player in

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.279
future films, referred to only by his first
name.

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.370
Director Justin Lin�s unofficial prequel
Better Luck Tomorrow starred Kang as �Han

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.680
Lue,� but Fast Five revealed his full name
was revealed to be �Han Seoul-Oh,� a clear

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.409
nod to the Star Wars saga�s infamous smuggler.

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.430
Godzilla

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.349
As serious a threat as a prehistoric alpha
predator may pose, the minds behind the 2014

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.500
Godzilla reboot had plenty of fun with their
opening credits.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.019
The classified reports censored to conceal
everything but a cast or crew member�s name

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.170
is clever, but a closer look reveals nearly
every one of them to be the butt of a joke

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.799
� including a nod to Bryan Cranston�s
role as Breaking Bad�s �Walter White,�

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.819
and the monster movie that put Gareth Edwards
in the director�s chair.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.330
The Lord of the Rings

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.469
No fantasy fan will forget the moment when
Boromir met his end in the Fellowship of the

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.969
Ring, pierced by multiple arrows from an Uruk-Hai
(pronounced �Oorook High�) bow, but it�s

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.959
Aragorn who finds the best way to remember
his sacrifice.

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.940
Removing Boromir�s leather vambraces before
sending his body on to Gondor, Aragorn goes

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.439
on to sport the forearm guards for the next
two films � a fact never called out or noted

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.040
by any character.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.669
Back to the Future

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.519
When Marty McFly�s time travel prevents
his parents from falling in love, he�s forced

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.450
to bring them together � or risk fading
from existence as a result.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.320
Convincing his sheepish father means using
all the futuristic tech and jargon he can

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.370
muster � including music by Van Halen.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.180
Although the band wouldn�t give permission
to use their name or music, lead guitarist

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.180
Eddie Van Halen did.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.639
Marty�s cassette tape is labelled EDWARD
Van Halen as a result, with the guitarist

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:40.870
admitting years later that he recorded the
guitar riffs himself.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.650
Jurassic Park

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.400
Steven Spielberg has a knack for terrifying
moviegoers with monsters neither seen nor

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.320
heard � first with the great white shark
of Jaws, and later, Jurassic Park.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.039
The parallels aren�t lost on the cast, either:
when Jurassic Park programmer Dennis Nedry

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.370
is introduced, he�s apparently enjoying
a viewing of Jaws on his own computer screen.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.900
Specifically, the scene in which the massive
shark is first revealed.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.431
You would think that he would have learned
never to get cocky with deadly animals, but

00:05:11.431 --> 00:05:16.020
Spielberg had�other plans.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.879
The Usual Suspects

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:26.889
Kevin Spacey�s crippled con man, Verbal
Kint may concoct one of the most iconic twists

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.750
in movie history, but the ending of The Usual
Suspects isn�t as hard to guess as you�d

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.750
think.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.421
Government agents suspect that his story is
only meant to cover the escape of his friend,

00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:35.421
Keaton.

00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:39.419
The audience saw Keaton killed by the film�s
mysterious villain, and when the interrogation

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:45.960
gets rough, Verbal spills the beans for one
brief second (insert clip: �I killed Keaton�).

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.409
The Customs agent, like the audience, may
have been too distracted to hear Verbal confess

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.120
to the crime.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.500
