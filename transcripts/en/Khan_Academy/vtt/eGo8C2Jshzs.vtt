00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.880
We're in the home stretch.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.380
We figured out a constraint
on b in terms of m

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.770
for the line that's
tangent to both

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.591
the circle and the hyperbola.

00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:11.340
And I want to make one
clarification here.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.860
Here in the last video,
I took the principal root

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.620
when I took the square
root, and that's

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.090
because I want the
y-intercept to be positive.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.424
Remember, when we
look at this drawing

00:00:20.424 --> 00:00:22.090
that I did in the
first video over here,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.540
this y-intercept needs
to be positive in order

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.550
for it to have a
positive slope and be

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.130
tangent to both the circle
and the hyperbola in this way.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.640
So down here, you
definitely want

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.527
to take the principal root.

00:00:38.527 --> 00:00:41.110
Now with that said, this is the
constraint from the hyperbola,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.210
this is the constraint
from the circle.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.560
Let's set them equal to
each other and solve for m,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.037
and then we'll have
our slope of the line.

00:00:48.037 --> 00:00:49.620
So let's set them
equal to each other.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.950
So we have the square
root of 9m squared minus 4

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:05.560
is going to be equal to
negative 4m plus 4 times

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.912
the square root of
m squared plus 1.

00:01:09.912 --> 00:01:11.370
So the first thing
we can do, let's

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.070
square both sides of this.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.240
So we get 9m squared minus 4
is equal to this term over here

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.380
squared.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.220
So this is 16m squared and
then plus 2 times the product

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.870
of these two terms.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.740
So the product is going
to be negative 16m.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.320
So it's going to be negative
32m times the square root of m

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.340
squared plus 1, and then
plus-- square this term--

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.770
16 times m squared plus 1.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.570
So let's try to simplify
this a little bit,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.740
get maybe the radical on
one side of the equation,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.290
and see if we can
simplify this even more.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.370
So a good place to
start, so let's see.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.450
This term right
over here is going

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.320
to be 16m squared plus 16.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.100
So on the right-hand side--
let me just write it like this.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.420
So we have 9m squared
minus 4 is equal to--

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.420
on the right-hand side,
we have 16 plus 16.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.470
We have 32.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.060
32m squared plus 16, minus
32m, times the square root

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.477
of m squared plus 1.

00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:31.060
Now let's see.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.730
We can subtract 9m
squared from both sides,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.130
so we'll subtract 9m
squared from both sides.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.375
And then we can add
4 to both sides.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.580
And then we are left with--
actually, let me do it

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.246
the other way, because
I want to isolate

00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:50.500
this on the right-hand side.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.600
Let me do it the other way.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.970
So let's subtract 32m
squared from both sides.

00:03:02.222 --> 00:03:03.930
Well, yeah, might as
well do it this way.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.020
So subtract 32m squared
from both sides,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.960
and then subtract
16 from both sides.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.960
The left-hand
side, 9 minus 32 is

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.730
going to be negative
23, because 23 plus 9,

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.170
yup, is-- so this is
negative 23m squared minus 20

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.850
is equal to negative 32m
times the square root

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.210
of m squared plus 1.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.310
Now we can square both
sides of this equation.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.302
It's not the cleanest
problem in the world,

00:03:41.302 --> 00:03:43.260
but hopefully, if we
haven't made any mistakes,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.680
we'll get someplace productive.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.138
Actually, let's
multiply both sides

00:03:46.138 --> 00:03:49.020
of this equation times negative
1 just to make it positive

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.110
and simplify things.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.110
So that becomes positive,
positive, and positive.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.480
If you square the left-hand
side of the equation,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.919
we get 23 squared.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:03:59.960
Let me write it this way.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:08.130
We get 23m squared squared plus
2 times the products of this.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.120
So this would be 40--
let me just write it

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.980
2 times 20 times 23m squared,
plus 20 squared, which is 400,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.290
is going to be
equal to 32 squared,

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.760
or I'll write it as 32m
squared, times m squared plus 1.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.230
Now let's see what
we can do over here.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.860
So this turns into-- this is
just a big tedious problem.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.990
So I'll just write this
is 23m squared squared

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.070
plus-- so this is
going to be 40.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.480
This is 40 times 23.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:54.780
So 23 times 4 is 92, so it's
going to be plus 920m squared.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.690
Actually, let me expand
everything out here.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.500
Let me just go straight to
the numbers, so 23 times 23,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.980
23 squared.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.380
3 times 3 is 9.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.753
3 times 2 is 6.

00:05:05.753 --> 00:05:07.460
69, put a 0 here.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.170
2 times 3 is 6.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.190
2 times 2 is 4.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.080
So you get a 9.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.880
6 plus 6 is 12.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.480
1 plus 4 is 5.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:25.360
So you have 529m to the
fourth plus 40 times 23.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.175
4 times 20 is 80.

00:05:27.175 --> 00:05:30.050
4 times 23 is 92.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.240
So it's going to be
plus 920m squared

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.080
plus 400 is equal to-- so
we're going to have 32 squared.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.980
Let me figure out
what 32 squared is.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.360
32 times 32.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.280
It seems like if you're
taking this exam,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.910
you might as well have your
multiplication tables memorized

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.255
to about 50.

00:05:51.255 --> 00:05:52.787
And I think they
do that on purpose.

00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:54.870
So just to get a sense, I
mean, this isn't an exam

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.580
where the test takers
expect everyone

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.180
to get a perfect-- I think
the number one score in India

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.810
is on the order of 80%,
which is pretty darn amazing.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.620
To be able to do roughly the
math section in about an hour,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.547
to 80% right is pretty amazing.

00:06:08.547 --> 00:06:10.380
But I think to make the
threshold of getting

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.360
into these highly
selective colleges,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.707
I think you have to get
around 40% or 50% correct.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.290
Forgive me if I got
that number wrong,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.150
but I think it's on that order.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.330
So they need to do
that because you

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.490
have 200,000 or 300,000
people in India taking it,

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.350
so you need to
make sure that you

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.558
have a good spread of people.

00:06:22.558 --> 00:06:25.710
So this is what they do
to spread people out.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.290
So we have 2 times 2 is 4.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.730
2 times 3 is 6.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.910
And then put a 0 here.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.290
3 times 2 is 6.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.010
3 times 3 is 9.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.910
And for example, if I was
preparing for the exam,

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.569
I might even go ahead
and-- you know me,

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.110
I hate to memorize
things, but if you

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.437
had to do this type of problem
on the order of five minutes,

00:06:47.437 --> 00:06:50.020
you might want to memorize these
type of things ahead of time.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.110
The y-intercept for a
line that intercepts

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.710
a hyperbola, y-intercept for a
line that intercepts a circle,

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.490
who knows?

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.450
But anyway.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.420
But in general, I don't think
it's good to memorize in life.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.070
Because when you're
actually doing math problems

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.980
in your life, what
matters more is you

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.471
understand the
underlying meaning.

00:07:04.471 --> 00:07:06.970
You normally have plenty of
time to do it in your real life.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.540
These exams are kind of an
artificial circumstance.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.740
But anyway, 4 plus 0 is 4.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.640
6 plus 6 is 12.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.230
So it's 1,024, is
equal to 1,024.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:24.800
That's the 32m squared
times m squared plus 1.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:34.930
Or another way, this is 1,024m
to the fourth plus 1,024,

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.020
squared.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.550
And now we are in
the home stretch.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.820
So let's subtract 529m to
the fourth from both sides.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.240
So minus 529m to the fourth,
this is extremely tedious.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.447
Minus 529m to the fourth.

00:07:51.447 --> 00:07:53.030
Frankly, at this
point in the problem,

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.450
you're better off if you
just want to do it for speed,

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.180
just trying out the
choices they gave you

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.920
and figuring out which
m's and b's satisfy that.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.970
But anyway, let's
just move forward--

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.030
or which m's satisfy it.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.280
That would probably be faster.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.655
But let's just
solve it properly.

00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:10.420
So minus 529m to
the fourth plus--

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.360
and then we also want to
subtract 920m squared.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.470
So let's also
subtract 920m squared.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.310
And so on this side,
we're just left--

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.150
let's also subtract
a 400 just to make

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.410
this a proper quadratic.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.310
And also we're going
to put a 400 here.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.410
So the whole left
side simplifies to 0

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.842
is equal to-- 1,024 minus 529.

00:08:33.842 --> 00:08:34.341
Let's see.

00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:40.150
1,024 minus 524
would have been 500.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.570
And so it's going to
be 5 less than that.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.927
So it's going to be
495m to the fourth.

00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:47.760
Did I do that right?

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.060
1,024 minus 524
would be 500, but I'm

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.080
subtracting 5 more than that.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.260
So that is going to be 495.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:04.470
And then 1,024 minus
920, it'll be 80 plus 24.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:15.270
So it's going to be plus 104m
squared minus 400 is equal to 0

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:19.660
So we have just a straight-up
quadratic equation over here.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.720
And you might not recognize
it, but this is the same thing.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.810
M to the fourth is the same
thing as m squared squared.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.180
So let's just solve it.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.397
So we'll get m squared.

00:09:30.397 --> 00:09:31.730
We're not solving for x anymore.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.566
We're going to get m squared
using the quadratic formula.

00:09:34.566 --> 00:09:36.440
You could substitute x
is equal to m squared,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.900
and this will just become
a natural quadratic then.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.980
m squared is equal to negative
b, negative 104, plus or minus

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.380
the square root-- more fun math
for us without a calculator--

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.160
plus or minus the square
root of 104 squared

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:58.230
minus 4 times a, which is 495,
times c, which is negative 400.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.570
So that'll make this a positive.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.600
And you have a 400
right over here,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.430
and then all of that
over 2 times 495.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.500
2 times 495 is what?

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.870
Well, it's going to
be 10 less than 1,000,

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.500
so it's going to be 990.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.680
So let's try to see if
we can evaluate this.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.710
Actually, I'll stop
this problem here.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.460
I'm already cross the
10-minute threshold.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.918
In the next video,
we'll just grind

00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:29.610
through this
mathematics-- It's really

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.230
just arithmetic at this
point-- and figure out

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.640
what m is going to be equal to.
