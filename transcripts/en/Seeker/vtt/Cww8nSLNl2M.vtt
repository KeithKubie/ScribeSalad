00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:08.035
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Canon PIXMA Pro professional inkjet printers:

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:09.194
Exactly as you envisioned.

00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:12.045
There is way too much UV light in the universe.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.385
So stock up on some SPF 50 and we’re good
right?

00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:20.445
Well, not if you’re an astronomer.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:24.695
Hey there fellow enlightenment sources, Julian
here for DNews.

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:29.065
Right now in the world of astronomy there’s
something of a sticky wicket; Astronomers

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:32.685
have observed five times more Ultraviolet
light than they can account for.

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:36.805
That’s not a minor miscalculation, that
means something is really wrong with our model

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:37.805
of the universe.

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:42.305
UV light is detected because it strips hydrogen
atoms of their electrons, ionizing them.

00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:46.174
By taking the amount of ionized gas we can
find, we can get a pretty good idea of how

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:48.794
much UV light is whipping around through space.

00:00:48.794 --> 00:00:49.974
So far, so good.

00:00:49.974 --> 00:00:53.165
But obviously that UV light has to come from
somewhere.

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:57.445
Obviously stars like our Sun give off UV light
as part of the electromagnetic spectrum they

00:00:57.445 --> 00:00:58.445
emit.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:01.494
Quasars are the superbright regions surrounding
supermassive black holes at the center of

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:06.244
galaxies and they’re getting compressed
and heated so much they’re an enormous source

00:01:06.244 --> 00:01:07.255
of UV light.

00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:11.585
But when astronomers tally the numbers from
stars and quasars and compare it to the amount

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:14.275
of ionized gas they’ve observed, they come
up short.

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:15.485
Unacceptably short.

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:19.355
It’s like when your mom asks for change
from that 5 she gave you for candy and you

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:21.995
act like there was none.

00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:25.155
So where could all this extra light be coming
from?

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:26.895
One suggestion is Dark Matter.

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:27.895
“Aha!”

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:30.355
I hear you say, because you’re a critical
thinker and I love that about you.

00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:34.355
“Dark matter, which is still an unproven
hypothesis,” you continue, “should not

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:36.475
absorb or emit electromagnetic radiation.

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:38.905
That’s why it’s called ‘Dark’ matter!”

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:40.865
Wow you’re smart.

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:45.605
And you’re right, so blaming the discrepancy
on Dark Matter looks a lot like grasping at

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:46.605
straws.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:47.605
But there’s a chance it’s the culprit.

00:01:47.605 --> 00:01:52.095
The best hypotheses to explain dark matter
are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles,

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:53.095
or WIMPs.

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:55.435
This is what passes as a joke in the science
world.

00:01:55.435 --> 00:01:59.425
Some proposed variations of WIMPs could decay
and release ultraviolet photons.

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:04.075
And since Dark matter accounts for over 80%
of the mass in the universe, that could be

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:05.075
enough to make up the difference.

00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:09.055
And if that’s what’s really happening,
this accounting error could lead to direct

00:02:09.055 --> 00:02:12.314
proof Dark matter exists and exactly what
it is.

00:02:12.314 --> 00:02:15.945
Of course if that’s not what’s happening,
we’re going to have to rethink our model

00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:16.995
of the universe a bit.

00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:20.275
The UV light conundrum is a great example
of science in action.

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:24.504
To quote Isaac Asimov, “The most exciting
phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds

00:02:24.504 --> 00:02:28.144
new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's
funny...'

00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:31.654
Obviously you can’t just take a picture
of Dark Matter, but for everything you can

00:02:31.654 --> 00:02:33.934
see you can capture it with a Canon.

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:37.894
And when you want to print your glorious proof
of a moment in time, Canon’s got you there

00:02:37.894 --> 00:02:38.894
too.

For more info on Dark Matter and what it means
for Sci Fi, Anthony in his rare beardless

00:02:56.184 --> 00:02:59.195
form has a video on that here.

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:02.394
Can you think of other times small mistakes
lead to scientific revolutions?
