00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.594
&gt;&gt; my name is Jane Chueh, and I'm a clinical professor at the Stanford

00:00:04.594 --> 00:00:08.128
Medical School, Medical Center. Clinically, I work

00:00:08.128 --> 00:00:11.560
as a high-risk obstetrician which means we see

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.371
high-risk pregnancies. And I also do fetal

00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:19.961
ultrasounds on pregnancies in general, looking for fetal

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:25.808
anomalies. So, every patient that we see we do require that we know their blood

00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:28.536
type and Rh type. And I know you talked

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:31.582
a lot about the A, B, O blood system. It's

00:00:31.582 --> 00:00:34.806
important because at delivery there's a chance that they may

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:37.844
bleed whether they have a vaginal delivery or whether they

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:41.527
have a c-section. sometimes they bleed. Most of the time

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:44.890
they bleed very minimally, so they don't require transfusion, but

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.054
occasionally, in rare cases, they have a lot of bleeding.

00:00:48.054 --> 00:00:50.966
and it becomes a very complicated case where they require,um

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:56.300
lots of blood. if you need blood, then it's important to have the type of blood

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.980
that the person receives matched to their type.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.540
So we, we want to know what that is.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.068
And in fact we actually require they be

00:01:03.068 --> 00:01:05.042
typed twice. So they're typed at a prenatal

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:06.563
visit, and they're also typed when they come

00:01:06.563 --> 00:01:09.360
in before they receive blood. So there's two that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.241
&gt;&gt; It's that important?

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.930
&gt;&gt; Th-, that is important. ' Cause you can't just could, it could be

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.077
a mistake. I mean the, one, if they have just one result. So the,

00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:19.833
the policy is that there's two that actually correlate. That, that

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:23.410
they're the same. if you don't have a blood type then,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.747
and you need blood, then the only option is, you know,

00:01:26.747 --> 00:01:31.281
the blood bank gives you universal donor, which would be O negative.

00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:33.700
but O negative is not the most common type of blood

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.355
there is and, you know, you can't use up your entire

00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:38.835
pool of O negative blood. So the best thing would be

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:41.227
to you know, give the person the type of blood that they

00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:44.210
actually have. So in pregnancy particularly the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.530
RH factor which is a rhesus blood group

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.700
on the red cell is, is important this refers to a group of antigens, the most

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.990
common being the D antigen. And there's a D positive group and there's a D

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.770
negative antigen you know, where they, they're missing

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.714
the D antigen. So everybody has two alleles,

00:02:06.714 --> 00:02:09.978
right, so there, they could be D positive D positive,

00:02:09.978 --> 00:02:12.892
or D positive D negative, or D negative D negative.

00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:14.932
&gt;&gt; So it's kind of like the O type where

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:17.587
O is nothing whereas you have A, B or nothing.

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:21.870
&gt;&gt; Correct, exactly. Exactly. So, just like with

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.870
A blood type, you can have homozygous A, which'd

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.060
be A positive, A positive, or heterozygous A which

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.510
would be A plus O. A plus O, right,

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.600
where A, O. And so, this becomes an issue when we find an

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.620
rh negative. Woman who's neg, D negative, D negative. so if she

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.430
marries a partner who is not RH negative,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.190
in other words, he's RH positive and he's

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.615
either D plus D plus or D plus D negative. Both of them are which are considered

00:02:56.615 --> 00:03:02.811
you know, D or RH positive. then there's a chance that her child could be RH

00:03:02.811 --> 00:03:07.163
positive. Either D plus, well actually would have

00:03:07.163 --> 00:03:10.246
to be a 100% D plus D negative right?

00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:10.683
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:13.354
&gt;&gt; Because one of the genes comes from her and will be D negative.

00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:17.287
And the other is going to come from her partner. So, we need to

00:03:17.287 --> 00:03:23.198
know what her partner's genotype is for the RH antigen. And we need

00:03:23.198 --> 00:03:29.830
to know if the fetus has you know, a 100% chance of being RH positive.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.140
&gt;&gt; And so just to be clear here than, the risk here

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.280
is that the mother would be RH negative and the baby is

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.250
RH positive

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.520
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.940
&gt;&gt; And if the mother's and the baby's blood were to see each other, that the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.850
mothers blood might not recognize the RH positive

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.200
in the baby blood and attack it or something?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.640
&gt;&gt; Bas, no, basically, if the mother is RH negative and sees the RH

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.770
positive in the fetus' blood, fetal blood,

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.970
then it will recognize it as being foreign.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.090
&gt;&gt; I see

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.003
&gt;&gt; Cause she's never seen the, the Antigen until she became pregnant.

00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:00.305
&gt;&gt; So what are, besides the

00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:03.219
actual mother, mother-fetus interaction, are

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:05.575
there any other important clinical settings

00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:09.870
related to this or otherwise, where knowing blood type's really important?

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.270
&gt;&gt; just the first one. You know, for, for the mother, mostly for her--

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.010
&gt;&gt; Mostly for the mother.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.680
&gt;&gt; --her safety and if she hemorrhaged during preg,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.890
during pregnancy or delivery, that she would need blood. So.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.340
&gt;&gt; And, and there are times when, I guess, patients need

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.132
a lot of blood, or a little bit of blood, I mean--

00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:24.212
&gt;&gt; Lots.

00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:25.690
&gt;&gt; --is there ever, has there ever been a scenario

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.060
where you're like, oh, gosh, I need this type

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.080
of blood, but, you know, I don't have enough, or?

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.560
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.750
&gt;&gt; What do you do?

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.860
&gt;&gt; So yeah we have something called massive transfusion protocol. this happens

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.500
when there's an,obstetrical hemorrhage disaster that

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.760
happens. usually if you have time you

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.890
try to give matched blood. And you know the persons blood type.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.050
especially if you anticipate the possibility

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.469
and she's already been crossed and matched.

00:04:51.568 --> 00:04:55.264
but, if not, you know, you, you activate the protocol

00:04:55.264 --> 00:04:58.293
and you give O- blood. And, and we've had cases

00:04:58.293 --> 00:05:01.777
where, due to certain conditions of the placenta and the

00:05:01.777 --> 00:05:05.447
uterus. Especially one called the placenta accreta, where the placenta grows

00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:07.889
into the uterus. Where you can't remove the placenta. After

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.034
delivery we have to remove the entire uterus. And there's

00:05:11.034 --> 00:05:13.453
so much blood flow that they, the mothers lose so

00:05:13.453 --> 00:05:16.698
much blood they can receive, you know, 50 to 100 units

00:05:16.698 --> 00:05:18.631
of blood. So, for all the sort of

00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:22.371
the general origin native women, they receive something called

00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:26.435
rhogam during pregnancy. Rhogam is an immune globulin that

00:05:26.435 --> 00:05:30.028
blocks, the antigens on the red cells. So if

00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:32.802
you might imagine the fetal cell trying to get

00:05:32.802 --> 00:05:36.160
into the maternal circulation if we got in there,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.080
the rhogam would just attached itself to all the

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.781
sites bind all the sites so the mother can't

00:05:41.781 --> 00:05:43.038
see the antigens.

00:05:43.038 --> 00:05:43.912
&gt;&gt; That's clever.

00:05:43.912 --> 00:05:46.408
&gt;&gt; And you can't, she won't, she want

00:05:46.408 --> 00:05:49.450
amount of response So, that way, if the fetus

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.804
happened to be RH positive, RH positive, that's

00:05:52.804 --> 00:05:56.520
correct, then she won't see the positive D antigen.
