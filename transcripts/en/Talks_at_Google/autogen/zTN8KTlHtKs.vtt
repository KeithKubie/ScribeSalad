00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.910
what excited you

always weird to talk first,

idea of telling

a story that was aspirational
and inspirational,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.200

dealt with real-life issues,

and topics, and things
that are uncomfortable.

that in some capacity and--

something-- this issue

presented itself,

tell a story about young women

to say the reason

directing whole thing is

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.600
So in all of these
different shorts,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.730
there were different
types of technologies,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.820

types of inspiration.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.060
So did any of you guys find
inspiration in these films,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.100
and if you did, connect
it to the film--

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.300
how did you make that
personal connection?

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.120
LISA EDELSTEIN: When we
were given this assignment,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.700
I was trying to figure out--

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.210
I was trying to relate to
myself as a young girl.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.980
And so I thought a lot
about what inspired me

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.440
as an imaginative young girl.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.110
And the thoughts
that Lulu has about

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.470
trying to imagine infinity and
trying to understand atoms,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.740
all that were things that
blew my mind when I was young.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.360
So I really wanted to--

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.520
I felt like that was my
way in to remember what

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.310
it was like to be 8 to 18,
and really just discovering,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.080
and being mind-expanding.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.330
Everything's mind-expanding
when you're that age.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.120
So yeah, that's why I did it.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.470
JENNA ORTEGA: Sweet.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.037
JULIE BOWEN: I thought of my
niece, who was 13 at the time.

00:06:13.037 --> 00:06:14.870
And that was kind of
our target demographic,

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.620
of young women who are
leaving science and math all

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.380
of a sudden, or not staying
the course-- not you girls,

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.430
I know you are.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.060
And I thought, what
would she watch?

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.690
What would she not click
through and go, eh.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.030
And I thought she needed to see
aspirational, lovely people,

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.520
but also you need to
dump the mom as fast

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.810
as you can in my experience.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.540
To the fact that we each
had a piece of technology

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.313
in our short, and mine was
the Waymo, the driverless car.

00:06:47.313 --> 00:06:49.730
And I thought that was a good
opportunity to dump the mom.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.450
So if that's
personally resonating,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.470
then that's how it
personally represented.

00:07:09.435 --> 00:07:10.810
I started a company
two years ago

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.297

using extracted gold

And we also use
cultivated diamonds,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.850
so diamonds that are grown
from a diamond seed that

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.830
are molecularly
identical to diamonds

consequences.

And I think one of the
things that I love so much

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.100
about wearing so many
hats in a company

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.010
is learning about
each of those areas.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.660
And I'm learning
coding, and I know

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.850
how to work the back
end of my website,

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.450
and building all of that myself.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.330
So I feel really inspired
by all of this as well.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.380
And it's amazing to see
multiple industries overlap--

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.422
fashion and tech, and
the intersection of that.

00:08:04.422 --> 00:08:08.710
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.590
ANA BRENDA CONTRERAS: For me,
it was very, very personal

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.070
journey, because I recently
lost my dad like two months

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:20.540
before they invited
me to this project.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.510
And I was reading
all the log lines,

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.140
and I read the story
by [? Borja, ?]

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.455
who is here somewhere.

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:28.080
Thank you, [? Borja, ?]
you're amazing.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.750
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.550
Thank you.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.830
And I was like, oh my
god, this is meant to be.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.580
I have to do this.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.429
I have to honor my
dad in a way, and also

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:40.960
talk about achieving
your goals, your dreams,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.840
but also about grieving,
and also about feeling lost,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.945
and just pushing and keep going,
because eventually you'll fly,

00:08:46.945 --> 00:08:48.790
and you're going to make it.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.130
So in so many ways, it
was a journey for me.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.572
And I grieved through it as
well, just like the character.

00:08:55.572 --> 00:08:56.530
JENNA ORTEGA: So sorry.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.370
Thank you.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.910
Thank you for
that, we felt that.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.470
I felt that watching that.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.010
Amazing.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.250
We very much appreciate you.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.510
Something I guess we
could play off of this--

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.180
and you could just come up
first for this next one, what

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.040
was the most rewarding part
about watching your film

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.490
once it was all put together?

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.360
ANA BRENDA CONTRERAS: Oh, god,
I tried not to cry, so, so bad.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.135
And you are all
amazing, by the way.

00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:22.510
I totally respect
you, and I feel

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.440
honored to be here tonight
with you sharing the stage.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.420
I don't know, like,
seeing it all together.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.080
And also the fact-- we were
talking about this earlier--

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.000
the fact that we, as actresses,
are out of our comfort zone,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.710
trying a different field.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.900
And I feel like the
message that I'm sending

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.350
and what I'm inviting young
girls to do, I did it myself,

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.070
in a way.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.830
So it's like, kudos
for me, in a way.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.430
Also, it's like,
great, I did it.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.902
So it was a great
feeling for me.

00:09:50.902 --> 00:09:53.674
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.830
JULIE BOWEN: I'm a
little in love down here.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.600
What was the question?

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.970
I was just watching her?

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.237
JENNA ORTEGA: What was most
rewarding about watching

00:10:06.237 --> 00:10:07.570
the short once it was presented?

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.540
JULIE BOWEN: Oh, I kept leaning
to all of these women who

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.970
made me cry, one after the
other, after the other,

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.830
and I was like, get ready
for some empty calories.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.000
We're going to
finish real light.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.520
Have you ever tried to make
it dinner out of cotton candy?

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.350
Because I knew I'd
made something light,

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.040
but I made it purposely
light because I wanted it--

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.910
I kept thinking, what
would my niece watch?

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.558
And boy, I can't even imagine--

00:10:37.558 --> 00:10:39.100
of course, she'll
watch all of these,

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.590
and she'll probably weep and
cry, and then go, Aunt Julie,

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.140
please.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.818
But I thought--

00:10:44.818 --> 00:10:47.110
ANA BRENDA CONTRERAS: I was
so thankful for your movie.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.410
I was like, yes, I want
to laugh, I want to laugh.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.620
JULIE BOWEN: Sometimes you need
to bury the message a little,

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.955
and so I was excited to
see that the audience was

00:10:56.955 --> 00:10:57.580
ready for that.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.980
It was fun to hear them laugh.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.280
So that's what was
exciting for me.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.620
And to see my son on screen,
Harris, with the drone--

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.240
one of my kids.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.960
He's at home, doing
homework right now.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.235
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.410
ROSARIO DAWSON: I'd
actually like to say--

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.320
I wanted to bring up-- and
so many of the things that I

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.080
brought up on my short are
all the things that stop us--

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.320
bullying, I wanted to talk about
that, and how devastating that

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:26.820
can be.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.020
People commit-- I mean,
people commit themselves

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.830
to just shutting down,
and not developing,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.290
and not showing up because
they don't feel like they

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.330
have that support out there.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.430
I wanted to talk
about how dangerous,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.710
how much information
we put online,

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.540
and how vulnerable
we make ourselves,

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.610
and how we have to be
smarter about that.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.420
I wanted to bring
up how important it

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.150
is to reach out
and ask for help,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.562
and to trust your friends,
and trust your community

00:11:56.562 --> 00:11:58.770
to be there for you so you
can problem-solve together

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.520
when something's too
overwhelming for you.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.000
It's like, in a spiritual
sense, which I just

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.140
love, so much of that.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.122
There's so much heart,
and spirit, and humor,

00:12:06.122 --> 00:12:07.830
and laughter, and
connection, and reality

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.997
that's embedded in all of
these films, which I think

00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:11.240
is just so important.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.483
And just that reality of
just that heart space.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:14.400
You've got to protect.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.320
And I'm a big fan of-- we all
have a space in the circle.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.910
We're not separate
from each other.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.890
We're all holding
hands in that circle.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.280
And oftentimes, when we get
hurt, when we feel vulnerable,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.020
when we get scared, we
pull away from the circle

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.053
and we step back.

00:12:30.053 --> 00:12:31.470
And those are the
moments where we

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.140
need to step in, and
be held in the circle,

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.635
and have everybody
else support us

00:12:35.635 --> 00:12:37.260
until we can stand
back in that circle,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.350
and support somebody else.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.530
And I just wanted to have
things like that show up,

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.600
and see how they
problem-solved those things.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.850
Do you give up the friendship?

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.940
Do you all just fight, and
just walk away, and give up?

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.670
Or do you empower each other,
and go, no, you're right,

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.920
and I can actually
see why you gave up--

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.410
and you were trying
to protect us,

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.250
and I see that, but no, because
this is bigger, actually,

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.990
than all of us individually.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.330
And none of those things
that this person is trying

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.820
to exploit about us
that we put online,

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.270
that makes us
sensitive and personal,

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.830
is anything that
could defeat us.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.590
Because we've also grown
from those experiences.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.700
And those experiences
didn't stop us,

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.135
so this one won't, either.

00:13:17.135 --> 00:13:18.510
And I just kind
of wanted to show

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.690
that in so many ways, especially
the idea-- it's subtle,

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.000
but just the idea
of how many people

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.700
were possibly in this
contest, and why did he

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.635
pick those girls to
try to take down?

00:13:29.635 --> 00:13:31.260
Why did he feel like
he was threatened?

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.957
In some ways people are really
interested in seeing girls

00:13:33.957 --> 00:13:34.790
in science and tech.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.260
So maybe he thought
they'd have so much shine

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
that he would not be able to
get attention on his as a boy.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.802
So I wanted to just kind
of-- and not totally

00:13:42.802 --> 00:13:44.760
demonize him and make
him this horrible person.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.400
It wasn't so much
that he's exploiting

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.380
these different things
because he really truly

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.195
is misogynistic, and
homophobic, and transphobic,

00:13:52.195 --> 00:13:53.070
and all these things.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.920
It's actually more so the
extent that he's vulnerable,

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.390
and he's scared,
and he has issues.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.100
And maybe he doesn't
have people around him

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.740
to support him to let him know
that what he's doing is enough,

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.073
and that he doesn't need to
take away from someone else,

00:14:04.073 --> 00:14:08.170
and someone else doesn't have
to lose in order for him to win.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:08.970
So it was just--

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.220
a lot of that stuff was
peppered in there, the things

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.060
that I've seen over, and
over, and over again,

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.940
but I just wanted to
see flipped on its head,

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.600
and see these girls
problem-solve.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.070
And when-- Zoe Bell is
in it, and Tracie Thoms

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.250
is in it, who I've done multiple
films with both of them.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.830
And it was sort of like an
Easter egg, of just going--

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.010
you know, I met
Tracie on "Rent,"

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.595
and then we auditioned
for "Deathproof,"

00:14:31.595 --> 00:14:32.970
and then she didn't
get the role.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.140
And we were like, no,
we went in together.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.220
And we got the role.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.350
And then we became really
great friends with Zoe,

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.270
and Zoe produced
something, and she cast us.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.395
And it's just been this
thing where we've continued

00:14:41.395 --> 00:14:42.565
to show up for each other.

00:14:42.565 --> 00:14:43.440
And it was just that.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.260
And these three girls are in
that really precarious moment,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.190
like, is this friendship
going to break

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.820
or are they going to
get stronger and end up

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.070
having a history of
showing up for each other

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.800
and knowing that they can depend
on each other like true family?

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.380
And so all of that stuff, I
thought, was just so important.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.300
The things that stop us, it's
so often just a connection away,

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.138
a communication away
from being resolved.

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:07.428
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:09.724 --> 00:15:10.474
JENNA ORTEGA: Wow.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.769
All right, to kind of
switch this subject,

00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:20.727
I'm going to make you
guys think a little bit--

00:15:20.727 --> 00:15:21.890
LISA EDELSTEIN: Damn it.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.030
JENNA ORTEGA: --if you
haven't already been already.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.620
No, if you could use
technology and content

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.670

NIKKI REED: Can we
ask the audience?

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:37.830
You guys can chime in.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.030
It's not just for us.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:44.470
JENNA ORTEGA: If anybody
has any ideas, feel free.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.658
LISA EDELSTEIN: Yes, energy.

00:15:45.658 --> 00:15:46.200

a future without that,

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:49.805
all these young people.

00:15:49.805 --> 00:15:52.180
The most important thing in
the world is our environment,

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.790

LISA EDELSTEIN: Yeah,
so here's to you guys.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.802
Come up with a solution.

left you a big one.

LISA EDELSTEIN: We're
counting on you.

00:16:05.843 --> 00:16:08.093
ROSARIO DAWSON: Well, that's
the thing, though, right?

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:09.360
Because we're still here.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.784

going to jump off--

MARISA POLVINO: Should
we open this up to Q&amp;A?

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.250
JENNA ORTEGA: Yeah, do
you guys have questions-

want to chime in?

is Katie?

Katie?

you have a question?

Raise your hand.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.592
We have Kate over
here-- oh, here we go.

00:16:55.592 --> 00:16:57.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for having us here.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.590
I know it means a lot
to all of our girls,

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.362
and we really appreciate it.

00:17:01.362 --> 00:17:03.820
I wanted to ask, how did you
come about getting the scripts

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.859
that you used for your shorts?

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.339
Were there a few in the
running that you looked at,

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.690
did you help build
them yourself?

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:11.890
What was that process like?

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.140
NIKKI REED: We were all
paired with a young writer who

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.940
had never written a
screenplay before.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.490
And the process was a
really wonderful one

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.690
because we kind of nurtured
the development of the project,

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.849
and had the opportunity
to kind of be

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:28.690
a part of that first
experience for that writer.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.750
But it was an
interesting experience.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.750
JULIE BOWEN: It was
interesting for the writers,

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.290
because I immediately--

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:37.360
we discussed the whole project
with Marisa, and my friend Rob,

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.860
and Jonas, who's
another producer.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.730
And I thought, OK, got
it, got it, got it,

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.452
and I know exactly
the female writer.

00:17:44.452 --> 00:17:45.910
And they said, the
one thing is, we

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.930
would like you to collaborate
with a male writer.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.070
And I was like, why?

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.750
I thought this is
about the ladies.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.391
They're like, no, it's
about working together.

00:17:55.391 --> 00:17:57.800
And I was like
(DEJECTED TONE) oh.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.720
So--

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.200
I missed that.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:08.440
Like [WHOOSH] I was really ready
to just be a castrating lady--

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.390
person.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.790
But I did know some--

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.000
I knew I wanted to
do something light.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.240
And I approached
some friends who

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.800
had written on "Modern Family,"
and some comedy friends.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.108
And one of them took the
bait, and I worked with him.

00:18:26.108 --> 00:18:28.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.870
JENNA ORTEGA: This
is a question I have.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.830
Did any of you guys like--

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.310
so going back to the different
technologies that were used,

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.870
did you know those
were real things?

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.703
Like I know, for me,
when I read the script,

00:18:38.703 --> 00:18:40.560
I was like, there's
self-driving cars?

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.290
That's a real thing in,
like, Arizona or something.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.640
They started Waymo.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.260
Shout out to Waymo.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.720
Yeah, that's a real
thing, and that really

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.450
caught me off my feet.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:55.710
So did any of you guys have
any idea that was happening?

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.870
ANA BRENDA CONTRERAS: I
was Googling and YouTubing

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.170
everything all the time,
like, oh my god, this is real,

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.550
I have to learn more about this.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:03.720
So, yeah.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.080
LISA EDELSTEIN: I had
a meeting with Jacquard

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.320
to try to figure out how to
create future technology that

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.290
felt reasonable, that felt
like we could get there.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.050
So I was inspired by a thing
that they do right now, which

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.040
is with holograms.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.080
Which, mine's not
holograms, it's 3D printing.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.810
But you can do this thing with
holograms where you take, like,

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.650
your 2 year old to
this hologram place,

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.650
and they do a hologram
of them having breakfast.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.173
And then when your
kid's 13, they

00:19:27.173 --> 00:19:28.590
can have breakfast
with themselves

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.660
by putting on those
glasses and just kind of

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.790
sit with themselves.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.160
And so I thought that
was really a cool concept

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.560
of storing memory digitally.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.390
So with mine, I
made it a 3D print,

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.720
as an idea of 30 years in
the future or whatever.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.470
JENNA ORTEGA: That's
amazing that you just

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.572
grew from that idea.

00:19:45.572 --> 00:19:46.280
There's so much--

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.400
LISA EDELSTEIN: They're like,
no, you can't do a hologram,

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.490
we already have a hologram.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:50.480
Damn it.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.620
[CHUCKLING]

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.620
JENNA ORTEGA: It worked.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.440
It worked, and it
definitely inspired.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.100
Anybody else?

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.470
NIKKI REED: I read an
article about a woman

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.900
who had been in a really
terrible car accident.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.370
And they were working on moving
in this direction for her,

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.810
and I felt really
inspired by it.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.340
And the technology,
unless something

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.130
has changed in the last year
and a half, wasn't developed,

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.250
but it made me want
to tell that story.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.570
It was a very emotional
piece to read,

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.750
and that was two-dimensional.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:23.280
So I thought seeing this
come to life would be--

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:23.938
anyway.

00:20:23.938 --> 00:20:24.980
JENNA ORTEGA: Absolutely.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.680
It was like a beautiful
hybrid of technology and art.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.008
It was really beautiful.

00:20:29.008 --> 00:20:29.800
NIKKI REED: Thanks.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.808
JENNA ORTEGA: Yeah.

00:20:31.808 --> 00:20:32.850
Cool, any more questions?

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.267
Oh, we have a
question right here.

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:35.660
Nice hair, by the way.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.790
I like it.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:37.766
It's cool.

00:20:37.766 --> 00:20:39.810
SPEAKER 1: Got a Google
microphone for you.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.500
JENNA ORTEGA: Oh, wow.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.500
AUDIENCE: I'm fancy now.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:50.850
How is all of this
going to be shown

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.670
to the rest of the world who
couldn't come here today?

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.320
Because obviously you can't fit
an entire world in this room.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.800
JENNA ORTEGA: So this Friday,
it's going to be on YouTube.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.400
It's going to be on YouTube.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.200
MARISA POLVINO: On
the Power On channel.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.190
JENNA ORTEGA: Yeah.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:03.887
So go tell your
friends, check it out.

00:21:03.887 --> 00:21:04.970
MARISA POLVINO: Subscribe.

Share, repost, do all that.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.610
Any more questions?

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:12.820
JULIE BOWEN: Did you
plant her in the audience?

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.970
That was an excellent question.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.620
MARISA POLVINO: We planted
a few people around.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.100
Oh, there's a--

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:16.940
LISA EDELSTEIN: I think
there's a question there.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.148
MARISA POLVINO: Caroline,
there's a girl in the back.

00:21:21.962 --> 00:21:23.670
AUDIENCE: I'm allowed
to throw it to you,

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:24.753
but I feel like it would--

00:21:24.753 --> 00:21:26.533
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:26.533 --> 00:21:27.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.280
These stories are
fiercely important,

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.780
and I really appreciated the
spectrum of representation.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.060
One thing that was really
central that I appreciated

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.780
was the importance on
women and relationships

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.473
that girls have with one
another and with other people.

00:21:42.473 --> 00:21:44.640
I'd love to hear a little
bit about how you maintain

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.848
the authenticity of
those relationships,

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:48.390
and I'd love to hear
how you maintain

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.490
the authenticity of the
representation spectrum

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.650
that you've showcased
in these stories today.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.478
JULIE BOWEN: Well,
I had sisters,

00:21:57.478 --> 00:21:59.270
and I know that you
can love them and fight

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.430
with them all day long.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.700
So that felt authentic to me.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.880
As far as being representational
in the microcosm,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.730
I thought that girls
fight and girls love,

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.338
and they don't have to
be mutually exclusive.

00:22:13.338 --> 00:22:15.380
ANA BRENDA CONTRERAS:
Well, I'm so happy that you

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.172
made that question.

00:22:16.172 --> 00:22:20.480
Because for me, it was really
important to find a story with

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.480
a Mexican-American family--

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.810
--and to do a film
where you can actually

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.150
speak in English and Spanish.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.570
Because there's this
stereotype and cliche

that Mexicans-- or
Latinos, for that matter--

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.760
can only do certain jobs.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.130
And I really wanted
to raise the awareness

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.770
and to tell young
girls and young boys

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:50.210
out there that maybe the next
Steve Jobs can have a Latino

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.023
last name, you know?

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:22:52.950 --> 00:23:00.550
So I know the struggle,
I know that it's

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.320
changing, little by little.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.370
It takes a lot of work, but
I wanted to do a little bit,

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.980
and try to like just put
[INAUDIBLE] "mi granito"

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:09.985
that in.

ROSARIO DAWSON: Zoe.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.423
Zoe, that's you, too.

00:23:30.423 --> 00:23:32.788
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.460
So, I worked with
some of my besties,

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.690
which was the best thing.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.990
And I was just really
grateful that the girls really

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.160
got along with each other.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:48.700
They're totally different
human beings, as all of us are.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.250
But it was just really
beautiful to see.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:54.880
Because they're so professional,
and they're so talented,

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.570
and they're so creative,
they were just really

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.682
able to make characters and
personalities shine through,

00:24:02.682 --> 00:24:04.390
even though we didn't
create these really

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.375
specific certain dynamics
to kind of really

00:24:07.375 --> 00:24:10.000
go, well, what kind of music do
you think that girl listens to,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.480
or whatever.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.230
It kind of came out
through their fashion,

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.830
and their behavior,
and just these moments

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.780
that they created that just
really individualized them.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.380
And it just was really
beautiful to see everything

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.130
that they brought.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.800
Because we didn't-- as we
don't-- have that much time.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.230
So much had to be in
between the lines.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.480
And it just really
resonates and, it just

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.220
feels really authentic.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.540
I felt like I know these girls.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:32.675
I believe these girls.

00:24:32.675 --> 00:24:35.050
I could see them at school,
going in completely different

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:35.620
directions.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.170
But I could also see them
showing up at the treehouse

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.930
later and going, well, this
is what I figured out today,

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.997
and let's pool it and make
something really special.

00:24:43.997 --> 00:24:46.330
And it didn't have to be that
they were exactly the same

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:47.800
and loved all the same things.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.050
Actually, what was best was
that they had their differences.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:52.720
And those differences
gave them strength

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.720
because it allowed them,
when they collaborated,

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.500
to make something
that each of them

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.580
individually couldn't
do on their own.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.580
And I just think that's
a really critical thing,

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.820
is to recognize, when you see
so many leaders and people

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.560
in spaces, they've
got assistants,

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.050
and all these different people
who are working with them.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.330
It's like an
extension of a brain.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.340
No one person has
all that information.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.620
They go, and you're
either Googling it,

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.312
or you're going out to your
community and kind of going,

00:25:17.312 --> 00:25:19.270
OK, cool, I need to get
this done by this time;

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.000
who's got this, and who's got
that, and how can we do this?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.310
And it's like an
expansion of your brains.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.930
If you have that
community of people

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.270
you can rely on that are
really going to show up,

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.430
suddenly it doesn't matter
that you don't know it,

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.680
because you all know it.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.390
And now it's known, and now
it can be that much better.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.913
I just think that
really resonated.

to try to touch

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.980
on how Lulu,
Princess's character,

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.400
couldn't cure
cancer, but she could

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.130
use the power of her
imagination to take

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.480
her sister on these journeys
that she so desperately needed.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.230
And it was the idea that
it's your imagination,

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.230
as young people,
that give us promise,

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.890
and that can change
anything and everything.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.230
Even though she couldn't
save her sister,

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:32.650
she changed the quality
of her life completely.

their connection--

so sweet.

NIKKI REED: I think I
wanted to tell a story

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.915
that spoke about the--

00:26:49.008 --> 00:26:54.700
you know, there's a real lack
of gender diversity in STEM

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.467
fields, but there's also a real
lack of cultural diversity,

00:26:58.467 --> 00:27:00.800
and I think that's what we're
all up here trying to say.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.970
And I don't know what
the up-to-date stats are,

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:08.770
but I think it's something like
14% or 20% of STEM fields--

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:12.160
it's an appallingly low number--

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.090
are women.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:17.050
And I also loved the idea of
flipping a story on its head

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:21.370
and letting the
girl save the boy.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.125
I remember, when
we started writing,

00:27:23.125 --> 00:27:25.250
I think the first draft--
and Adam, if you're here,

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.583
please don't kill me because
I could be making this up--

00:27:27.583 --> 00:27:29.680
but I feel like there
was a conversation of,

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.230
should Andy be the
girl, and the boy

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:33.760
comes in and saves the girl?

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.980
And I immediately said, no, it's
got to be the other way around.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.250
And not only that, I
don't feel like you

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:43.810
see in film very often platonic
relationships between girls

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:44.380
and boys.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.880
It's always a love story.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.317
But those exist in real life.

00:27:47.317 --> 00:27:49.900
And some of the most important
relationships I have in my life

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.450
are platonic relationships
with the opposite sex.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:55.915
And I feel like as much
as we're in a movement--

00:27:55.915 --> 00:27:57.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.320
--as much as we're
in a movement that

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.600
is all about women
and supporting women,

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.300
and I love that, I
also think we need

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.960
to remember to be inclusive of
these wonderful men that are

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.130
a part of all of our stories.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:14.250

it's about inclusivity.

behind you guys casting

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.303
How did you cast them?

00:28:32.303 --> 00:28:33.970
LISA EDELSTEIN: We
had casting sessions.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.887
MARISA POLVINO: Yeah,
we had casting sessions.

00:28:35.887 --> 00:28:38.610
LISA EDELSTEIN: People come in,
and they read from the script,

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.110
they play the
character in the room.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.777
And we have all
different girls come in.

00:28:41.777 --> 00:28:43.690
Some of them don't get the job.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.130
But it's so beautiful to
see people come and try

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.920
and take on these roles.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.872
And I think all of
us, as actors, it's

00:28:52.872 --> 00:28:54.330
really important
to us that we make

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.490
it a safe space for
people to get the job

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.250
or even not get the job.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:04.000
Princess actually-- she came in,
she read it, and it was fine.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.230
And then I sort of re-explained
the whole meditation

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:10.620
about infinity, and she
just burst into tears.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.856
[CHUCKLING]

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.340
It was such a beautiful moment.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.410
To have a real moment
in an environment that

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.415
can be so stressful is a
really magical experience.

00:29:19.415 --> 00:29:20.790
And so sometimes
it can be great,

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.470
and sometimes it
can be terrible.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.710
But that was the process.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.918
JULIE BOWEN: I have to agree.

00:29:24.918 --> 00:29:25.980
That was the best--

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.950
that was the highest and the
lowest part of the process,

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.550
because all of us have
been in that room, over,

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.960
and over, and over.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.880
And sometimes it feels
so deeply personal,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.790
and it's not, when
you're the person.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.800
And so I really felt
a responsibility--

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.890
and I'm sure the
other women did, too--

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.890
to make the people that
were coming in to read

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.010
feel like their work and
their time was valued.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.870
So often you're left
just sitting in a room

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.160
somewhere, for hours.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.310
You don't know what's
going on and why.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:30:00.900
We saw so many wonderful
actresses for my short.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.560
And I was heartbroken that
I couldn't cast them all.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.320
And I wish that I
could call younger me

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.390
and be like, it's not about you.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.300
Sometimes, it's just
about somebody else.

[AUDIENCE CHUCKLING]

ANA BRENDA CONTRERAS: It
was so hard for me as well.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:20.610
Because all these pretty,
amazing little girls

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:21.270
were in there.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:24.510
And I was like, can I just
cast them all, please?

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:30.720
And I remember when Ariana came
in-- she's somewhere here--

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.890
I started crying.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.740
Because I was like, I can't
believe she's so beautiful.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:40.030
And in a way, I understood
that that's a really hard job.

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.840
And now I totally look
at it so different.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.180
Whenever I go in and cast,
it's like, OK, I get it,

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.750
it's hard for you as
well, so it's all right.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.630
So also, in a way,
Power On changed me,

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:53.580
because now I don't
suffer anymore

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.372
whenever I go into casting.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.690
MARISA POLVINO: We
have one more question.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:03.190
NIKKI REED: Wait, on that note,
really quickly, can I just--

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.320
Bella and Derek, and
Thomas Dekker are here,

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.015
and Rosario is here,
of course, as well.

00:31:09.015 --> 00:31:10.890
Gina couldn't make it
tonight, but can I just

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.840
say thank you, guys,
wherever you are.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.860
Are you here.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.190
I see Bella.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.524
MARISA POLVINO: Yay, Bella.

00:31:18.826 --> 00:31:19.910
NIKKI REED: There you are.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:20.692
Hi, sweetie.

00:31:20.692 --> 00:31:22.150
You guys have all
grown up so much.

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:23.850
It's hard-- I don't
recognize anyone.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:27.930
And Thomas Dekker is somewhere.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.980
Maybe he's being shy,
which is not like Thomas,

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.810
but he might be.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.315
Anyway, thank you guys so much.

00:31:32.315 --> 00:31:33.690
You're so wonderful
in this film.

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.778
And thank you for being
a part of this with me.

00:31:35.778 --> 00:31:38.586
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.280
MARISA POLVINO: Do we
have time for one more?

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.155
AUDIENCE: I got the mic,
but it's [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:48.530
MARISA POLVINO:
Anyone out there?

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.190
AUDIENCE: Well, my question,
I guess, is kind of quick.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:53.248
I just feel like
the doors for women

00:31:53.248 --> 00:31:55.540
are opening in a lot of areas,
which is wonderful, tons

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.920
of room to grow, obviously.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.810
But there's so many
young people here.

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:00.727
And I think it would be
really awesome to hear

00:32:00.727 --> 00:32:03.340
a story that you had
in your younger years,

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.490
that you felt that door
closing in your face

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:09.265
because you're female, and how
you got past it, to inspire

00:32:09.265 --> 00:32:11.140
these young ladies so
they can recognize when

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.625
a situation like that happens.

00:32:15.588 --> 00:32:17.630
JULIE BOWEN: There's almost
a hesitation I have--

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.590
I was talking to some
press people earlier--

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:24.370
I went to all-girls
schools until I was 14.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.440
And the messaging that I was
getting at those schools--

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.130
they were excellent schools, and
at the time this was the best

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:31.270
messaging--

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:35.020
was all-women's education
is best for you,

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.990
because when you are in
a classroom with boys,

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.073
when it comes to
science and math,

00:32:40.073 --> 00:32:41.740
the boys are going
to put their hands up

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.450
and the teacher's
going to call on them.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:51.670
In a way, they were
reinforcing the stereotype.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.600
And they did not realize the
damage that that was doing.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.990
So I'm almost hesitant to
say, look out for this.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:03.020
Because what I love is
how your experiences--

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.810
I'm looking at all
these purple ties--

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:07.750
these young women are probably
having a completely different

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.110
experience.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:15.730
And I don't want to color it in
any way by old-school thinking.

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:20.830
It's just, if it excites
you, if it turns you on,

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.660
if you can't stop thinking
about it when you go to school,

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.080
and you can't wait
to compete in it,

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:30.972
or write it, or sing
it, or make it, do it.

00:33:30.972 --> 00:33:32.180
LISA EDELSTEIN: That's right.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.305
JULIE BOWEN: And that's it.

00:33:33.305 --> 00:33:37.160
LISA EDELSTEIN: Yeah, when I was
11, when I was in sixth grade,

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.302
we had to write
essays on what we

00:33:39.302 --> 00:33:40.510
wanted to be when we grew up.

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:43.030
And I wrote an essay that
I wanted to be an actress.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.220
And everyone laughed at me.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:50.050
Because by sixth grade,
boys and girls already

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:52.360
believed that none
of those things

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.220
were things they had access to.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.190
They already were sitting on
top of their dreams and saying,

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:59.530
this won't happen--

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:00.820
at 11.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.890
And so I say to you guys,
everything is possible.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.642
Yes, if you've got
a passion, if you've

00:34:07.642 --> 00:34:09.100
got something you're
excited about,

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.060
you go and you make that happen.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.601
The world is yours, take it.

ANA BRENDA CONTRERAS:
I also think

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.989
it's very important to end
the whole "mean girl" culture.

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:26.250
It's like, girls, just
support your girls.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:27.870
Talk to each other.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:31.330
And believe me, there's going to
be a lot of blessings for you.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.370
It's going to be all
better if you team up.

to ask a question,

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.810
