00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.590
Why do Voices Squeak During Puberty?

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.730
Once you activate your vocal system, the air
in your lungs gets pushed up by the relaxation

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.170
of your diaphragm.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.340
It then goes through your trachea and out
a small orifice that has two folds of skin

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.110
(vocal cords) on either side of it, in the
shape of a V; this is called your larynx,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.290
or voice box.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.660
As the muscles that attach to your voice box
tense and relax, they create a vibration of

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.660
the cords.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.810
As these cords vibrate, they release pulses
of air.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.501
The tension in these muscles creates the differences
in frequency, the higher the tension, the

00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:44.320
higher the frequency and, therefore, the higher
the pitch.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.320
This frequency is measured in hertz (how many
times a second this repeats).

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.320
For example, typical vibrations from speech
usually range from approx.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.320
200 hertz-8,000 hertz.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.960
When we are kids, our larynx is relatively
small and our vocal cords are relatively thin.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.910
Think of guitar strings, the smaller and thinner
the string, the higher the pitch.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.780
As boys go through puberty, the increasing
amounts of testosterone leads to a lengthening

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.540
of the cartilage of the larynx and a thickening
of the vocal folds.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.110
This lengthening and thickening deepens the
tone in their voices, similar to the effect

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.570
of lengthening and thickening a guitar string.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.860
Along with the “guitar strings” of the
voice box getting bigger, there are also other

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.180
features affecting the sound of one’s voice
that are changing.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.140
For instance, things like the nose, back of
the throat (hypopharnyx), sinuses and facial

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.720
bones getting bigger will affect the ultimate
sound of the voice.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.310
These bigger features create more space in
your facial area, giving your vocal sounds

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.480
more room to resonate.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.049
The changes to the voice box generally take
place gradually over a period of time.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.659
Sometimes, however, when there is a dramatic
period of change, the body has not “grown

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.670
into” its newly sized cords and vocal mechanism
and has trouble adjusting, in terms of being

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.300
able to make steady sounds.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.970
So the sudden and differing growth rates of
everything involved in making sounds causes

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.200
the brain to sometimes have a hard time controlling
the voice mechanism to maintain a steady vibrating

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200
resonance.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.261
As a result of this, poor little Billy must
endure his voice cracking from time to time

00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:33.849
while his brain adjusts to the quick changes
his body is going through.
