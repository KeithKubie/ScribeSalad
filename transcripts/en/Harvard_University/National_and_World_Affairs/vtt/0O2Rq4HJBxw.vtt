Funding for this program provided by

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.850
Additional funding provided by

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.290
last time we argued about

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.400
the case of the Queen verses Dudley and Stephens

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.970
the lifeboat case, the case of cannibalism
at sea

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.420
and with the arguments about

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.369
the lifeboat

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:53.750
in mind the arguments for and against 
what Dudley and Stephens did in mind,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.890
let's turn back to the

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.480
philosophy

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.060
the utilitarian philosophy of Jeremy Bentham

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.130
Bentham was born in England in 1748,
at the age of twelve

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.740
he went to Oxford, at fifteen he went to law
school

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.060
he was admitted to the bar at age nineteen 
but he never practiced law,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.470
instead he devoted his life

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.920
to jurisprudence and moral

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.170
philosophy.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.690
last time we began to consider Bentham's version
of utilitarianism

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.810
the main idea

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.870
is simply stated and it's this,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.750
the highest principle of morality

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.909
whether personal or political morality

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.260
is

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.520
to maximize

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.390
the general welfare

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.560
or the collective happiness

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.070
or the overall balance of pleasure over
pain

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.210
in a phrase

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.210
maximize

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.420
utility

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.750
Bentham arrives at this principle by the following
line of reasoning

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.150
we're all governed by pain and pleasure

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.009
they are our sovereign masters and so any
moral system has to take account of them.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.999
How best to take account?

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.209
By maximizing

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.739
and this leads to the principle

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.449
of the greatest good for the greatest
number

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:23.029
what exactly should we maximize?

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:24.699
Bentham tells us

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:25.510
happiness

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.729
or more precisely

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.479
utility.

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:34.239
Maximizing utility is a principal not only
for individuals but also for communities and

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.569
for legislators

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.749
what after all is a community

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.359
Bentham asks,

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.309
it's the sum of the individuals who comprise it

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:46.780
and that's why

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.370
in deciding the best policy, in deciding what the
law should be, in deciding what's just,

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.029
citizens and legislators should ask themselves
the question if we add up,

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:03.870
all of the benefits of this policy

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.290
and subtract

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.829
all of the costs,

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.669
the right thing to do

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:11.779
is the one

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:13.439
that maximizes

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.699
the balance

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.020
of happiness

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.869
over suffering.

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:24.039
that's what it means to maximize utility

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.989
now, today

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.189
I want to see 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.150
whether you agree or disagree with it,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.650
and it often goes, this utilitarian logic, under
the name of cost-benefit analysis

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.719
which is used by companies

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.219
and by

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.979
governments

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.729
all the time

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.239
and what it involves

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.789
is placing a value usually a dollar value
to stand for utility

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:53.289
on the costs and the benefits

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:56.539
of various proposals.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.879
recently in the Czech Republic

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.370
there was a proposal to increases the excise
tax on smoking

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.089
Philip Morris,

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:08.219
the tobacco company,

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:09.779
does huge business

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.509
in the Czech Republic. They commissioned

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.430
a study of cost-benefit analysis

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.789
of smoking

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.679
in the Czech Republic

00:04:18.679 --> 00:04:20.900
and what their cost benefit

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.830
analysis found

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.550
was

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.660
the government gains

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.349
by

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.779
having Czech citizens smoke. 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:32.360
Now, how do they gain?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.189
It's true that there are negative effects

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:40.000
to the public finance of the Czech government

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.039
because there are increased health care costs
for people who develop smoking-related

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.239
diseases

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:50.369
on the other hand there were positive 
effects

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:51.620
and those were

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.099
added up

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.379
on the other side of the ledger

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:01.960
the positive effects included, for the most
part, various tax revenues that the government

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.240
derives from the sale of cigarette products
but it also included health care savings to

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.530
the government when people die early

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.339
pensions savings, you don't have to pay pensions
for as long,

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:14.889
and also savings

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.679
in housing costs for the elderly

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:24.539
and when all of the costs and benefits were added
up

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:25.969
the Philip Morris

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.870
study found

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.610
that there is a net public finance gain
in the Czech Republic

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.449
of a hundred and forty seven million dollars

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.120
and given the savings

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.479
in housing and health care and pension costs

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.570
the government enjoys the saving of savings
of over twelve hundred dollars

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.569
for each person who dies prematurely due to
smoking.

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.740
cost-benefit analysis

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.729
now, those among you who are defenders utilitarianism 
may think that this is a unfair

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.389
test

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:09.130
Philip Morris was pilloried in the press and
they issued an apology for this heartless

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.990
calculation

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.319
you may say

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:17.119
that what's missing here is something that
the utilitarian can be easily incorporate

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:19.339
mainly

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:23.430
the value to the person and to the families
of those who die

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.599
from lung cancer.

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:29.190
what about the value of life?

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.099
Some cost-benefit analyses incorporate

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.560
a measure

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.809
for the value of life.

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:41.330
One of the most famous of these involved the
Ford Pinto case

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.009
did any of you read about that? this was back
in the 1970's, you remember that

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.210
the Ford Pinto was, a kind of car?

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.029
anybody?

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:55.879
it was a small car, subcompact car,
very popular

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.059
but it had one

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:01.959
problem which is the fuel tank was at the
back of the car

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:07.960
and in rear collisions the fuel tank exploded

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.210
and some people were killed

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.349
and some severely injured.

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:18.999
victims of these injuries took Ford to court
to sue

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:21.669
and in the court case it turned out

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:24.030
that Ford had long

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.249
since known

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:27.719
about the vulnerable fuel tank

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:33.599
and had done a cost-benefit analysis to determine
whether it would be worth it

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:36.300
to put in a special shield

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.490
that would protect the fuel tank and prevent it
from exploding.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.979
They did a cost benefit analysis

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:46.319
the cost per part

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.239
to increase the safety

00:07:48.239 --> 00:07:50.299
of the Pinto,

00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:55.689
they calculated at eleven dollars per part

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:57.189
and here's,

00:07:57.189 --> 00:08:00.609
this was the cost benefit analysis that emerged

00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:03.089
in the trial,

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:05.960
eleven dollars per part

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.999
at 12.5 million cars and trucks

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:13.559
came to a total cost of 

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.370
137 million dollars to improve the safety

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.789
but then they calculated

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:20.139
the benefits

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:23.300
of spending all this money on a  safer car

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.800
and they counted 180 deaths

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.749
and they assigned a dollar value

00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:30.449
200 thousand dollars

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:32.490
per death

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.250
180 injuries

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.490
67 thousand

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.910
and then the cost to repair

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:43.290
the replacement cost for two thousand
vehicles that would be destroyed without the

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.030
safety device

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.060
700 dollars per vehicle,

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.390
so the benefits

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.930
turned out to be only 49.5 million,

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.270
and so they

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.330
didn't install

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.140
the device

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.840
needless to say

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.740
when this memo

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:09.160
of the Ford Motor Company's cost-benefit analysis came
out in the trial

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.250
it appalled the jurors

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.950
who awarded a huge settlement

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:21.810
is this a counter example to the utilitarian
idea of calculating

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.040
because Ford included a

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.320
measure of the value life.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.770
Now who here wants to defend

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.240
cost-benefit analysis from

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.320
this apparent counter example

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.720
who has a defense?

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.590
or do you think it's completely destroys

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:47.410
the whole utilitarian calculus?

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.760
I think that

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.210
once again they've made the same mistake the previous case
did that they've assigned a dollar value

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.570
to human life and once again they failed to take into
account things like

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.580
suffering and emotional losses of families, I mean families
lost earnings

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.980
but they also lost a loved one and that

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.820
is more value than 200 thousand dollars.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.170
Good, and wait wait wait, what's you're name?

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.480
Julie Roto.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.400
so if two hundred thousand, Julie, is too

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.660
too low a figure because it doesn't include
the loss of a loved one,

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.660
and the loss of those years of life,

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.980
what would be, what do you think

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.290
would be a more accurate number?

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:32.430
I don't believe I could give a number I think
that this sort of analysis shouldn't be applied to

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.560
issues of human life.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.200
I think it can't be used monetarily

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.270
so they didn't just put to low a number,

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:44.510
Julie says, they were wrong to try to
put any number at all.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:49.540
all right let's hear someone who

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.860
you have to adjust for inflation

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.130
all right

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.050
fair enough

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.660
so what would the number of being now?

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.640
this is was thirty five years ago

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.330
two million dollars

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.030
you would put two million

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.080
and what's your name

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.410
Voicheck

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.330
Voicheck says we have to allow for inflation

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.640
we should be more generous

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:25.170
then would you be satisfied that this is the
right way of thinking about the question?

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.310
I guess unfortunately

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.590
it is for

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.980
there's needs to be of number put somewhere

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.330
I'm not sure what number would be but I do
agree that there could possibly

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.490
be a number put

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.060
on a human life.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.440
all right so

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.420
Voicheck says

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.280
and here he disagrees with

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:46.649
Julie

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:49.750
Julie says we can't put a number of human
life

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.670
for the purpose of a cost-benefit analysis,
Voicheck says we have to

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:59.870
because we have to make decisions somehow

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:04.750
what do other people think about this?
Is there anyone prepared to defend cost-benefit

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.270
analysis here

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.810
as accurate, as desirable?

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:16.000
I think that if ford and other car companies didn't use
cost-benefit analysis they'd eventually go out

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.949
of business because they wouldn't be able
to be profitable

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:23.139
and millions of people wouldn't be able to use
their cars to get to jobs, to put food on the table

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:27.939
to feed their children so I think that if cost-benefit
analysis isn't employed

00:12:27.939 --> 00:12:29.700
the greater good

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.870
is sacrificed

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.810
in this case. Alright let me ask, what's your name?

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.600
Raul. Raul.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.760
there was recently a study done about cell
phone use by drivers, when people are driving

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.090
a car,

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:47.080
and there's a debate about whether that should be
banned

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.660
and 

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.690
the figure was that some

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.990
two thousand people die

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.280
as a result of accidents

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.240
each year

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.120
using cell phones

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:07.860
and yet the cost benefit analysis which was done by
the center for risk analysis at Harvard

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.520
found that if you look at the benefits

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.560
of the cell phone use

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.090
and you put some

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:19.050
value on the life, it comes out about
the same

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.290
because of the enormous economic benefit
of enabling people to take advantage

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.370
of their time, not waste time, be able to make deals
and talk to friends and so on

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.370
while they're driving

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.060
doesn't that suggest that

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.620
it's a mistake to try to put monetary figures
on questions

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.590
of human life?

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.330
well I think that if

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.780
the great majority of people

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:47.570
tried to derive maximum utility out of a service
like using cell phones and the convenience that cell phones

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:47.989
provide

00:13:47.989 --> 00:13:50.400
that sacrifice is necessary

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.160
for

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.230
satisfaction to occur.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:59.200
You're an outright utilitarian. In, yes okay.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.820
all right then, one last question Raul

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.810
and I put this to Voicheck,

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.829
what dollar figure should be put

00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:12.870
on human life to decide whether to ban the
use of cell phones

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.640
well I don't want to 

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.200
arbitrarily

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.140
calculate a figure, I mean right now

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.370
I think that

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.610
you want to take it under advisement.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:24.790
yeah I'll take it under advisement.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.690
but what roughly speaking would it be? you've
got 23 hundred deaths

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.400
you've got to assign a  dollar value to know
whether you want to prevent those deaths by

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.070
banning the use of cell phones in cars

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.900
so what would you're hunch be?

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.350
how much?

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:40.799
million

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:42.280
two million

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.410
two million was Voitech's figure

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.120
is that about right? maybe a million.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.500
a million.?!

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:55.110
Alright that's good,  thank you

00:14:55.110 --> 00:15:00.440
So these are some of the controversies that arise
these days from cost-benefit analysis especially

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.859
those that involve

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:06.770
placing a dollar value on everything to be
added up.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.840
well now I want to turn

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:15.110
to your objections, to your objections not necessarily
to cost benefit analysis specifically,

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.400
because that's just one version of the

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.960
utilitarian logic in practice today,

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.830
but to the theory as a whole, to the idea

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.000
that the right thing to do,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.710
the just basis for policy and law,

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.559
is to maximize

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:39.750
utility.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.590
How many disagree

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.359
with the utilitarian

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:44.330
approach

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.390
to law

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.480
and to the common good?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.230
How many bring with it?

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:55.200
so more agree than disagree.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.560
so let's hear from the critics

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.209
my main issue with it is that I feel like

00:16:02.209 --> 00:16:06.280
you can't say that just because someone's
in the minority

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:11.650
what they want and need is less valuable than
someone who's in the majority

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.190
so I guess I have an issue with the idea that

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.099
the greatest good for the greatest number

00:16:16.099 --> 00:16:18.070
is okay because

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.040
there is still what about people who are in 

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.720
the lesser number, like it's not fair to them
they didn't have a say in where they wanted

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.840
to be.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.880
alright now that's an interesting objection, you're
worried about

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.460
the effect on minority. yes.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.940
what's your name by the way. Anna.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:39.819
alright who has an answer to Anna's worry about
the effect on the minority

00:16:39.819 --> 00:16:41.690
What do you say to Anna?

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:42.540
she said that

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.490
the minorities value less, I don't think that's
the case because individually the minorities

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:51.339
value is just the same as the individual in the majority
it's just that

00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:54.520
the numbers outweigh the 

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.670
minority

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.919
and I mean at a certain point you have to make a
decision

00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:01.510
and I'm sorry for the minority but

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.640
sometimes

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.670
it's for the general

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:08.840
for the greater good. For the greater good, Anna what do you
say? what's your name? Youngda.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.840
What do you say to Youngda?

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.589
Youngda says you just have to add up people's
preferences

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:17.699
and those in the minority do have their preferences
weighed.

00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:22.000
can you give an example of the kind of thing
you're worried about when you say you're worried

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.880
about utilitarianism violating

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.970
the concern or respect due the minority?

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.730
can you give an example.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:35.179
so well with any of the cases that we've talked
about, like with the shipwreck one,

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.450
I think that

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.700
the boy who was eaten

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:39.980
still had

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.560
just as much of a right to live as the other people
and 

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.710
just because

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.980
he was the

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.610
minority in that case the one who

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.460
maybe had less of a chance to keep living

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.870
that doesn't mean

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.450
that the others automatically have a right
to eat him

00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.680
just because

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.849
it would give a greater amount of people

00:18:01.849 --> 00:18:03.290
the chance to live.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.740
so there may be a certain rights

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.850
that the minority

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:12.550
members have that the individual has that
shouldn't be traded off

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.400
for the sake of

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.520
utility?

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.210
yes Anna?

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.990
Now this would be a test for you,

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.550
back in ancient Rome

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:29.510
they threw Christians to the lions in the
coliseum for sport

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:33.890
if you think how the utilitarian calculus
would go 

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:38.770
yes, the Christian thrown to the lion suffers enormous
excruciating pain,

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:45.770
but look at the collective ecstasy of the Romans.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.580
Youngda. Well

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.890
in that time

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.250
I don't think

00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:01.710
in the modern-day of time to value the, um, to given 
a number to the happiness given to the people watching

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.900
I don't think

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.300
any

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.490
policy maker would say

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.390
the pain of one person, the suffering of one person is
much much,

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.680
in comparison to the happiness gained

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:20.460
no but you have to admit that if there were
enough Romans delirious with happiness,

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:25.220
it would outweigh even the most excruciating
pain of a handful of

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.600
Christians thrown to the lion.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.570
so we really have here two different objections
to utilitarianism

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.030
one has to do

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.850
with whether utilitarianism

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.559
adequately respects

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:40.740
individual rights

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.500
or minority rights

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.150
and the other has to do

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.940
with the whole idea

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.980
of aggregating

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:49.900
utility

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.610
for preferences

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.070
or values

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.470
is it possible to aggregate all values

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.050
to translate them

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.360
into dollar terms?

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.480
there was

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.000
in the  1930's

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.190
a psychologist

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.840
who tried

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.370
to address

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:15.850
the second question. He tried to prove

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.530
what utilitarianism assumes,

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.040
that it is possible

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.230
to translate

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.309
all goods, all values, all human concerns

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:28.909
into a single uniform measure

00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:30.230
and he did this

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.660
by conducting a survey

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:37.610
of the young recipients of relief, this was
in the 1930's

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:42.000
and he asked them, he gave them a list of
unpleasant experiences

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.360
and he asked them how much would you have to
be paid to undergo

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.900
the following experiences and he kept track

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.040
for example

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:57.240
how much would you have to be paid to have
one upper front tooth pulled out

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:04.240
or how much would you have to be paid to have one little
one tow cut off?

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:11.650
or eat a live earth worm, six inches long

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:18.650
or to live the rest of your life on a farm in
Kansas

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:24.480
or to choke a stray cat to death with your bare hands

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.140
now what do you suppose

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:32.900
what do you suppose was the most expensive
item on that list

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:39.750
Kansas?

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.840
You're right it was Kansas

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.059
for a Kansas

00:21:46.059 --> 00:21:47.619
people said they'd have to pay them

00:21:47.619 --> 00:21:51.980
they have to be paid three hundred
thousand dollars

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.800
what do you think

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.140
what do you think was the next most expensive?

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.010
not the cat

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.190
not the tooth

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.250
not the toe

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:16.580
the worm!

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.600
people said you'd have to pay them a hundred
thousand dollars

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.420
to eat the worm

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.010
what do you think was the least expensive
item?

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.010
not the cat

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.300
the tooth

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.990
during the depression people were willing
to have their tooth pulled 

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.600
for only forty five hundred dollars

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.670
now

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.010
here's what Thorndike

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:48.460
concluded from his study

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.650
any want or satisfaction which exists, exists

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.600
in some amount and is therefore measurable

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.950
the life of a dog

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.010
or a cat

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.430
or a chicken consists

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:00.979
of appetites

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:01.880
cravings

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.290
desires and their gratifications

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.750
so does the life

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.940
of human beings

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.409
though the appetites and desires

00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:12.450
are more complicated

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.330
but what about

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.990
Thorndike's study?

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.870
does it support

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.210
Bentham's idea

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.130
that all

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:28.390
goods all values can be captured according
to a single uniform measure of value

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:34.289
or does the preposterous character of those
different items on the list

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:37.220
suggest the opposite conclusion

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.290
that may be whether we're talking about life

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.120
or Kansas

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.180
or the worm

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.440
maybe

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.810
the things we value

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.400
and cherish

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.350
can't be captured

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.280
according to a single uniform measure of value

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.130
and if they can't

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.910
what are the consequences

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.740
for the utilitarian theory

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.180
of morality

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:09.180
that's a question we'll continue with next
time

00:24:13.179 --> 00:24:15.530
alright now let's take the other

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.680
part of the poll

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.309
which is the

00:24:19.309 --> 00:24:21.470
the highest

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.410
experience or pleasure?

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.659
how many say 

00:24:25.659 --> 00:24:31.720
Shakespeare

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:38.120
how many say fear Factor

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.760
no you can't be serious

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:46.160
really?

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.530
last time

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:53.510
last time we began to consider some objections

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.570
to Jeremy Bentham's version

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.790
of utilitarianism

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.950
people raised two objections in the discussion

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.380
we had

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.600
the first

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.710
was the objection, the claim

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.760
that utilitarianism,

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.970
by concerning itself

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:20.110
with the greatest good for the greatest number

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.120
fails adequately to respect

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.480
individual rights.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.880
today we have debates

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.990
about torture

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.610
and terrorism

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.140
suppose

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:41.350
a suspected terrorists was apprehended
on September tenth

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.190
and you had reason to believe

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.490
that the suspect

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:51.230
had crucial information about an impending
terrorist attack that would kill over three thousand

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.200
people

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.690
and you couldn't extract the information

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.670
would it be just

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.440
to torture

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.070
the suspect

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.060
to get the information

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.550
or

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.770
do you say no

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:14.550
there is a categorical moral duty of 
respect for individual rights

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.900
in a way we're back to the questions we started
with t

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:23.910
about trolley cars and organ transplants so that's
the first issue

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:29.250
and you remember we considered some examples of
cost-benefit analysis

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:33.870
but a lot of people were unhappy with cost-benefit
analysis

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:39.970
when it came to placing a dollar value on
human life

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.290
and so that led us to the

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.500
second objection,

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.810
it questioned whether it's possible to translate
all values

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.880
into a single uniform measure of value

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.580
it asks in other words whether all values
are commensurable

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.080
let me give you one other

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.299
example

00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:07.240
of an experience, this actually is a true
story, it comes from personal experience

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:12.900
that raises a question at least about whether
all values can be translated without

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.060
loss

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:20.159
into utilitarian terms

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:22.390
some years ago

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:28.080
when I was a graduate student I was at Oxford
in England and they had men’s and women's

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.800
colleges they weren't yet mixed

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.429
and the women's colleges had rules

00:27:31.429 --> 00:27:33.590
against

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:37.470
overnight male guests

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.080
by the nineteen seventies these

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.030
rules were rarely enforced and easily violated,

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:51.030
or so I was told,

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.549
by the late nineteen seventies when I was there,
pressure grew to relax these rules and it became

00:27:56.549 --> 00:28:01.100
the subject of debate among the faculty at St. Anne's College

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.840
which was one of these all women colleges

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.630
the older women on the faculty

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:10.720
we're traditionalists they were opposed to
change

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.820
on conventional moral grounds

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.320
but times had changed

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.110
and they were embarrassed

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.000
to give the true grounds of their objection

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.809
and so the translated their arguments

00:28:22.809 --> 00:28:26.120
into utilitarian terms

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.420
if men stay overnight,

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.680
they argued, the costs to the college will increase.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.490
how you might wonder

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:39.429
well they'll want to take baths, and that
will use up hot water they said

00:28:39.429 --> 00:28:40.779
furthermore they argued

00:28:40.779 --> 00:28:46.780
we'll have to replace the mattresses more often

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.380
the reformers

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.250
met these arguments by adopting the following
compromise

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.280
each woman

00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:00.280
could have a maximum of three overnight male
guest each week

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:05.940
they didn't say whether it had to be the same
one, or three different

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.800
provided

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.240
and this is the compromise provided

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.400
the guest

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.340
paid fifty pence to defray the cost to the college

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.180
the next day

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:23.080
the national headline in the national newspaper
read St. Anne's girls, fifty pence a night

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.040
another

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:31.730
illustration

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.730
of the difficulty of translating

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.150
all values

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.930
in this case a certain idea of virtue

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:44.200
into utilitarian terms

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.980
so that's all to illustrate

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.830
the second objection

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:52.680
to utilitarianism, at least the
part of that objection

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.780
that questions rather

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.620
the utilitarianism

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.809
is right to assume

00:29:58.809 --> 00:30:00.670
that we can

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.420
assume the uniformity of

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:08.230
value, the commensurability of values
and translate all moral considerations

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.740
into

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.280
dollars

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.220
or money.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.510
But there is a second

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:19.690
aspect to this worry about aggregating values
and preferences

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.990
why should we

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:23.120
weigh 

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.260
all preferences

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.390
that people have

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:32.650
without assessing whether they're good preferences
or bad preferences

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.120
shouldn't we distinguish

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.010
between

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.590
higher

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.260
pleasures

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.760
and lower pleasures.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.250
Now, part of the appeal of 

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:49.380
not making any qualitative distinctions about
the worth of people's preferences, part of the

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.820
appeal

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:55.250
is that it is non-judgmental and egalitarian

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:58.110
the Benthamite utilitarian says

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.200
everybody's preferences count

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.890
and they count regardless of what people want

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:08.580
regardless of what makes it different people

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.530
happy. For Bentham,

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.250
all that matters

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.960
you'll remember

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.010
are the intensity and the duration

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.270
of a pleasure or pain

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:24.040
the so-called higher pleasures or nobler
virtues are simply those, according to Bentham

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.420
that produce

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.419
stronger,

00:31:26.419 --> 00:31:29.380
longer, pleasure

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.790
yet a famous phrase to express this idea

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.770
the quantity of pleasure being equal

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.059
pushpin

00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:39.519
is as good as poetry.

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:41.789
What was pushpin?

00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:46.929
It was some kind of a child's game like to tidily winks
pushpin is as good as poetry

00:31:46.929 --> 00:31:48.850
Bentham said

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.509
and lying behind this idea

00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:51.510
I think

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:52.779
is the claim

00:31:52.779 --> 00:31:54.090
the intuition

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:55.870
that it's a presumption

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.950
to judge

00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:58.979
whose pleasures

00:31:58.979 --> 00:32:00.670
are intrinsically higher

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.850
or worthier or better

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:07.010
and there is something attractive in this

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.770
refusal to judge, after all some people like

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.790
Mozart, others

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:12.520
Madonna

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.090
some people like ballet

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.390
others

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:17.360
bowling,

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.440
who's to say

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.140
a Benthamite might argue, who's to say which 
of these pleasures

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.260
whose pleasures

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.460
are higher

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.350
worthier

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.500
nobler

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.570
than others?

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:35.980
But, is that right?

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.310
this refusal to make qualitative distinctions

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.180
can we

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.170
altogether dispense with the idea

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:49.010
that certain things we take pleasure in are

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.660
better or worthier

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.890
than others

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:58.640
think back to the case of the Romans in the coliseum,
one thing that troubled people about that

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:58.960
practice

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.170
is that it seemed to violate the rights

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:04.490
of the Christian

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.250
another way of objecting to what's going
on there

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.720
is that the pleasure that the Romans
take

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.480
in this bloody spectacle

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.850
should that pleasure

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:16.500
which is a base,

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.130
kind of corrupt

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.730
degrading pleasure, should that even

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:26.960
be valorized or weighed in deciding what
the

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:33.770
the general welfare is?

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:38.760
so here are the objections to Bentham's
utilitarianism

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.800
and now we turn to someone who tried to

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.890
respond to those objections,

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.820
a later day utilitarian

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.120
John Stuart Mill

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.780
so what we need to

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.510
examine now

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:58.809
is whether John Stuart Mill had a convincing
reply

00:33:58.809 --> 00:34:05.090
to these objections to utilitarianism.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.750
John Stuart Mill

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.760
was born in 1806

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.369
his father James  Mill

00:34:11.369 --> 00:34:14.079
was a disciple of Bentham’s

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:17.389
and James Mills set about giving his son

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:20.329
John Stuart Mill a model education

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:22.429
he was a child prodigy

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:23.569
John Stuart Mill

00:34:23.569 --> 00:34:27.859
the knew Latin, sorry, Greek at the age of three, 
Latin at eight

00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:29.139
and at age ten

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:33.659
he wrote a history of Roman law.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:35.649
At age twenty

00:34:35.649 --> 00:34:39.129
he had a nervous breakdown

00:34:39.129 --> 00:34:43.549
this left him in a depression for five years

00:34:43.549 --> 00:34:46.800
but at age twenty five what helped lift him
out of this depression

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.949
is that he met Harriet Taylor

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.659
she in no doubt married him, they lived happily ever after

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.849
and it was under her

00:34:54.849 --> 00:34:56.659
influence

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:59.859
the John Stuart Mill try to humanize

00:34:59.859 --> 00:35:01.720
utilitarianism

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.279
what Mill tried to do was to see

00:35:05.279 --> 00:35:07.710
whether the utilitarian calculus could be

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.029
enlarged

00:35:09.029 --> 00:35:11.200
and modified

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.759
to accommodate

00:35:13.759 --> 00:35:17.429
humanitarian concerns

00:35:17.429 --> 00:35:20.390
like the concern to respect individual rights

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:24.599
and also to address the distinction between
higher and lower

00:35:24.599 --> 00:35:26.439
pleasures.

00:35:26.439 --> 00:35:30.369
In 1859 Mill wrote a famous book
on liberty

00:35:30.369 --> 00:35:35.399
the main point of which was the importance
of defending individual rights and minority

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:36.380
rights

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.329
and in 1861

00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:40.339
toward the end of his life

00:35:40.339 --> 00:35:43.130
he wrote the book we read is part of this course

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:45.099
Utilitarianism.

00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:46.599
It makes it clear

00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:49.739
that utility is the only standard of morality

00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:50.769
in his view

00:35:50.769 --> 00:35:52.550
so he's not challenging

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:53.949
Bentham's premise,

00:35:53.949 --> 00:35:55.279
he's affirming it.

00:35:55.279 --> 00:35:58.829
he says very explicitly the sole evidence,

00:35:58.829 --> 00:36:04.659
it is possible to produce that anything is
desirable is that people actually do

00:36:04.659 --> 00:36:05.929
desire it.

00:36:05.929 --> 00:36:11.679
so he stays with the idea that our de facto
actual empirical desires are the only

00:36:11.679 --> 00:36:12.979
basis

00:36:12.979 --> 00:36:15.619
for moral judgment.

00:36:15.619 --> 00:36:17.549
but then

00:36:17.549 --> 00:36:18.979
page eight

00:36:18.979 --> 00:36:24.879
also in chapter two, he argues that it is possible
for a utilitarian to distinguish

00:36:24.879 --> 00:36:26.320
higher from lower

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.970
pleasures.

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:30.519
now, those of you who've read

00:36:30.519 --> 00:36:32.079
Mill already

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:33.329
how

00:36:33.329 --> 00:36:36.559
according to him is it possible to draw that
distinction?

00:36:36.559 --> 00:36:40.079
How can a utilitarian

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:42.819
distinguish qualitatively higher pleasures

00:36:42.819 --> 00:36:43.540
from

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:48.859
lesser ones, base ones, unworthy ones?

00:36:48.859 --> 00:36:50.519
If you tried both of them

00:36:50.519 --> 00:36:55.309
and you'll prefer the higher one naturally
always

00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:59.819
that's great, that's right. What's your name? John.

00:36:59.819 --> 00:37:01.759
so as John points out

00:37:01.759 --> 00:37:05.019
Mill says here's the test,

00:37:05.019 --> 00:37:07.869
since we can't step outside

00:37:07.869 --> 00:37:10.490
actual desires, actual preferences

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.650
that would

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.670
violate utilitarian premises,

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.819
the only test

00:37:16.819 --> 00:37:17.600
of whether

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.769
a pleasure is higher

00:37:19.769 --> 00:37:26.469
or lower is whether someone who has experienced
both

00:37:26.469 --> 00:37:28.109
would prefer it.

00:37:28.109 --> 00:37:29.369
And here,

00:37:29.369 --> 00:37:31.259
in chapter two

00:37:31.259 --> 00:37:32.900
we see the passage

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:37.199
where Mill makes the point that John just described

00:37:37.199 --> 00:37:42.680
of two pleasures, if there be one to which all
are almost all who have experience

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.219
of both give a decided preference,

00:37:46.219 --> 00:37:51.859
irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to
prefer it, in other words no outside, no independent

00:37:51.859 --> 00:37:53.390
standard,

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:57.529
then that is the more desirable pleasure.

00:37:57.529 --> 00:37:59.829
what do people think about that argument.

00:37:59.829 --> 00:38:01.549
does that

00:38:01.549 --> 00:38:03.489
does it succeeded?

00:38:03.489 --> 00:38:06.380
how many think that it does succeed?

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:11.489
of arguing within utilitarian terms for a
distinction between higher and lower pleasures.

00:38:11.489 --> 00:38:12.390
how many

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:17.789
think it doesn't succeed?

00:38:17.789 --> 00:38:20.829
I want to hear your reasons.

00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:22.249
but before

00:38:22.249 --> 00:38:23.849
we give the reasons

00:38:23.849 --> 00:38:26.329
let's do an experiment

00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:28.719
of Mills'

00:38:28.719 --> 00:38:31.569
claim.

00:38:31.569 --> 00:38:35.199
In order to do this experiment

00:38:35.199 --> 00:38:39.859
we're going to look that three

00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:41.559
short excerpts

00:38:41.559 --> 00:38:44.889
of popular entertainment

00:38:44.889 --> 00:38:48.170
the first one is a Hamlet soliloquy

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:52.939
it'll be followed by two other

00:38:52.939 --> 00:38:55.420
experiences

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.259
see what you think.

00:38:58.259 --> 00:39:02.249
'what a piece of work is a man

00:39:02.249 --> 00:39:05.509
how noble in reason

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:07.579
how infinite in faculties

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:11.439
in form and moving, how express and admirable

00:39:11.439 --> 00:39:14.949
in action how like an angel. In apprehension, how like a god

00:39:14.949 --> 00:39:16.430
the beauty of the world

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.349
the paragon of animals

00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:21.259
and yet, to me

00:39:21.259 --> 00:39:24.689
what is this quintessence of dust?

00:39:24.689 --> 00:39:31.689
man delights not me.

00:39:43.309 --> 00:39:47.749
Imagine a world where your greatest fears become reality

00:39:47.749 --> 00:39:52.609
each show, six contestants from around the country battle
each other in three

00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:59.609
extreme stunts. these stunts are designed to challenge 
these contestants both physically and mentally

00:40:00.419 --> 00:40:02.289
six contestants, three stunts, one winner.

00:40:02.289 --> 00:40:09.289
Fear factor.

00:40:16.449 --> 00:40:22.919
The Simpsons. Well hi diddly-o peddle to the metal o-philes! 
Flanders- since when do you like anything cool.

00:40:22.919 --> 00:40:25.240
well, I don't care for the speed, but I can't get enough of that 
safety gear 

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.729
helmets, roll bars, caution flags. I like the fresh
air

00:40:28.729 --> 00:40:35.499
and looking at the poor people in the infield.

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:41.320
Dang Cletus, why you got to park by my parents. 

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.029
Now hunny, it's my parents too.

00:40:55.759 --> 00:41:00.629
I don't even have to ask which one you like
most

00:41:00.629 --> 00:41:05.109
the Simpsons? How many like the Simpson's most?

00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:10.140
How many Shakespeare?

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.710
What about fear factor?

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:15.959
how many preferred fear factor?

00:41:15.959 --> 00:41:22.369
really?

00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:24.079
people overwhelmingly

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:25.769
like the Simpsons

00:41:25.769 --> 00:41:29.229
better

00:41:29.229 --> 00:41:31.599
than Shakespeare. alright, now let's take the other

00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:33.749
part of the poll

00:41:33.749 --> 00:41:35.799
which is the

00:41:35.799 --> 00:41:37.529
highest

00:41:37.529 --> 00:41:39.409
experience or pleasure?

00:41:39.409 --> 00:41:41.729
how many say

00:41:41.729 --> 00:41:47.789
Shakespeare?

00:41:47.789 --> 00:41:49.960
how many say

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:54.189
fear factor?

00:41:54.189 --> 00:41:59.069
no you can't be serious

00:41:59.069 --> 00:42:01.039
really?

00:42:01.039 --> 00:42:02.709
alright go ahead you can say it.

00:42:02.709 --> 00:42:03.439
I found that one 

00:42:03.439 --> 00:42:04.709
the most entertaining

00:42:04.709 --> 00:42:09.429
I know but which do you think was the worthiest, 
the noblest experience, I know you find it

00:42:09.429 --> 00:42:10.920
the most anything

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.920
if something is good just because it is pleasurable
what is the matter if you have some kind of 

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.209
abstract

00:42:17.209 --> 00:42:21.729
idea of whether it is good by someone else's
sense or not.

00:42:21.729 --> 00:42:25.039
Alright so you come down on the straight Benthamite's side

00:42:25.039 --> 00:42:26.429
whose to judge

00:42:26.429 --> 00:42:29.279
and why should we judge

00:42:29.279 --> 00:42:33.880
apart from just registering and aggregating
de facto preferences, alright fair enough.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.349
what's your name? 

00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:37.329
Nate? okay fair enough

00:42:37.329 --> 00:42:38.219
Alright so

00:42:38.219 --> 00:42:40.919
how many think that the Simpson's is actually

00:42:40.919 --> 00:42:46.259
apart from liking is actually the higher experience

00:42:46.259 --> 00:42:47.420
higher than Shakespeare.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.309
Alright let's see the vote for Shakespeare again

00:42:49.309 --> 00:42:52.869
how many think Shakespeare is higher?

00:42:52.869 --> 00:42:53.869
alright so

00:42:53.869 --> 00:42:55.540
why is it

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:58.999
ideally I'd like to hear from someone is there
someone

00:42:58.999 --> 00:43:02.109
think Shakespeare is highest

00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:02.989
but who preferred

00:43:02.989 --> 00:43:04.060
watching

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.739
the Simpsons

00:43:08.739 --> 00:43:14.160
Like I guess just sitting and watching the Simpsons, it's entertaining
because the make jokes, they make us laugh but

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.839
someone has to tell us that Shakespeare was this great writer
we had to be taught how to read him, how to

00:43:17.839 --> 00:43:20.630
understand him, we had to be taught how to

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.150
take in Rembrandt, how to analyze a painting.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.859
well how do, what's your name? Aneesha. 

00:43:25.859 --> 00:43:27.840
Aneesha, when you say someone

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.259
told you that Shakespeare's better

00:43:31.259 --> 00:43:37.299
are you accepting it on blind faith you voted that
Shakespeare's higher only because the culture

00:43:37.299 --> 00:43:41.529
tells you that our teachers tell you that
or do you

00:43:41.529 --> 00:43:44.049
actually agree with that yourself

00:43:44.049 --> 00:43:48.319
well in the sense that Shakespeare, no, but earlier you made

00:43:48.319 --> 00:43:49.740
an example of Rembrandt

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:54.479
I feel like I would enjoy a reading a comic book
more than I would enjoy a kind of analyzing

00:43:54.479 --> 00:43:58.349
Rembrandt because someone told me it was
great, you know. Right so of some this seems 

00:43:58.349 --> 00:44:01.699
to be, you're suggesting a kind of

00:44:01.699 --> 00:44:05.319
cultural convention and pressure. We're told

00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:12.319
what books, what works of art are great. who else?

00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:19.640
although I enjoyed watching the Simpsons more
in this particular moment in Justice,

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.049
if I were to spend the rest of my life
considering

00:44:23.049 --> 00:44:25.369
the three different

00:44:25.369 --> 00:44:26.869
video clips shown

00:44:26.869 --> 00:44:29.119
I would not want to spend

00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:31.869
that remainder of my life considering

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:33.800
the latter two clips.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.650
I think I would derive more pleasure

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:38.309
from being able to

00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:39.269
branch out in my own mind

00:44:39.269 --> 00:44:40.489
sort of

00:44:40.489 --> 00:44:44.869
considering more deep pleasures, more
deep thoughts.

00:44:44.869 --> 00:44:48.630
and tell me your name

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.630
Joe. 

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:52.559
Joe, so if you had to spend the rest of your life
on 

00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:55.409
on a farm in Kansas with only

00:44:55.409 --> 00:44:57.489
with only Shakespeare

00:44:57.489 --> 00:45:02.079
or the collected episodes of the Simpsons

00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:04.119
you would prefer

00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:06.599
Shakespeare

00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:09.849
what do you conclude from that

00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:12.149
about John Stuart Mill's test

00:45:12.149 --> 00:45:15.079
but the test of a higher pleasure

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:16.359
is whether

00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:18.369
people who have experienced

00:45:18.369 --> 00:45:21.509
both prefer it.

00:45:21.509 --> 00:45:23.880
can I cite another example briefly?

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.130
in biology

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:28.769
in neuro biology last year we were told of a rat who was
tested

00:45:28.769 --> 00:45:31.209
a  particular center in the brain

00:45:31.209 --> 00:45:35.879
where the rat was able to stimulate its
brain and cause itself intense pleasure repeatedly

00:45:35.879 --> 00:45:38.369
the rat did not eat or drink until it died

00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:42.179
so the rat was clearly experiencing intense
pleasure

00:45:42.179 --> 00:45:46.269
now if you asked me right now if I'd rather
experience intense pleasure

00:45:46.269 --> 00:45:47.140
or have

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:52.690
a full lifetime of higher pleasure, I would consider
intense pleasure to be lower pleasure, right 

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:55.799
now enjoy intense pleasure

00:45:55.799 --> 00:46:01.969
yes I would

00:46:01.969 --> 00:46:03.159
but over a lifetime I think

00:46:03.159 --> 00:46:04.360
I would think

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.899
almost a complete majority here would agree

00:46:06.899 --> 00:46:11.630
that they would rather be a human
with higher pleasure that rat

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:13.269
with intense pleasure

00:46:13.269 --> 00:46:14.930
for a momentary period of time

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:15.870
so now

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:18.959
in answer to your question, right, I think

00:46:18.959 --> 00:46:21.349
this proves that, or I won't say proves

00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:24.999
I think the conclusion

00:46:24.999 --> 00:46:28.650
is that Mill's theory that when a majority people are
asked

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.439
what they would rather do,

00:46:31.439 --> 00:46:33.119
they will answer

00:46:33.119 --> 00:46:34.689
that they would rather

00:46:34.689 --> 00:46:39.499
engage in a higher pleasure. So you think that this
supports Mills, that Mills was on to something here

00:46:39.499 --> 00:46:40.739
I do.

00:46:40.739 --> 00:46:42.629
all right is there anyone

00:46:42.629 --> 00:46:46.839
who disagrees with Joe who thinks that
our experiment

00:46:46.839 --> 00:46:48.579
disproves

00:46:48.579 --> 00:46:49.959
Mills'

00:46:49.959 --> 00:46:51.099
test

00:46:51.099 --> 00:46:53.239
shows that that's not an adequate way

00:46:53.239 --> 00:46:57.689
that you can't distinguish higher pleasures within
the utilitarian

00:46:57.689 --> 00:47:02.649
framework.

00:47:05.879 --> 00:47:09.509
If whatever is good is truly just whatever
people prefer it's truly relative and there's

00:47:09.509 --> 00:47:11.519
no objective definition then

00:47:11.519 --> 00:47:14.889
there will be some society where people prefer
Simpsons

00:47:14.889 --> 00:47:15.849
more

00:47:15.849 --> 00:47:21.380
anyone can appreciate the Simpsons, but I think
it does take education to appreciate Shakespeare

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:25.660
Alright, you're saying it takes education to appreciate
higher

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.319
true thing

00:47:27.319 --> 00:47:29.719
Mill's point is

00:47:29.719 --> 00:47:32.890
that the higher pleasures do require

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:35.090
cultivation and appreciation and education

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:37.799
he doesn't dispute that

00:47:37.799 --> 00:47:38.650
but

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.660
once having been cultivated

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.029
and educated

00:47:44.029 --> 00:47:45.509
people will see

00:47:45.509 --> 00:47:48.270
not only see the difference between higher
lower 

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:49.009
pleasures

00:47:49.009 --> 00:47:51.539
but will it actually

00:47:51.539 --> 00:47:52.769
prefer

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:53.970
the higher

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:55.849
to the lower.

00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:59.519
you find this famous passage from John Stuart
Mill-

00:47:59.519 --> 00:48:00.809
it is better

00:48:00.809 --> 00:48:03.869
to be a human being dissatisfied

00:48:03.869 --> 00:48:06.109
then a pig satisfied.

00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:10.539
Better to the Socrates dissatisfied than
a fool satisfied

00:48:10.539 --> 00:48:12.229
and if the fool

00:48:12.229 --> 00:48:13.439
or the pig

00:48:13.439 --> 00:48:15.539
are of a different opinion

00:48:15.539 --> 00:48:18.209
it is because they only know

00:48:18.209 --> 00:48:20.700
their side of the question.

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.339
so here you have

00:48:22.339 --> 00:48:23.159
an attempt

00:48:23.159 --> 00:48:24.609
to distinguish

00:48:24.609 --> 00:48:27.199
higher from lower

00:48:27.199 --> 00:48:28.719
pleasures

00:48:28.719 --> 00:48:33.169
so going to an art museum or being a couch
potato, swilling beer watching television

00:48:33.169 --> 00:48:35.489
at home

00:48:35.489 --> 00:48:37.950
sometimes Mill agrees we might succumb

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:40.839
to the temptation

00:48:40.839 --> 00:48:41.839
to do the latter,

00:48:41.839 --> 00:48:46.309
to be couch potatoes,

00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:47.779
but even when we do that

00:48:47.779 --> 00:48:49.609
out of indolence

00:48:49.609 --> 00:48:50.680
and sloth,

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.200
we know

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.029
that the pleasure we get

00:48:54.029 --> 00:48:55.670
gazing at Rembrandts

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:56.989
in the museum

00:48:56.989 --> 00:49:00.219
is actually higher,

00:49:00.219 --> 00:49:03.190
because we've experienced both.

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:05.699
And is a higher pressure

00:49:05.699 --> 00:49:06.940
gazing at Rembrandts

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.499
because of engages our higher human faculties

00:49:11.499 --> 00:49:13.849
what about Mill's attempt

00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:18.890
to reply to the objection about individual rights?

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.859
In a way he uses the same

00:49:21.859 --> 00:49:25.319
kind of argument

00:49:25.319 --> 00:49:27.859
and this comes out in chapter five

00:49:27.859 --> 00:49:33.369
he says while I dispute the pretensions of any
theory which sets up an imaginary standard

00:49:33.369 --> 00:49:34.889
of justice

00:49:34.889 --> 00:49:39.719
not grounded on utility,

00:49:39.719 --> 00:49:41.389
but still

00:49:41.389 --> 00:49:43.429
he considers

00:49:43.429 --> 00:49:44.599
justice

00:49:44.599 --> 00:49:48.549
grounded on utility to be what he calls the
chief part

00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:52.679
and incomparably the most sacred and binding
part

00:49:52.679 --> 00:49:54.599
of all morality.

00:49:54.599 --> 00:49:57.249
so justice is higher

00:49:57.249 --> 00:50:00.049
individual rights are privileged

00:50:00.049 --> 00:50:01.899
but not for

00:50:01.899 --> 00:50:05.310
reasons that depart from utilitarian assumptions.

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:06.769
Justice is a name

00:50:06.769 --> 00:50:09.069
for certain moral requirements

00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:11.220
which, regarded collectively

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.519
stand higher in the scale of social utility

00:50:14.519 --> 00:50:17.109
and are therefore

00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:19.209
of more

00:50:19.209 --> 00:50:20.679
paramount obligation

00:50:20.679 --> 00:50:23.200
 than any others

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:28.920
so justice is sacred, it's prior, it's privileged,
it isn't something that can easily be traded

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.890
off against lesser things

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:32.239
but the reason

00:50:32.239 --> 00:50:33.619
is ultimately

00:50:33.619 --> 00:50:35.799
Mills Claims

00:50:35.799 --> 00:50:37.929
a utilitarian reason

00:50:37.929 --> 00:50:39.239
once you consider

00:50:39.239 --> 00:50:41.199
the long run interests

00:50:41.199 --> 00:50:43.539
of humankind,

00:50:43.539 --> 00:50:44.670
of all of us,

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:46.329
as progressive

00:50:46.329 --> 00:50:47.699
beings.

00:50:47.699 --> 00:50:51.279
If we do justice and if we respect rights

00:50:51.279 --> 00:50:52.609
society as a whole

00:50:52.609 --> 00:50:55.949
will be better off in the long run.

00:50:55.949 --> 00:50:57.999
Well is that convincing?

00:50:57.999 --> 00:50:59.159
Or

00:50:59.159 --> 00:51:04.549
is Mill actually, without admitting it, stepping
outside

00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:06.219
utilitarian considerations

00:51:06.219 --> 00:51:07.789
in arguing

00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:11.129
for qualitatively higher

00:51:11.129 --> 00:51:12.789
pleasures

00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:14.479
and for sacred

00:51:14.479 --> 00:51:16.949
or specially important

00:51:16.949 --> 00:51:18.479
individual rights?

00:51:18.479 --> 00:51:21.719
we haven't fully answered that question

00:51:21.719 --> 00:51:23.809
because to answer that question

00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:26.259
in the case of rights and justice

00:51:26.259 --> 00:51:28.869
will require that we explore

00:51:28.869 --> 00:51:30.419
other ways,

00:51:30.419 --> 00:51:33.369
non utilitarian ways

00:51:33.369 --> 00:51:35.030
of accounting for the basis

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:36.479
or rights

00:51:36.479 --> 00:51:38.269
and then asking

00:51:38.269 --> 00:51:40.409
whether they succeed

00:51:40.409 --> 00:51:42.949
as for Jeremy Bentham,

00:51:42.949 --> 00:51:44.969
who launched

00:51:44.969 --> 00:51:46.099
utilitarianism

00:51:46.099 --> 00:51:47.419
as a doctrine

00:51:47.419 --> 00:51:49.979
in moral and legal philosophy

00:51:49.979 --> 00:51:53.819
Bentham died in 1832 at the
age of eighty five

00:51:53.819 --> 00:51:57.509
but if you go to London you can visit him
today

00:51:57.509 --> 00:51:58.729
literally.

00:51:58.729 --> 00:52:01.440
he provided in his will

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.390
that his body be preserved,

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:05.489
embalmed and displayed

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:07.739
in the university of London

00:52:07.739 --> 00:52:11.069
where he still presides in a glass case

00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:12.950
with a wax head

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:14.989
dressed in his actual clothing.

00:52:14.989 --> 00:52:17.049
you see before he died,

00:52:17.049 --> 00:52:22.339
Bentham addressed himself to a question consistent
with his philosophy,

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:23.499
of what use

00:52:23.499 --> 00:52:26.839
could a dead man be to the living

00:52:26.839 --> 00:52:30.499
one use, he said, would be to make one's corpse
available

00:52:30.499 --> 00:52:33.519
for the study of anatomy

00:52:33.519 --> 00:52:37.129
in the case of great philosophers, however,

00:52:37.129 --> 00:52:38.159
better yet

00:52:38.159 --> 00:52:44.919
to preserve one's physical presence in order
to inspire future generations of thinkers.

00:52:44.919 --> 00:52:47.619
You want to see what Bentham looks like stuffed?

00:52:47.619 --> 00:52:50.410
Here's what he looks like

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:53.549
There he is

00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:55.459
now, if you look closely

00:52:55.459 --> 00:52:57.459
you'll notice

00:52:57.459 --> 00:52:58.529
that

00:52:58.529 --> 00:53:05.529
the embalming up his actual had was not a
success so they substituted a waxed head

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:10.009
and at the bottom for verisimilitude

00:53:10.009 --> 00:53:13.390
you can actually see his actual had

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:14.979
on a plate

00:53:16.529 --> 00:53:17.809
you see it?

00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:22.599
right there

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:25.709
so, what's the moral of the story?

00:53:25.709 --> 00:53:29.499
the moral of the story

00:53:29.499 --> 00:53:33.699
by the way they bring him out during meetings
of the board at university college London

00:53:33.699 --> 00:53:40.659
and the minutes record him as present but
not voting.

00:53:40.659 --> 00:53:42.539
here is a philosopher

00:53:42.539 --> 00:53:45.109
in life and in death

00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:46.769
who adhered

00:53:46.769 --> 00:53:48.400
to the principles

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:55.400
of his philosophy. we'll continue with rights next time.
