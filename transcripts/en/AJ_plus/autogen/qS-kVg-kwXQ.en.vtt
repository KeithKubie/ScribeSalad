00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.430
 are two very important beaches for 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.060
 sea â€‹â€‹turtle reproduction because 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.149
 are two countries still very shocking 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.560
 very natural yet without large 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.560
 human interference 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.070
 because we would like to allow 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.380
 that they had the first contact with 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.890
 clean water and not with water already mixed 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.890
 with the mud 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.150
 here behind me you are seeing a 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.480
 example of the kind of rock story 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.230
 accepted giant turtle is an animal 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.270
 which is very threatened with extinction is 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.160
 a very great concern of ours in 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.260
 relation to this species due to this 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.260
 disaster happened here on the sweet river
