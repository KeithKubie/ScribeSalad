and forth between some events in the

and forth between some events in the
region um and the ways in which people

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
region um and the ways in which people
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.419
region um and the ways in which people
analyze them and one of the things I

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429
analyze them and one of the things I
 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.789
analyze them and one of the things I
think that's important in talking about

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
think that's important in talking about
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.279
think that's important in talking about
this is to understand that what was

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289
this is to understand that what was
 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:20.690
this is to understand that what was
going on in the region what people

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
going on in the region what people
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.520
going on in the region what people
worked on didn't necessarily correlate

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
worked on didn't necessarily correlate
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.149
worked on didn't necessarily correlate
all that well and so what people chose

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
all that well and so what people chose
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.580
all that well and so what people chose
to focus on the development of the study

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
to focus on the development of the study
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.529
to focus on the development of the study
of Eastern Europe had a life of its own

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539

not surprisingly as well as being rooted
in in various things going on we just

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:37.499
in in various things going on we just
 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:41.739
in in various things going on we just
say a few words briefly about the the

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749
say a few words briefly about the the
 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.630
say a few words briefly about the the
interwar period because I think that

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
interwar period because I think that
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.450
interwar period because I think that
what was interesting about the the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
what was interesting about the the
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.039
what was interesting about the the
interwar period in Eastern European

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
interwar period in Eastern European
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.480

studies are a couple of things I wanted

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
studies are a couple of things I wanted
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.550
studies are a couple of things I wanted
to emphasize one of course is that that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
to emphasize one of course is that that
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.069
to emphasize one of course is that that
is the beginning of the theme that we

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
is the beginning of the theme that we
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.989
is the beginning of the theme that we
see over and over again in Eastern and

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999
see over and over again in Eastern and
 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.059
see over and over again in Eastern and
Central Europe that is to say the

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069
Central Europe that is to say the
 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.910
Central Europe that is to say the
simultaneous construction of state's new

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
simultaneous construction of state's new
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.770
simultaneous construction of state's new
economies and new regimes

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
economies and new regimes
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.330
economies and new regimes
it's also the beginning of we can do

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340
it's also the beginning of we can do
 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.969
it's also the beginning of we can do
this from above in effect we can

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979
this from above in effect we can
 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.880
this from above in effect we can
engineer the transformation of this

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890
engineer the transformation of this
 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.390
engineer the transformation of this
region it also brings open the theme of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400
region it also brings open the theme of
 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.979
region it also brings open the theme of

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.290
uneasy the old-fashioned term here did
not have any control over what happened

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300

had excuse me enormous impact on on what
 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.350
had excuse me enormous impact on on what
happened in the region and so the work

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360
happened in the region and so the work
 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.360
happened in the region and so the work
on the region I think and it was done

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370
on the region I think and it was done
 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.240
on the region I think and it was done
more by British scholars than by

over the ideological map there was some
 

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.590
over the ideological map there was some
degree of that also in soviet studies

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600
degree of that also in soviet studies
 

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.300

and so it's an if there was a very clear
 

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.370
and so it's an if there was a very clear
distinction um and and if you think back

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:44.380
distinction um and and if you think back
 

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.070
distinction um and and if you think back
on it it's hard to come up with many

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.080
on it it's hard to come up with many

regimes I don't know if any of you

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.030
regimes I don't know if any of you
 

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.520
regimes I don't know if any of you
familiar with that but this is a new

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:46.530
familiar with that but this is a new
 

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.490
familiar with that but this is a new
kind of regime that has popped up during

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:49.500
kind of regime that has popped up during
 

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.080
kind of regime that has popped up during
the third wave of democratization all

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:51.090
the third wave of democratization all
 

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.270
the third wave of democratization all
the reality by our Germany was a hybrid

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:53.280
the reality by our Germany was a hybrid
 

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.370
the reality by our Germany was a hybrid
machine but anyway it's only been

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380
machine but anyway it's only been
 

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.920
machine but anyway it's only been
written about over the past 20 years and

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:57.930
written about over the past 20 years and
 

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.690
written about over the past 20 years and
these are regimes that are these weird

00:28:59.690 --> 00:28:59.700
these are regimes that are these weird
 

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.460
these are regimes that are these weird
combinations of democracy and

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:01.470
combinations of democracy and
 

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.890
combinations of democracy and
dictatorship in other words they don't

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:03.900
dictatorship in other words they don't
 

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.210
dictatorship in other words they don't
go for one of the other but they

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220
go for one of the other but they
 

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.060
go for one of the other but they
straddle what does that mean in practice

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:08.070
straddle what does that mean in practice
 

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.590
straddle what does that mean in practice
well they often have authoritarian

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600
well they often have authoritarian
 

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.930
well they often have authoritarian
leaders they often don't have fully rule

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940
leaders they often don't have fully rule
 

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.960
leaders they often don't have fully rule
of law they often have competitive

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:14.970
of law they often have competitive
 

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.640
of law they often have competitive
elections but it's not on an even

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:16.650
elections but it's not on an even
 

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.500
elections but it's not on an even
playing field so that some sets of

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:18.510
playing field so that some sets of
 

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.390
playing field so that some sets of
players are favored over other sets of

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:20.400
players are favored over other sets of
 

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.170
players are favored over other sets of
players so you have this big gray zone

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:24.180
players so you have this big gray zone
 

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.150
players so you have this big gray zone
if you imagine democracy and

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:26.160
if you imagine democracy and
 

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.600
if you imagine democracy and
dictatorship you have this big gray zone

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:28.610
dictatorship you have this big gray zone
 

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.090
dictatorship you have this big gray zone

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:56.670
naughty yeah so so what happened when
 

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.430
naughty yeah so so what happened when
communism collapsed and at that point

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440
communism collapsed and at that point
 

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.040
communism collapsed and at that point
after state dissolution end of 1992

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:01.050
after state dissolution end of 1992
 

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:03.910
after state dissolution end of 1992
there were 27 cases in the region a

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:03.920
there were 27 cases in the region a
 

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.760
there were 27 cases in the region a
majority were these mixed regimes and

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:06.770
majority were these mixed regimes and
 

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.530
majority were these mixed regimes and
they weren't really fully democratic but

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:09.540
they weren't really fully democratic but
 

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.630
they weren't really fully democratic but
they weren't really holy authoritarian

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640
they weren't really holy authoritarian
 

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.340
they weren't really holy authoritarian
they had electoral competition but it

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:13.350
they had electoral competition but it
 

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.440
they had electoral competition but it
wasn't really quite right you know civil

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:15.450
wasn't really quite right you know civil
 

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:16.730
wasn't really quite right you know civil
liberties and political rights but they

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.740
liberties and political rights but they
 

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.760
liberties and political rights but they
weren't always respected etc so there

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:19.770
weren't always respected etc so there
 

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:21.680
weren't always respected etc so there
was this funny amalgam that when I in

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:21.690
was this funny amalgam that when I in
 

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.290
was this funny amalgam that when I in
what's happened since then politically

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:24.300
what's happened since then politically
 

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.310
what's happened since then politically
let me just say a little bit

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320
let me just say a little bit
 

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.510
let me just say a little bit
economically the democracies and I was

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520
economically the democracies and I was
 

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.340
economically the democracies and I was
surprised by this I don't know if others

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:31.350
surprised by this I don't know if others
 

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.890
surprised by this I don't know if others
were the democracies went to capitalism

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:33.900
were the democracies went to capitalism
 

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.620
were the democracies went to capitalism
pretty quickly and pretty effectively

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:36.630
pretty quickly and pretty effectively
 

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.270
pretty quickly and pretty effectively
even if we could talk about the various

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:38.280
even if we could talk about the various
 

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.850
even if we could talk about the various
costs to it but that process which we

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860
costs to it but that process which we
 

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.940
costs to it but that process which we
thought would blow

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:41.950
thought would blow
 

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.870
thought would blow
out democracy because of the kinds of

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:45.880
out democracy because of the kinds of
 

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.129
out democracy because of the kinds of
costs that it necessarily incurred

00:30:49.129 --> 00:30:49.139
costs that it necessarily incurred
 

00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:54.090
costs that it necessarily incurred
didn't happen the hybrid regimes like

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:54.100
didn't happen the hybrid regimes like
 

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.149
didn't happen the hybrid regimes like
Russia for example these mixed regimes

00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:57.159
Russia for example these mixed regimes
 

00:30:57.159 --> 00:31:00.990
Russia for example these mixed regimes
in the 90s they ended up doing various

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000
in the 90s they ended up doing various
 

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.720
in the 90s they ended up doing various
kinds of transition economic transitions

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:03.730
kinds of transition economic transitions
 

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.220
kinds of transition economic transitions
but basically they had the worst

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:05.230
but basically they had the worst
 

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.940
but basically they had the worst
economic disasters of anybody and then

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:08.950
economic disasters of anybody and then
 

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.560
economic disasters of anybody and then
the regimes that basically never noticed

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:10.570
the regimes that basically never noticed
 

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.070
the regimes that basically never noticed
the communism collapsed you know like

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080
the communism collapsed you know like
 

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.570
the communism collapsed you know like
this many the Central Asian regimes

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:15.580
this many the Central Asian regimes
 

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.470
this many the Central Asian regimes
Belarus um to some degree Ukraine but

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480
Belarus um to some degree Ukraine but
 

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.009
Belarus um to some degree Ukraine but
that's complicated you know they were

00:31:23.009 --> 00:31:23.019
that's complicated you know they were
 

00:31:23.019 --> 00:31:25.590
that's complicated you know they were
doing okay early on and so you had any

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600
doing okay early on and so you had any
 

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.480
doing okay early on and so you had any
way this this interesting kind some

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:27.490
way this this interesting kind some
 

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.279
way this this interesting kind some
dictatorships lots of these mixed

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:29.289
dictatorships lots of these mixed
 

00:31:29.289 --> 00:31:32.279
dictatorships lots of these mixed
regimes and sub democracies and so what

00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:32.289
regimes and sub democracies and so what
 

00:31:32.289 --> 00:31:35.190
regimes and sub democracies and so what
we've done and looking at the

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200
we've done and looking at the
 

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.629
we've done and looking at the
relationship how that has affected

00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:36.639
relationship how that has affected
 

00:31:36.639 --> 00:31:40.350
relationship how that has affected
issues of social mobility relations

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360
issues of social mobility relations
 

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.899
issues of social mobility relations
between groups how this affected issues

00:31:42.899 --> 00:31:42.909
between groups how this affected issues
 

00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:45.090
between groups how this affected issues
of economic reform economic performance

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:45.100
of economic reform economic performance
 

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.060
of economic reform economic performance
and the like so that's been one set of

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:48.070
and the like so that's been one set of
 

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.560
and the like so that's been one set of
questions is trying to figure out

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:49.570
questions is trying to figure out
 

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.310
questions is trying to figure out
relatedly why these mixed regimes tip in

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320
relatedly why these mixed regimes tip in
 

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.570
relatedly why these mixed regimes tip in
certain directions why does Russia

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:54.580
certain directions why does Russia
 

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.480
certain directions why does Russia
become an authoritarian regime you know

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:57.490
become an authoritarian regime you know
 

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.090
become an authoritarian regime you know
by the end of the 90s why did the tip

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:00.100
by the end of the 90s why did the tip
 

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:04.169
by the end of the 90s why did the tip
more democratic um why did some regimes

00:32:04.169 --> 00:32:04.179
more democratic um why did some regimes
 

00:32:04.179 --> 00:32:06.330
more democratic um why did some regimes
tip in a more democratic direction you

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:06.340
tip in a more democratic direction you
 

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.440
tip in a more democratic direction you
have to have been mixed which is

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:07.450
have to have been mixed which is
 

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.659
have to have been mixed which is
actually Ukraine's example and they're

00:32:09.659 --> 00:32:09.669
actually Ukraine's example and they're
 

00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:11.190
actually Ukraine's example and they're
bunch of examples we could give so

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200
bunch of examples we could give so
 

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.019
bunch of examples we could give so
looking at these regime transitions has

00:32:13.019 --> 00:32:13.029
looking at these regime transitions has
 

00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:14.940
looking at these regime transitions has
been a big issue the second big issue

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:14.950
been a big issue the second big issue
 

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:18.409
been a big issue the second big issue
obviously is the struggle over

00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:18.419
obviously is the struggle over
 

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:23.220
obviously is the struggle over
identities and boundaries and and we

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:23.230
identities and boundaries and and we
 

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:25.710
identities and boundaries and and we
have spent a huge amount of many many

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720
have spent a huge amount of many many
 

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.810
have spent a huge amount of many many
many studies of this I would say that

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:27.820
many studies of this I would say that
 

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.590
many studies of this I would say that
that was the issue in which many social

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600
that was the issue in which many social
 

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.340
that was the issue in which many social
scientists finally discovered the region

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:34.350
scientists finally discovered the region
 

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:36.930
scientists finally discovered the region
I wanted to say something parenthesis

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:36.940
I wanted to say something parenthesis

happened in the study of post communism

true and Eastern and Central Europe

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240
true and Eastern and Central Europe
 

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.999
true and Eastern and Central Europe
insofar as you talk about things like

00:33:52.999 --> 00:33:53.009
insofar as you talk about things like

European studies EU studies and the like
but it's very striking to me how

00:34:01.869 --> 00:34:01.879
but it's very striking to me how
 

00:34:01.879 --> 00:34:05.450
but it's very striking to me how
segmented we still remain in in so many

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:05.460
segmented we still remain in in so many
 

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.389
segmented we still remain in in so many
ways it's an interesting to talk about

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399
ways it's an interesting to talk about
 

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:10.730
ways it's an interesting to talk about
why that has happened but it's really

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:10.740
why that has happened but it's really
 

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:16.730
why that has happened but it's really
it's really a huge issue um okay the

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:16.740
it's really a huge issue um okay the
 

00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.260
it's really a huge issue um okay the
other thing I wanted to mention is that

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:18.270
other thing I wanted to mention is that
 

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:21.530
other thing I wanted to mention is that
and then maybe I'll stop there um open

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540
and then maybe I'll stop there um open
 

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.470
and then maybe I'll stop there um open
it up is that there has been the field

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480
it up is that there has been the field
 

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.690
it up is that there has been the field
of eastern and central european studies

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:26.700
of eastern and central european studies
 

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.389
of eastern and central european studies
has been radically transformed by young

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399
has been radically transformed by young
 

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:32.599
has been radically transformed by young
scholars and it's been for me a very

00:34:32.599 --> 00:34:32.609
scholars and it's been for me a very
 

00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:34.940
scholars and it's been for me a very
very exciting period in the last 20

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:34.950
very exciting period in the last 20
 

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:37.550
very exciting period in the last 20
years watching this I don't think it's

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560
years watching this I don't think it's
 

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.659
years watching this I don't think it's
so exciting when I write all the

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:38.669
so exciting when I write all the
 

00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:41.329
so exciting when I write all the
ten-year letters um I think it's very

00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339
ten-year letters um I think it's very
 

00:34:41.339 --> 00:34:44.540
ten-year letters um I think it's very
not exciting and all that I mean we've

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:44.550
not exciting and all that I mean we've
 

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:46.099
not exciting and all that I mean we've
all had this experience I'm sure it's

00:34:46.099 --> 00:34:46.109
all had this experience I'm sure it's
 

00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:49.220
all had this experience I'm sure it's
just unbelievable how many people there

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:49.230
just unbelievable how many people there
 

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.669
just unbelievable how many people there
are in the field now and many people

00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679
are in the field now and many people
 

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.619
are in the field now and many people
ended up and this is interesting I don't

00:34:54.619 --> 00:34:54.629
ended up and this is interesting I don't
 

00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:55.940
ended up and this is interesting I don't
know if is it true but I have a feeling

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:55.950
know if is it true but I have a feeling
 

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:59.780
know if is it true but I have a feeling
that there is now more equality between

00:34:59.780 --> 00:34:59.790
that there is now more equality between
 

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:03.260
that there is now more equality between
people working on Eurasia and eastern

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:03.270
people working on Eurasia and eastern
 

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.470
people working on Eurasia and eastern
and central europe in terms of numbers

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480
and central europe in terms of numbers
 

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.010
and central europe in terms of numbers
I'd like the curious to see if that

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:08.020
I'd like the curious to see if that
 

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.780
I'd like the curious to see if that
true but I fake it they're certainly

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:09.790
true but I fake it they're certainly
 

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:12.210
true but I fake it they're certainly
there closer in terms of numbers and

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:12.220
there closer in terms of numbers and
 

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.940
there closer in terms of numbers and
part of that simply is because I think

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:14.950
part of that simply is because I think
 

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:17.490
part of that simply is because I think
Eastern and Central Europe offered such

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:17.500
Eastern and Central Europe offered such
 

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.470
Eastern and Central Europe offered such
a rich array of research agenda

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480
a rich array of research agenda
 

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.260
a rich array of research agenda
possibilities and the second thing is

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:22.270
possibilities and the second thing is
 

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.600
possibilities and the second thing is
that in many cases they had social

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:24.610
that in many cases they had social
 

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:27.900
that in many cases they had social
scientists with whom external scholars

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:27.910
scientists with whom external scholars
 

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.180
scientists with whom external scholars
could connect especially Poland Hungary

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:30.190
could connect especially Poland Hungary
 

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:34.230
could connect especially Poland Hungary
and the former Yugoslavia some degree

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240
and the former Yugoslavia some degree
 

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.160
and the former Yugoslavia some degree
the Czech Republic too and that was a

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.170
the Czech Republic too and that was a
 

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.340
the Czech Republic too and that was a
real draw and the former Soviet Union

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:41.350
real draw and the former Soviet Union
 

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:45.500
real draw and the former Soviet Union
really was much weaker in that regard

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:45.510
really was much weaker in that regard
 

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.390
really was much weaker in that regard
because the collapse of the Soviet Union

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400
because the collapse of the Soviet Union
 

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.310
because the collapse of the Soviet Union
was also a crisis for scholars within

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320
was also a crisis for scholars within
 

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.710
was also a crisis for scholars within
the Soviet Union and the kinds of work

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720
the Soviet Union and the kinds of work
 

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.720
the Soviet Union and the kinds of work
they did the definition of the research

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:54.730
they did the definition of the research
 

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:57.330
they did the definition of the research
institutes and the like so that was a

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:57.340
institutes and the like so that was a
 

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:01.620
institutes and the like so that was a
huge ship I'm gonna stop there enough

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:01.630
huge ship I'm gonna stop there enough
 

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:04.050
huge ship I'm gonna stop there enough
yeah
