00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.663
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.133
&gt;&gt; It's not often a
critic gets to meet

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.306
and interview an author whose
books he or she has reviewed.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.140
So it's really a great pleasure
for me to finally meet Orhan Pamuk,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.996
whose work I have long admired
and whose most recent novel,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.970
the Museum of Innocence, I reviewed
for the Washington Post last year.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.356
You will know Orhan Pamuk,
of course, for the long trail

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.776
of literary excellence
that precedes him.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.393
He is the author of such
original widely translated

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.600
and much lauded novels as
My Name is Red and Snow

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.346
as well as the Memoir Istanbul.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.186
Four years ago in 2006 he
was awarded the Nobel Prize

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.500
in literature.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.500


00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.193
Now as we all know it's
a much touted precept

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.046
that once a Nobel Prize is awarded
the laureate has a hard time ever

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.393
producing a great work again.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.570
[Laughter] After that prize

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.370
of that magnitude the writer
can lose shall we say his knees,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.636
his chops, his pen, but with
the Museum of Innocence,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.030
Pamuk has proved that his place in
the literary pantheon is secure.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.896
The novel, which has just
been reissued in paperback,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.790
and I think you can buy today
or have already about I hope

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.716
at his signing, is
a brave, inventive,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.680
devilishly entertaining novel.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.933
The work of a writer in
total control of his craft.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.506
Mr. Pamuk was born 58
years ago in Istanbul,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.136
the grandson of a prominent
Turkish engineer

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.170
who owned factories
and built railroads.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.476
As a child, he longed
to be a painter,

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.223
and I had the wonderful
experience of walking

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.623
through the National Museum of Art
with him just now and he's back

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.400
to painting he says like a teenager.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.630
As a young man though, he
followed the family tradition

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.670
and studied engineering
and architecture

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.690
and then took a sharp turn and
earned a degree in journalism,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.676
but he didn't use any of these.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.476
He never practiced any
of these disciplines.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.493
Until the age of 30 he lived
in his mother's apartment

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.526
in Istanbul writing as we say for
the desk drawer producing works

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.263
that for one reason or other he
wouldn't or couldn't get published

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820
when his first book Cevdet Bey,
is that how you pronounce it?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.666
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Cevdet, yes.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.576
&gt;&gt; Cevdet Bey and His Sons
was finally published in 1982

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.690
when he was still a young man.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.556
It was likened to Thomas
Mann's Buddenbrooks

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.876
and won Turkey's prestigious
Orhan Kemal prize.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.383
His second, the Silent House,
a novel about a family told

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.016
through many narrators, suggested
according to John Updike,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.540
Virginia Woolf and William Faulkner.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.706
His third, The White Castle,
a creepy, 17th Century tale

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.130
of double identity evoked comparison

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.340
to [inaudible], and
[inaudible] Cardino.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.936
The fourth, The Black Book,
a missing person's adventure

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.313
that reveled [phonetic] in
the details of Istanbul,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.453
was fashioned after
James Joyce's Ulysses.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.980
The fifth, The New
Life, a dreamlike,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.030
first person contemporary tale
was described by a reviewer

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.616
as [inaudible] with a light touch.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.250
[Laughter] The sixth, My Name
is Red, a murder mystery set

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.786
in 16th Century Istanbul used the
art of [inaudible] illumination

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.980
to explore a nation's soul.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.223
Since then he has written the
books, we as Americans know best,

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.503
the disturbing Snow, which
he described as my first

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.463
and last political novel,
describes a poet who returns

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.260
to the sectarian violence
and tension is Istanbul

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.373
after being away for many years.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.083
Istanbul, his memoir is a
stirring tribute to the city

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.623
of his ancestors; the streets
and haunts of his youth.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.896
In all, Orhan Pamuk's great skill
is his ability to reinvent himself

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.313
in book after book and yet like a
magician manipulating boxes each

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.820
book contains something of the
next; a narrator, a character,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.686
a distinct little helix of
DNA that creates the illusion

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.496
of a coherent universe and that
larger Pamukian universe describes a

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.760
people and a nation struggling
between worlds, between old and new,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.420
between east and west, between Asia
and Europe, between fundamentalism

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.480
and tolerance, between
provincialism and globalization,

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.090
between the strange
and the familiar.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.666
He has been for many
readers an eloquent bridge

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.353
between many antipodes.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.433
His books have been
enormously successful.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.433
They've been translated

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.566
into 60 languages including
[inaudible] and [inaudible].

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.300
They've received unaccountable
prizes and honors.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.216
Four years ago, Time
magazine called him one

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.143
of the most 100 most
influential persons in the world.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.973
We're lucky to have
him here with us today

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.123
to talk about his life and work.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.103
He's also obviously very,
not a show off at all.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.410
[Laughter] We're lucky to have him
to talk about his life and work.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.183
Please welcome this very
special guest Orhan Pamuk.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.510
[ Applause ]

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.876
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: I don't know
what to say after all this.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.216
Any mistake you make is enlarged
and enlarged and enlarged.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.870
So I have to keep on the line of
being modest and try to do my best

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.983
in a modest fashion try
to answer the questions.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.590
I hope the questions are
not too hard by the way.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.830
[Laughter]

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:21.963
&gt;&gt; Well, let's start, can
you hear me with this?

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.160
Let's start with a concrete
fact, yes, you can hear me?

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.630
You left your science education
behind, Orhan, to be a novelist.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.170
Tell us about your decision to
abandon all that elaborate education

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.796
in engineering and architecture
not to mention journalism to hole

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.263
up at the age of 23
to become a writer?

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.983
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: There was some
family ideology behind it.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.776
I come from a family of engineers.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.510
My grandfather was one of the
first civil engineers in Turkey

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.780
who made a lot of money
building railroads.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.800
My father, one of my uncles
went to the same school,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.010
Istanbul Technical University, again
to study civil engineering and there

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.630
in the family the utmost talk,
the rhetoric was all you don't go

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.390
to business, you don't go to
art, you don't go to this,

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.136
you don't go to that,
you be an engineer.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.960
Also this is sprinkled with the
idea that Turkey is a poor country,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.266
engineers are making and
developing and building buildings.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.026
So, you're my grandson,
you have to do that.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.013
On the other hand I was a sort of
in a family of engineers and people

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.670
who were very good in mathematics
and I was also interested in arts

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:33.050
and I was considered a sort
of black sheep in that manner.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.436
So, as I was painting
as you have just said,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.840
someone in the family said, oh,
this one now that he, of course,

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.743
inevitably be an engineer and likes

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:49.926
to paint why don't
he be an architect?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.893
So I enrolled in the same Istanbul
Technical University Architectural

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.580
School, but at the third grade I
realized that I just don't want

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.076
to be both an architect
and a painter.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:05.120
I quit studying architecture,
enrolled to the school

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.113
of journalism not to be
a journalist but just

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.433
to delay my military
service [Laughter]

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.160
and begin writing my first novel.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.636
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.170
Well, engineering, you had said in
Other Colors, "I think when I think

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.623
of a writer, I think of a person
who locks himself up in a room

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.160
and patiently constructs
stories just

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.800
as a mason constructs
bridges with stones."

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.146
It reminds me of an
essay, an essay that I love

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.826
by John Gregory Dunn called
Laying Pipe in which he says

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.596
that writing is manual
labor of the mind.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:44.016
It's a job like any other job
that you lay pipe, you write.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.976
Is writing a craft like any other?

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.306
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: It is
a craft like any other

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.673
and craftsmanship side
of it is neglected.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.363
The modernist's ideology puts
that writer and the painter

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.610
and the creative artist
on a pedestal

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.543
and under stresses his ingenuity,
his uniqueness or his or her,

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.356
or the way they are constituted
different from the rest of us.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.723
This is a modernist ideology so
we owe some of this to the history

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.073
of art history where attribution

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.400
to single artist made the
value of the paintings go up.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.933
So, a signature artists
style, his uniqueness, yes,

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.940
we believe in these things,

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.460
but in modernity [phonetic]
they are a bit exaggerated.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.153
With that I mean that as a
writer I'm not a great, crazy,

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.540
creative genius artist all the time.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.246
Most of my time is, in fact,
turning around sentences

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.480
and it is about craftsmanship.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.876
Things they perhaps try
to teach to students

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.463
in creative writing departments.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.736
Since that part of craftsmanship
part of writing is neglected,

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.126
writers, yes, gain an aura
of distinct personalities,

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.083
but then most of the people do
not realize how much very simple

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.966
craftsman like label goes
into writing a novel.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.430
When the novel is good, when
you enjoy it, when you say, wow,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.003
he is a genius, this author,
you don't realize also

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.696
and I as a reader sometimes
I'll even forget

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.416
that how many times this author
turns around sentences and builds

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:56.030
up things, maneuvers, he spends a
month actually not doing genius-like

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:02.356
composition but turning things
around developing ideas, but them,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.466
yes, in the end we call the
renaissance painters we love

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.283
so much they were also
craftsmen and artists.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:17.543
Our modern idea of the artist put
the artist too much on the pedestal

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.660
and if he or she should come down

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:21.923
and this was the idea behind My Name
is Red, one of the ideas behind one

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.183
of my novels, My Name is
Red, which is about painters.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.720
&gt;&gt; So, speaking of craftsmanship
and the discipline that goes

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.450
into your art, I read somewhere
that you write, and I don't know

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.493
that you have the schedule
anymore, but that you write

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.313
from 2 to 8 in the afternoon.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:45.896
You take a break and
then you write again

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.056
from midnight to 4 in the morning?

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.976
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: This was years,

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:53.126
years ago before my
daughter was born.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.693
[Laughter] Now she
is, you can imagine,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.593
is a student at Columbia
University where, okay,

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.273
once in a week I also teach
at Columbia University.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:06.606
Twice a week we have lunch
and chat and she says, daddy,

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.633
come to this class there's so much
artistry there so forth and so on,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.566
but then after she was born then
I switched the whole program.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.580
I like and I think most of authors
that I like also like working

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.163
until 4 AM in the morning.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:32.003
[Inaudible] used to work until 4
AM, 5 AM and will sleep at that time

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.430
and wake up at 1:00,
12:00, whatever.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.343
I lived 20 years like that

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.746
and in this next 20 years my
daughter probably born in the middle

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.473
of my writing career, I have changed
it and now I wake up very early.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:47.800
This changed because when she was
born we are taking care of her

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.726
and later I used to take her

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.793
to school every morning
and go to the office.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.060
So, but why do writers
like to work in the middle

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.033
of the night it simply is this
that, you know, I lived all my life

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.713
in Istanbul it's a
city of ten million.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:06.203
Ten million people are sleeping.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.936
[Laughter] You are the
only one who is awake

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.713
and that bring some urgency,
importance and creativity

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.706
that you have something to say.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:20.513
They're sleeping, it's as if
you're preparing the newspaper.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.386
They're sleeping, but you are
doing something very special.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.200
&gt;&gt; Now your speaking about your
daughter reminds me of something

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.520
that you said to me earlier today,
which absolutely, what I have found

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.586
so charming he said that, well,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.846
tell us about what your
daughter made you do

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.460
when she was a little girl and
you were putting her to bed

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.186
at night and your storytelling.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.190
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Okay.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.523
Mia [phonetic] is mentioning
this because we were walking

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.826
across these tents and there was
a children's books tent and, oh,

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.286
this is Jane Smiley, I didn't know

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:01.310
that Jane Smiley wrote
children's books.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.670
And I thought, hmm, maybe I should
go and publish my children's books.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.226
[Laughter] I am the kind of author

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.753
who always is jealous
of other authors.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.100
[Laughter]

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.100
&gt;&gt; It's common.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.510
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: My idea of influence
is this that I go to a book shop,

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.380
I look at a book, which I haven't
read, and look at the cover

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.056
and the [inaudible] or
whatever and interesting book,

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.676
and I begin to project
my idea of that book.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.726
I haven't read that book.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:33.393
I think and think and think so much

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:35.566
about that book, which
I have never read.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:37.363
I don't know what it's about,
but I fancy about that book

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.276
and I am later influenced
from my fancy of that book.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:47.190
[Laughter] So, I saw that Jane
Smiley is doing some children's book

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.696
thing and then I mentioned to
Mia [phonetic] that, in fact,

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.763
when my daughter was small
baby or until she was 10

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.823
or 11 every Saturday I
used to tell her stories.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.200
At 11:00 she would come to
my bed and for two hours,

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.140
three hours I would tell her
stories and then after a while I

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.160
in a businesslike fashion I
begin to record these stories,

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.843
but the funny thing about these
stories she would in the middle

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:26.336
of each Saturday before each
session started she would say, okay,

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.676
I want the witch, I want the bird,
I want this, but no killing of that.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.393
[Laughter] And I would
immediately give her the story.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.560
[Laughter]

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:41.653
&gt;&gt; Orhan, tell us what
was the inspiration

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.153
for your first book,
Cevdet Bey and His Sons.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.883
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: It was
really a, it was not, oh,

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:51.396
I have such an important story
to tell and I have to write it.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.010
It was not like this.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:01.383
For me, and I think I have seen from
so many writers autobiographies,

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:06.003
biographies from my writer friends
that first you want to be a writer

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.603
and then you think of the novel.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.803
It's not like the other way around.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.026
First, you have such an
important story to tell

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.780
and then you write a novel.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.246
It was not like me.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.133
First, I wanted to be a writer and
this is associated, closely linked

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.693
with the idea that I wanted to be
a painter imagining myself alone

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.660
in a room standing my whole life.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:31.423
The idea of painting failed,
but this time I wanted

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.480
to write a book then it's very
natural that my first book,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.876
which I hope that it will be one
day translated here perhaps five

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.390
or six years later, is a family saga

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.470
which is based on my
personal family.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.413
So it's a 600 page of
family story of my family.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.430
In that sense, it's
like [inaudible].

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.550
&gt;&gt; Indeed.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:17:00.083
Now, so many of your books and this
really, we will talk about Museum

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.706
of Innocence in a moment, but this
really struck me in Snow the fact

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:10.276
that so many of your books are
like puzzles within puzzles.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.080
They're like Chinese boxes.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.880
They have constructions in them that
are, for instance, well, in Snow,

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.320
the narrator's name is Ka, right?

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.450
He is headed for the Town of Kars

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.320
and in Turkish the
word for snow is kar.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.766
Now, are these deliberate
Borgesian boxes or are you,

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:34.330
are critics just chasing their
tails when they try to find them?

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.156
Or tell us about that.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.530
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Okay.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.946
They are, yes, little Borgesian
tricks, but they're not Borgesian

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:46.780
in the sense that for [inaudible]

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.046
and this kind of trick
was everything.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.613
For me they are lesser.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.080
The fact that they also asked
so frequently, well, Mr. Pamuk,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.793
in the end of your
novel Snow or Museum

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.996
of Innocence I come across you.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.060
Yes, but that's not
so important really.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.573
That my appearance or these kind
of jokes are ornamental rather

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.843
than essential to the philosophy or
to the essential nature of the book.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.106
I make these jokes, there's so
many personal jokes, this or that.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.483
If you miss them, and I'm sure some
readers miss them because there's

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:30.653
so many, you don't,
you just miss them.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.073
It's not that you miss the book.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.740
You misunderstand the book.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:37.010
A book, my books are,
good books are layers

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.736
of layers of layers of meaning.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.416
Some of them personal.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.083
Even you understand some
of them even you forget

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.843
that personal little joke because
it happens, something happens

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.996
on the bus, but in the long run
those little games, elaborations are

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.703
for me, yes, they are
not essential thing.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:08.930
Essential thing is what is
invented in 19th Century,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.166
19th Century novel I
think is still dominating.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.233
We make call ourselves post
modernists, modernists,

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:23.083
experimental, this or that, but
what makes the reader grasp?

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.166
What makes the train moving?

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.560
They force, the energy,
the narrative drive comes

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.400
from those essential
structures invented by Dickens,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.240
by Balsa [phonetic],
by Standov [phonetic],

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.173
it's continued after that.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.710
&gt;&gt; Speaking of structures, let's
talk about building bridges.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:50.396
Is Turkey, in fact, a bridge
between the east and the west?

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.216
Or does that representation
diminish the unique personality

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.253
and character of [inaudible]?

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.920
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Turkey, first
there are so many layers.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.786
There is rhetoric so many times
[inaudible], oh, you're from Turkey.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.416
It's a bridge for east
and west, which is true.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.853
Look at the map; it's like that.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.416
It's Muslim country [inaudible] to
be European, part of European Union.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:16.150
It's whole history is formed by
these clashes, inner clashes,

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.470
those in the national resists,
western influence and those

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.320
who want this is the nature of
Turkey and I belong to that culture,

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.826
of course, obviously so but
then this doesn't have too much

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.386
to do with my writing.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.253
Though as a Turkish writer I tackle
questions of identity the wake

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.166
of history and the desire to
embrace modernity that clashes

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:50.550
in the culture and, of course,
there is always class side.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.376
Rich and the poor side
to westernization.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:02.583
Like many countries in Turkey,
too, upper classes, ruling classes,

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.203
richer people, they don't want
westernization and European more

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.946
than the rest of the nation.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:10.263
So, there's so many
problems related to this.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.763
I tackle, address, represent,
dramatize go, go into embrace,

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.380
play around with all these problems,

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.010
but am I a bridge between
east and west?

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.776
No. [Laughter] But they say so.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.330
[Laughter]

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.543
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a, you know,
speaking of westernization,

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.583
which I think Orhan
writes about brilliantly,

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.310
there's this wonderful scene
in the Museum of Innocence

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.836
of the wedding in the
Istanbul Hilton.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.130
Now, the black market
liquor is flowing,

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.570
the women are wearing miniskirts,
the men are hip and wise

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:56.836
to the world and they're swinging
through the revolving doors,

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:03.623
but we can quickly forget that we
are in a Muslim country and tell us

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:09.043
about your grappling with
that aspect of the character

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.243
of the country specifically
in Museum of Innocence.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:19.070
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Well, look, just not
to get the impression in Turkey just

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:20.776
until recently alcohol was
produced by the government

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.530
and was a government monopoly.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.670
So, just to say that it's a
Muslim country doesn't mean

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:29.320
that people don't drink,
they're less than,

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.780
you know, Germans or Russians.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.920
[Laughter] Turks enjoy
drinking and government produces

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.606
until recently the national drink.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.413
Once there is a lot of exaggerated
idea of Islam, of course,

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:55.483
because of what happened in the
last 10 years and once the idea

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.770
or general idea of [inaudible]
is Islam is exaggerated.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:05.243
I am facing these questions
about do people drink in Turkey?

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.216
Do this happen, do that happen?

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:08.786
More or less I think the
average income per capita is

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.266
also increasing.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.466
Turkey as a county is slowly
approaching European standards, yes,

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.603
on the other hand it is
an Islamic country, yes,

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:22.916
on the other hand there are
politically motivated people

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.643
who don't want you to drink
alcohol in that country

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.750
and there are clashes, but those
clashes are small, they are played

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.053
in the democratic arena or
in the constitutional arena

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:39.866
and everything is working fine.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.100
The country is not falling apart.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.230


00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.510
[ Applause ]

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:55.896
&gt;&gt; As you've just indicated, you've
always been bold and unafraid

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.143
to say what you think
and what you believe

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:04.423
and you were charged actually as
a criminal in Istanbul in 2005

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:05.150
for saying in a Swiss publication
that 30,000 Kurds had been killed

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.950
in Turkey as well as
one million Armenians.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.266
I read somewhere also that you
were the first person in Turkey

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:20.556
to defend Salman Rushdie after
the publication of Satanic Verses,

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:20.946
which as we know infuriated
the Ayatollah Khomeini

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.700
and brought a fatwa
down on Rushdie's head.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.326
Why have you chosen to speak out
about Turkey's difficult history

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.990
or is it just something that is
huge in that you can't help but do?

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.383
I mean is this a [inaudible].

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:36.826
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Look, I don't
want to pose as more brave as I,

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.740
more than, you know,
I'm not that brave.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.233
[Laughter] But things happen.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.873
Also things happen to [inaudible]
what I will say, you know,

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.813
words change so a writer if
you come from a Turk world

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.813
or I will say more politely to a
writer who comes from troubled parts

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:01.100
of the world, poor parts of
the world or non-western world

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.733
where free speech is troubled

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.840
and unfortunately free speech
is still troubled in Turkey.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:15.580
Journalists most inside and outside
of Turkey naturally ask you, well,

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.683
Mr. Pamuk, I think you write a
novel of [inaudible], very good,

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.410
but what do you think
of the government?

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:24.163
[Laughter] So, either you
back away from that question

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.020
or you honestly tell what you think.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.293
Then it is inevitable you end

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:32.426
up being a political commentator
no matter how willing you are

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.466
in it and how you're not.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:41.243
Then your dignity, your
representation of yourself,

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.153
your picture of yourself
is at stake, too.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:46.856
You can't say, well, just don't
ask me about government, okay?

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:50.850
Just skip that.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.680
You just don't want it, and I'm also
sometimes ill tempered person losing

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.153
my, you know, and then I
say whatever I want to say

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.520
and that also puts me in trouble.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.743
I go to court, my friends
tell me shut up.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.750
I have body guards in Turkey
when I go out in the streets.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.546
So forth and so on.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:12.893
But on the other hand
I don't want to pose

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.266
as a brave political
person because I'm not.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.273
I am a brave writer writing
[inaudible] adventuring doing

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.690
bravest things if I
want to be brave.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.830
In my novels, I'm not
saying political things,

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:29.773
but turning around [inaudible] novel
rather than, but on the other hand,

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:33.876
yes, there were situations when
I think I have to say what I have

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:40.496
to say and I said then, but
I don't want to be that kind

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.323
of politics to be my life.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.923
It's such a tender thing, you know,

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:46.340
you spend six years say you write
Museum of Innocence, you know,

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.486
this joke happened to me
and then it's about love.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.380
There is politics in it, but
that's not that important.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.260
My text is important
and the first thing is

00:26:59.370 --> 00:26:59.656
that what a great love novel,
Mr. Pamut, but what do you think

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.283
about [inaudible] in there
some place, you know?

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.683
[Laughter] And you
have to answer that.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.240
So, politics is inevitable
for a non-western writer.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.043
It is hard to maneuver with dignity

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:23.886
and protecting your artistic
integrity and also your personal,

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.526
ethical, political integrity
to combine these two.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:34.996
I have been sweating and sweating
and it's not only Washington heat.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.506
[Laughter] It is a situation that I
have to endure and learn to master.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.560
&gt;&gt; And you do.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.060
[ Applause ]

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:54.003
Now, let's talk, Orhan, about
your book Museum of Innocence,

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.793
which is an absolutely
astoundingly wonderful book.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.606
It is a love story.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.340
It is a surprising love story.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:07.540
It's a story of a man who is
besotted in love with a young woman

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:11.876
and continues to be besotted

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:17.216
in love her all his life whether he
can't leave her, he can't have her,

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.873
it is at once a trap and also turns

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.163
out to be the inspiration
of our hero's life.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:39.143
I'm very entertained by the fact
that you've given your hero the name

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.140
of the prize that you
won, the Orhan Kemal.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:42.996
Of course, Orhan Kemal was a great
Turkish writer, but that is the name

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.150
of our hero in the story
of this besotted suitor.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.733
So, tell us if you would
how this story came to you

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:56.266
and how you constructed it
and what you're trying to do.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.360
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Really it's
so hard to plot out one by one

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.253
to remember how the details
of a whole novel come to you.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.293
A novel for me we can in our
mind's eye, in our imagination,

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.126
picture a novel as a big,
big oak tree so to speak

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.936
in which there are tens
of thousands of leaves.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.343
No order can in any moment

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.186
of inspiration can dream
all of these leaves once.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:43.930
For me artistic literary
creation is a matter of patience.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.423
Slowly and slowly, leaf by
leaf you invent a novel.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.473
Yes. You have instincts
and experience.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:58.113
You think, well, the boat should
go this way, the wind may come

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:03.010
from this way, no one had gone that
way, why don't I go this way then?

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:09.116
You more or less plot where you
want to head, these are your themes,

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.486
your subjects, things you know,
things you want to identify

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.363
with some of the things you
don't know but you want to learn

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.990
and you want to put in a book,
these all make a whole package

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:26.396
and you sail, but you have a sense
of experience, sense of drama,

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.736
sense of mystery and
expectation and on your way leaf

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.373
by leaf you invent a tree.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:40.203
There is not a single day you said
I was one day sitting under a tree

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.640
and an apple fall on my
head and I wrote that novel.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:48.176
Don't believe that, but yes, the
beginnings of novels are like that.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:53.056
I was sitting under a
tree and I thought, well,

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.380
why don't I write a novel about
the man so obsessed with love

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.230
that his whole life is destroyed?

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.640
It will be a good excuse to
write about once and last time

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:09.803
about the Istanbul Bourgeoisie I
know and also class distinctions,

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:15.136
also the oppression of woman, also
I like museums and collectors.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.186
Who is a collector?

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.853
Why do people collect things?

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.453
What makes a person a collector and
what makes a collection a museum?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.200
So, forth and so on and
also the power of objects

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.926
to bring us the past
interesting moments.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:38.596
Also another idea I have is that how
objects remind us of past moments.

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:44.123
Maybe I can illustrate this
with this little story.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:48.790
We go to a movie and we [inaudible]
coats and we just leave the movie,

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.953
put the tickets in our coat pocket.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.640
We don't use that coat
for ten years.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.113
It's some place then say 20
years later someone says, oh,

00:31:58.790 --> 00:31:58.853
I found your old coat you're
not using this anyway.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.593
Shall I throw this, oh, by
the way I found this ticket

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.823
and gives you that ticket.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:12.756
Now, once you touch that ticket the
movie, you immediately realize, oh,

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.553
yes, I went to that movie.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.973
You have already forgotten
that you have seen that movie,

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.626
but now with the ticket you remember
not only the movie that you saw

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.583
that movie, scenes of that movie

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:31.156
that you have forgotten
begin to come back to you.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:35.523
That is the power of the object,
but then I'm not the first one

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.400
who thought of this; it was Marcel
Proust who thought of this idea.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.203
[Laughter] I gave you
a different example.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:47.803
This is [inaudible].

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.603
&gt;&gt; Now, Orhan is very
invested in this whole notion

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.803
because he is building a museum.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.440
Actually he's about to
open a museum in Istanbul.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:57.653
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.853
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Wow.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:01.853
Okay. I wrote a novel called Museum

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.920
of Innocence chronicling a man's
infatuation, if the word is right,

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.713
to a twice removed cousin.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.370
He is an upper class rich guy;

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.660
twice removed cousin is
a poor tailor's daughter.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.640
This happens, that happens, I
won't tell you what and then

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.146
in the end the girl like Turkish
melodramas marries someone else,

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.833
the guy is not happy with the
poor girl's family for 8 years

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.260
and collects whatever she touches

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:39.276
because that helps him
addresses what we call love pain.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.313
Then this happens, that happens
he tries to erect, builds a museum

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.260
of innocence with the
objects he collected.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:56.146
The novel chronicles all of this,
all the rules of the museum,

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:04.020
what you have to wear in the museum,
how many people can enter and,

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:09.010
in fact, the story is also told as
a sort of annotated museum catalog,

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:14.286
you know, you buy museum
catalog we see, what do we see?

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.346
We see photo of this pencil
and it says this is a pencil

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.763
when [inaudible] was looking
at me very meaningful.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:30.790
She was also holding this and we can
talk and talk and talk like this.

00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:31.160
Let us imagine in our mind's eye
to compose a novel in the shape

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.660
of annotated detail, annotated
in a very detailed fashion.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.010
More or less the Museum of
Innocence, the novel, is formed

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:48.210
and made like this, and I'm also
doing the museum in Istanbul

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.736
because as I wrote the novel
I bought all the objects

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:52.913
that are mentioned in the novel.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.046
A good example can be is
what the characters wear.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.520
I bought what they wore and
then described them, you know,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:06.716
looking at the dress
and put them in a book.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:12.956
Now I'm going to put them in
a museum as simple as this.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.070
[Laughter]

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.203
&gt;&gt; It's charming.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:17.940
I hope you get a lot of
visitors to your museum, Orhan.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.466
Now, I want you to get ready to ask
your questions, but I want to read,

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.513
here is a homework assignment

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:32.120
if you have not read Orhan Pamut's
Nobel Prize speech, please go home,

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.393
pull it up on the Internet
and read it.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.986
It is an extraordinarily
moving account of the weight

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.193
of his father's briefcase.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.726
It's a marvelous, marvelous piece.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.770
I want to read just
a paragraph from it.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.010
Actually, will you read it?

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.510
[ Applause ]

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.530
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Okay.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.330
I will do my best.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:05.130
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.530
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Okay.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:09.330
I am now going to speak
of this weight's meaning.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.340
When we say this weight, it was
the weight of my father's suitcase,

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.386
it was full of his manuscripts.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.093
He considered himself
an unsuccessful author.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.266
Let me add he didn't try too much.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:27.396
[Laughter] And then he said, you
know, after me maybe you want

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.960
to publish these things and gave
me his manuscripts sometime before

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.370
he died.

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:34.400
Then I in my Nobel
lecture I refer to that,

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.540
the weight of that suitcase, was
in fact, the weight of literature.

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:43.080
I am not going to speak
of this weight's meaning.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:50.153
It is what a person creates when
he shuts himself up in a room,

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:55.756
sits down at the table and retires
to a corner to express his thoughts.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.386
That is the meaning of literature.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.900
The writer secret is not inspiration

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.133
for it is never clear
where it comes from.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.420
It is his stubbornness,
his patience.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.140
I wrote that I agree.

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:16.013
[Laughter] That lovely
Turkish saying to dig a well

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:22.806
with a needle seems to me to have
been said with writers in mind.

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:27.630
In the old stories, I loved the
patience of [inaudible] who digs

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:32.490
through mountains for his love, and
I understand it, too, in my novel,

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.166
My Name is Red, and I wrote about
the old Persian [inaudible],

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.526
who had drawn the same
horse with the same passion

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:44.136
for so many years memorizing each
stroke that they could recreate

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:50.163
that beautiful horse even with their
eyes closed I knew I was talking

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:54.783
about the writing profession
and my own life.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.520
If a writer is to tell his
own story, tell it slowly

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.596
as if it were a story
about other people.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.666
If he is to feel the power of
the story rise up inside him,

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.093
if he is to sit down at the
table and patiently give himself

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.233
over to this art, this craft,

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.000
he must first have
been given some hope.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.230
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.510
[ Applause ]

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:37.223
I feel that Orhan gives you
as much hope about literature

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:42.130
as he gives me, and I know you will
have very interesting questions

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.130
for him.

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:47.663
Please step up to the
microphone now and make it good.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:52.850
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering when
you were arrested in Turkey,

00:38:55.970 --> 00:39:00.236
I'm assuming that you were just
out on bail, not actually jailed.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.646
Is that correct?

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:03.846
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: No.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.846
&gt;&gt; You were jailed.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.646
No, you weren't.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.246
I'm wondering if you think
that charges were dropped due

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:10.713
to your international reputation

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.913
or do you think someone just had
second thoughts on these charges?

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.713
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Some of
the charges were dropped

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.113
because of my international
reputation;

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.780
some of the court cases
are continuing by the way

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.416
but I'm trying to, I don't
want to dramatize that.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:24.010
&gt;&gt; Over here.

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:26.520
&gt;&gt; Hi. I wonder if you could address
another translation the extent

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.966
to which you were involved
with the translators

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.110
in 58 languages of your works?

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.880
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: The only language
which I think I have some command

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.720
of is English and I only
checked the English translations.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:46.123
I have worked a lot with my
translators, fighting with them,

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.780
arguing with them, being their
friends, talking with them,

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.066
understanding, correcting,
discussing,

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.066
listening you just can't
say this in English

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.876
and since English is the
only language I check,

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.123
I cannot stop myself
and I'm translated

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:18.123
to almost 60 languages say of
this now it's getting decreasing,

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:22.723
but some 10 years ago maybe some 20

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:26.043
of them was translated
through English.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:30.550
Say I'm translated to Vietnamese
even to Swedish, not now,

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.463
but 15 years ago my
first book was translated

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.190
to Swedish through English.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:43.963
So, of course, I deliberately I
care about the quality, precision,

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.766
music of translation
as much as I can.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.413
That is time consuming.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.613
It's a lot of energy
with a dedicated person.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:55.423
You are never rich if
you're a translator.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:01.083
That person obviously cares
about your work, she is very,

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:06.663
he or she is very respectful and
wants to help you while you begin

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.043
to criticize this is not like that.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.426
I didn't mean that.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.560
You got it all wrong.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.360
Where is my music?

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:15.560
[Laughter] And this
person loves you,

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:17.996
wants to give you another language,
help to say it, and you know,

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.723
drama and tears and all of that.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:23.230
[Laughter] Don't ask me too much.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:26.290
[Laughter]

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.406
&gt;&gt; He has a wonderful
translator by the way.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.083
Maureen Freely [phonetic], who
is a writer in her own right.

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:33.413
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: All of my
translators are [inaudible].

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.980
[Laughter]

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.646
&gt;&gt; Oh. He says he's
not political, right?

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.740
[Laughter]

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.556
&gt;&gt; You partially answered
my question, but you talked

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:46.590
about the craft of writing and how
you work and rework your sentences,

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.056
and I'm wondering with
the translation

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:55.523
when I read the English
translation what might I be missing?

00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:00.536
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Of course,
translation is missing something

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:02.690
that the customs of languages,

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.690
in the customs some
things unfortunately stay,

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.950
but then I say, well,
that stayed there.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.960
Let's invent something else
in the translated language.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.133
Translation is, of course,
betrayal, but then on the other hand

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.420
for me the finishing of pros that
is something that is translatable

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:28.543
that if I'm writing a
novel I am believing

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.273
that whatever I put there
is translatable except

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:36.736
if I'm not aspiring to write
Finnegan's Wake every novel

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.566
is translatable.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.700
Yes, some of the meaning is lost,

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.323
but if you have a good
translator you work

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:47.790
with something is gained, too.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:50.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:52.570
&gt;&gt; Over here, please.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.903
&gt;&gt; Mr. Pamut, I was just
wondering about the Bourgeoisie.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.303
You've mentioned the
Victorian [phonetic] novel,

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:59.260
do you think that the class that
you talk about, the Bourgeoisie

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.013
in Turkey, the king elite,

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.430
what happens when you
find the new [inaudible]

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:05.436
that are arriving in Turkey?

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:05.743
What happens when the newer
classes that, you know,

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:09.580
the people who are making
the money the [inaudible]?

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.080
What happens when they
come onto the scene?

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:13.863
We haven't seen much of
them except for in Snow.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.296
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: I see.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:22.563
Yes, of course, the logic of having
reached Bourgeoisie is there will be

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.780
new [inaudible] Bourgeoisie
and they will change.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.660
I don't think that we should ascribe

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:35.156
to the idea the old Bourgeoisie was
better, the new ones are vulgar.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:36.943
It is a cliche as you know

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:41.370
and cliches has also some
reality into them, too.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.726
That's what it is all about.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.393
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:47.860
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:49.860
Over here?

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.260
&gt;&gt; Hi, I wrote my question down
actually because it's a little long

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:57.460
so I hope you'll bear with me, but
I remember something that you wrote

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.113
about a 1,001 Nights where
you said that you had wrote it

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:14.876
at different times in your life and
it meant different things to you

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:23.426
at different stages, but that as a
work it was a really a collaboration

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:28.763
of east and west and that it
started in the east and went

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:30.200
through Europe was shaped by
Europe before it came back

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.086
to you in Istanbul.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:38.366
And I was wondering if you
think that because of real

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:40.236
or perceived political
tension between the west

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:46.290
and the broader Middle East or even
things like technological advances

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:47.116
that we've lost the opportunity
for such broad, cultural

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:53.190
and literary collaborations
between the east and the west?

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.953
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: I don't think
that we have lost the [inaudible]

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:57.703
that the cultures are
there in their richness

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.896
and let's not confuse
political developments

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.180
with cultural exchange, interchange.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.923
Even if there's a war going
on cultural interchange

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.590
and exchange continues too.

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:14.173
Even when they fight say
medieval times they fought

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:17.270
and by the side they marry
to each other this and that.

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:24.143
It is in evitable that cultures
interchange, influence each other.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:24.816
I don't, I'm not regretful
about all Middle Eastern culture

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:30.496
that we were going to
influence west so much

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:30.610
but we lost some important thing.

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:36.903
No. In fact, now that we are
talking about Arabian Nights that,

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:38.956
this essay you're talking about
which was published in other colors,

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:42.390
was my introduction
to a new translation

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:46.883
of Arabian Nights in Turkish.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:51.696
I wrote it saying that perhaps
it would make my points clearer

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:52.630
that in my childhood I read Arabian
Nights [inaudible] translations

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:57.570
for Turkish boys, and I
read them as a westerner.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.143
My God, look at this
fancy, strange Arabs.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.693
What's happening to them
like a European reader,

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:12.910
but on the other hand Arabian Nights
and some of the stories like Aladdin

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:18.756
and the [inaudible] story
is a European invention.

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:24.950
It's not an Arabic story, it's
not a Middle Eastern story.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.870
So, books are always made up
of [inaudible] so many layers

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.286
and we should not hastily
combine political aspirations,

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:43.130
political utopias with
books and culture so fast.

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:46.610
Thank you.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:48.610
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:50.610
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:52.610
Over here?

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:54.143
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Mr. Pamuk,
for your work.

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:59.410
I'm a psychiatrist and a
psychotherapist and sometimes I'm

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.613
in the habit of prescribing
a book to one of my patients.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.520
[Laughter] And so.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.440
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Just tell
them not to read after 10:00.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.800
[Laughter]

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.533
&gt;&gt; Well, I prescribed
Museum of Innocence.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.813
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Thank you.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.480
&gt;&gt; To a 40-year old Black
janitor from here in town.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:40.183
He read it and it was the most
effective interpretation I

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:44.880
have made.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.586
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Maybe we should put
that as a blurb on the front cover.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.240
[Laughter] [Applause]

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.240
&gt;&gt; You're welcome to.

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.840
[Applause]

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.573
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Thank you.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:58.403
&gt;&gt; I from reading your book sort
of was inspired to start writing.

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.810
Not very successfully so
far, but I was wondering

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:08.656
if you believe is a great
writer born with the talent

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:15.436
or is it possible to learn that
talent and learn that craftsmanship?

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:19.860


00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:22.956
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: This is
a [inaudible] question,

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.553
of course, you don't do that.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.676
[Inaudible] has been asked,
Mr. Pamut, do you believe

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.953
in creative writing departments?

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.706
Writing can be taught?

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.160
I think some of it is
possible that you learn.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.426
There's so much to learn.

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.140
Reading books is the first
thing you do to be a writer.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.173
Then the rest really just
life, just like life depends

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.073
on your cleverness, on your
luck, on your persistence,

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.746
on your strength, on
this and on that.

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:02.016
Can we say that?

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:04.536
Is there a university of life that
will teach us those two goals?

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:09.363
The university of life will
be more successful than life?

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:14.196
It's like that, but on the
other hand there are books

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:21.550
if you read them you have more
chance of being successful.

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.100
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.100
Over here.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.100
&gt;&gt; [Speaking foreign
language] I just got back

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:32.166
from spending a year
teaching English in Ankara

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.690
and there were a few
times in classes

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:39.443
when my students would not speak
and there were three things

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:43.890
that I could always count on to
make them speak with each other.

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:47.036
One was [inaudible], one
was soccer, and one was you.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:49.730
[Laughter] The typical
response I got from my students,

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:54.130
this is at Bilkent University,
was that you were somehow non,

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:57.370
or anti-Turkish or non-Turkish for
what you said about what's happened

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:59.103
in the history with Turkey and
Armenia and that you were pandering

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:00.436
to the west in statements

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:01.636
that you've made I
believe to a Swiss paper.

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:04.770
I wanted to know does it bother
you to be seen in that light?

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.170
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Of course it bothers
everyone to been seen that way

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.703
and it's not a joking matter.

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:10.970
I understand I'm sorry that those
students of yours are thinking

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:13.236
that way, but don't forget that
[inaudible] newspapers, governments,

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:14.103
armies, big money publish
newspapers, control media

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:17.036
and those ideas pass to I would
say young, naive minds like that.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:16.836
People don't think those things

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:19.570
and they are unfortunately
very suppressed,

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:22.103
oppressive right wing
nationalist ideas they learn,

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:24.503
these good boys learn those
bad ideas from bad newspapers

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:26.236
who are spreading sort

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:27.436
of [inaudible] right
wing fascists ideas.

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:29.170
I can't help it, but
just don't think

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.970
of this situation as an internal.

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:33.970
Politics is like that that
someone in the streets

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:35.570
that you don't know
has bad ideas about you

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.903
which are not true and accurate.

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:41.170
Of course, I'm sorry about that,
but then I cannot shut off my mind

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:42.903
because some cheap newspaper will
write something bad about me.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:51:01.540
Thank you.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000


00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:45.770
[ Applause ]

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:47.903
&gt;&gt; Yes, Mr. Pamut, the
only work, unfortunately,

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:50.836
of yours that I have read is
Snow, and I enjoyed it very much,

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:51.953
but read about the present Turkish
government and what is going

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.253
on particularly a recent
article I read

00:50:56.890 --> 00:51:01.623
about somehow the Muslim government
has taken over the judiciary I think

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:07.536
about Snow and what
Orhan Pamuk say in Snow,

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:15.730
which kind of remind me I get the
feeling based on what I read in Snow

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:21.703
that somehow the military is
going to take over the government.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:26.936
That the military, you know, was
opposed to the Muslim influences

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:35.313
in Turkey during the time
of Snow and I don't know is,

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.603
what is the situation now?

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:39.960
I'm asking you a political question.

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.560
[Laughter]

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.160
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: I don't think
this is even a political,

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.893
this is a journalistic
question you're asking, sir.

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.560
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.693
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: What is
the situation there now?

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.693
Well, it's sunny.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.960
[Laughter] Last time I was
there it was not raining.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.013
[Laughter] But, of course,

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.130
we writers should avoid being
journalistic representatives

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:06.496
of our cultures, of our countries.

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:09.796
If I attempt to seek the
nation's spirit rather

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.460
than the latest political
developments I don't think

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.686
that is a major political
drama happening in Turkey now.

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:21.016
I think it's just normal.

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:21.593
I have seen my, I know my
country it's just regular politics

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.040
are happening.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:31.306
What happened in the last ten
years after 9/11 was that Turkey is

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.240
in the news because of America's
worries about Islamic world,

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:40.660
call it Islamphobia
or America's defense

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:45.633
against Islamic terrorism
whatever you may call it.

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:46.163
Because of that Turkey is in
the news, but if you look at it

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:53.576
from my point of view nothing much
has changed, but it's on the news

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:57.070
and you're asking me about it.

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:58.070
[Laughter]

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:00.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000


00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:02.070
[ Applause ]

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:03.336
I'm sorry to say we only have time

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:05.803
for one more question,
and you're it, sir.

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:08.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:11.403
Do you have any thoughts about
passing on the weight of your work.

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:12.536
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Sorry?

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:14.670
&gt;&gt; Do you have any thoughts
about passing on the weight

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:15.136
of your works to your daughter?

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:18.803
&gt;&gt; Orhan Pamuk: Oh, I see.

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:19.603
Yeah, but then I'm
not a closet writer,

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:21.863
she knows that I'm a
writer, she reads my books.

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:27.210
My father was a sort of shy,
poet who just did not want me

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:33.776
to read his poems and was
also thoroughly self-conscious

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.480
about his failure, but you
can't even call it a failure

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.193
because he didn't want it too much.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:44.776
So, there's a difference.

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:47.776
For my daughter I am
an outspoken writer,

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.140
I am a writer who is obviously fair.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:53.150
It's not the same thing.

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:54.550
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:56.550
Thank you.

00:53:57.550 --> 00:53:59.016
&gt;&gt; Thank you to Orhan Pamut
for a wonderful interview

00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:01.483
and thank you all for coming.

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:07.100
