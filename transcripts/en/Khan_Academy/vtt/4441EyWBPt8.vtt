00:00:00.425 --> 00:00:01.880
- [Voiceover] In this video,
we're going to be talking

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.171
about conjugate acid-base pairs.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.367
We're going to introduce the idea

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:08.293
of a conjugate acid-base pair

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:10.460
using an example reaction.

00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:16.492
The example reaction is
between hydrogen fluoride,

00:00:16.492 --> 00:00:17.909
or HF, and water.

00:00:21.114 --> 00:00:23.348
So hydrogen fluoride is a weak acid,

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:25.846
and when you put it in water,

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:27.841
it will dissociate partially.

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:30.739
So some of the HF will dissociate,

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.656
and you'll get fluoride minus ions.

00:00:35.224 --> 00:00:38.307
And then that dissociated H plus ion.

00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:41.616
So this dissociated H plus ion

00:00:41.616 --> 00:00:42.949
will get donated

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:45.218
to our water.

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:51.209
So water then becomes
H3O plus, or hydronium.

00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:59.866
And so this process is
in dynamic equilibrium,

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.253
cause it can go forward,
and it can go backward,

00:01:02.253 --> 00:01:04.441
and eventually, those two rates are equal,

00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:06.619
and they're both happening
at the same time.

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.071
So in this reaction, we have
a couple things going on,

00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:10.349
and we're gonna think about it

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:14.279
in terms of hydrogen ions being exchanged.

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:16.860
So if we just look at
the hydrofluoric acid,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.775
and we look in the forward direction,

00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:21.025
our HF is becoming F minus.

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:27.035
And it's doing that by donating or losing,

00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:30.006
so I'll put a minus for losing a proton.

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.006
So our HF loses a proton

00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:36.601
that forms our F minus or fluoride ion.

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.745
And then we can look at that same process

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:42.386
happening in the backwards reaction.

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:44.359
So if we look at the backwards reaction,

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.140
which is also happening,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.473
the fluoride ion can pick up

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.343
or accept a proton from somewhere.

00:01:53.343 --> 00:01:55.136
So it can pick up an H plus,

00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:57.753
so I'll have a plus, H plus here.

00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:00.920
And so when fluoride accepts a proton,

00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:03.759
we reform our HF.

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.970
So we can see that HF and F minus

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.386
have this special relationship where

00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:10.253
you can form one or the other

00:02:10.253 --> 00:02:12.279
by losing or gaining a proton.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.658
And we can see a similar relationship

00:02:14.658 --> 00:02:17.527
between water and hydronium.

00:02:17.527 --> 00:02:20.142
So, water here, we said water

00:02:20.142 --> 00:02:22.642
is accepting a proton from HF,

00:02:23.483 --> 00:02:26.816
so we see that water will gain a proton,

00:02:28.485 --> 00:02:31.152
and that will give us hydronium.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.342
In the reverse reaction,

00:02:34.342 --> 00:02:38.009
hydronium can lose a
proton to reform water.

00:02:38.944 --> 00:02:40.361
So, minus H plus.

00:02:42.134 --> 00:02:44.015
So again we have these two species,

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:45.743
water and hydronium,

00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:47.700
that are related to each other

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.783
by having, or not having, one H plus.

00:02:52.092 --> 00:02:54.634
So in chemistry, we call these species

00:02:54.634 --> 00:02:56.199
that are related in this way

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.466
conjugate acid-base pairs.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:02:59.987
So the official definition,

00:02:59.987 --> 00:03:03.489
or my official definition of
a conjugate acid-base pair

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.656
is when you have two species
that are related to each other.

00:03:08.923 --> 00:03:13.056
Let's see, two species that
are related to each other,

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:14.889
related by one H plus.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.500
In this case, we have HF and F minus

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.855
that are related to each
other by that one H plus.

00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:31.335
And so HF and F minus are
a conjugate acid-base pair.

00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:34.766
We also have water and hydronium,

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:37.874
which are also related by that one H plus.

00:03:37.874 --> 00:03:42.114
So water and H3O plus are also
a conjugate acid-base pair.

00:03:42.114 --> 00:03:44.132
You can probably tell from the name,

00:03:44.132 --> 00:03:46.620
but whenever you have a
conjugate acid-base pair,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.259
one thing in the pair will be an acid,

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.247
and the other thing will always be a base.

00:03:50.247 --> 00:03:52.518
The definition of which one is the acid

00:03:52.518 --> 00:03:53.762
and which one is the base

00:03:53.762 --> 00:03:55.935
comes from the Bronsted-Lowry definition

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.226
of acids and bases.

00:03:57.226 --> 00:03:59.903
So the Brondsted-Lowry definition says

00:03:59.903 --> 00:04:03.084
anything that can donate an H plus,

00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:06.360
so anything that will give
away an H plus is an acid.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.114
So we can see that, in this case,

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:11.979
our hydrofluoric acid
is acting as the acid

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.488
in the conjugate acid-base pair.

00:04:14.488 --> 00:04:16.376
And that means that fluoride

00:04:16.376 --> 00:04:19.488
has to be acting as the base.

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:21.822
And that makes sense, because

00:04:21.822 --> 00:04:23.538
the Bronsted-Lowry definition of a base

00:04:23.538 --> 00:04:26.264
is something that will accept an H plus.

00:04:26.264 --> 00:04:27.613
And that's exactly what it does

00:04:27.613 --> 00:04:29.121
in the reverse reaction.

00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:31.131
Your F minus will pick up an H plus

00:04:31.131 --> 00:04:33.130
and go back to your acid.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.128
So we can also look at water and H3O plus.

00:04:36.128 --> 00:04:40.428
So here, water is gaining
a proton, or accepting it,

00:04:40.428 --> 00:04:42.845
so water is acting as a base.

00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:47.254
And in the reverse reaction, H3O plus

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:49.117
is donating a proton,

00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:51.867
so H3O plus is acting as an acid.

00:04:56.274 --> 00:04:58.847
The relationship between
conjugate acid-base pairs

00:04:58.847 --> 00:05:01.343
we can write a little bit more generally.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:05.745
So, if we represent
any generic acid as HA.

00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:07.412
So this is our acid.

00:05:10.303 --> 00:05:14.386
We said that a acid is
something that donates a proton.

00:05:14.386 --> 00:05:16.469
So it'll lose the proton,

00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:21.005
and when it does that, it
will form the conjugate base,

00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:23.672
which is represented by A minus.

00:05:25.276 --> 00:05:27.980
In the reverse reaction,
our base, A minus,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.583
can gain a proton and remake our acid,

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:33.125
or conjugate acid.

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:35.000
So whenever you have two species

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.568
that have basically the same formula,

00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:39.486
which we abbreviated here as A minus,

00:05:39.486 --> 00:05:42.160
except for one has an
H plus and one doesn't,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.502
then you know you have a
conjugate acid-base pair.

00:05:44.502 --> 00:05:46.250
So let's look at some more examples

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.818
of conjugate acid-base pairs.

00:05:48.818 --> 00:05:52.068
We saw above, HF, or hydrofluoric acid,

00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:56.009
it's conjugate base is F minus.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.603
So here HF is our acid, and
when it loses that proton,

00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:02.883
we are left with F minus.

00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:06.888
We saw in the same reaction
that water can act as a base.

00:06:06.888 --> 00:06:09.808
So if water is our A minus,

00:06:09.808 --> 00:06:12.941
if that water accepts a proton,

00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:16.024
it forms the conjugate acid H3O plus.

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.156
So the example we've gone through so far,

00:06:22.156 --> 00:06:24.133
HF, is for a weak acid.

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:25.694
But we can also talk about

00:06:25.694 --> 00:06:27.630
the conjugate base of a strong acid,

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.137
like hydrochloric acid.

00:06:29.137 --> 00:06:30.388
HCl is a strong acid,

00:06:30.388 --> 00:06:32.837
so that means it completely dissociates.

00:06:32.837 --> 00:06:34.995
So it gives away all of its protons,

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:35.953
and when it does that,

00:06:35.953 --> 00:06:39.829
we're left with the
conjugate base, chloride.

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:44.607
So even though chloride
isn't particularly basic,

00:06:44.607 --> 00:06:47.690
it's still the conjugate base of HCl.

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:49.877
And last but not least,

00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:53.009
we're gonna go through two examples where

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:55.559
it looks like we might have
a conjugate acid-base pair,

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:57.373
but we actually don't.

00:06:57.373 --> 00:07:01.512
So one example is, what
about the relationship

00:07:01.512 --> 00:07:04.012
between H3O plus and OH minus?

00:07:08.234 --> 00:07:10.250
If we think of our acid up here

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.364
being H3O plus, if we lose one proton,

00:07:13.364 --> 00:07:16.564
we saw that its conjugate base is water.

00:07:16.564 --> 00:07:20.032
If water loses another
proton, we get OH minus.

00:07:20.032 --> 00:07:23.254
So the difference between
these two species here

00:07:23.254 --> 00:07:25.826
is two protons instead of one proton.

00:07:25.826 --> 00:07:28.723
So these two, hydronium and hydroxide

00:07:28.723 --> 00:07:31.505
are not a conjugate acid-base pair

00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:35.672
because they differ by two
protons instead of one.

00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:43.848
And then the last
example we'll look at is,

00:07:43.848 --> 00:07:46.563
we said that fluoride is
a conjugate base of HF.

00:07:46.563 --> 00:07:48.238
So what about the relationship between

00:07:48.238 --> 00:07:50.317
sodium fluoride and fluoride?

00:07:50.317 --> 00:07:54.501
And so these two are also
not a conjugate base pair

00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:57.746
because if we take our fluoride ion,

00:07:57.746 --> 00:08:00.240
and it accepts a proton,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.892
we don't get sodium fluoride.

00:08:01.892 --> 00:08:04.642
They are related by a sodium ion.

00:08:07.242 --> 00:08:09.760
So by definition, these two are not

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.797
a conjugate acid-base pair.

00:08:11.797 --> 00:08:14.731
So in this video, we learned
that a conjugate acid-base pair

00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:16.724
is when you have two species

00:08:16.724 --> 00:08:18.391
and they have the same formula,

00:08:18.391 --> 00:08:20.683
except one has an extra proton.

00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:23.639
So the acid has an extra proton,

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:25.494
which it can lose to form the base.
