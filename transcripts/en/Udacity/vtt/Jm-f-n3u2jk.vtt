00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here are 3 lines of things that the computer has done for me.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The very first one you should just ignore. It'll always be there. Just ignore it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It tells the computer that we wish to plot things.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The second and the third one were the important ones.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I define a data set--a data set is a list of 10 elements--3, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5, 3, 6, 4, 3 that I made up

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and with this line, I tell the computer that this over here is my data.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Then I tell the computer, "Please histogram plot my data"--and then this is the result I just shown you.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Here are the 3 things that we have to tell the computer.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If you ignore the cryptic "from plotting import *," then what we do is we define the data.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We list it, we give it a name called data, and we generate a histogram plot of the data.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Then we then hit run in the small box down here--you'll get exactly the plot that I've shown you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
where the frequency of the data is plotted accordingly.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Obviously, that range was 2.8 with 3.6 as the most frequent and if we go back up to the data.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We find yet 3 occurrences of 3 with 4 into this range. This is the most frequent range.
