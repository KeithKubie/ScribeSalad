00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.550
So let's see how do we access the magnetic disks

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.270
and how long does it take to get to our data?

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.792
We will assume that the disk is already spinning. If

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:12.668
the disk is not spinning it takes possibly several seconds to

00:00:12.668 --> 00:00:15.380
actually spin up the disks. So most of the time

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.572
if you're accessing the data frequently, the disk would just keep

00:00:18.572 --> 00:00:22.014
spinning. So if the disk is spinning then the axis

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:25.325
time consists of the seek time, which is the time it

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:31.020
takes to move the head assembly to the correct cylinder for our data. So we know

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.940
where the data is, we know which cylinder,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.600
which sector, which surface. We first have to get

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.100
the heads so that they are above the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.930
correct cylinder. So at that point, one of the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.070
heads will be above the track where our

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.490
data really is. Next, there is the rotational latency.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.500
After we have moved the heads, they're somewhere

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.580
along the track, but not necessarily, and usually

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.820
not, above the very sector that we are

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.762
interested in. So the rotational latency is about waiting

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:07.614
for the start of our sector to finally

00:01:07.614 --> 00:01:11.288
get under the head that will read it. Note

00:01:11.288 --> 00:01:13.829
that the head is actually sitting in one

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.986
place at this point, but the platter is rotating

00:01:16.986 --> 00:01:19.758
so different parts of the track are getting

00:01:19.758 --> 00:01:23.223
under the head and the rotational latency's how long

00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:26.303
until the beginning of our sector gets under the

00:01:26.303 --> 00:01:30.190
head. Next we have the data read which is,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.920
we read until the end to the sector is

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.534
seen by the head. Again the data read really

00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:38.812
depends on how fast a disk is spinning and

00:01:38.812 --> 00:01:42.038
how many sectors we have per track. For example,

00:01:42.038 --> 00:01:44.882
if the whole track is just one sector, then

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:47.726
the data read will be a whole rotation of the

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:51.074
disk. If we have ten sectors per track, then

00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:54.870
the data read will be one-tenth of a rotation. Then

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.840
there is some controller time for the disk controller

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.750
to actually check the check sound, determine that the sector

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.135
is okay, and so on. And the IO bus time

00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:07.600
which is once the disk drive itself and its controller

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.910
have the data, how long does it take

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.420
to actually get that data to the main memory?

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.970
Now note that unlike a cache or a DRAM

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.390
where we could actually be doing multiple axises potentially

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.280
at the same time, on a magnetic disk once

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.000
we seek to one track we cannot really be

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.271
reading other tracks. So really what happens is accesses

00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:33.095
to the disk are happening one at a time.

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:35.867
We go to a track, possibly read several

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:39.647
sectors, but we cannot access another track until we

00:02:39.647 --> 00:02:45.090
are done with this one and move to the next track. So all of this is the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.810
latency to do one disk access and often

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.785
times the latency of a disk request made by

00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:54.865
the operating system includes this, plus a significant

00:02:54.865 --> 00:02:58.180
queuing delay because we first have to wait for

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.280
previous accesses to finish doing this and only then our access can move

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.360
the heads to the correct position and do a read or a write.
