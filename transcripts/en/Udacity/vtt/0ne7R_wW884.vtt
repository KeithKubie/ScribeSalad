00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.070
We've been talking about labels and
their use in mandatory access control.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.440
Now we're going to get
to a concrete model.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.150
This is a model that deal
with confidentiality and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.310
it was introduced earlier is
the Bell and La Padua model.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.790
Project that developed this model was
funded by the Department of Defense,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.650
so the kind of label we're going to
talk about are the type we've

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.940
been discussing, where you have
classification and clearance and

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.840
things like that.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.262
Couple of things to keep in mind here is
that confidentiality is the issue here.

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:35.584
We're concerned about
the disclosure of information.

00:00:35.584 --> 00:00:39.974
So more sensitive information we don't
want that to be disclosed to someone who

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:42.230
is not cleared at that level.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.715
So that's going to be one.

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:47.060
And since we're talking with DoD
the other thing to keep in mind is

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.260
the labels what they're
going to look like.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.140
As I said, the DoD means it's going
to assume that information or

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.780
data that's contained in files
is classified at levels like TS,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.000
top secret, secret, and
classified and so on.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.530
The second part of a label
is a compartment or

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.830
category that as we said before.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.780
It depends, what is the document about.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.160
So is it chemical or nuclear or

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.280
conventional or two kinds or
something like that.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.540
And the rule for read says user with
label L1, top secret user, for example.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.893
Who's working on, let's say,
nuclear and conventional.

00:01:27.893 --> 00:01:30.563
So that would be this
user's compartments.

00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:36.809
So user with label L1 can read document
with label L2 only when L1 dominates L2.

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:41.096
So this domination that we defined
before when the label of the subject or

00:01:41.096 --> 00:01:46.120
the user dominates the label of the
document, then they're able to read it.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.910
This is called the read-down rule.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.270
You can read documents that
are classified at your or

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.710
a level that's below yours.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.160
Or further down from your level.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.700
So that's the read-down rule.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.800
It's also called the simple
security property.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.350
So how about writes?

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.130
Because you both need,
you need to address both read and write.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.669
So user with label L1 can
write document with level

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.840
L2 when L1 is dominated by L2.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.340
This is saying the user has to
be at a level that is lower than

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.260
the level at which
the document is classified.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.727
Which means if the user is secret,
he can write a top-secret document,

00:02:25.727 --> 00:02:28.590
he cannot write
an unclassified document.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.860
This is the write-up rule.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.223
So you can read down, but
you have to write-up, and

00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:34.740
it's called the star property.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.050
So let's just see what's the sort
of rationale for writing up.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.140
Remember, our focus is
on confidentiality or

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.060
disclosure of information.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.102
This model says more sensitive
information cannot flow.

00:02:46.102 --> 00:02:49.280
Well, the information flow
control requirement that we had.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.860
So more sensitive information
should not flow to users

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.910
who are not cleared at that level.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.035
It's basically focusing on disclosure.

00:02:57.035 --> 00:03:00.125
It doesn't say anything about
who can write information.

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:05.595
That's sort of an integrity question and
we have to revisit that perhaps.

00:03:05.595 --> 00:03:08.710
But if I can write at my level or
at a higher level.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.790
If I could write at the lower level,
then what could go wrong?

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.790
Well, I may have in my possession some
information that is more sensitive.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.291
If I write it into a document that's
at the lower level, then someone who's

00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:22.645
cleared at the lower level can in
the future come and read that document.

00:03:22.645 --> 00:03:25.605
Which means we would have
information flow from a more

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:29.704
sensitive level to a level and to a user
who should not have access to that.

00:03:29.704 --> 00:03:32.170
So, you can't allow write downs.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.260
You can question why would
an unclassified user have information

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.280
that is top secret?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.200
But if they did write a top secret
document, a top secret user would read

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.990
it, as information flow from
unclassified to top secret.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.060
But that doesn't,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.720
while with the confidentiality
requirement that we have.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.240
So think about, a request comes.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.410
User has the users label.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.730
The target is a document that the user
wants to access, had its own label.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.140
We can do this comparison
if the read request is,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.230
user is making a read request.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.670
Then the user label better
dominates the documents label,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.690
to satisfy the simple security
property of the read-down rule.
