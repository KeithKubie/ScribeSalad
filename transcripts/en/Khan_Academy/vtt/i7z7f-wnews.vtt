00:00:00.484 --> 00:00:02.351
- [Voiceover] In previous
videos on cell signaling,

00:00:02.351 --> 00:00:04.928
we talk about the idea
that if we have a cell

00:00:04.928 --> 00:00:08.807
right over there and let's say
it has some type of receptor.

00:00:08.807 --> 00:00:11.325
It doesn't actually have to
be on the cellular membrane,

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:12.712
but I'll put it there for now.

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:18.523
It can bind to some ligand,
that when the ligand

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:22.365
binds to the receptor and
it's usually particular,

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:23.715
the ligand is usually particular

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:25.339
to the receptor and vice versa,

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.984
it can set off a whole cascade of events.

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:32.289
In particular, once it binds,
so let me actually draw

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.288
the ligand bound to the receptor,

00:00:35.288 --> 00:00:38.376
you can have a signal that
tells the cell to do something.

00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:41.186
It might activate some
genes, it might change

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:43.650
the metabolism of the cell in some way.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.387
And this signal that goes from
the receptor into the cell

00:00:46.387 --> 00:00:48.326
to make the cell behave in some way,

00:00:48.326 --> 00:00:50.965
we call that signal transduction.

00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:55.791
We call it transduction,
signal transduction.

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:57.092
In the previous video, I was kind of

00:00:57.092 --> 00:00:58.624
hand wavy about it, and
you might have been saying,

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:02.653
"Well how does a signal
actually go into the cell?

00:01:02.653 --> 00:01:04.360
"How does it actually
move through the cell

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.610
"and how does it actually
make things happen?"

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.362
And what I wanna do in
this video is I'm not gonna

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:09.956
go into all of the details,
but I'm gonna give you

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:14.514
an appreciation for how
transduction can actually occur.

00:01:14.514 --> 00:01:16.653
Hopefully it'll also give you appreciation

00:01:16.653 --> 00:01:19.093
for how complex biological systems,

00:01:19.093 --> 00:01:20.857
including you and me, and even each of our

00:01:20.857 --> 00:01:23.388
individual cells actually are.

00:01:23.388 --> 00:01:26.651
So this pathway that we're seeing up here,

00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:28.392
and you can see that
there's a bunch of pathways

00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:30.958
that all kind of work together and overlap

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.926
in terms of the enzymes and
the proteins that are involved.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.486
This, as the diagram calls,

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:38.941
is the Classical Map kinase pathway.

00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:41.093
If you're wondering, "What
does Map kinase stand for?"

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:44.616
And oftentimes people will
just say MAPK or M-A-P-K,

00:01:44.616 --> 00:01:47.525
it stands for mitogen, M for mitogen,

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:50.788
mitogen-activated protein kinases.

00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:55.732
And you might be saying,
"What does mitogen mean?"

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:59.820
Well, mitogen refers to
things that cause cells

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.652
to mitose, to actually

00:02:03.652 --> 00:02:08.168
go into mitosis, to start
replicating themselves.

00:02:08.168 --> 00:02:10.963
Now, what is mitogen-activated?

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:14.727
So this pathway is going to
be activated by a mitogen.

00:02:14.727 --> 00:02:18.755
Mitogen-acivated protein kinase.

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:19.928
Well, a protein kinase,

00:02:19.928 --> 00:02:23.124
a kinase, and we've seen
kinases multiple times.

00:02:23.124 --> 00:02:26.444
They're involved in many, many,
many biological mechanisms.

00:02:26.444 --> 00:02:28.590
These are general term for enzymes

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.331
that help take a higher energy phosphate,

00:02:31.331 --> 00:02:33.224
or especially, I should
say, a higher energy bond

00:02:33.224 --> 00:02:35.552
or a phosphate, part of an ATP

00:02:35.552 --> 00:02:38.782
or a GTP and transfers them
to different molecules,

00:02:38.782 --> 00:02:40.574
and as they transfer them
to different molecules,

00:02:40.574 --> 00:02:42.342
it's able to leverage that energy

00:02:42.342 --> 00:02:45.505
to actually facilitate
some type of a mechanism.

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:48.137
Now, as I said, I'm not gonna
go into all the details here.

00:02:48.137 --> 00:02:49.546
This is actually quite complex,

00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:51.125
but I want to make a
little bit sense of it.

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:53.377
And we're actually gonna talk about

00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:56.790
a few proteins and a few
enzymes that are actually

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.250
fairly important to modern
biological research.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.259
So what you have right over here,

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.660
I'll start with this
molecule right over here.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.339
This is the ligand.

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.619
This is the ligand, it's
going to be released

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.760
by some other part of
the biological system,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.203
from some other cell.

00:03:15.203 --> 00:03:20.154
And this EGF, this stands
for epidermal growth factor.

00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:23.551
The 1986 Nobel Prize in
medicine was actually given

00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:27.255
for the discovery of EGF,
of epidermal growth factor.

00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:28.822
Now this is going to be the ligand,

00:03:28.822 --> 00:03:31.910
and this is essentially when this attaches

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.428
or when this binds to a receptor,

00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:37.495
that's going to cause a
signal to be transduced.

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:40.084
You're gonna have the
transduction going into the cell.

00:03:40.084 --> 00:03:41.888
And so you can imagine, it's going to bind

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.466
to this membrane receptor,

00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:47.286
and so EGFR literally stands for

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:51.837
epidermal growth factor
receptor, EGF receptor.

00:03:51.837 --> 00:03:55.158
And it's part of this protein
complex and once this binds,

00:03:55.158 --> 00:03:59.432
it's able to help activate

00:03:59.432 --> 00:04:01.384
RAS right over here.

00:04:01.384 --> 00:04:03.693
RAS, once again, all of these names,

00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:06.063
they have these interesting
histories associated with them.

00:04:06.063 --> 00:04:08.239
This stands for rat sarcoma,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.155
and sarcomas are cancers

00:04:14.155 --> 00:04:16.813
in certain tissues in the body.

00:04:16.813 --> 00:04:19.889
It was first discovered
associated with certain cancers,

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.952
that rats that had certain sarcomas,

00:04:23.952 --> 00:04:26.392
that they were able to see
that there were mutations

00:04:26.392 --> 00:04:30.187
in the genes that
produced the RAS protein.

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:33.426
Because of those
mutations, the RAS protein

00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:35.914
that the enzymes associated with it

00:04:35.914 --> 00:04:37.861
were in their activated mode.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.394
And because they were
in the activated mode,

00:04:39.394 --> 00:04:42.146
this mechanism was kind of overactive.

00:04:42.146 --> 00:04:46.650
And any of the stop signals
weren't actually happening.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.181
And so you could imagine a
mechanism right over here

00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:51.259
that is about cell differentiation,

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.150
that if this mechanism
proceeds, it's eventually

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.622
going to tell the DNA,
some portions of the DNA,

00:04:57.622 --> 00:04:59.355
especially the portions of the DNA

00:04:59.355 --> 00:05:02.118
that are involved with DNA replication,

00:05:02.118 --> 00:05:04.292
with cell division, with mitosis,

00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:05.192
those are gonna go crazy,

00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:07.584
and that's exactly what happens in cancer.

00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:08.988
So this pathway is actually

00:05:08.988 --> 00:05:11.217
a very important pathway in cancer.

00:05:11.217 --> 00:05:14.173
You see right over here, you
actually see the Map kinase,

00:05:14.173 --> 00:05:17.240
it's often called, or was
originally called ERK,

00:05:18.162 --> 00:05:21.353
which is extracellular
signal regulated kinase.

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:24.082
But this in an incredibly
important pathway

00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:27.857
to cancer researchers, and
they actively are looking for

00:05:27.857 --> 00:05:30.374
different types of drugs,
different types of molecules

00:05:30.374 --> 00:05:33.604
that can down regulate
this type of pathway.

00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:35.227
So the whole point of
this video, once again,

00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:37.119
I'm not going into all of the details

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:39.559
on the Map kinase pathway,

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:40.989
was to give you an appreciation

00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:42.788
for how complex transduction is.

00:05:42.788 --> 00:05:46.446
You have this cascade of
this signal which is really

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.763
these phosphate groups
originally transferred

00:05:48.763 --> 00:05:53.763
from a GTP going to Ras,
and it keeps cascading down

00:05:53.784 --> 00:05:57.950
all the way until you actually
have the DNA being told to,

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.659
or you start activating mechanisms

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:06.185
where the DNA is going
to start replicating,

00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:07.789
and then the cell itself

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.920
is going to proliferate and differentiate.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.518
This needs to happen in practically
every cells in our body,

00:06:14.518 --> 00:06:18.419
but there's all sorts of kind of factors

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.719
that keep it from going crazy.

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:21.941
But if you have a
mutation in something like

00:06:21.941 --> 00:06:25.082
the Ras gene which codes
for the Ras protein,

00:06:25.082 --> 00:06:28.143
then you could end up with
an actual cancer cell.

00:06:28.143 --> 00:06:30.138
So hopefully this give you a
little bit more appreciation

00:06:30.138 --> 00:06:32.773
for how transduction actually occurs.
