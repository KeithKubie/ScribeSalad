00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.700
 I am Jack Nugent, you are watching Now You See it 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.100
 Let's talk about how the villain agent really laughs at you. 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.980
 Quentin Tarantino is one of the most popular and violent directors 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.300
 His films focus on the violence that people commit. 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.960
 A group of criminals killed the hired killer 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.780
 a black market munition smuggler killing 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.340
 A former killer who kills for revenge 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.000
 A special force targeting the Nazis during World War II 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.920
 And more hired killers 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.200
 Finally, his latest work "The Eight Evils" will be released in the fall of 2015. 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.160
 Will be played by Hawthorn Jackson as the hired killer you guessed. 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.800
 Undoubtedly Quentin Tarantino's movie 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 Especially his relatively high shooting budget 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.700
 Brought a lot of super crazy deaths 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.380
 The magazine "Floating World" has done a great chart. 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.820
 Count how many people died in Quentin’s movie 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 Shows how violent Quentin’s movies are. 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.180
 His eighth film, The Villain, is no exception. 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.040
 The whole film killed 57 people. 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.720
 Does not include the 342 people who died in the fire and fear. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.680
 On average, every two and a half minutes, one person will die. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.140
 Really have enough bad guys 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.960
 Even the movie is so violent 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.040
 The villain agent still gains commercial success 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.420
 And created a box office of more than 300 million US dollars 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.800
 Also won eight Oscar nominations 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.180
 Most Quentin movies have excellent box office results. 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.980
 In fact, in the nine films directed by Quentin 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 Eight have earned three times more than the budget. 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.500
 So how do we explain the audience we bought to watch his movie? 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.640
 Do we like violence? 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 Are we right to watch people who die in the movies? 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.520
 Quentin knows that while presenting a violent image 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.140
 It is also unlikely to criticize those who seek violent images. 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.520
 So he chooses entertainment 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.180
 Let's take a look at "The villain" 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.060
 And see how Quentin criticizes those who admire violence. 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.660
 "The Evil Agent" tells a unit named the villain agent during World War II. 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.480
 Their mission is to blow up a screening of the German propaganda film. 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.520
 And there are a number of Nazi officers attending the cinema. 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.540
 Including Hitler himself 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.980
 This promo is about a Nazi soldier named Frederick Zoller. 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.860
 He killed 215 Russian soldiers in the clock tower alone. 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.060
 The title of this film is regarded as "the glory of the country" is extremely violent 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.800
 We can see that 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.300
 In the film, there are many pictures of Frederick Zoller shooting Russian soldiers. 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.940
 Nazi members are quite fond of 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.700
 They laughed and admired these death pictures. 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.940
 Hitler even praised the film director 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.880
 This is your best movie so far. 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.080
 We can’t help but watch these audiences appreciate the glory of the country. 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.440
 And I feel a little ridiculous and absurd 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.560
 They watched these repeated, monotonous and unnecessary kills 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.260
 And think that this movie is simply a god 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.100
 For us, this is just a movie with a rough scene. 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.660
 But please think carefully 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.680
 Don't you think it sounds familiar? 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.060
 These Nazi members are watching promotional movies. 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.580
 Just like we are watching this movie 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.300
 This is a movie in a movie. 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.880
 When we see the reaction of Quentin's super shot 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.980
 Isn't that the same? 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.220
 I want to say that Quentin is going to express 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.220
 When we are watching "The villain" 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.060
 It’s no different from Nazi party members watching the Glory of the Country. 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.220
 We will cheer 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.940
 Even if it is a boring, over-beautified and unnecessary violent death shot 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.920
 We saw too many violent shots in The Villain 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.740
 Even the Nazis who watched the Glory of the Country 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.220
 Deep in the plan to blow up the cinema 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.000
 Even the cinema owner is in another wave of plans 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.780
 I plan to burn a whole cinema and seal all the exits. 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.520
 Let the Nazi party members get trapped and burned 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.320
 Even the task of killing all Nazi members has been successful. 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.100
 They are still shooting at the Nazi party members. 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.820
 More unnecessary violence 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880
 Then blow up the entire movie theater 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.340
 Then more unnecessary violence shots 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.600
 The whole film is full of absurd violence 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.840
 People cut off the scalp 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.700
 Smash with a bat to death 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.360
 There is also a gun to beat the eggs. 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.240
 In The Glory of the Country and The Agent of the Villain 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.060
 There are too many violent shots 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.560
 Similarities are more than these 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.520
 The protagonists of both films use the knife to engrave the Nazi symbols. 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.560
 And they are very loyal to their country. 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.480
 There are even a few shots that are very similar in both pieces. 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.200
 Take a look at the shot of this person flying from the explosion of the cinema. 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.200
 And this shot is in the "Glory of the Country" 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.780
 Quentin wants to express his own film and is not far from the glory of the country. 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.160
 Even the title can be compared 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.140
 "Shameless bastard" and "the glory of the country" are completely opposite meanings. 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.200
 This film is so similar to the audience. 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.620
 We watched "The Villain" 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.940
 Nazi party members watch "The Glory of the Country" 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.720
 We all appreciate the violence in the film. 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.600
 We all cheer for death 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.860
 We are all guilty of brutal killings. 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.660
 Through our comparison with Nazi members 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.240
 Quentin criticizes the excessive violence we love 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.120
 We are a group of cold-blooded feelings of brutality 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.040
 And the ignorant viewers who can also find fun 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.160
 Similarly, Nazi members are also portrayed as simple minds. 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.080
 Can also find fun from the brutal "Glory of the Country" 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.180
 Quentin is teasing us 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.520
 The story he said is as ridiculous as the Nazi party members saw. 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.940
 Look at other violent shots 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.360
 Even his villain agents are doing everything they need. 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.840
 Quentin did the same thing in all his movies. 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.300
 He sometimes uses death to make comedy effects. 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.620
 He let the audience enter a world where death will become a wonderful point. 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.700
 But there are more meanings 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.260
 The distance across the screen makes us feel less irritating 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.340
 When we watch a movie, we can tell that this is different from real death. 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.760
 Quentin knows that this distance of death will be funny. 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.240
 "The Glory of the Country" is a parable that tells us how ridiculous this is. 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.920
 Do we praise the violence in the film and criticize the reality is not hypocritical? 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.460
 There is another interesting story about these two films and their respective audiences. 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.640
 When the Glory of the Country is being shown 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.800
 Susanna shot the real Frederick 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.560
 But no Nazi audience found 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.220
 Because they are addicted to the violence in the movie 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.460
 They thought that the gunshots were the sound effects of the movie. 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.160
 Does Quentin comment on us? 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.320
 Explain how we don't express our opinions or care about the real world. 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.760
 And only focus on the movies we love. 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.940
 "The villain" is not the only movie that criticizes the audience. 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.560
 Any movie shown to the audience 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.060
 It’s possible that the director is trying to criticize the audience of the movie. 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.260
 "Wolf of Wall Street" tells a corrupt businessman named Jordan Belfort 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.540
 Ups and downs 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.400
 He is unfaithful to his wife 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.120
 Stealing thousands of people’s money 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.100
 Later I understood the people who really love him. 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.460
 And stayed in prison for a few years 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.340
 Theoretically speaking 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.500
 We should think that Jordan Belfort is a dishonest and despicable man. 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.400
 But look at the expressions of the audience in the final scene. 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.320
 Do they seem to despise him? 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.900
 They worship him and want to be like him 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.940
 Fame and fortune, no matter how much dishonesty and thieves 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.360
 Just like "The villain agent" 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.120
 The director let us see the defects of the audience. 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.880
 Is Jordan Belfort really the kind of person we should strive to be? 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.800
 Smart directors can use the audience or the crowd to summarize the whole society. 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.060
 After all, this is the most interesting place. 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.380
 When the arguments are centered around the audience watching the movie 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.840
 Who is far from perfect? 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.240
 So when you see another movie next time 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.180
 Ask yourself if they are laughing at me?
