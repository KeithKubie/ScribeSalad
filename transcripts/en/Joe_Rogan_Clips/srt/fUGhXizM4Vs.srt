1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,530
So, uh, apparently Ron, why you have a
mugshot that we can add to our collection?

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:09,190
Yeah, I'll get one over here. I'll have
it framed and sent it on up. Uh, oh,

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,450
I made, we'll make sure it's a small
enough to put on that wall out there,

4
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:13,770
you know?
So it'd be a pretty big one.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,250
I'd like to have a pretty
dominant spot over at the, uh,

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,020
tell me what you need experience.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,980
I'll give you a fucking six foot tall
one brother. All right. All right.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,310
So that's it. Six foot tall life
size. Yeah. Get a free fuck it.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,800
Yeah, it was a bad picture. Yeah, they
were really bad. So, uh, this, we're,

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,160
we're talking about this, this
is a, you got busted for weed.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,470
Somebody ratted you out that
there was weed on your plane that,

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,370
that they didn't say there
was a weed on my plane.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,260
They said it was a drug smuggling plane.
Oh.

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,600
And so there's a hotline that you can
call and they just pilots that had fired

15
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:50,640
and,
and uh,

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,380
and so I'm just sitting on the plane
looking out the window and there's drug

17
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:58,710
dogs and people in invest and
machine guns and I'm like,

18
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,920
what's going on out
there? Well, but you know,

19
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:04,410
as soon as they determined
that that's not what it was,

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,610
that I just had some personal,

21
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:09,090
we'd that obviously somebody called
in and allied instead of going in and

22
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:12,750
arrested that guy, they took me to
jail then it makes no sense at all.

23
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,550
And then the, in the
newspaper, the sheriff goes,

24
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,880
well he might not have had much pot with
him, but who knows how much he did have.

25
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,620
And who knows,
I didn't kill somebody.

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,730
How about we just put me up for murder
right now if we need no evidence at all.

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,170
You know, is he didn't steal larceny.
How about that something site.

28
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,040
Then they went, they drove by in a pit.

29
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:36,540
They drove by three meth labs in a
dead hooker just to get to my plane.

30
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,741
And they're really,

31
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:42,050
the funny part of it was the next day we
were going to go somewhere else and I'm

32
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,460
in Louisiana and uh, but then now
I've got to, you know, just we,

33
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:48,470
we can get rid of, that's
all we can do. Cause they,

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,860
they might do it again next night,
the next place more dry.

35
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:56,270
So now we've got an apple
were smoking out of there.

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,070
There are two of them on horseback and
Alex feeds that one of the horses as he's

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,340
walking by here, take this little apple
tried, you'd check your plan again.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,740
They did check it again. But we, we just
had come up with this little plan that,

39
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:11,280
uh, you know, we would just would end,

40
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:14,540
he also had to eat a little bag of
weed and he was really stoned onstage,

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,790
really stuff. But we, you know, we, we
didn't go to jail that night. If you eat,

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,720
just eat weed will get you
high. Yeah, absolutely. Will
it take, it takes a while,

43
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:29,720
but it was a big old Chawla of it. I mean,
he do a big old lip, full cheek full.

44
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:33,030
I'm surprised people don't chew. We'd
like. There's no one out there chewing.

45
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:37,110
It tastes like ass dude,
which is why nobody eats.

46
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:40,920
We'd even the cookies, you know they gotta
they gotta watch it to keep in place.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,040
There is a growing number of people
who juice the leaves and drink it.

48
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,380
Yeah.
You know like wheat grass juice.

49
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,760
They do it with the
leaves of cannabis plant.

50
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,050
I've seen people squeeze it to make
the Gig like the concentrate out.

51
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:58,950
So I think they're a, they're sticking
in one of those mass Decatur's.

52
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,480
Is that what they called?
Those things that make a,

53
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,120
you know the wheat grass like he had,

54
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,710
they can get juice at a fucking grass. It
makes sense. If you could get it out of,

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,420
I mean you might get a grass,

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,130
you could get it out of any plant right
behind. You don't get high though.

57
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,740
Like getting a CBD out there. What's
the point for Health Ron? Oh yeah.

58
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,230
You know, it's like Oh duals pot
to tell you what's not bad either.

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,920
The Heineken Shit that we got,
we have Heineken zero, zero,

60
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,580
whatever the fuck it is. It does not
taste bad. It's what areas go, uh,

61
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,420
no alcohol in it, but it tastes so
you don't get that annoying buzz.

62
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,390
I know. No, you don't get down to that.
