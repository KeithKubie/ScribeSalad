00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.720
The Simpsons has some of the most memorable gags

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.640

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.500
done by the most memorable faces

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.740
Marge - "Homey, why don't you just go down to Moe's and talk to him?

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.660
I bet he'd be willing to share some of the success with you"

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.840
Homer - "Nahh"

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.400
With the most memorable catch phrases

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.580
Homer - "Marge, I'm too upset to eat...

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.380
I think I'll go to Moe's

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.580
D-oh!"

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.280
With almost 30 years on television, the show remains a staple in american culture,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.080
so what's the secret that makes the show so legendary?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.140
"Easy...

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.440
easy..."

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.080
The secret is balance.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.080

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.240
The Simpsons had a comediac advantage over every other tv sitcom at the time,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.600
because it was animated.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.240
If it could be drawn, The Simpsons' writers could make the joke,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.880
they could do just about anything, and that made for some hilarious gags

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.960
But what makes The Simpsons so great

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.240
is that the creators chose not to do just about anything

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.100
"There's a hardcore rule, which is, you know, there's a lot of cartoons

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.680
where the impossible can happen.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700
You think about Wile E. Coyote cartoon,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.520
where he can literaly blow up and then come back, and he is

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.520
he's black and he's flat like an acordeon

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.340
it was always made very clear to me

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.580
that this is a real world

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.480
and it gets stretched, obviously, it gets stretched like crazy"

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.480
So why purposely hope back the cartoon jokes?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.120
Homer - "More

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.860
thank you"

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.860
That's the secret behind The Simpsons' success

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.860
"At a certain point it was like: 'This is not a cartoon,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.860
we're making a show that's not a cartoon,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.200
and happens to be a cartoon, but it's not a cartoon.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.320
Now we, as young men

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.320
like the Gooffy cartoon jokes

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.320
and, as silly as they could be, but

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.580
slightly wisened older guys

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.620
said no, approach as a family,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.060
and it was, as you say, I think it's genius.'

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.620
It's through the balance between cartoon gags

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.620
and realistic portrails of family life

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.960
that The Simpsons stands out.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.040
The show had the heart and the realism of a family sitcom

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.760
but the humour of a cartoon. Take Homer's triple by-pass surgery:

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.900
the episode has hilarious gags that could only be done in an animation show

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.900
Smithers - "Mr. Burns, I think he's dead"

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.740
Mr. Burns - "Oh, dear! Send a ham to his widow"

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.220
Homer - "Mmmh mmmh ham"

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.020
Smithers - "No, wait, he's alive"

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.040
Mr. Burns - "Oh, good! Cancel the ham."

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.060
Homer - "D-oh!"

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.500
But the episode is just real enough to have genuinely emotional moments

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.540
Homer - "Don't worry Marge, America's health care system is second only to Japan,

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.660
Canada, Sweden, Great Britain, well all of Europe.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.200
but you can thank your lucky stars we don't live in Paraguay!"

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.080
It's a perfect balance between what's real and what's funny

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.560
"What I try to do with my life's work is to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.560
breach the gap between

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.300
the funny art of this, that I saw in tv

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.300
and what I knew was real.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.560
I think that's partly the success of The Simpsons."

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.860
The result is a show that's funny but also has us connect with the characters.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.560
What makes Homer such a memorable character

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.560
is more than just when he's an idiot:

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.480
the best moments in The Simpsons are when he proves he isn't a caricature

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.860
and he's actually a caring husband and loving father.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.120
Homer - "Oh, my little Maggie, I may never hold you again.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.600
Ew, stinky pants!"

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.780
Shows like Family Guy and South Park are really good at providing social comentary

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.780
and funny gags, but these shows don't have the heart

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.420
and realism of The Simpsons.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.560
The Simpsons has the perfect balance.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.560
So whenever The Simpsons has episodes on an specific topic,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.780
like politics, marriage or religion,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.780
the episodes tipically have sincere lessons

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.460
along with the edgy jokes and social commentary

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.760
The Simpsons discusses these topics with the perfect combination of humour and sincerity.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.440
Other animated cartoons focus more on telling the more jokes as possible

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.800
rather than presenting a lesson,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.900
and other family sitcoms oftentimes shove a corny message down your throat.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.200
The Simpsons is right in the middle.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.220
Take the episode Bart sells his soul:

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.520
the episode is not without its classic sense of humour.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.160
Milhouse - "But every religion says there's a soul, Bart!

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.960
Why would they lie? What would they have to gain?"

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.460
Reverend Lovejoy - "I don't hear scrubbing!"

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.960
But in between the jokes is a very interesting commentary on religion:

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.300
Bart sells his soul to Milhouse for five dollars

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.320
and he finds himself empty without it,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.880
unable to laugh at his pranks that usually bringed him joy.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.740
The episode actually has extemelly powerful symbolism

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.340
when Bart without his soul is left stranded in an ocean

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.460
and unable to steer himself in the right direction.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.480
The episode has a great wide shout of Bart protesting against spirituality

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.480
in the barren church,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.200
with a heavenly light casting down on him from above

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.820
and an eery echoe in his voice.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.920
Bart - "Listen, you don't have a soul, I don't have a soul, there's no such thing as a soul!"

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.720
Through his spiritual journey he realizes the value of his soul.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.620
The episode conveys the message that one's spirituality

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.960
is not given by some church or by anyone else,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.580
it's created internally

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.640
and The Simpsons gives all this philosophical thought in a cartoon.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.460
I'm not saying that The Simpsons is the funniest, most thematic or most realistic show,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.900
but what I am saying is that it is one of the few shows to balance

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.360
each of these three elements almost perfectly.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.400
Of course the glaring unanswered question is:

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.120
what happened?

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.040
Just about every Simpsons' video on YouTube has a top comment

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.860
about the show's declining quality

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.820
and while people atribute many factors to the decline of The Simpsons

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.280
like bad show runners, bland story lines,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.960
lazy writting or overused celebrity cameo appearances,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.180
I think the declines could possibly be summed up

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.260
by saying The Simpsons lost its balance.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.060
A Slate magazine review of the show sums it up nicely.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.380
Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.340
bicycling into the sunset, now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dard into Marge's neck

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.640
Homer - "Thank you"

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.440
Even in the new HD opening title sequence

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.580
we can see the subtle change in a show that's more cartoon than reality.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.720
The majority of television shows never mantain the balancing act The Simpsons accomplished

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.720
although that's not necessarilly a bad thing.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.440
Some shows are mostly to make you laugh

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.880
or are mostly to make you feel

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.260
and that doesn't make them bad shows,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.320
but what makes The Simpsons so legendary

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.040
is that they were able to have the laughter and the heart.
