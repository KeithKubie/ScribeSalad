00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.388
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:05.860
- Good morning, everyone.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.700
It's wonderful to see you.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.610
I am Tomiko Brown-Nagin, the
dean of the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.460
for Advanced Study here
at Harvard University.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.870
Welcome to our annual gender
conference, focused this year

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.170
on the intersection of
gender and communication

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.780
beyond spoken words.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.510
Last night, we kicked
off our conference

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.120
with an exploration
of communication

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.430
through the lens
of drag culture.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.370
It was quite a great evening.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.320
If you couldn't
join us, I encourage

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.790
you to watch the recording
of that evening that'll

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.350
be posted online.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.280
Today, we consider the
aesthetics of communication

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.750
through topics as diverse
as tattoos, perfume,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.970
animal behavior, robots,
sign language, and dance.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.790
The program will engage
our minds and senses.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.370
And I expect it'll
reveal aspects

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.980
of unspoken communication
that many of us

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.250
might not have
considered before.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.920
Interdisciplinarity
is the very core

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.360
of what we do here at Radcliffe,
and it permeates every session

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.550
of this convening.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.680
As we engage today,
I hope you'll

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.320
keep in mind yesterday
evening's discussion

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.970
and consider how the examples of
bodily communication we explore

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.160
relate to issues of
equity, opportunity,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.950
and inclusion, another
core element of Radcliffe's

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.570
identity.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.250
It's still a reality that
many individuals are demeaned,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.490
devalued, and discriminated
against because of how they

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.100
express their gender
identity and how

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.200
others perceive it are for
pushing against gender norms.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.790
This past fall, a public
library system in Louisiana

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.790
prohibited a story
hour event because it

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.290
would feature drag queens
reading children's books.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.810
Similar reading programs
exist across the country,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.160
including here in the
Cambridge-Boston area.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.900
And so, too, do efforts
to censor drag performers,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.000
whether in libraries,
onstage, or elsewhere.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.790
In our nation's schools,
students are frequently

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.070
disciplined because
their appearance

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.220
violates dress codes that hinge
on traditional gender norms.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.920
And research shows
that these dress codes

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.330
are disproportionately enforced
against black girls, who

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.050
tend to be perceived by
adults as less innocent, more

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.810
adult-like, and more sexual as
compared to their white peers.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.120
Transgender and
gender-nonconforming

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.810
individuals experience
mistreatment, discrimination,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.160
and even violence at
particularly alarming rates.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.030
A staggering 83% of
transgender youth

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.250
and 69% of gender-nonconforming
youth in grades 6 through 12

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.300
report being bullied
or harassed at school.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.270
I mention these examples because
they illustrate the importance

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.630
of thinking intersectionally.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.720
Bodily communication
and how others perceive

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.810
that communication varies
in meaningful ways,

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.720
not only across
gender but also as

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.100
to race, sexual orientation,
class, ability, nationality,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.690
and so much more.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.940
This is something to keep
in the back of our minds

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.030
today as we dive into
this illuminating

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.440
conversation focused on the
aesthetics of communication.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.970
In a moment, I'll
turn things over

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.910
to my colleague, Professor
Shigehisa Kuriyama,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.180
who conceptualized
this conference

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.110
and who will introduce
today's program.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.030
Hisa is the faculty director
of the humanities at Radcliffe

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.070
and the Reischauer
Institute Professor

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.830
of Cultural History in the
faculty of arts and sciences

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.330
here at Harvard.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.510
But first, let me express
my thanks to everyone who's

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.400
made this convening possible.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.400
I'm very grateful to Hisa
and to all of our speakers,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.680
moderators, and performers.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.040
Let me also thank Rebecca
Wassarman, executive director

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.610
of academic ventures here at
Radcliffe, Jessica Viklund,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.300
director of events, and the
entire ventures and events

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.950
teams.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.880
I also want to recognize members
of the Radcliffe Institute

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.050
Leadership Society and all of
our dedicated annual donors.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.770
Radcliffe's lectures,
conferences, exhibitions,

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.140
and collections
are free and open

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.950
to the public because of
your generous support.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.390
Thank you.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.760
And finally, thanks to
all of you in the audience

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.680
for joining us.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.600
We're happy to have you here.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.960
With that, please join me in
warmly welcoming Hisa Kuriyama.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.460
Hisa.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.855
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:06.025 --> 00:05:06.650
- Good morning.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.636
- Good morning.

00:05:11.087 --> 00:05:13.059
- Ba.

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.045
- Ba.

00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:15.524
- Ba.

00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:17.003
- Ba.

00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:17.990
- Ba.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.208
- Ba.

00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:20.186
- Ba.

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:21.164
- Ba.

00:05:21.164 --> 00:05:22.131
- Ba.

00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:22.631
- Ba.

00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:24.098
- Ba.

00:05:24.098 --> 00:05:25.565
- Ba.

00:05:25.565 --> 00:05:26.532
Ba.

00:05:26.532 --> 00:05:27.032
Ba.

00:05:27.032 --> 00:05:27.521
Ba.

00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:28.010
Ba.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.510
Ba.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.966
Ba.

00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:33.389
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.777
- These two examples--

00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:36.860
I only have three minutes.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.290
So these two examples are
used to illustrate the two

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.580
key points that I'd like you to
take away from my introduction.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.890
One is there are illustrations
of how much communication

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.220
occurs beyond what's
explicitly given.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.750
If I just said good
morning, then you'd

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.090
just take it as something
to be listened to.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.160
If I say good morning
a different way,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.570
then you know to answer.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.970
Similarly, with--
let's try this.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.940
Ba.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.880
- Ba Ba.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.835
Ba.

00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:15.335
Ba.

00:06:15.335 --> 00:06:15.820
Ba.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.320
Ba.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:22.325
- That's the other aspect
that you will have to think.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.760
So the first point
is really about

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.190
how there's so much more
communicated than usually

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.060
we just explicitly express.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.370
The second important
point, I think,

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.010
about particularly
this conference

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.790
is that we really do conceive
of this as a participatory kind

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.470
of event.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.160
I think many of the speakers
will engage you directly.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.930
But even if you're
just listening,

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.470
I'd like you to listen actively.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.200
There'll be a question period
for each of the panels.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.900
And as you listen, think
about the questions

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.420
not only that you want
to ask, which, of course,

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.050
is important, but also what
you think the speaker wants

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.520
to speak more about.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.960
We have a fantastic, really,
an all-star cast of speakers.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.710
They only have a very short
period of time to speak.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.710
And if you give
them an opportunity

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.020
to elaborate on
something that they

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.330
want to speak but they don't
have the time to speak,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.540
then they'll be
eternally grateful.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.210
So with that, let
me proceed directly

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.710
to our first speaker, who
will provide some framing

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.220
for the idea of communication.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.420
And this is Professor
John Durham Peters,

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.810
who is the María Rosa--

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.560
Meno-cul?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.380
- Menocal.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.270
- --Menocal Professor of English
and professor of film and media

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.620
studies at Yale University.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.100
He's the author of many
books, but the book

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.740
I'd like to draw your
attention to in particular

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.340
is Speaking into the Air--

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.650
A History of the Idea of
Communication, because this

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.720
is actually the book which--

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.150
and it's a book I
highly recommend.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.430
It's the book that
gave me, actually,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.470
the idea for this conference.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.433
So it's with tremendous delight
that I welcome Professor Peters

00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:17.600
to give the framing remarks.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.988
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:21.488 --> 00:08:22.460
- Thank you.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.432
Thank you so much.

00:08:23.432 --> 00:08:26.350
Thank you.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.580
My dear fellow embodied
beings, good morning.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.120
Today is the 10th birthday
of my oldest granddaughter,

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.429
Libby Anne Lambert Peters.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:41.710
And this is the way that I met
Libby, as an ultrasound image.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.059
You can kind of
see her face there.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.770
But the first thing I knew
about Libby was her gender.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.660
And her gender preceded her.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.160
Her gender goes with her.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.690
Her gender is pervasive
in all kinds of ways.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:01.750
Obviously, gender saturates our
world, our bodies, and the ways

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.880
that we interact, the ways that
grandfathers and granddaughters

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.380
interact.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.090
I haven't talked with her
yet today, but I plan to.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.810
The drag performance last
night kept making me think--

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.220
this might sound strange--

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.660
of the aesthetic theory of
the great and gnarly thinker

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.130
Theodor Adorno, who might
actually have liked drag.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.110
He'd like circus acts and
the burlesque, for sure.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.460
For him, aesthetics was the
claim of an artful justice

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.530
in a broken world.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:37.360
Gender, a topic otherwise
so pervasive and so painful,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.120
one that is so weighty
and has so much at stake,

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.330
that's so wonderful
and so on omnipresent,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.680
in drag is briefly transfigured
into an art, a florid zone

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.500
of freedom, choice, and play.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.830
As Adorno somewhere said,
"In a perfect society,

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.510
the only thing
that would survive

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.020
the injury of the
difference between the sexes

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.340
is the happiness that
it makes possible."

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.100
Another sense of
aesthetics is to emphasize

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.140
embodied sensation.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.200
Here comes the
obligatory etymology.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.860
[GREEK] in ancient
Greek means "I sense."

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.320
So the very notion
of aesthetics has

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.910
to do with embodied concrete
sensation-- eyes, ears,

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.770
tactility, taste,
kinesthetic, all the ways

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.160
that we exist in the world.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.910
So aesthetics-- I am very
happy that that's our theme--

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.290
is much better than
epistemology when

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.420
we talk about communication.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.140
The history of the
term "communication--"

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.820
it's a very odd
history because it

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.960
tends to be medium
neutral or medium hostile.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.900
That is that successful
communication was long

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.990
understood as being the
disappearance of the medium

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:00.130
and a kind of demure
self-sacrifice in which

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:06.610
some precious, elusive
substance shines through,

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.100
such as mind or meaning.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.260
Now, this sense of
communication we

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.450
get from an older sense
of the term [GREEK],,

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.810
or transmission, really,
of some kind of element

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.480
through a medium, such as glass.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.440
The element is often something
like electricity, magnetism,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.860
or ether.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.630
So these physical processes
which allow for connection

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:35.560
across distance of
precious substances

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.800
came to refer to the
way that minds interact

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.830
in the philosophy of John
Locke in the Essay Concerning

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.160
Human Understanding
of 1690 in which he

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
talked about the
communication of ideas.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.740
Locke gave us this
eternal problem

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.710
when we think about
communication of epistemology,

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.290
is how do you know what's
in the other's head?

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.760
How do you get your ideas
in the other person's head?

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.790
This notion of
communication was reinforced

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.910
in the 19th century
when electricity became

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.660
the means of connecting people,
thanks to the telegraph,

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:15.250
telephone, phonograph,
also via fast mails.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.590
These were
ghost-multiplying media,

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.980
as Franz Kafka memorably put it.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:26.350
Now, of course we all depend
upon accurate transmission.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.660
That's obviously important.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.310
But there's a lot of
conceptual collateral damage.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.540
If a term whose chief
value is accuracy

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:43.210
comes to describe the human
interaction in general,

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.700
moving a signal is
not the same as doing

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.940
the hard work of
inhabiting a common space

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.980
or working together to
create mutual understanding.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.730
And the term "communication"
took on this expansive sense--

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.420
again, a celebration on my
part of aesthetics rather than

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.580
epistemology.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.440
An even weirder
part of the history

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.670
is this term "nonverbal
communication,"

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.530
which first seems to have
been used in the 1950s--

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:16.090
that's very late-- by the
Swiss-American psychiatrist

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.490
Jurgen Ruesch in a book.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.280
Now, of course, notions
of nonverbal communication

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.440
were found among
ethologists, including

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.580
Charles Darwin, before.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.130
And it's funny because
nonverbal is defined negatively

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.190
as everything
which is not words,

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.820
but I think this is such
a constricted conception,

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.320
because everything
that connects us

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.900
with embodiment
and with the cosmos

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.350
somehow gets turned into
something we call nonverbal,

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.410
which is extremely limited.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.570
Nonetheless, the virtue
of the term "nonverbal"

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:55.240
was to reconnect our many
modes of mutual interaction

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.800
with our embodiment.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.300
So the question
of the aesthetics

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.420
of our embedded sociability
is obviously urgent in a time

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.360
when our everyday interaction
in a digital world

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.320
has all of us playing
Turing games, that is,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.910
trying to persuade
others that we

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.360
are human with no other
medium than a keyboard.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.250
When I talk to my
granddaughter today,

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.390
I hope we can
FaceTime, not text.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.610
But who's a bot, and who's not?

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.580
This is a question that I can't
always tell the answer for,

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.740
especially when I'm
looking in the mirror.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.670
But we find ourselves
embedded and diffused

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.230
in our various modes of being
in the world with other people.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.360
And embodiment
always has a gender.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.940
The voice, for my money,
is one of the most

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.150
interesting and
stubborn gender markers,

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.010
as we might talk about.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.670
There are very few female
contrabasses, very few

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.190
male sopranos,
unless they've been

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.780
doctored so that they don't have
testosterone, they're castrati.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.480
So what I've done so far
in this very brief talk

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.140
is follow a strategy
of de-naturalization

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.710
by looking at the
history of words

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.470
to show how things could
have been otherwise.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.800
And indeed, in gender-critical
work for the past 50 years,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.750
de-naturalization has been
one of the major strategies,

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.950
and justly so, because to
say that gender is natural

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:28.855
can have obvious toxic
ideological side effects.

00:15:28.855 --> 00:15:31.720
Nature has been conceived in
the realm of gender studies

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.630
as culture in
disguise, as an enemy

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:39.850
or an untrustworthy
breeding ground of ideology.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.980
So then we have this
very deep suspicion

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.700
of nature talk with regard
to gender and, of course,

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.240
with regard to race,
ethnicity, sexuality,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.420
and other modes of
human difference.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.480
We like to insist upon
gender as fluid, constructed,

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.320
performative.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.260
Now, they say climate
is what you expect.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.020
Weather is what you get.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.430
That's a handy breakdown.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.070
I'd suggest something similar.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.170
Sex is the naked body.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.630
Gender is the dressed body.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.200
I think this is a more robust
distinction than biology

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.480
and culture because
of the stubborn way

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.380
that biology and culture mingle
in the domain of embodiment,

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.910
such as Iris Marion Young's
famous, fabulous essay

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.450
on throwing like a girl
from 1978 in which she shows

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.290
that she doesn't
think that women have

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.670
inferior ballistic capacities
or anatomy compared with men,

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.790
but in a patriarchal culture,
that modes of motility

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.255
and movement are actually
built into the musculature,

00:16:44.255 --> 00:16:49.460
to the nervous tone, to the gait
such that oppression becomes

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.560
genuinely embodied and real.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.910
And so it's hard to
tell where ontology ends

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.010
and history begins.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:03.080
And indeed, in no domain
is the confusion or fusion

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.170
of reality and contingency
so clear as in gender.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.700
Gender is both fully real
and fully constructed.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.550
When the drag performers
last night held up signs

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.910
announcing in bold letters
"me" on the other side

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.369
of a gender-ambiguous
placard, I think

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.740
the manifest point
was supposed to be

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.859
to celebrate an authentic
kind of homecoming

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.319
or therapeutic self acceptance.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:30.290
But the more obvious and
perhaps even more radical

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.100
interpretation was to show
that personal identity is

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.830
inseparable from
performance and artifice.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.850
How hard do we want to make
the nature-culture split

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.140
in thinking about gender?

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.230
This is something I'm
generally puzzled about.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.840
A major development recently
in intellectual life

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.770
is a fusion or a meltdown
between STEM fields

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.340
and humanities and an interest
on the part of humanists

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.250
in reclaiming the
category of nature,

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.180
something which humanists,
for a long time,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.050
treated as a dirty word.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.910
On a planet in which
nature is something

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:11.020
that is set apart and
designated as such by humans,

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.270
on a planet in which
anthropogenic meddling

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.310
with nature is visible
from the sea floor

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.000
to the upper atmosphere, when
we think of weather and climate

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.760
as profoundly affected
by human habits,

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:27.010
do we want to hold onto such a
hard distinction between nature

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.690
and culture?

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.900
In any case, what
is nature like?

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.120
Nature is infinitely diverse--

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.100
well, not infinitely,
because it's

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.400
constrained by environments
and all kinds of other things,

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.550
by niches and
their construction.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.140
Wait for my
colleague, Rick Prum,

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.390
to tell you about
bird ornaments.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.570
What a crazy quilt
of variations.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.860
Nature is profligate
with variation.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.370
So I think I can actually
feel comfortable in saying

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.420
gender is natural.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.840
You might want to
fight me on this.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.630
That does not mean
it's fixed or given.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:12.220
Heck, what is fixed or
given in nature anyway?

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.090
What does it mean?

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.580
But it does mean that gender
is ubiquitous and meaningful.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.170
Here's another provocation.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.300
And I get the reasons
for the questionings

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.960
and deconstructions of binary.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.630
But if we want to celebrate
all the varieties of gender

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.530
options, of course the
binary has to be one of them.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:35.610
You can cut the two interlocking
circles to get squares,

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.560
as Hisa did last
night, or you can

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.990
cut them to get united hearts.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.750
There are lots of ways
to make such a split.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.340
Maybe our job is
to figure out how

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.240
to make the two boxes cozier
and friendlier, kinder,

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.990
rather than to abolish
them altogether.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.450
Why have we gotten
used to thinking

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.700
that all the
variation in diversity

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.000
is on the side of culture,
of social construction,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.980
rather than of nature?

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.590
Natural variation can
outstrip anything the wildest

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.540
performer can come up with.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.500
Nature is, of course, the
ultimate drag performer.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.290
So let me conclude
by a meditation

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.370
on this ultimate mystery of
gender, which I've been trying

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.250
to think about and
understand implicitly

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.720
all of my embodied life.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.820
And indeed, they
didn't have ultrasounds

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.830
before I was born but probably
before my embodied life.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:31.430
And I can't think of a topic
more pressing, more painful,

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.760
more interesting, and more
beautiful than gender.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:40.370
But I can't say what it is,
and I can't say what it means.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:45.530
So let us, for a moment, dwell
with the mystery, the mystery

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:50.270
that we are not our own,
that our bodies are not

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.630
our own, that the
plasticity of our bodies

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:58.600
has limits, that our bodies are
made out of stardust, out of--

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.050
it's a poetic saying,
but it's literally true,

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.730
because without the
nucleosynthesis of supernovae,

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.280
we would not have the
complicated chemicals that we

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.860
need to be organic beings.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.430
Our bodies are connected to
agriculture, to nutrition,

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.920
to medicine, to
geography, to history,

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.280
to the mating choices
made by our ancestors.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.150
Our bodies are ultimate
hybrids of nature and culture.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.310
And so to celebrate
the mystery, I

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.200
want to go to one of
my favorite poets,

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.280
who was a first-rate
celebrant of the aesthetics

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.770
of embodied communication,
Walt Whitman.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.730
Whitman wrote, "I diffuse
my flesh in eddies,

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:46.120
and drift it in lacy jags--"
could be drag, right?

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:51.280
So he celebrated the many
forms that embodiment can take.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.730
But the thing that made
Whitman an amazing poet

00:21:54.730 --> 00:22:00.460
was that he included
within the realm of bodily

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.320
being in the world debility
and death and deterioration

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.850
and breakdown.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:11.580
"The translucent mold
of me it shall be you--"

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.870
the stench of armpits.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.530
"I keep as delicate
around the bowels

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.840
as around the head and heart."

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.140
These are all quotes from
Song of Myself so far.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.600
"I resist anything better
than my own diversity."

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.870
"And that a kelson of
the creation is love,

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:35.490
and limitless are leaves stiff
or drooping in the fields,

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.070
and brown ants in the
little wells beneath them,

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.430
and mossy scabs
of the worm fence,

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:46.050
heap'd stones, elder,
mullein, and poke-weed."

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.900
One of the remarkable
things about his poetics

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:55.380
is that he's able to infuse such
a mundane, ordinary scene not

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.360
of glamorous nature but of
leaves drooping, brown ants,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:05.850
mossy scabs with a kind
of reverence or holiness.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:10.170
But Whitman is also aware
of the terror of nature

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.010
and the terror of being
in a body, which we know,

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.820
whatever the plasticity
of our bodies might be,

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:20.560
is always hurtling
inevitably toward death.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.820
So in his poem "This Compost,"
the opening line is "Something

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.330
startles me where I
thought I was safest."

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.970
"Something startles me where
I thought I was safest."

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.370
And this is what I find
always happens with gender.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.640
Something startles me where
I thought I was safest.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.780
This poem, of course, is about
decomposition and compost.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.440
But it's also about composition,
the poetics of compost,

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.730
where in which
composition, compost.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.230
You get it.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:54.310
I mean, he's riffing on
the poetry of compost.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:59.750
So let us end with
Whitman, a final line

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.540
from Song of Myself,
which I think

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:07.940
applies to our embodied being
because bodies imply gender.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.025
"I and this mystery
here we stand."

00:24:11.025 --> 00:24:13.677
"I and this mystery
here we stand."

00:24:13.677 --> 00:24:14.510
Thank you very much.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.933
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:19.889 --> 00:24:22.812
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:22.812 --> 00:24:23.312
questions?

00:24:23.312 --> 00:24:23.801
- Yes.

00:24:23.801 --> 00:24:24.301
- OK.

00:24:24.301 --> 00:24:30.250
- So Professor Peters
will field questions

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.790
on his very provocative talk.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.460
- I wondered if you would
elucidate more about

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:45.030
that idea of if you're
having a spectrum of allowed

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.150
but retaining the binary
is one of those elements.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.890
Can you talk a little
bit more about what

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.515
that conceptualization
would look like?

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.130
- This is a really
difficult thing

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.980
to think through because
it's so sensitive

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.430
and ticklish and delicate,
because it can feel like you're

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:06.420
stomping on hard work that
people have done to carve out

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:10.660
space for modes of being
which have been historically

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.900
stigmatized.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.590
But I think that it's pretty
persistent, as far as I

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:22.740
can tell, that biologically
complementary conspecifics will

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.197
find ways of signaling
that gender difference.

00:25:26.197 --> 00:25:27.780
And the gender
difference is something

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.020
which we're going
to be stuck with

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.990
or to celebrate in a
variety of plastic ways

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:37.800
and that it's not
commonsensical and not

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:43.210
true to the complexity of
our gender being in the world

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:48.240
if we want to abolish some
kind of statistical binary

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:48.810
in general.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.450
I'm not saying everybody has
to fit in one box or another

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.460
but to recognize that--

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.830
well, let's speak
French for a minute.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.190
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.290
Gender is a genre.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.700
It's the same word in French.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.840
And if we could think of
gender as genres of being

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.570
which are family resemblances--

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.730
and I just think that
it's important for us

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:15.270
to be able to think about gender
difference as being something

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.200
which we're not--

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.600
at least in my own
personal cosmology,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.690
it's not something that I'm
interested in abolishing.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.020
I'm interested in rethinking
it, making it more fair,

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.510
more just, more
beautiful, but I'm not

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:35.125
interested in just saying
binaries are only oppressive.

00:26:35.125 --> 00:26:35.750
Does that help?

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.140
- Can I ask one other question?

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:36.800
- Please, yeah.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.400
Yeah.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.900
- And when you're using gender,
it seemed like it was some--

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.250
switching between
biology and expression.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.960
Is that how you're
using the word?

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.570
I just wondered how
you conceived of--

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.310
- Yeah, see, what
I was trying to say

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.590
is that if you have a
conception of gender which

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.730
is purely social construction,
that is not true to the way

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.515
that gender gets
into our bodies.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.330
I mean, the standard
line was to say

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:10.100
that XY, XX, estrogen,
testosterone,

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.610
I mean anatomical
physiology-- that's sex,

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.820
but the gender is clothing
performance, gait, voice,

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.860
style, dress, shaving,
yeah, which one doesn't

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.030
do in the '70s, I think, right?

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:34.270
Yeah, but I don't think you
can rigorously hold to that.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:38.600
So yes, and obviously
I haven't figured out--

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.020
I mean, we're all
trying to figure it out.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:42.800
- Yeah, thank you.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.400
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:43.900
- Thanks.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.710
Yep.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:46.380
- Hi.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.870
Thank you so much
for your remarks.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:52.410
In the beginning, you mentioned
the idea of ghostliness.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.970
And I know that
this is a concept

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.900
that you speak to much
more in your book Speaking

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.690
into the Air.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:00.540
But I'm wondering
specifically how

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.070
you see those concepts of
ghostliness and the ephemeral

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.520
relating to gender.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.560
- That is such a
wonderful question.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.350
How do ghosts show up?

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.800
Ghosts show up by sound.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.690
And sound and voices are so
interesting because they're

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:22.530
disembodied, and yet,
they always mean that--

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:27.540
the gender and race always
seem to sneak back into voices,

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.374
again, in various ways.

00:28:30.374 --> 00:28:33.158
Oh, I don't know.

00:28:33.158 --> 00:28:33.700
I don't know.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.760
And I'll have to
think about this.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.440
But I think that every
medium reorganizes embodiment

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.870
and that embodiment
is always going

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:45.060
to be gendered in
one way or another

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.190
so that when you have a
new medium which allows

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.170
for people to be in touch--

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.990
in touch-- across a
distance that that's

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.620
going to produce all kinds
of weird gender ripples,

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.990
as it does like with the
history of the telephone

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.150
or the history of the radio.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:00.650
- Thank you.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:01.670
- Was that close enough?

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:02.090
- Yes.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.590
Thank you.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:03.303
- OK, thanks.

00:29:03.303 --> 00:29:04.220
- Thank you very much.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.320
