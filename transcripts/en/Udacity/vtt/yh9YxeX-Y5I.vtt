00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.718
Only these two graph parabolas. Which might surprise you. In particular, this

00:00:05.718 --> 00:00:11.073
equation, y equals x squared plus 2 xy plus 1 does not graph a parabola. Even

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:16.383
though there is a x squared term, there's also this term 2 xy. Looking back at

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:20.403
the general form, we don't see any terms here that have both x and y in them

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:24.756
multiplied together, so this does not fit the bill. We'll see this graph in just

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:29.000
a second. And, of course, you'll recognize this graph as a straight line. This

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.330
is linear. Think to yourself what the slope is and what the y-coordinate or the

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.897
y-intercept is. This last answer may also have been a little bit tricky for you.

00:00:37.897 --> 00:00:41.897
I know that right now this doesn't look at all, like this general form equation

00:00:41.897 --> 00:00:45.936
of a parabola. But if we distributed multiplication by what's in this first set

00:00:45.936 --> 00:00:50.136
of parenthesis towards on the second one, we get something pretty interesting.

00:00:50.136 --> 00:00:53.715
In fact, let's look at the graphs for all four of these right now. So here are

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:57.589
the graphs for all 4 of the equations we just looked at. This funny red curve,

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.070
which has a big break in the middle, is the graph that corresponds to the

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.997
equation that we've never seen anything like before. Y equals x squared plus 2

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:08.431
xy plus 1. How funny that this isn't even in one piece. This is called a

00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:12.341
hyperbola. We're not really going to deal with them much. But it's important to

00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:16.053
recognize that having a term like xy makes an equation no longer equation of a

00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:19.882
parabola. This solitary straight line is of course y equals 5 x plus 7. The

00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:25.014
yellow curve, is the parabola y equals 3 x squared plus 2 x. And this last curve

00:01:25.014 --> 00:01:29.955
left, this big blue arc, is y equals negative 1 8th, x minus 4, times x minus

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:35.317
24. Because if you multiplied out all of the terms inside here, we'd end up with

00:01:35.317 --> 00:01:40.084
a term with an x squared in it, as the only term of degree 2. And it does,

00:01:40.084 --> 00:01:41.858
indeed, graph a parabola.
