00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.450
my first trip was in August of 2003, I was really delighted,
 I really wanted to work

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.149
in Haiti because I knew the program here
was about

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:14.399
health care broadly

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.769
including HIV and TB.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.720
So they come in first and they get weighed and
their blood pressure taken over here on the right hand side

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.219
it's pretty much the best job in the world, I
can't imagine

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:26.399
I would enjoy anything

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.119
as much as I like being a doctor.

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.299
And the complaints are pretty

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:36.140
you know pretty varied from very very sick people 
who come like really

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.270
we call it carried in on a stretcher 
they get carried in from home

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.340
to coughs and colds

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.940
to children is diarrhea, malaria, we have an awful lot of

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.830
gastritis, high blood pressure, so people
just line up to get seen

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.660
and they get seen one after another

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.340
and then we just finish when the last patient has been seen.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.089
You know one day I had a little girl

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.300
who was about eight

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.940
die of malnutrition

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.949
like an eight-year-old dying of starvation
you know like honesty most people that I know

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.949
in the US or in Ireland don't actually
know anyone whose child has died.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.619
I can't actually, I can't sleep at night 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.380
you know, because of the things that I see.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.260
Like I've seen more children dying in my arms than
most people have ever experienced in their whole lives

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.470
and this is just everyday stuff. We only see the
half of it.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.149
You know it's not even a question of what keeps
me here it's like

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.880
what keeps me there, like why do I go back to
Boston, I'm not really sure.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.020
But you know, that's part of my family are there

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.970
and that's where the connection is with
the university and that's the academic

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.610
part

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.780
There is just so much work here to do that I just 
find it so compelling

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.630
I just can't not do it.
