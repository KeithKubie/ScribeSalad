00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 I suffer from tension? 75% of adults were stressed at levels ranging from 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.580
 Moderate to high last month, there must be some solution. 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.220
 So what are the best scientific methods to deal with stress and anxiety? 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.900
 How can you really relax and calm your mind and body? They say laughter is the best medicine, and it shows us 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.420
 It is also a medicine for stress, because when we laugh the amount of oxygen increases and stimulates [release] endorphins. 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.239
 Studies have shown that even just waiting to watch a funny movie can increase the levels of endorphins beta to 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.700
 27% and lead to low levels of stress hormone in the bloodstream. 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.440
 After watching a funny movie, the stress hormone (cromogranin A) decreased in participants in their saliva. 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.540
 And as long as you are in the cinema why not kiss with someone? It reduces cortisol and increases 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.860
 Oxytocin from the pituitary gland in the brain which creates feelings of attachment, bonding, 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.020
 Satisfaction and security, participants in the study who accepted their partners regularly within six weeks had lower cholesterol levels 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.340
 Of course some frankincense may help your breath 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.180
 However, a Japanese study also found that those who chew frankincense twice a day for two weeks 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.920
 They felt more comfortable. While other participants chewed frankincense while carrying out a stressful task 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.480
 They also showed lower levels of cortisol in saliva than those who did not chew frankincense. 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.540
 Not because of the components of frankincense, 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.560
 But it is simply a munching action known as kneading. 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.680
 This recurrent movement is directly related to increased brain activity of the brain and relaxation. 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.840
 The time spent in nature or even a simple plant nursery can also lower stress levels. 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.480
 In 1982 the Japanese government began a forced fishing campaign or "Shinrin Yoku" 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.890
 Which aims to raise awareness of the benefits of spending time in the forest for this purpose. Once a short visit to the forest 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.780
 Cortisol levels, heart rate and blood pressure showed a decrease. 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.460
 Even hospital patients who have a window overlooking nature tend to be better at tolerating the pain 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.220
 Their recovery rates are faster compared to those who have encountered only a blank wall. 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.720
 Talking about the leaves of nature, although the sense of relaxation of tea may be just an illusion, 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.260
 But looking to perform rituals associated with feelings of relaxation may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.000
 In other words, if you are mentally preparing to relax with your favorite sedative tea 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.700
 Or relax with scented oils, our brain starts to slow down and we feel better. 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.800
 The amygdala in the brain is responsible for managing the emotion 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.540
 It is directly related to our olfactory system. 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.880
 The inhalation of a candle that brings back a childhood memory as a memory of an apple pie may well help to relive those moments, creating a better mood. 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.500
 Music can have the same effect. Cut 60 to 80 beats per minute 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.050
 Without words have led to stress reduction even in patients who have undergone various types of surgeries. 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.600
 If you can get a pet or be next to it, do not hesitate. Having a dog is associated with low anxiety, 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.480
 12% versus 21% for those without a dog. 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.040
 Dog breeders have shown low levels of cortisol 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.780
 And an increase in oxytocin levels. 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.540
 Finally, some people relax and concentrate using the "fidget" 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.100
 That's why we made her own video. 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.320
 Game Gen by people, is it effective or not?
