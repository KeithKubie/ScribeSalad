00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.190
So now, move down all of this.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.130
Let's ask the question,
what can we do about trying to now

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.370
be able to recover
transformations from images?

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.520
So basically what that means for

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.360
recovering is given f of x,
y, can I generate g of x, y?

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.748
But also, can I also kind of
learn the transformation itself?

00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:22.815
So what it basically means is given an
image f and given the transformed image,

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:25.896
if I know the axis for both of them,
this would be x and y, and

00:00:25.896 --> 00:00:28.516
of course this would be x prime,
y prime.

00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:35.363
If we know what f and g are, can we
recover the transformation, t itself?

00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:38.091
To achieve this,
one question would be is,

00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:42.150
how many points on both these
images do I need to know?

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.100
For example,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.390
would I need to know a point here that
would correspond to this point here.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.140
I would need a point here that would
need to correspond to this point here.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.680
I would need to know this point
corresponding to this, and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.040
this point corresponding to this.

00:00:58.068 --> 00:01:00.566
All right?
So, if I know these correspondences,

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.532
[SOUND] I would be able to
figure out the inverse,

00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:05.993
by all this transformation function.

00:01:05.993 --> 00:01:08.434
But how many do I need
to know is the question,

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.309
do I also need to know some inside?

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:12.590
Those are important questions,
so let's get to that.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.450
And we would do this
in forms of quizzes.
