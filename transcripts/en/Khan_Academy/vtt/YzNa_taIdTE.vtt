00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.120
- [Instructor] Let's say that you knew

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.120
that a jar of jellybeans
starts with 282 jellybeans,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.400
and then you know that someone
came and ate 59 of them.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.470
How many jellybeans would be left?

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.260
Well, you could start with
282 and then subtract 59.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.530
And in future videos,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.360
we're gonna think about
many different ways

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.770
to approach something like this.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.050
How do you take 59 away from 282?

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.310
What is 282 minus 59?

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.020
But what we're going to do in
this video is not think about

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.900
what the exact number is of 282 minus 59,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.280
but instead trying to
estimate what this is.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.160
Instead of saying this
is equal to something,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.550
I'm going to put these
squiggly equal signs.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.540
And you could says 282 minus
59 is roughly equal to what?

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.150
Now, you might say, well, why is it useful

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.400
to come up with what
it roughly is equal to?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.030
Why is estimating it actually useful?

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.410
Well, if you actually
wanted to know exactly

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.160
what 282 minus 59 is,
the estimation is useful,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.800
because oftentimes you
can do it in your head,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.880
and then you can see whether
your answer is reasonable.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.740
In other situations, you
might not actually care

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.240
about the exact value of 282 minus 59.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.170
You just wanna know roughly
how many jellybeans there are.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.720
The typical way to estimate

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.670
when you're subtracting
large numbers is think about,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.970
well, these numbers are
close to what other numbers

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.510
that are easier to subtract in your head?

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.750
We can start with 282.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.340
So 282, we could round
it to the nearest 10,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.120
and what would that be?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.570
Well, the nearest 10 to 282

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.927
is going to be 280.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.820
One way to think about it is
we look at the tens place.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.850
We're either going to go
up to 290 or down to 280,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.410
and 282 is closer to 280, so
that's why we rounded down.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.960
And then we could do
the same thing with 59.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.180
We have five tens here,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.050
so we're either going
to round up to six tens

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.140
or we're gonna round down to
just five tens and no ones,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.670
so either to 50 or 60.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.970
And 59 is closer to 60 than it is to 50,

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.270
so this will round to 50.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.600
There you have it.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.150
This estimate we could say is going

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.370
to be roughly 280 minus 50.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.090
Now, why was this useful?

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.150
Well, some of you might
find this a lot easier

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.130
to do it in your head.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.560
In fact, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.420
and see if you can figure out

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.800
what 280 minus 50 would be in your head.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.800
There are several ways to approach it,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.420
but one way is to just think about

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.870
how much we have in each of the places.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.480
So for example, we have
zero ones in either case.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.130
That was part of the
simplification process

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.500
to get a rough estimate of what
these numbers are close to.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.540
So we're going to, if
we have zero ones minus

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.250
and we take away zero ones,

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.740
well, we're still going to have zero ones.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.600
That's looking at the ones place.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.360
If we think about how
many tens we started with,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.860
we started with eight tens,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.500
and we're taking away five of those tens.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.170
So if you start with eight of something

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.990
and you take away five of those tens,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.390
you're left with three tens.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.500
And then for hundreds, we
started with 200 jellybeans,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.390
and we didn't take away any hundreds.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.160
There's no hundreds right over here,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.800
and so we're still going
to have two hundreds.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.430
So we can say that 282 minus 59

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.730
is roughly 230,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.470
which is useful to figuring out

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.330
if you were to actually compute this

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.350
whether you got a reasonable answer.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.540
Or if you just wanted to
estimate, then you're done.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.323
You're seeing, hey, this is
roughly 230 jellybeans left.
