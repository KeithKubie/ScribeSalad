00:00:00.554 --> 00:00:03.777
- [Teacher] The function g is
defined over the real numbers.

00:00:03.777 --> 00:00:07.082
This table gives select values of g.

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:09.368
What is a reasonable
estimate for the limit

00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:12.388
is x approaches five of g of x?

00:00:12.388 --> 00:00:14.306
So pause this video, look at this table.

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:17.122
It gives us the x values
as we approach five

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:19.488
from values less than five
and as we approach five

00:00:19.488 --> 00:00:20.753
from values greater than five

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:24.304
it even tells us what g
of x is at x equals five.

00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:26.638
And so, given that, what
is a reasonable estimate

00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:27.888
for this limit?

00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:30.843
Alright now let's work
through this together.

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:34.475
So let's think about what g
of x seems to be approaching

00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:38.556
as x approaches five from
values less than five.

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:41.616
Let's see at four is it 3.37,
4.9? It's a little higher.

00:00:41.616 --> 00:00:43.949
Is it 3.5, 4.99? Is it 3.66?

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:48.074
4.999; so very close to five.

00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:51.741
We're only a thousandth
away, we're at 3.68.

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:54.319
But then at five all of a sudden

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.871
it looks like we're
kind of jumping to 6.37.

00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:00.237
And once again, I'm
making an inference here.

00:01:00.237 --> 00:01:01.665
I don't, these are just sample points

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:02.971
of this function, we don't know exactly

00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:04.889
what the function is.

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:07.459
But then if we approach five
from values greater than five.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:11.042
At six we're at 3.97;
at 5.1 we're at 3.84.

00:01:12.312 --> 00:01:13.729
5.01; 3.7; 5.001;

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:15.941
we're at 3.68.

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:19.956
So a thousandth below five
and a thousandth above five

00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:21.955
we're at 3.68, but then at five

00:01:21.955 --> 00:01:24.036
all of sudden we're at 6.37.

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:26.158
So my most reasonable estimate

00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:30.158
would be, well it look like
we're approaching 3.68.

00:01:30.158 --> 00:01:32.606
When we're approaching
from values less than five.

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:34.975
And we're approaching 3.68 from values

00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:37.097
as we approach five from
values greater than five.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:40.201
It doesn't matter that
the value of five is 6.37.

00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:42.569
The limit would be 3.68 or

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.609
a reasonable estimate for
the limit would be 3.68.

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.059
And this is probably the
most tempting distractor here

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:51.466
because if you were to
just substitute five;

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:52.895
what is g of five?

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:56.283
It tells us 6.37, but the limit does not

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:59.916
have to be what the actual
function equals at that point.

00:01:59.916 --> 00:02:03.645
Let me draw what this might look like.

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:07.812
So an example of this, so if
this is five right over here,

00:02:09.092 --> 00:02:11.816
At the point five the value of my function

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:15.733
is 6.37, so let's say
that this right over here

00:02:17.098 --> 00:02:19.465
is 6.37, so that's the value

00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:22.956
of my function right over there.

00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:25.706
So 6.37, but as we approach five,

00:02:26.608 --> 00:02:29.628
so that's four, actually let
me spread out a little bit.

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:32.731
This obviously is not drawing to scale.

00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:37.384
But as we approach five,
so if this, that's 6.37;

00:02:37.384 --> 00:02:40.051
then at four, 3.37 is about here

00:02:40.896 --> 00:02:44.079
and it looks like it's approaching 3.68.

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.650
So 3.68, actually let me draw that.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.400
So 3.68 is gonna be roughly that.

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.979
3.68 is gonna be roughly that.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.581
So the graph, the graph might
look something like this.

00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:01.440
We can infer it looks like
it's doing something like this.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.909
Where it's approaching 3.68
from values less than five

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.214
and values greater than
five, but right at five,

00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:09.560
our value is 6.37.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.212
I don't know for sure if this
is what the graph look like

00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:13.926
once again, we're just
getting some sample points.

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:14.905
But this would be a reasonable inference.

00:03:14.905 --> 00:03:17.478
And so you can see, our limit.

00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:20.620
We are approaching 3.68,
even though the value

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.008
of the function is something different.
