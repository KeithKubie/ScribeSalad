00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:01.688
- [Voiceover] Electric
Charge is a property

00:00:01.688 --> 00:00:05.622
that some, but not all fundamental
particles in nature have.

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:06.761
The most commonly talked about

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:09.562
fundamentally charged
particles are the electrons,

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:11.564
which orbit the outside of the atom.

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:13.345
These are negatively charged.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:15.146
There's also the protons, which reside

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:18.484
inside the nucleus, and
these are positively charged.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:20.088
And the neutrons inside the nucleus

00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:21.855
don't have any net charge.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.212
It turns out that all
fundamentally charged particles

00:00:24.212 --> 00:00:26.310
in the universe, have charges that come in

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.258
integer units of the elementary charge.

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:30.804
So if you find a particle in nature,

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:33.916
it's gonna have a charge
of one times this number,

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:37.016
two times this number,
three times this number,

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:38.717
and it could either be
positive or negative.

00:00:38.717 --> 00:00:41.690
For instance, the electron
has a charge of negative 1.6

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.658
times 10 to the negative 19th Coulombs,

00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:47.542
and the charge of the
proton is positive 1.6

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:49.889
times 10 to the negative 19th Coulombs.

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:51.928
However, most atoms in the universe

00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:54.076
are electrically neutral overall,

00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:56.828
since they'll have just
as many negative electrons

00:00:56.828 --> 00:00:59.013
as they do positive protons.

00:00:59.013 --> 00:01:01.307
But if an atom had too many electrons,

00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:04.009
overall that atom would
be negatively charged,

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.501
and if an atom had too few electrons,

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.844
that atom would be overall
positively charged.

00:01:08.844 --> 00:01:10.593
And something that's really
important to remember

00:01:10.593 --> 00:01:13.077
is that the electric
charge is always conserved

00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:15.212
for every process, in other words,

00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:17.539
the total charge initially, is gonna equal

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.586
the total charge finally
after any process.

00:01:20.586 --> 00:01:22.086
So what's an example problem involving

00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:23.660
electric charge look like?

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.187
Let's say three identically
sized metal spheres

00:01:26.187 --> 00:01:28.344
start off with the charges seen below.

00:01:28.344 --> 00:01:32.136
Positive five Q, positive
three Q, and negative two Q.

00:01:32.136 --> 00:01:35.793
If we touch sphere X to
sphere Y, and separate them,

00:01:35.793 --> 00:01:39.609
and then touch sphere Y to
sphere Z, and separate them,

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.575
what will be the final
charge on each sphere?

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:44.547
Well first, when we touch X to Y,

00:01:44.547 --> 00:01:46.693
the total charge has to be conserved.

00:01:46.693 --> 00:01:49.224
There's a total charge
of eight Q amongst them,

00:01:49.224 --> 00:01:50.934
and since they're identically sized,

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:52.779
they'll both share the total charge,

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.038
which means after they touch,

00:01:54.038 --> 00:01:56.008
they'll both have positive four Q.

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:57.429
If one of the spheres were larger,

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.028
it would gain more of the charge,

00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:01.378
but the total charge
would still be conserved.

00:02:01.378 --> 00:02:04.193
And now when sphere Y
is touched to sphere Z,

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.414
the total charge amongst
them at that moment

00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:09.443
would be positive four
Q plus negative two Q,

00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:10.976
which is positive two Q.

00:02:10.976 --> 00:02:13.493
They would share it equally,
so sphere Y would have

00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:17.029
positive Q, and sphere Z
would also have positive Q.

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.247
So the answer here is C.

00:02:19.247 --> 00:02:22.288
Opposite charges attract
and like charges repel,

00:02:22.288 --> 00:02:24.874
and what Coulomb's Law does
is it gives you a way to find

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:28.499
the magnitude of the electric
force between two charges.

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.069
The formula for Coulomb's Law says

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.123
that the magnitude of the electric force

00:02:32.123 --> 00:02:36.003
between two charges Q1
and Q2, is gonna equal the

00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:39.203
electric constant K, which is
nine times 10 to the ninth,

00:02:39.203 --> 00:02:42.619
times the product of the two
charges, measured in Coulombs

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:44.489
divided by the center to center distance

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.260
between those two charges, squared.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.542
You can't forget to square this distance.

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:51.612
And it's gotta be in
meters if you want to find

00:02:51.612 --> 00:02:54.151
SI units of Newtons for the force.

00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:56.716
Also, don't rely on the
negative and positive signs

00:02:56.716 --> 00:02:59.626
of the charges to tell you
which way the force points,

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:02.064
just use the fact that
opposite charges attract

00:03:02.064 --> 00:03:04.986
and like charges repel,
and use Coulomb's Law

00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:07.175
to get the magnitude of the force.

00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:08.500
So what's an example problem involving

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.790
Coulomb's Law look like?

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.653
Let's say two charges
exert an electric force

00:03:11.653 --> 00:03:13.586
of magnitude F on each other.

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:16.336
What would be the magnitude
of the new electric force

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:18.749
if the distance between
the charges is tripled

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.687
and the magnitude of one
of the charges is doubled?

00:03:21.687 --> 00:03:23.375
Well we know the formula for Coulomb's Law

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.265
says that the force between two charges

00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:28.026
is the electric constant
times one of the charges,

00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:30.354
times the other charge
divided by the distance

00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:33.321
between them squared, and now
once we triple the distance

00:03:33.321 --> 00:03:36.154
and double a charge,
the new electric force

00:03:36.154 --> 00:03:39.180
is gonna be the electric constant
times one of the charges,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.719
multiplied by two times
one of the charges,

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.402
divided by three times the
distance, which is squared,

00:03:46.402 --> 00:03:48.148
so I'm gonna get a factor of two on top,

00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:49.926
and this three will get
squared, which gives me

00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:51.761
a factor of nine on the bottom.

00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:54.148
If I pull up those extra
factors I get that the new force

00:03:54.148 --> 00:03:58.588
is gonna be two ninths
multiplied by K, Q1, Q2,

00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:00.993
over D squared, but this entire quantity

00:04:00.993 --> 00:04:03.971
was just the old force F, so the new force

00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:07.731
is going to be two
ninths of the old force.

00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:10.644
The electrical current I tells
you the amount of Coulombs

00:04:10.644 --> 00:04:14.061
of charge that passes a
point in a wire per second.

00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:16.019
So if you watch some point in a wire,

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.113
and you count how many Coulombs of charge

00:04:18.113 --> 00:04:21.328
pass by that point per second,
that would be the current.

00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:23.659
Or in equation form we
can see that the current I

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.628
is gonna be the amount
of charge that flows

00:04:25.628 --> 00:04:27.897
past a point in a wire per time.

00:04:27.897 --> 00:04:30.588
This gives the units of
I as Coulombs per second,

00:04:30.588 --> 00:04:32.848
which we abbreviate as an Ampere.

00:04:32.848 --> 00:04:34.681
And since charge and time aren't vectors,

00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:36.499
current is not a vector either.

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:37.736
Something that's kind of strange

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:40.908
is that the so-called
conventional direction of current

00:04:40.908 --> 00:04:43.475
would be the direction that
positive charges flow within a

00:04:43.475 --> 00:04:47.171
wire, however positive charges
don't flow within a wire.

00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:49.458
The only charges that
actually flow in a wire

00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:51.658
are negative charges, but it turns out

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:55.019
that negative charges flowing
to the left is physically

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:57.932
the same as positive charges
flowing to the right.

00:04:57.932 --> 00:05:00.498
So in physics problems
we pretend as if it were

00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:02.819
the positive charges moving, however

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.889
it's really the electrons,
which are negative,

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.464
that are moving within the wire.

00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:07.410
So what's an example problem

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.295
involving electrical current look like?

00:05:09.295 --> 00:05:11.387
Let's say three amps
flows within a circuit.

00:05:11.387 --> 00:05:14.014
How much charge would pass
by a point in that wire

00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:16.505
during a time interval of five minutes?

00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:17.904
Well we know the definition of current

00:05:17.904 --> 00:05:20.341
is the charge per time,
that means the charge

00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:23.285
is gonna be the amount of
current multiplied by the time,

00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:25.303
so we take our current of three amps,

00:05:25.303 --> 00:05:27.305
and we multiply by the time, but we can't

00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:30.295
multiply by five because
that's in units of minutes,

00:05:30.295 --> 00:05:32.486
since amps is Coulombs per second,

00:05:32.486 --> 00:05:34.535
we've got to convert five
minutes into seconds,

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:37.934
which would be five minutes,
multiplied by 60 seconds

00:05:37.934 --> 00:05:39.833
per minute, which would
give us a total amount

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:42.000
of charge of 900 Coulombs.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.794
The resistance of a circuit
element measures how much

00:05:45.794 --> 00:05:48.703
that element will restrict
the flow of current.

00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:51.132
The larger the resistance,
the less current

00:05:51.132 --> 00:05:52.763
there will be allowed to flow.

00:05:52.763 --> 00:05:55.978
And this definition of
resistance is given by Ohm's Law.

00:05:55.978 --> 00:05:57.794
Ohm's Law states that
the amount of current

00:05:57.794 --> 00:05:59.759
that you'll get through
a portion of a circuit,

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.476
it's gonna be proportional to the voltage

00:06:01.476 --> 00:06:04.371
across that portion,
divided by the resistance

00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:06.006
of that portion of the circuit.

00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:08.331
So between these two points,
the amount of current

00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:10.198
that will flow, is gonna be equal to

00:06:10.198 --> 00:06:12.536
the voltage between those two points,

00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:15.604
divided by the resistance
between those two points.

00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:17.889
So the larger the
resistance, the less current

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.958
will flow, but the greater
the voltage supplied,

00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.418
the greater the current will be.

00:06:22.418 --> 00:06:24.107
And this is what Ohm's Law says.

00:06:24.107 --> 00:06:26.316
Even though Ohm's Law
gives you a way to define

00:06:26.316 --> 00:06:29.082
the resistance, you can
determine the resistance

00:06:29.082 --> 00:06:31.043
of a circuit element by knowing the size

00:06:31.043 --> 00:06:32.949
and shape of that circuit element.

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.568
In other words, the resistance
of a cylindrical resistor,

00:06:35.568 --> 00:06:37.872
is gonna be equal to the resistivity,

00:06:37.872 --> 00:06:40.214
which is a measure of an
object's natural resistance

00:06:40.214 --> 00:06:43.126
to current, multiplied by
the length of that resistor,

00:06:43.126 --> 00:06:45.768
the longer the resistor,
the greater the resistance

00:06:45.768 --> 00:06:48.072
and the more it will
resist the flow of current,

00:06:48.072 --> 00:06:50.199
and then divide it by
the cross sectional area

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.860
of that resistor, which would
be this area right here,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.583
the current is either
flowing into or out of.

00:06:55.583 --> 00:06:58.450
If the resistor is cylindrical,
the area of this circle

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.313
would be Pi times r
squared, where little r

00:07:01.313 --> 00:07:04.356
would be the radius of
this cross sectional area.

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:07.521
The units of resistance is
Ohms, and it is not a vector.

00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:09.746
It is always positive or zero.

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:11.888
So what's an example
problem involving Ohm's Law,

00:07:11.888 --> 00:07:14.699
or the resistance of a
cylindrical resistor look like?

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:16.776
Let's say a battery of
voltage V is hooked up

00:07:16.776 --> 00:07:19.744
to a single cylindrical
resistor of length L

00:07:19.744 --> 00:07:21.813
and radius little r, and when that's done,

00:07:21.813 --> 00:07:24.482
a current I is flowing
through the battery.

00:07:24.482 --> 00:07:27.913
What is the resistivity
Rho, of that resistor?

00:07:27.913 --> 00:07:30.278
Well we know Ohm's Law states
that the current that flows

00:07:30.278 --> 00:07:32.446
through a portion of a
circuit will be equal to

00:07:32.446 --> 00:07:33.972
the voltage across that portion,

00:07:33.972 --> 00:07:36.278
divided by the resistance of that portion.

00:07:36.278 --> 00:07:38.603
And this means the resistance
of this resistor is gonna be

00:07:38.603 --> 00:07:40.883
the voltage of the battery
divided by the current.

00:07:40.883 --> 00:07:43.268
To factor resistivity
into this, we have to use

00:07:43.268 --> 00:07:46.153
the formula for the resistance
of a cylindrical resistor,

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:48.222
which is Rho times L over A.

00:07:48.222 --> 00:07:50.637
This gives us the
resistance of the resistor,

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.735
which is gotta equal V over I,

00:07:52.735 --> 00:07:55.023
and now we can solve
for the resistivity Rho.

00:07:55.023 --> 00:07:58.381
We get V times A over I
L, but since we're given

00:07:58.381 --> 00:08:01.117
the radius little r,
we gotta write the area

00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:03.204
in terms of that radius,
so this is gonna be

00:08:03.204 --> 00:08:06.858
V times Pi, r squared,
divided by I times L,

00:08:06.858 --> 00:08:09.210
which gives us an answer of C.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.285
When dealing with complicated
circuits with many resistors,

00:08:12.285 --> 00:08:14.214
you often have to reduce those resistors

00:08:14.214 --> 00:08:17.098
into smaller, equivalent
amounts of resistors.

00:08:17.098 --> 00:08:18.862
And the two ways you
do this are by finding

00:08:18.862 --> 00:08:21.680
two resistors that are
in series or in parallel.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.164
Resistors will be in
series if the same current

00:08:24.164 --> 00:08:25.891
that flows through the same resistor,

00:08:25.891 --> 00:08:27.688
flows through the next resistor.

00:08:27.688 --> 00:08:30.157
If the current branched
off in between them,

00:08:30.157 --> 00:08:32.791
these resistors would
no longer be in series,

00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:34.153
but if they're in series you can find

00:08:34.153 --> 00:08:37.044
the equivalent resistance
of this section of wire

00:08:37.044 --> 00:08:40.036
by just adding up the two
individual resistances.

00:08:40.036 --> 00:08:41.777
So the current for resistors in series

00:08:41.777 --> 00:08:45.112
must be the same, but the
voltage might be different,

00:08:45.112 --> 00:08:47.244
since they could have
different resistances.

00:08:47.244 --> 00:08:49.104
Two resistors will be in parallel,

00:08:49.104 --> 00:08:52.000
if a current comes in,
splits into two parts,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.803
goes through one resistor
each, and then rejoins

00:08:54.803 --> 00:08:56.818
before hitting anything
else in the circuit,

00:08:56.818 --> 00:08:58.768
and if this is the case,
you can find the equivalent

00:08:58.768 --> 00:09:00.882
resistance of this portion of the circuit,

00:09:00.882 --> 00:09:04.093
i.e. between these two
points, by saying that one

00:09:04.093 --> 00:09:06.519
over the equivalent
resistance is gonna equal

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:08.893
one over the resistance
of the first resistor,

00:09:08.893 --> 00:09:11.556
plus one over the resistance
of the second resistor.

00:09:11.556 --> 00:09:14.275
But be careful, one
over R1 plus one over R2

00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:16.544
just gives you one over R equivalent.

00:09:16.544 --> 00:09:18.663
If you want R equivalent,
you're gonna have to take

00:09:18.663 --> 00:09:22.627
one over this entire side,
in order to get R equivalent.

00:09:22.627 --> 00:09:24.604
So what's an example
problem involving resistors

00:09:24.604 --> 00:09:26.386
in series and parallel look like?

00:09:26.386 --> 00:09:28.357
Let's say we have this
circuit shown below,

00:09:28.357 --> 00:09:30.164
and we want to know what current flows

00:09:30.164 --> 00:09:31.726
through the eight Ohm resistor.

00:09:31.726 --> 00:09:33.280
Now you might be tempted to say this,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.861
since Ohm's Law says that the
current is delta V over R,

00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:38.729
we can just plug in the
voltage of the battery,

00:09:38.729 --> 00:09:41.330
which is 24 volts,
divided by the resistance

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.469
of the resistor, which is eight Ohms,

00:09:43.469 --> 00:09:45.220
and that would give us three Amps.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.487
But that's not right at all.

00:09:46.487 --> 00:09:48.549
When using Ohm's Law,
the current that flows

00:09:48.549 --> 00:09:51.511
through a resistor R, is gonna be equal to

00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:54.382
the voltage across that
resistor divided by

00:09:54.382 --> 00:09:56.406
the resistance of that resistor.

00:09:56.406 --> 00:09:59.382
So if we plug eight Ohms into
the denominator, we've gotta

00:09:59.382 --> 00:10:02.567
plug in the voltage across
that eight Ohm resistor.

00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:04.456
But the voltage across
the eight Ohm resistor

00:10:04.456 --> 00:10:07.556
is not gonna be the full
24 volts of the battery,

00:10:07.556 --> 00:10:09.595
it's gonna be less than 24 volts.

00:10:09.595 --> 00:10:12.056
In other words, the battery
provides a voltage between

00:10:12.056 --> 00:10:15.144
this point and this point of 24 volts,

00:10:15.144 --> 00:10:16.611
but there's gonna be voltage drops

00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:18.855
across the six and 12 Ohm resistors,

00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:20.138
which make it so that the voltage

00:10:20.138 --> 00:10:21.776
across the eight Ohm resistor is not

00:10:21.776 --> 00:10:23.701
gonna be the full 24 volts.

00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:26.396
So we have to reduce these
resistors to a single resistance.

00:10:26.396 --> 00:10:28.335
The six and the 12 are in parallel,

00:10:28.335 --> 00:10:31.351
so we can say that one
over six, plus one over 12,

00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:32.907
would equal one over the resistance

00:10:32.907 --> 00:10:34.400
of that portion of the circuit.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.540
This is gonna equal three
twelves, which is one fourth,

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.280
so that means that parallel
portion of the circuit

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.857
has an equivalent resistance of four Ohms.

00:10:41.857 --> 00:10:44.159
So between this point and this point,

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:46.184
there are four Ohms of resistance,

00:10:46.184 --> 00:10:48.469
and that equivalent
resistance is in series

00:10:48.469 --> 00:10:50.141
with this eight Ohm resistor.

00:10:50.141 --> 00:10:51.652
So we can add four and eight,

00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:54.217
and get 12 Ohms of total resistance.

00:10:54.217 --> 00:10:57.720
And now I can say that the
full 24 volts of the battery

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.135
is applied across this
entire equivalent resistance

00:11:00.135 --> 00:11:03.685
of 12 Ohms, so if I come up
here and change this eight Ohms

00:11:03.685 --> 00:11:06.980
to 12 Ohms of equivalent
resistance for the total circuit,

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.440
I'll get the correct current that flows

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.322
through the battery of two Amps.

00:11:10.322 --> 00:11:12.143
And since that's the current
that's flowing through

00:11:12.143 --> 00:11:13.879
the battery, that had to be the current

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:16.343
that's flowing through the
eight Ohm resistor as well.

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:20.059
Since this eight Ohm resistor
and the batter are in series.

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:23.152
Elements in a circuit
often use Electrical Power.

00:11:23.152 --> 00:11:25.892
That is to say, when current
runs through a resistor,

00:11:25.892 --> 00:11:27.726
the electrons moving through that resistor

00:11:27.726 --> 00:11:30.428
turn some of their
electrical potential energy

00:11:30.428 --> 00:11:33.766
into energies like heat, light, or sound.

00:11:33.766 --> 00:11:35.408
And the rate at which these electrons

00:11:35.408 --> 00:11:37.978
are turning their energy
into other forms of energy,

00:11:37.978 --> 00:11:39.854
is called the electrical power.

00:11:39.854 --> 00:11:41.815
So the rate at which a resistor is turning

00:11:41.815 --> 00:11:43.974
electrical potential energy into heat,

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:46.481
is the electrical power
used by that resistor.

00:11:46.481 --> 00:11:47.940
In other words, the amount of energy

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.084
converted into heat, divided by the time

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:52.380
it took to convert that
energy, is the definition

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.358
of the power, and there's
a way to determine

00:11:54.358 --> 00:11:57.404
this number of Joules per
second, in terms of quantities

00:11:57.404 --> 00:12:00.199
like the current, the
voltage, and the resistance.

00:12:00.199 --> 00:12:02.425
The power used by a
resistor can be written as

00:12:02.425 --> 00:12:04.410
the current through that resistor

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.436
multiplied by the voltage
across that resistor,

00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:10.661
or if you substituted Ohm's
Law into this formula,

00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:12.181
you see that this is equivalent to

00:12:12.181 --> 00:12:14.319
the current through that resistor squared,

00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:16.759
multiplied by the
resistance of the resistor,

00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:18.132
or we could rearrange these formulas

00:12:18.132 --> 00:12:20.025
to get that the power used by a resistor

00:12:20.025 --> 00:12:23.124
would also be the voltage
across that resistor squared,

00:12:23.124 --> 00:12:25.521
divided by the resistance
of that resistor.

00:12:25.521 --> 00:12:27.540
All three of these, if used correctly,

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.130
will give you the same
number for the power used

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.074
by a resistor, and if
you wanted to determine

00:12:32.074 --> 00:12:34.605
the number of Joules of
heat energy converted,

00:12:34.605 --> 00:12:37.054
you could set any one of
these equal to the amount

00:12:37.054 --> 00:12:40.122
of energy per time, and
solve for that energy.

00:12:40.122 --> 00:12:42.561
The units of Electrical Power
are the same as the regular

00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:46.262
units of power, which is
Watts, i.e. Joules per second,

00:12:46.262 --> 00:12:48.333
and Electrical Power is not a vector.

00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:49.836
So what's an example problem involving

00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:51.452
Electrical Power look like?

00:12:51.452 --> 00:12:53.296
Let's say a light bulb of resistance R

00:12:53.296 --> 00:12:55.416
is hooked up to a source of voltage V,

00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:57.694
and a second light bulb of resistance 2R,

00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:00.246
is hooked up to a source of voltage 2V.

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.786
How does the power used
by the second light bulb

00:13:02.786 --> 00:13:05.285
compare to the power used
by the first light bulb?

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.553
Since we have the
information about R and V,

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:09.382
I'll use the version of the power formula

00:13:09.382 --> 00:13:11.645
that says that the
power used by a resistor

00:13:11.645 --> 00:13:13.980
is gonna be delta V squared over R.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.937
So in terms of quantities
given the power used

00:13:15.937 --> 00:13:18.797
by the first light bulb is
gonna be V squared over R.

00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:21.225
And the power used by the
second light bulb is gonna be

00:13:21.225 --> 00:13:23.779
equal to the voltage across
the second light bulb,

00:13:23.779 --> 00:13:26.852
which is two times the voltage
across the first light bulb,

00:13:26.852 --> 00:13:28.953
and we square that,
divided by the resistance

00:13:28.953 --> 00:13:30.678
of the second light
bulb, which is gonna be

00:13:30.678 --> 00:13:33.015
two times the resistance
of the first light bulb.

00:13:33.015 --> 00:13:35.547
The two squared on top is
gonna give me a factor of four,

00:13:35.547 --> 00:13:37.708
and I'll have another
factor of two on the bottom.

00:13:37.708 --> 00:13:40.032
So if I factor out this
four divided by two,

00:13:40.032 --> 00:13:42.269
I get that the power used
by the second light bulb

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:44.666
is gonna be two times V squared over R,

00:13:44.666 --> 00:13:46.663
but V squared over R was the power used

00:13:46.663 --> 00:13:48.658
by the first light bulb, so the power used

00:13:48.658 --> 00:13:50.653
by the second light bulb is gonna be two

00:13:50.653 --> 00:13:52.838
times the power used by
the first light bulb,

00:13:52.838 --> 00:13:54.681
and so if the light
bulb of resistance two R

00:13:54.681 --> 00:13:57.662
has twice the power, and
that means it'll be brighter.

00:13:57.662 --> 00:13:59.591
The quantity that
determines the brightness

00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:03.124
of a light bulb, is the electrical
power of that light bulb.

00:14:03.124 --> 00:14:06.318
It's not necessarily the
resistance or the voltage,

00:14:06.318 --> 00:14:07.821
it's the combination of the two

00:14:07.821 --> 00:14:10.895
in this formula that will
tell you the electrical power,

00:14:10.895 --> 00:14:13.649
and therefore the brightness
of the light bulb.

00:14:13.649 --> 00:14:15.519
Two of the most useful ideas in circuits

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:17.767
are referred to as Kirchhoff's Rules.

00:14:17.767 --> 00:14:19.854
The first rule is called
the Junction rule,

00:14:19.854 --> 00:14:22.040
and it states that all the
current entering a junction

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.140
must equal all the current
exiting that junction.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.961
In other words, if you add
all the current that flows

00:14:26.961 --> 00:14:28.997
into a junction, that has to equal

00:14:28.997 --> 00:14:31.260
all the current that flows
out of that junction,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.263
because current is just flowing charge,

00:14:33.263 --> 00:14:35.897
and charge is conserved,
so charge can't be

00:14:35.897 --> 00:14:38.964
created or destroyed at
any point in the circuit.

00:14:38.964 --> 00:14:41.506
No more than water can
get created or destroyed

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.213
within a series of pipes.

00:14:43.213 --> 00:14:45.080
And the second rule is
called the Loop rule,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.515
which states that if you
add up all the changes

00:14:47.515 --> 00:14:51.235
in electric potential, i.e.
voltages around any closed

00:14:51.235 --> 00:14:54.238
loop in a circuit, it'll
always add up to zero.

00:14:54.238 --> 00:14:56.464
So if you add up all
the voltages encountered

00:14:56.464 --> 00:14:58.191
through a closed loop through a circuit,

00:14:58.191 --> 00:14:59.768
it always adds up to zero.

00:14:59.768 --> 00:15:02.273
And this is just a result
of conservation of energy.

00:15:02.273 --> 00:15:04.408
The electrons will gain
energy when they flow

00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:06.410
through the battery,
and they'll lose energy

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.396
every time they flow through a resistor,

00:15:08.396 --> 00:15:09.919
but the total amount of energy they gain

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:12.443
from the battery, has to be
equal to the total amount

00:15:12.443 --> 00:15:14.956
of energy they lose due to the resistors.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.345
In other words, if we
consider a complicated circuit

00:15:17.345 --> 00:15:19.759
that has a batter and three resistors,

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:23.125
the total current flowing
into a junction I1,

00:15:23.125 --> 00:15:25.065
will have to be equal to the total current

00:15:25.065 --> 00:15:28.293
coming out of that junction, I2 and I3.

00:15:28.293 --> 00:15:30.951
Since no charge gets created or destroyed.

00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:32.986
And that means when these
two currents combine again,

00:15:32.986 --> 00:15:34.482
the total current flowing out

00:15:34.482 --> 00:15:37.194
of that section is gonna again be I1.

00:15:37.194 --> 00:15:39.990
And if we follow a closed
loop through this circuit,

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.372
the sum of all the
voltages around that loop

00:15:42.372 --> 00:15:45.919
have to add up to zero, i.e.
the voltage of the battery

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:48.939
minus the voltage drop
across the first resistor,

00:15:48.939 --> 00:15:51.784
minus the voltage drop
across the second resistor,

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.480
would have to equal zero.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.894
So what's an example problem involving

00:15:54.894 --> 00:15:56.496
Kirchhoff's Rules look like?

00:15:56.496 --> 00:15:58.513
Let's say we have the circuit
below and we wanted to

00:15:58.513 --> 00:16:01.702
determine the voltage
across the six Ohm resistor.

00:16:01.702 --> 00:16:03.409
To do this, we could use the Loop rule,

00:16:03.409 --> 00:16:05.633
I'll start behind the
battery, and I'll go through

00:16:05.633 --> 00:16:08.392
the resistor, I want to
determine the voltage across.

00:16:08.392 --> 00:16:10.932
I'll add up all the
voltages across that loop,

00:16:10.932 --> 00:16:12.364
and set it equal to zero.

00:16:12.364 --> 00:16:13.556
So the voltage across the battery

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.703
is gonna be positive 24 volts,

00:16:15.703 --> 00:16:18.276
minus the voltage across
the six Ohm resistor,

00:16:18.276 --> 00:16:19.745
and then minus the voltage across the

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:22.220
eight Ohm resistor has to equal zero.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.676
But we're given this current,
so we know that two Amps

00:16:24.676 --> 00:16:26.706
flows through the eight Ohm resistor,

00:16:26.706 --> 00:16:27.847
and you can always determine the voltage

00:16:27.847 --> 00:16:29.939
across the resistor using Ohm's Law,

00:16:29.939 --> 00:16:31.870
so the voltage across
the eight Ohm resistor

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.870
is gonna be two Amps, which is flowing

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.436
through the eight Ohm resistor,

00:16:35.436 --> 00:16:39.129
multiplied by eight Ohms,
and we get 16 volts.

00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:41.837
Which I can plug into
here, and this gives me

00:16:41.837 --> 00:16:45.686
24 volts minus the voltage
across the six Ohm resistor,

00:16:45.686 --> 00:16:48.389
minus 16, has to equal zero.

00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:49.583
And if I solve this for the voltage

00:16:49.583 --> 00:16:52.253
across the six Ohm
resistor, I get 24 volts

00:16:52.253 --> 00:16:54.871
minus 16 volts, which is eight volts.

00:16:54.871 --> 00:16:56.721
So the voltage across the six Ohm resistor

00:16:56.721 --> 00:16:58.308
would be eight volts.

00:16:58.308 --> 00:17:01.392
Note, because the 12 Ohm
resistor and the six Ohm resistor

00:17:01.392 --> 00:17:04.095
are in parallel, the voltage
across the 12 Ohm resistor

00:17:04.095 --> 00:17:07.078
would also be eight volts,
because the voltage across

00:17:07.078 --> 00:17:11.633
any two elements in parallel,
have to be the same.

00:17:11.633 --> 00:17:13.549
Voltmeters are the device that you use

00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:16.398
to measure the voltage between
two points in a circuit.

00:17:16.398 --> 00:17:18.113
When hooking up a voltmeter you've gotta

00:17:18.113 --> 00:17:20.580
hook it up in parallel
between the two points

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.600
you wanna find the voltage across.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.015
In other words, to determine the voltage

00:17:24.015 --> 00:17:26.388
between this point and
this point, which would be

00:17:26.388 --> 00:17:29.235
the voltage across R3, you
would hook up the voltmeter

00:17:29.235 --> 00:17:31.465
in parallel with R3.

00:17:31.465 --> 00:17:33.351
Ammeters are the devices we use to measure

00:17:33.351 --> 00:17:34.908
the electrical current that pass

00:17:34.908 --> 00:17:36.780
through a point in a circuit, and ammeters

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.595
have to be hooked up in series
with the circuit element

00:17:39.595 --> 00:17:41.373
you want to determine the current through.

00:17:41.373 --> 00:17:43.261
In other words, if we wanted
to determine the current

00:17:43.261 --> 00:17:47.267
through R1, we would hook up
the ammeter in series with R1.

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:49.877
Note that for these electrical
devices to work well,

00:17:49.877 --> 00:17:53.185
the ammeter should have almost
zero internal resistance,

00:17:53.185 --> 00:17:55.407
thereby not affecting
the current that flows

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:57.479
through the circuit, and
voltmeters should have

00:17:57.479 --> 00:18:00.440
near infinite resistance,
so that it doesn't draw

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.674
any of the current from the resistor.

00:18:02.674 --> 00:18:04.969
In reality, ammeters have a very small,

00:18:04.969 --> 00:18:07.148
but non-zero internal resistance,

00:18:07.148 --> 00:18:08.463
and voltmeters have a very high,

00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:10.653
but not infinite internal resistance.

00:18:10.653 --> 00:18:12.107
So what would an example problem involving

00:18:12.107 --> 00:18:14.108
voltmeters and ammeters look like?

00:18:14.108 --> 00:18:15.865
Let's say we have the circuit shown below,

00:18:15.865 --> 00:18:18.558
and these numbered circles
represent possible places

00:18:18.558 --> 00:18:21.173
we could stick a voltmeter
to measure the voltage

00:18:21.173 --> 00:18:23.165
across the eight Ohm resistor.

00:18:23.165 --> 00:18:25.380
Which two of these
voltmeters would correctly

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.079
give the voltage across
the eight Ohm resistor?

00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:30.124
And you have to be
careful, some AP problems

00:18:30.124 --> 00:18:31.844
are gonna require you to select

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:33.838
two correct answers for
the multiple choice,

00:18:33.838 --> 00:18:36.509
so be sure to read the
instructions carefully.

00:18:36.509 --> 00:18:38.229
Voltmeter number four
is a terrible choice,

00:18:38.229 --> 00:18:40.368
you never hook up your
voltmeter in series,

00:18:40.368 --> 00:18:42.331
but the circuit element
you're trying to find

00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:44.382
the voltage across, and
voltmeter number one

00:18:44.382 --> 00:18:46.524
is doing nothing really,
because its' measuring

00:18:46.524 --> 00:18:48.989
the voltage between two points in a wire

00:18:48.989 --> 00:18:51.206
with nothing in between that wire.

00:18:51.206 --> 00:18:52.952
So the voltage measured by voltmeter one

00:18:52.952 --> 00:18:56.034
should just be zero, since
the voltage across a wire

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:59.412
of zero resistance should
just give you zero volts.

00:18:59.412 --> 00:19:01.627
So the correct choices would
be voltmeter number two,

00:19:01.627 --> 00:19:04.736
which gives you the voltage
across the eight Ohm resistor,

00:19:04.736 --> 00:19:06.429
and voltmeter number
three, which also gives you

00:19:06.429 --> 00:19:08.304
an equivalent measurement of the voltage

00:19:08.304 --> 00:19:10.870
across the resistor eight Ohms.
