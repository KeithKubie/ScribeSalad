00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:02.848
- [Voiceover] We're all
familiar with the base 10

00:00:02.848 --> 00:00:05.332
number system, were
often called the decimal

00:00:05.332 --> 00:00:09.541
number system, where we have 10 digits

00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:13.308
Zero, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:00:13.308 --> 00:00:14.585
Now, we started to see that we can

00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:16.304
have alternate number system.

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:18.072
We can have a base two number system,

00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:19.616
or it's the binary number system,

00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:23.385
where instead of 10 digits
you only have two digits.

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:25.131
Each place, instead of being a power

00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:28.099
of ten is going to be a power of two.

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.402
Now you can imagine that
we can keep extending this.

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:33.861
We can extend to base three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:37.909
eight, nine, or we could even go above 10.

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:42.909
What I want to show you
in this video is a fairly,

00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:46.569
heavily used number system
that is larger than,

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:51.358
or that has more digits than
base 10, and that base is 16.

00:00:51.358 --> 00:00:56.358
Base 16, often called the hexadecimal.

00:00:57.045 --> 00:01:01.581
Hexadecimal number system.

00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:04.703
As you can imagine, instead of only

00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:08.858
having 10 digits, it is going to have 16.

00:01:08.858 --> 00:01:11.104
What are those digits going to be?

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.082
As we'll see, instead of
the place is being powers

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:16.731
of two or powers of ten,
there will be powers of 16.

00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:19.890
Let's see, we can reuse
the existing 10 digits

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.133
from the decimal number system.

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:27.100
We can reuse zero, one, two, three,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.100
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:01:32.783 --> 00:01:37.148
but then we're going to need
to have six more digits.

00:01:37.148 --> 00:01:41.885
The convention is to use
the first six letters.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:46.885
A, B, C, D, E, and F.

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:48.400
You might say this is crazy.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.016
These are letters, not numbers,
but remember these are just

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:55.457
arbitrary squiggles of
ink on a piece of paper.

00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:57.464
These are just arbitrary symbols

00:01:57.464 --> 00:01:59.989
that we're grown to associate with things.

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.696
You're grown to associate
this symbol right over here

00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:06.474
with eight thing, with
the word eight which you

00:02:06.474 --> 00:02:09.905
associate with when you
see that many objects.

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:13.315
If you're thinking in hexadecimal,
this isn't the letter A

00:02:13.315 --> 00:02:15.590
that makes you want to
say "ah", or the letter B

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.632
that makes you want to say "bababababa".

00:02:17.632 --> 00:02:20.386
This is, literally, this represents

00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:23.149
if you had 10 things laying around.

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.674
You would say, "I have
A things over there."

00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:28.420
If you have 11, you'd say,
"I have B things over there."

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.616
12, C things.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:32.091
13, instead of saying,
"I have 13 things there",

00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:33.840
"I have D things there."

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.450
Instead of saying, "I have 14",

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.572
you could say, "I can
have E things there."

00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:38.880
Instead of saying, "I have 15",

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.598
you could say, "I have F things there."

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:43.173
Now, how does that help?

00:02:43.173 --> 00:02:44.607
Well, let's see if we can represent

00:02:44.607 --> 00:02:48.585
the same number 231, or 231 in decimal.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:53.585
If we can represent that
same number in hexadecimal.

00:02:54.627 --> 00:02:56.499
What I'll do is I'll give
you what the number is,

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:58.065
and then I'll show you how we convert it.

00:02:58.065 --> 00:02:59.409
I'll show you the place value,

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.580
and I'll show you how we convert it.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.750
231 in hexadecimal.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.750
231 in hexadecimal is the number E seven.

00:03:12.835 --> 00:03:13.997
E seven.

00:03:13.997 --> 00:03:15.588
Once again, you're
like, "This looks crazy.

00:03:15.588 --> 00:03:17.575
"This is like I'm playing
like battleship or something."

00:03:17.575 --> 00:03:19.257
What's E seven?

00:03:19.257 --> 00:03:21.333
This is a number and I would say yes.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:22.679
This is a number.

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.095
Now remember, base 16.

00:03:24.095 --> 00:03:26.781
What are these place values represent?

00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:30.701
This first place represents
16 to the zero power

00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.504
or still represents the ones place.

00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:34.925
This is the ones place.

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:36.651
This is seven ones.

00:03:36.651 --> 00:03:39.351
Now, what is this place here represents?

00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:42.426
Well, in base 10, that
was 10 to the first power.

00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:44.470
In base two, that was
two to the first power.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.103
On base 16, this is going to be,

00:03:47.103 --> 00:03:47.979
I'll leave those there,

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.560
in base 16, this is going
to be 16 to the first power.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.027
This is literally, well let me write out

00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:58.442
the word, this is literally sixteens.

00:03:58.442 --> 00:04:03.442
This is E sixteens plus seven ones.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.604
Let me write that down.

00:04:05.604 --> 00:04:10.604
This is E sixteens plus seven ones.

00:04:15.444 --> 00:04:18.426
That's what this number represents.

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:20.817
Now, if we want to start rewriting this

00:04:20.817 --> 00:04:23.064
or re-conceptualizing it in our decimal

00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:24.882
number system, what is E sixteens?

00:04:24.882 --> 00:04:29.758
Well, the E if we think
in decimal, E is 14.

00:04:29.758 --> 00:04:33.920
E is 14.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.166
This is really, we can
really think of this

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:37.941
if you want to think them decimals.

00:04:37.941 --> 00:04:40.748
This is 14 sixteens.

00:04:40.748 --> 00:04:42.270
It's 14 sixteens.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.530
Well, that's just the
same thing as 14 times 16.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.077
14 times 16 is equal to 224.

00:04:49.077 --> 00:04:51.503
Maybe I should do that in same color.

00:04:51.503 --> 00:04:56.503
This thing right over
here is going to be 224.

00:04:57.375 --> 00:05:02.375
14 sixteens, 14 times 16
is 224 plus seven ones.

00:05:05.652 --> 00:05:10.652
Well, 224 plus 7 is
going to be give you 231.

00:05:10.674 --> 00:05:11.747
Hopefully, you can appreciate it.

00:05:11.747 --> 00:05:13.957
You can represent the same quantity

00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:17.704
in any of these different number systems.

00:05:17.704 --> 00:05:20.967
In any number that you
can represent in decimal,

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:24.125
you can also represent
that number in binary,

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:29.125
or in hexadecimal, or in
base three, or in base 60,

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:33.557
or in base 31, whatever you want to do.

00:05:33.557 --> 00:05:35.638
You might have noticed the pattern.

00:05:35.638 --> 00:05:38.082
The more symbols that we have,

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:41.014
so in base 16, you have 16 symbols,

00:05:41.014 --> 00:05:43.025
the less place values we need

00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:44.815
to represent the same quantity.

00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:46.597
One way to think about it is each

00:05:46.597 --> 00:05:49.126
of the places are
containing more information.

00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:51.722
This is one of 16 characters.

00:05:51.722 --> 00:05:53.828
While this over here is
only one of two characters.

00:05:53.828 --> 00:05:55.775
This is one of ten characters.

00:05:55.775 --> 00:05:58.586
The more symbols that
you have, the more digits

00:05:58.586 --> 00:06:01.525
that you could put in each
place, the less places

00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:06.249
that you need to represent
a given quantity.

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:08.993
Another way to think about it
is when you have a high base,

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:13.091
like base 16, as you take
powers of 16, the next

00:06:13.091 --> 00:06:18.091
place right over here would be 16 squared,

00:06:18.162 --> 00:06:23.162
which, of course, is two
hundred and, wait a minute, 256.

00:06:23.937 --> 00:06:27.408
You're clearly going to be able
to represent bigger numbers

00:06:27.408 --> 00:06:29.746
faster, I guess you could
say, or with less digits.

00:06:29.746 --> 00:06:32.083
It's just an interesting thing to observe.

00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:34.440
But hopefully, you're
going to kick out of,

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.082
as much of a kick out of base 16

00:06:36.082 --> 00:06:38.291
as I do, and it's actually useful.

00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:42.430
This actually is used if
you look at most web pages.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.189
If you look at the actual code for there,

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:47.479
or I guess you could say the
formatting line, the HTML

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:50.186
for the webpage, when they specify colors,

00:06:50.186 --> 00:06:52.776
they tend to specify in hexadecimal.

00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:55.039
That's because they're specifying
the colors, the intensity

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:00.039
of the red, the green, or the
blue, between zero and 255.

00:07:00.493 --> 00:07:04.035
Two digits of hexadecimal
are perfect for that,

00:07:04.035 --> 00:07:09.035
because if you think
about it, what is F F?

00:07:11.895 --> 00:07:14.913
What would this be if you
rewrite it in the decimal number

00:07:14.913 --> 00:07:17.948
system, and I encourage you
after this video is done,

00:07:17.948 --> 00:07:21.122
I encourage you to do that to
figure that out on your own.

00:07:21.122 --> 00:07:22.594
If you really want to do something fun,

00:07:22.594 --> 00:07:23.913
let me give you another one.

00:07:23.913 --> 00:07:28.686
Try to figure out what A F three is.

00:07:28.686 --> 00:07:30.205
Again, this isn't very specialized.

00:07:30.205 --> 00:07:31.347
I just wanted to give you another

00:07:31.347 --> 00:07:33.531
interesting thing to work on.
