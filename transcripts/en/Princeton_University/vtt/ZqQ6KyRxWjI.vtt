[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.930
DAN TRUEMAN: Musical
instruments are

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.540
amazingly interdisciplinary.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.290
I mean, basically,
to understand what's

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.780
going on with a musical
instrument involves touching

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.440
on so many different
disciplines,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.490
whether it's physics and
acoustics or perception

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.990
and cognition.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.620
Whether it's interfacing -- like
how we interface with machines

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.350
or devices through something
like the keyboard or the violin

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.090
bow.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.550
MAYA KEREN: I'm currently
undecided about my major,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.670
but I'm definitely
interested in music.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.490
And I'm also thinking
about computer science.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.400
This class is basically the
intersection of those two

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.700
interests, in addition
to some other topics

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.149
like physics and math.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.440
AATISH BHATIA: I co-teach
this course with Dan Trueman.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.620
And I think having this
interdisciplinary approach,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.290
we have many
different perspectives

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.600
on the same question,
and they all kind of

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.620
build upon each other.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.495
And so to me, that's
one of the things that's

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.570
really exciting about
collaborative teaching,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.130
is that it allows us to build
on each other's perspectives

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.640
and really build, I think,
a more well-rounded course.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.020
[CHATTER]

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.000
ELI BERMAN: So today, we're
building some overtone flutes

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.130
out of some PVC pipes.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.300
So using the natural resonance
of these materials to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.310
activate different frequencies.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.810
We figure out what
fundamental pitch

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.280
we want to be the base level
pitch of the instrument,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.900
and then we calculate how
long the PVC pipe should be.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.694
SUBJECT: It's
between 28 and 28.01.

00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:39.110
MAYA KEREN: Perfect
Let's do that.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.370
Basically, my lens
in how I see music

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.310
is very influenced by my
path as a jazz pianist.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.040
And I think this class
is going to open up

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.290
this whole new realm
of possibilities for me

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.150
in terms of where I
can take the music.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.515
[FLUTE PLAYING]

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.680
ELI BERMAN: I had never
gone through the process

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.100
of making any instrument.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.000
So it's really fascinating
to be able to see the care

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.330
that's needed to create an
instrument that works at all,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.550
or that sounds at all.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.060
And then to see what other
details can be made to make it

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.580
work in the way
that you want to.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.121
DAN TRUEMAN: Eli
and I were listening

00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:18.590
to the same pair
of notes, and they

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.390
were hearing different
difference tones in their head

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.074
then I was hearing.

00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:26.740
So we were just hearing
different things

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.470
based on our experience, based
on, probably, our physiology.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.320
It's a really important lesson
to learn for young musicians --

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.640
that there's no absolute
sound that we're all hearing.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.920
Like, it's a very
personal thing.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.117
And that's an important
thing to know and realize

00:02:42.117 --> 00:02:43.950
when you're sharing
music with other people,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.450
and you're trying to be
empathetic and understand what

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.920
other people are experiencing.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.830
AATISH BHATIA: Music is one
example of a place where

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.930
you can experience it
and you can enjoy it

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.500
without necessarily having
an understanding of what

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.510
makes things sound good.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.360
But once you're at that place,
gaining that understanding --

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.150
so like, trying to use math
and science and physics

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.500
to understand what is actually
happening when I hear a violin

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.840
note, or what is actually
happening when I hear a chord

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.370
that I really like --

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.480
that adds to our
understanding of it.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.880
So I think finding spaces
where science, engineering,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.060
math, intersect with
things like music

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.700
that people are often
already passionate about

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.100
is the really
interesting way for me

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.350
to try to bridge these things
together and try to make

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.150
science more accessible.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.812
[FLUTE PLAYING]

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:34.270
MAYA KEREN: I think that any
way that you kind of see music

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.728
from a different
lens, whether it's

00:03:35.728 --> 00:03:39.247
from a historical lens or
a very theoretical lens --

00:03:39.247 --> 00:03:41.830
and in this sense, it's kind of
like a physical and scientific

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.270
lens, if you're going
to make new discoveries.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.020
And I think in this case
a lot of the discoveries

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.310
are based on digging up
what is the actual physical

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.970
and scientific foundations of
how music is made in the world.
