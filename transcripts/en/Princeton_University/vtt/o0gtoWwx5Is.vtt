00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:13.000
(music)

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.380
Eric Schmidt:
I'm Eric Schmidt, Class of 1976.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.421 position:91%
Eric Schmidt:
I was an electrical engineering major because there was no

00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:21.890 position:98%
Eric Schmidt:
computer science, now there is, and I am now the CEO of Google.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.714 position:94%
Eric Schmidt:
It seems to me that people go to college, and then they join

00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:30.000 position:97%
Eric Schmidt:
their firms, and between the ages of 25 and 35 they learn a lot.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.445 position:97%
Eric Schmidt:
And then, all of a sudden, they want everything not to change.

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:39.605 position:98%
Eric Schmidt:
And inevitably something new comes along: a new idea, a new fashion, a new country,

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:42.950 position:69%
Eric Schmidt:
a new war, whatever, that upsets everything.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.117 position:92%
Eric Schmidt:
So the lesson to be learned after years of watching this is

00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:49.130
Eric Schmidt:
that the norm must change.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.404 position:81%
Eric Schmidt:
What we want to do is we want to constantly reinvent

00:00:51.404 --> 00:00:52.920 position:58%
Eric Schmidt:
ourselves. Now it's easy to say that.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.209 position:73%
Eric Schmidt:
How do you do it? In our case, we encourage our

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:58.727 position:98%
Eric Schmidt:
employees to spend 20 percent of their time working on whatever

00:00:58.727 --> 00:01:01.960 position:84%
Eric Schmidt:
they are interested in, not what their boss wants them

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.614 position:97%
Eric Schmidt:
to work on. Out of that, most of our great new products have come.

00:01:11.468 --> 00:01:13.430 position:59%
Eric Schmidt:
Many different leadership styles work.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.825 position:89%
Eric Schmidt:
There's not one leadership style that is the way in which

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:20.730
Eric Schmidt:
corporations, institutions succeed.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.159 position:95%
Eric Schmidt:
You'll have passionate, charismatic and disorganized leaders.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.459 position:81%
Eric Schmidt:
You'll have boring and rational and precise leaders.

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:30.396 position:89%
Eric Schmidt:
What really matters about a leader is their commitment to

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:33.700 position:95%
Eric Schmidt:
getting to the right answer and to doing it in the right way.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.596 position:81%
Eric Schmidt:
And however they get there, if they get to the right

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.300
Eric Schmidt:
answer, people respect them.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.932 position:67%
Eric Schmidt:
Along the way, you'll have conflict and you

00:01:40.932 --> 00:01:45.352 position:97%
Eric Schmidt:
can resolve it in many different ways. If you don't seek out the

00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:47.420
Eric Schmidt:
conflict, you won't excel.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.760 position:95%
Eric Schmidt:
Because without the conflict, at least the ideas in conflict,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.610
Eric Schmidt:
you won't hear the best ideas.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.330 position:69%
Eric Schmidt:
When I thought about where to go to college,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.480 position:78%
Eric Schmidt:
everyone assumed I would go to a technical school,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.890 position:78%
Eric Schmidt:
someplace where people with my interests would go.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.355 position:78%
Eric Schmidt:
But I was attracted to Princeton precisely because

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:08.370 position:59%
Eric Schmidt:
engineering was not its primary focus.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.882 position:97%
Eric Schmidt:
And I believe that the value of a liberal arts education just in

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.663 position:59%
Eric Schmidt:
general, just learning about the world

00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:17.488 position:97%
Eric Schmidt:
and learning about other people, would serve me in some inchoate

00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:19.409 position:69%
Eric Schmidt:
way, some way in which I really didn't know.

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.530
Eric Schmidt:
And that's proven true --

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.105 position:69%
Eric Schmidt:
that the skills and in particular the social

00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:27.702 position:89%
Eric Schmidt:
experiences and exposure to the non-technical part of the

00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:31.669 position:86%
Eric Schmidt:
world as a young person, made a huge difference for me.

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:35.210 position:95%
Eric Schmidt:
In my case, I met a brilliant professor who got me interested

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.508 position:88%
Eric Schmidt:
in computing and got me interested in the foundations of

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:41.690 position:77%
Eric Schmidt:
the kinds of things I did after I left Princeton.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.079 position:92%
Eric Schmidt:
So it was the combination of critical thinking and the fact

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.759 position:97%
Eric Schmidt:
that you had such good access to professors who you could really

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:52.327
Eric Schmidt:
talk to, that as a very, very young

00:02:52.327 --> 00:02:55.919
Eric Schmidt:
person had a huge impact on me.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.379 position:84%
Eric Schmidt:
My name is Eric Schmidt, and I'm a Princeton Engineer.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:29.000
