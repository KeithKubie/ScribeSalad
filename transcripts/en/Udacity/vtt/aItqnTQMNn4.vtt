00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.230
In this lesson, we learned how
treating your screen as a shared stage

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.480
that elements purposely move in and out
of makes your UI more understandable.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.430
&gt;&gt; We studied how animation can
explain complex state changes and

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.730
make the user feel in control.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.660
&gt;&gt; We considered what makes
a good transition and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.500
how to apply this to
the elements in your UI.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.120
&gt;&gt; And finally, we looked at how motion
can provide elements of delight and

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.610
whimsy that express
the personality of your app.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.610
&gt;&gt; Stay with us for the next lesson,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.760
where we'll study how to apply
everything we've learned so far to

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.100
the myriad of devices out there through
something we call adaptive design.
