00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:22.844
(upbeat music)

00:00:45.287 --> 00:00:47.940
- Welcome to a conversation with history.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.980
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.080
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.540
Our guest today is William Cronon

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.557
who is the Frederick
Jackson Turner professor

00:00:56.557 --> 00:01:00.450
of history, geography and
environmental studies,

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.260
and the Vilas research professor

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.405
at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:10.750
Professor Cronon, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.770
- [William] Thanks for having me.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.995
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:14.940
- I was born in New Haven, Connecticut.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.100
I'm an academic brat,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.380
so I've lived in university
towns all my life.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.210
I spent the first six years
of my life in New Haven,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.080
a couple of years in Lincoln, Nebraska,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.420
and then from third grade on

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.780
through the end of my undergraduate years

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.090
in Madison, Wisconsin.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.530
- Looking back how did your parents

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.940
shape your thinking about the world?

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.370
- Pretty deeply I would say.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.650
My father was an American
historian as I am.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.410
I ended up following in his footsteps

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.010
much more closely than I
ever imagined that I would.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.880
From him I learned the habit of

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.380
looking at pretty much
everything historically

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.470
asking how did things get to be this way?

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.770
He was a wonderful storyteller,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.990
and always had historical
stories to tell about

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.560
wherever it was that we might be.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.640
My mother was really interested in

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.260
natural history and science,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.820
and those ended up being kind of

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.730
the converging interests of my life.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.950
I'm kind of endlessly
fascinated by nature,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.210
but I tend to approach
nature historically.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.920
For me almost everything
has a story in it,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.538
and finding those stories

00:02:15.538 --> 00:02:17.880
is what I really devoted my life to doing.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.457
- I have the sense from reading about you,

00:02:20.457 --> 00:02:22.330
and reading your writings that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.110
being in Wisconsin

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.170
really shaped you in a
very distinctive way.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.730
- Yeah, I would say that's true,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.700
and many complicated ways that ranged from

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.570
Wisconsin it's a Midwestern
kind of humble landscape.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.560
It doesn't have the sublime
drama of California.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.250
It's rolling hills, lot of
flatlands, lot of wetlands.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.790
It's not a dramatic place,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.820
and yet it's also a place
where there's a lot of nature,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.180
and there's also a lot of
people living near nature.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.240
Often nature's that other people

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.780
might not even notice were nature,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.200
so a lot of farming, a lot of woodlands.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.510
It's a culture in which people
are outdoors all the time,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.132
and that was the world I grew up in.

00:03:06.132 --> 00:03:09.727
My hobby as a boy was
actually cave exploring.

00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:11.620
I had friends with whom

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.300
I went all over the state of Wisconsin

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.660
trying to find caves, and exploring caves.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.782
I came to read the Wisconsin landscape

00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:21.123
for what was underneath it
looking at the landscape

00:03:21.123 --> 00:03:24.000
trying to figure out where caves might be,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.160
and that notion that there's
a hidden invisible world,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.830
a world that most people
don't know how to see,

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.780
and if you can only learn to look for it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.120
you see things that other people don't.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.980
Oddly, cave exploring was one of my ways

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.010
of learning how to do that.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.030
- I think I read somewhere
that in high school was it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.530
that you did a project on
vegetation where you were

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.860
making note of all the
different vegetation around you?

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.350
- Yeah, one of the things that
a lot of people were doing

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.510
in the mid 20th century,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.540
and I would have been
late to this process,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.730
but Wisconsin was one of the
places where it was pioneered

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.050
was they used the original
land survey records

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.210
when the federal surveyors
first came across the landscape,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.730
and put the grid down
that turned landscape

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.660
into real estate in many
parts of the United States,

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.800
and they would cite the trees
as they laid down that grid.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.340
It turns out you can use those trees

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.806
the trees that marked
the corners of the grid

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:18.990
as a kind of ecological sample

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.450
of what the vegetation in
that landscape looked like

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.960
150 years ago now.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.850
A high school research project that I did

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.060
in my junior and senior
years of high school

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.872
was to take a county in Wisconsin,

00:04:29.872 --> 00:04:31.799
look at all the survey marks,

00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:35.070
and build a map of what
the vegetation had been

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.090
in that county in the 1840s, 1830s.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.060
- I know that you are
very focused on the link

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.172
between history and nature,

00:04:43.172 --> 00:04:47.590
but it also sounds like the
history of nature itself,

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.090
in other words, it's evolution over time.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.980
- Oh, yeah, very much so.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.740
In fact, I entered college
thinking partly based on

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.220
the project you just asked about

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.040
that I would be a
quantitative plant ecologist,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.400
and for a while I thought
I would be a geologist.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.646
In fact, geology has
been a passion of mine,

00:05:02.646 --> 00:05:05.290
actually, all the way back to those caves,

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.091
and it continues to be
kind of a passion of mine.

00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:12.416
In a funny kind of way
geology, ecology, human history

00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:13.840
they're all history,

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.816
they're all the story of
landscape change over time.

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:22.460
I often think of landscape
as one of my favorite words

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.380
is the word for medieval
manuscripts a palimpsest

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.030
in which these very
valuable pieces of vellum

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.990
that the monks would
write on were so valuable

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.850
that they couldn't bear to throw them out,

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.650
and when they were done
with the manuscript

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.540
they scraped off the letters,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.350
and wrote something new on that vellum.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.000
You can now read the hidden
script on those documents

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.833
if you know how to do so,

00:05:42.833 --> 00:05:44.427
and the idea that landscape is like that

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:48.440
that's it's layer upon layer
of texts that we can read

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.730
if we know the language
if we have the skills.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.070
The languages come from
many different disciplines,

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.984
geology, ecology, chemistry,
physics, astronomy,

00:05:56.984 --> 00:05:59.090
English literature, you name it.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.184
I'm interested in, yes,
the history of nature,

00:06:01.184 --> 00:06:03.200
and I'm interested in the history

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.930
of the way we think about
nature our ideas of nature.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.440
- You started in photography very early

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.340
so the visual is very important for you.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.668
- The visual has been very
important to me all along.

00:06:14.668 --> 00:06:17.310
My dad had photography as a hobby,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.140
another thing that he gave me,

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.057
and he actually had an old

00:06:20.057 --> 00:06:23.330
Kodak 35 millimeter Rangefinder camera

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.790
that I think had been his camera

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.880
in the late 1940s, early 1950s.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.070
One of my proudest possessions as a boy

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.995
was when he had moved onto an SLR,

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:37.270
a much more advanced modern camera,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.387
and he gave me this old Rangefinder.

00:06:39.387 --> 00:06:43.910
I'd say for about, oh,
five, six, seven years

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.840
that camera was one of the ways

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.404
that I would go into the landscape,

00:06:48.404 --> 00:06:52.228
and see the landscape through
the frame of the camera's eye.

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:54.230
So that, too, was a skill, right?

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.130
Learning how to see through a lens,

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.660
and thinking through
what the lens requires

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.700
both technically in terms of exposure,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.320
but also aesthetically
in terms of composition,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.027
and the history of how
cameras have that form,

00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:09.880
and the history of why
we frame the way we do.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.390
All those, too, have stories

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.530
that I'm interested in exploring.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.530
- Also important for you has been

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.167
the University of Wisconsin
both in the sense that

00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:22.240
that's where you did your
undergraduate training,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.884
and it's where you came back from Yale

00:07:24.884 --> 00:07:27.500
after getting your education,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.977
your advanced education at
Yale and teaching at Yale.

00:07:30.977 --> 00:07:35.574
Talk about Wisconsin
you as an undergraduate,

00:07:35.574 --> 00:07:39.560
and any particular professor
who really influenced you.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.740
- Yeah, well, I was very, very much formed

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.080
by the University of Wisconsin,

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.530
and remember I was the
child of a professor there,

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.340
so when I say I'm an academic brat

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.565
there's a way in which I was
in the University of Wisconsin

00:07:49.565 --> 00:07:52.630
from third grade forward
in a funny kind of way,

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.860
so I grew up my high school
was with a lot of academic kids

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.840
we were exposed to the
university all along.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.330
I would say it's what you've
heard me describe about

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.423
the interest of people in a landscape

00:08:05.423 --> 00:08:07.540
has actually been an intellectual passion

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.689
of that institution really
going back to the 19th century

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:13.450
with initial awareness that Wisconsin

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.887
is a glaciated landscape,

00:08:14.887 --> 00:08:17.750
and the reading of
glaciation in that landscape

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.500
is a way of understanding, again,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.440
the hidden scripts of Wisconsin.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.650
Frederick Jackson Turner
one of the best-known

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.900
of the faculty members on that
campus in the 19th century

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.270
with his idea of the frontier

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.900
that, too, had a big influence on me.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.630
As an undergrad the teachers
who most affected me

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.516
by far the most important was
a man named Richard Ringler

00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:40.050
who I almost by accident took a course

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.645
in my freshman year
called the Anglo-Saxons,

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:44.920
which was a literature course,

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.350
but really a cultural history course on

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.430
Dark Age Britain from the 5th century AD

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.616
to about the 12th century AD,

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:57.510
and he taught that course with
pictures and with objects,

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.410
and with a kind of
kaleidoscopic understanding

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.470
of what the landscape of Great Britain

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.650
had been like during that period,

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.440
the ideas, the cultures, all of that.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.000
One other teacher in my
senior year taught a course

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.750
on the history of the American
West and the frontier,

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.310
and that's what sort of turned me away

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.060
from the Middle Ages and
toward the American West,

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.150
and I eventually went
to Yale to learn about,

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.730
and then teach the Trans-Mississippi West,

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.640
but when I got the chance
to come back to Madison

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.863
15 years later I chose to do that.

00:09:28.721 --> 00:09:33.170
- One of the interests that I
like to pursue in my program

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.086
is kind of how intellectual
communities emerge,

00:09:37.086 --> 00:09:39.933
and what are their foundation.

00:09:41.887 --> 00:09:46.270
Is it the landscape that
you've just described,

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.146
and what Wisconsin's relation to nature

00:09:51.146 --> 00:09:53.118
that is formative here?

00:09:53.118 --> 00:09:57.005
Has it been the genius of
the leaders of the university

00:09:57.005 --> 00:10:00.910
so that you get an intellectual community

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.410
that really reflects
this natural environment?

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.520
- Yeah, it's a really great question,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.690
and we could spend the next hour

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.940
just trying to answer that question,

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.350
which I know you don't want to do,

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.480
so a couple of quick answers.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.200
I've been puzzling about this
question really all my life.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.449
I'm quite intrigued why
the University of Wisconsin

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.060
has this kind of peculiar culture.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.040
Many other universities
that are great institutions

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.491
don't have the kind of
embeddedness in place

00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:27.720
that that place has had
and it's partly leaders.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.057
It's partly people like
Frederick Jackson Turner,

00:10:30.057 --> 00:10:33.110
or Aldo Leopold, folks
like that that people know,

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.450
or for that matter John Muir

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.640
who we associate with California,

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.867
but who grew up in Wisconsin,

00:10:37.867 --> 00:10:40.037
and was very much shaped by Wisconsin,

00:10:40.037 --> 00:10:44.110
but oddly an institutional
explanation I would say is that

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.570
UW-Madison is actually one
of the very few universities

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.730
in the country that is both
the liberal arts university,

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.310
and the land-grant engineering
and agricultural school.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.990
Many, many Midwestern states

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.900
have a University of
Iowa and an Iowa State,

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.910
or a University of Kansas
and a Kansas State,

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.876
but in Wisconsin the legislature,

00:11:04.876 --> 00:11:08.930
actually, over the opposition
of the Madison faculty

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.610
insisted that the
land-grant the ag school,

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.752
the engineering school
be on the same campus

00:11:13.752 --> 00:11:16.290
as the liberal arts school.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.730
Oddly, I think it's
actually been that dialogue

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.290
between the liberal arts tradition

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.160
the kind of broad understanding
of the human experience

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.750
which is the great I think contribution

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.218
of the liberal art perspective
to higher education

00:11:29.218 --> 00:11:32.027
with the much more
practical applied knowledge

00:11:32.027 --> 00:11:34.050
of the ag schools, the engineering schools

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.147
those kinds of professional schools

00:11:36.147 --> 00:11:39.836
that really has created a
really interesting dialogue

00:11:39.836 --> 00:11:43.863
at UW-Madison much of it over agriculture.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.620
- I also get a sense in
reading up about you,

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.820
and the ideas that have motivated you

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.570
that this University of Wisconsin setting,

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.780
and Madison and Wisconsin

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.670
imbue one with a sense of
community and community service,

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.223
and the public good and so on.

00:12:06.223 --> 00:12:08.516
- Very much so and that's
a tradition that goes back

00:12:08.516 --> 00:12:11.860
really to the governorship
of Bob La Follette

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.740
the great progressive Republican governor

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.210
at the beginning of the 20th century

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.130
whose roommate in college

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.050
had actually been a man named
Charles Richard Van Hise

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.560
who was the first PhD from
the University of Wisconsin.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.900
Van Hise would actually
write the first textbook

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.310
on natural resource conservation
in the United States.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.830
They were very close friends,

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.360
and when La Follette became governor

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.040
he and his old roommate hatched the idea

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.900
which they called The Wisconsin Idea

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.910
that the university should exist

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.170
in the service of the people of the state,

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.300
and the motto of that
was that the boundaries

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.220
of the university are the
boundaries of the state.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.780
We now say the boundaries of the state,

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.810
the boundaries of the nation,

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.320
the boundaries of the world,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.153
but this idea that the
university exists to serve

00:12:55.153 --> 00:12:58.730
that is it's not in an ivory
tower separate from the world,

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.983
but it is in the world
and being in the world

00:13:01.983 --> 00:13:05.900
intellectual work needs to be in dialogue

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.810
with what's out there in the world,

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.010
so Wisconsin led the way.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.350
It invented the idea of social security.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.958
There are actually a whole
series of public policy reforms

00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.570
in the early 20th century

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.844
that came out of this Wisconsin idea,

00:13:18.844 --> 00:13:20.850
and then by the time of the new deal

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.607
were being mapped onto
the nation as a whole.

00:13:23.607 --> 00:13:28.607
- You then after doing
your BA work in Wisconsin

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.180
you took a break from
Wisconsin so to speak,

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.700
and were Rhodes Scholar at Oxford,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.972
and then graduate student at Yale,

00:13:37.972 --> 00:13:39.430
and then you taught at Yale.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.219
What did you get that
was different or additive

00:13:43.219 --> 00:13:45.490
in these two educational experiences?

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:49.883
- Well, that, too, would
be a complicated question.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.920
Oxford was revelatory to
me in all sorts of ways.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.670
Living in England living
in the British Isles

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.400
was revelatory because this
habit of reading landscape

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.610
that I had already acquired from Madison

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.503
in England the time depth and
the multitude of cultural,

00:14:07.503 --> 00:14:10.540
and environmental layers
that take you back

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.580
from the present day to
the Industrial Revolution

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.210
to before the Industrial
Revolution to the enclosures

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.400
to the Norman French to the Anglo-Saxons

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.980
to the Celts to the Romans

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.960
those layers are all
legible in that landscape.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.060
The English the Brits in general

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.492
have had a fascination for that place

00:14:29.492 --> 00:14:34.120
I would say that surpasses most
places in the United States.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.070
It was just

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.130
a feast for somebody
with my kind of curiosity

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.680
to be in that kind of place
with those kinds of guides,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.740
and I wrote a dissertation
there on energy consumption

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.750
because I was working in the late 1970s

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.690
at the time of the energy crisis,

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.980
but I knew I wanted to come back,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.690
and work on the history
of the American West,

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.440
and at that time, interestingly,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.020
Yale was one of the leading
places in the United States

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.470
to study the Trans-Mississippi
West because of a wonderful

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.370
scholar and teacher
there named Howard Lamar,

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.960
and I came to work with him.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.740
He became the dean of Yale College,

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.500
and I essentially was
hired to be his replacement

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.773
while he was being dean.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.560
What I think I got from
both Oxford and Yale

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.650
that I hadn't gotten from
Wisconsin was the idea of

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.570
it's hard to describe

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.600
institutions that were deeply committed to

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.560
undergraduates learning
in a liberal arts college

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.480
kind of community setting,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.060
so the idea that undergrads
were in small communities

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.850
which is not Wisconsin strength,

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.220
and for that matter Berkeley strength.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.068
It's not smallness it's largeness,

00:15:42.068 --> 00:15:45.050
and the richness that comes from size.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:48.010
Yale and Oxford are much
smaller more intimate places,

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.890
and I came to have an
appreciation for that intimacy

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.740
of the undergraduate
experience at those places,

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.933
which when I moved back to Madison

00:15:54.933 --> 00:15:58.530
I actually tried to set up a
residential college at Madison

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.620
based on the Yale and Oxford models

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.686
was fascinating attempt to do that.

00:16:02.686 --> 00:16:06.672
- You actually have a paper
in which you sort of define

00:16:06.672 --> 00:16:11.500
what values you would like to see in

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.500
liberal arts students who
really have such an education.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.170
- Yeah, it's an essay called Only Connect

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.250
that was published first
in the American Scholar

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.860
you can see it on my website.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.136
I actually wrote it at the
time that I was working on

00:16:25.136 --> 00:16:28.960
this residential college at Madison,

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.460
and in it I tried to
articulate what I defined

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.440
as 10 qualities of a
liberally educated mind

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.020
that I think of as the
goal of liberal education,

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.590
and that I would say research
universities in particular

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.620
are often at risk to forget
the kind of very basic things

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.980
like learning to read, learning to talk,

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:48.970
learning to put yourself

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.000
in another persons frame of reference,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.480
and trying to understand the world

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.040
from another point of view.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.890
Those are the civil benefits I would say

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.883
of higher education in the
liberal arts tradition.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.829
Then the research
universities which I cherish

00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:06.770
I am utterly a creature
of research universities

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.760
in terms of my upbringing
and how I think of the world,

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.010
but in the research universities

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.040
we tend to narrow our focus we dive deep,

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.391
and what we get from those
deep dives is extraordinary,

00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:20.769
but in the world you
need to also be able to

00:17:20.769 --> 00:17:22.910
open the frame back up,

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.437
and see those deep dives
in a larger context,

00:17:25.437 --> 00:17:28.580
and that to me has been the
great gift of liberal education

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.550
to the United States of America.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.383
It's one of the things

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:33.870
I'm really committed to try to preserve

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.327
that liberal education
tradition in the United States

00:17:36.327 --> 00:17:38.703
at a time when I think it's under threat.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.520
- What is involved what is
the struggle like to implement

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.520
this kind of vision at a
major research university?

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.460
I mean, what is most frustrating,

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.453
and what is most fulfilling?

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.860
- Well, again, we could talk
a long time about that one,

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.530
but I would say that if I had to give you

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.250
two very quick answers to that one,

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:10.030
one would be we specialists,

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.780
and I'm as much a specialist as anybody

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.090
love nothing more than to
invite you into my specialty,

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.070
and show you what a wondrous world

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.270
is in this very small place

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.873
that I've devoted my
life to understanding.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.700
We're often not so good at saying,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.250
well, see here's this speciality,

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.755
and here's this speciality
and here's this specialty

00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:32.313
what do they share?

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.500
If we were to have a dialogue
across the boundaries

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.380
what might that look like?

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.580
Although we sometimes
pay lip service to that,

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.100
and we certainly say it's important to do

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.930
I'm not sure we're actually
all that good always to do it,

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.555
and we often throw the kids the undergrads

00:18:46.555 --> 00:18:49.840
sort of out into this vast
menu of all these specialties

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.200
we want them exposed to,

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.480
and we kind of expect
them to do the integrating

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.750
rather than us help them do that.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.096
I think the R1s the research universities

00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:00.596
are in general not as good at that

00:19:00.596 --> 00:19:03.003
as the little liberal arts colleges.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.430
They in many ways I think have
been the keepers of the flame

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.960
of that kind of undergrad integration

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.950
more than the research
universities have been.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.180
The other thing I would say
as an answer to that question

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:19.400
is I think the big places,
the big research universities

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.660
often disempower undergrads

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.630
without noticing that they're doing it.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.993
They often take it as an assumption

00:19:27.993 --> 00:19:30.170
that the center of the enterprise

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.740
are the research faculty,

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.300
and maybe their graduate students,

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.923
and maybe the research staff,

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.340
and the undergraduate mission is not quite

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.280
sort of the deep, deep
purpose of the institution

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.280
which is not to say

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.360
you can't get an absolutely
great undergraduate education

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.540
at a Berkeley, or a Madison,
at Ann Arbor, or whatever,

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.420
but you have to know how to find it,

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.560
whereas, a little liberal arts place

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.530
I'm visiting Reed College later this week,

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.613
those kind of places that's what they do

00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:00.210
the kids are the heart
of their enterprise.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.670
- In a way as an outsider

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.660
one sees history as
the best hope in a way,

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.879
or one of the best hope
with the humanities

00:20:09.879 --> 00:20:14.879
more broadly preserving this

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.500
liberal arts perspective,

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.990
so let's switch gears here a minute,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.380
and talk about what the
skills and temperament

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.530
you see of students
who want to do history,

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.260
and who become historians,

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.610
and then we'll talk about
how the world is changing.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.510
- Yeah, sure, well, I'm glad you say that

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.190
that history is one of the
best hopes of preserving

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.110
this liberal arts tradition
because I believe that.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.080
I believe in the others too.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.050
I believe in philosophy,

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.900
I believe in literature, all of them,

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.313
but I would say history,

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.440
and notice all specialists
do what I'm about to do,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.230
so a chemist can say this too.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.030
A geologist can say this too.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.030
There's a way in which
history is the whole world.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.993
There is nothing in the world

00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:01.644
that you can't ask a
historical question about,

00:21:01.644 --> 00:21:03.330
and the thing you're asking about

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.500
becomes bigger and deeper and richer

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:09.220
by having said where did it
come from, why is it this way?

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.570
I would say that one of the
habits of mind of the historian

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.230
is looking at everything
in the way I just said.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.550
No matter what it is whether
it's the glasses I'm wearing

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.790
where did these come?

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:22.831
Who started making them?

00:21:22.831 --> 00:21:24.140
Why are they made the way?

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.503
How do people grind lenses like this?

00:21:25.503 --> 00:21:27.170
When did they start doing that?

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.410
We can take anything and do it that way,

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.590
but the second question,

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.010
the second question that
historians always ask,

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:40.980
and it seems so stupidly
obvious that it's almost trite,

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.363
but when you live inside
the second question

00:21:44.363 --> 00:21:48.823
it goes forever is what are the documents?

00:21:50.011 --> 00:21:53.400
How would I find out where
these glasses came from?

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.870
What are all the glasses
that have survived?

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.880
When did the first lens maker

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.310
write an account of how you grind a lens?

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.620
How would I find that
document where would it be?

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.770
That looking for looking for documents,

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:08.100
piecing together the
kaleidoscopic jigsaw puzzle

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.740
which are all these fragments

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.810
which have come down to us from the past

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.720
is really not the way other
disciplines ask questions,

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.690
so that's one thing that
history gives the world.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.367
The last one I would give you though is

00:22:20.367 --> 00:22:25.367
historians are committed
to ordinary language.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.430
They speak plain English

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.450
not that they don't use
certain words in special ways,

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:34.210
but they're not as fond
of inventing neologisms,

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.760
new words as many disciplines are.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.740
They don't speak a secret language

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.820
that only experts know how to understand,

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.860
so there's a kind of accessibility
of historical writing

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:46.920
which if you believe

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.010
that academic work should be in the world,

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.360
and should be accessible to ordinary folks

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.880
that ordinary languageness
of history is a good thing,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.840
and one reason for the ordinary
languageness is storytelling

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.490
that the commitment to narrative,

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.600
the commitment to when
I answer the question

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.970
how did it get to be this way?

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:11.970
That invites a story that's
almost a required story

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.690
is the answer to that kind of question.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.610
Most disciplines, although, I would argue

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:21.440
they all actually build
narrative, they build story.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.410
They don't actually tell a story.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:27.290
The rhetoric they use is
not a storytelling rhetoric,

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.009
and there is something
about story, I believe,

00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:34.170
that is about as deeply a
part of human consciousness

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.730
as any feature of the way

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.610
human beings make meaning in the world.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.660
We make meaning by telling stories,

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.240
and many of the stories
we tell are about the past

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.252
that's what history is.

00:23:44.252 --> 00:23:46.380
- You were the president

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.990
of the American Historical Association,

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:52.320
and in your address and columns
you wrote for that office

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.073
you talk about a second component

00:23:54.073 --> 00:23:57.720
which is coming to
understand a foreign country,

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:02.720
so in addition to wanting
to know how we got here

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.110
you really want to answer that question

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.950
by knowing what it was like back then,

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.957
but in the terms of the people
who lived in that period.

00:24:11.957 --> 00:24:14.480
- Yeah, and this one is a
hard and complicated one

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.503
because in general I would
say more often than not

00:24:18.503 --> 00:24:20.750
people who are not historians

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.260
come to history through the first question

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.680
how did things get to be this way?

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.690
Certainly, when I teach an 18-year-old

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.430
they haven't lived that much history.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.490
They don't have that much
time depth in their own life,

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.400
and they have a kind of late adolescence,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.270
and how did I get to be me?

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.770
So there's a way in which

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.510
one of the most interesting
stories is always,

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.660
well, how did I get to be
me and by me I mean us.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:48.280
So where did we come from
is kind of intrinsically

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.680
a starting point for
storytelling about the past,

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.770
but for professional historians

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.650
we're always a little
nervous about that question

00:24:55.650 --> 00:25:00.280
because it kind of implies
that that past back there

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:05.280
existed to become us its
purpose was to become us,

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.210
and that could not be
farther from the truth

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.100
because those people back
there existed to be them.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.740
They didn't know they
were gonna become us.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.640
Many of them didn't want to become us.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.250
So learning to recognize that

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.540
they are equally powerful questions.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.680
In fact, the first one
how do we get to be us

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.250
is actually more interesting
when you recognize

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.340
how different those
people were back there.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.920
The way I often put this is
the past is a foreign country.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.589
Those people back there
were really unlike us

00:25:34.589 --> 00:25:38.400
even those who are nearest to us.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.030
My grandparents my great-parents
people kind of deeply

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.850
in my racial gendered classed identities

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.250
they are really different from me.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.590
So learning that no matter who they were,

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:55.650
their alienness, their
difference, their autonomy,

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.580
the rich selves that they inhabited

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.230
I owe them honor, I owe them respect,

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.558
and asking how that
complicated world back there

00:26:05.558 --> 00:26:08.570
made these really tricky,

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.300
unexpected journeys to become our world,

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.070
well, those two together become one story,

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.380
but not everybody begins
with the second one.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.310
You have to lead them to the second one.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.937
That's what professional historians do.

00:26:21.937 --> 00:26:26.440
- So as you go back and
you find this foreign land,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.403
so to speak,

00:26:28.484 --> 00:26:31.290
and at the same time

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.410
your goal is to figure out

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:38.629
how we got here today
because of that foreign land,

00:26:38.629 --> 00:26:43.473
so the historian has to
balance these two things.

00:26:44.587 --> 00:26:47.310
Are you saying that storytelling

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:53.890
is a way to carry this
information from the past,

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:58.930
and bring it to the present so
that both fellow historians,

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.820
students and a wider audience

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.819
will then appreciate this vocation?

00:27:04.819 --> 00:27:07.360
- Yes, that's deeply what I believe,

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.620
and I think it's deeply
what my discipline believes.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.453
That's the reason why

00:27:10.453 --> 00:27:14.180
we really are unapologetic
about narrative.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.270
Many, many disciplines in the 20th century

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.620
came to regard narrative as unscientific

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.840
because it's not sufficiently ambitious

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.510
in the generalizations
that it had to offer,

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.100
whereas, there's a way in
which history by its nature

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.130
we believe that it's all
of their broad patterns

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.300
each story is unique,

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.430
and that's the property of storytelling

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.790
that if I tell a story
well it's a unique story.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.080
You come to care about the characters,

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.730
and the experiences
and the lived realities

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.593
of that set of characters
that are in that story.

00:27:49.456 --> 00:27:51.127
I do believe, again,

00:27:51.127 --> 00:27:55.630
that a deep part of human
pattern making, meaning making

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.780
is we empathize with people.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.860
We come to put ourselves in their shoes.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.600
When we can inhabit a
story where we can imagine

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.500
being in that place in that time

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.470
nothing does that so well
as narrative I would say.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:17.380
- You have an article which
is on your website about,

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.870
I think the article was done

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.960
for the Wisconsin Historical Society,

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.361
and it's about a particular place that

00:28:25.361 --> 00:28:26.778
became preserved,

00:28:29.146 --> 00:28:29.979
and was

00:28:33.734 --> 00:28:35.090
a historical site,

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:39.270
and you relate that to a
woman who lived in the past.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.460
I think her name was Juliette Kinzie

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:46.760
who actually wrote a book

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.170
that described the people and the places,

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.180
and why this house which she lived in

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.920
was important in terms of those stories,

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.300
so this is a particular example

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.700
of what you're talking about

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.690
that nobody really might
care about this historic site

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.280
unless we had her stories.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.610
- Right, exactly right,

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.030
and she wrote a book called Wau-Bun,

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.110
which I think is one of
the best accounts we have

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.063
of life on the Wisconsin
frontier in the 1830s.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.480
Actually, it's in a place
called Portage, Wisconsin

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.010
which is a remarkable place.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:25.150
I've spent literally the last 20 years

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.310
working on a huge book
about Portage, Wisconsin.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.850
It was Frederick Jackson
Turner's hometown.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.330
It's where John Muir migrated

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.030
as an 11-year-old boy from Scotland.

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.260
It's where Aldo Leopold's
Shack was located.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.710
It's the naval of the universe
for American ideas of nature,

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.340
but there's also Juliette Kinzie
sitting in what was called

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.180
the Indian Agency House in the 1830s,

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.113
and she wrote this book.

00:29:46.113 --> 00:29:49.580
It's not a particularly
dramatic or ambitious book.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.700
It's about life on the frontier,

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.120
but she's a wonderful writer.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.040
She's a storyteller she
is herself telling stories

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.810
about the world she's in,

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.650
and because she's such a vivid storyteller

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:05.870
she sees so vividly and she
builds stories so vividly

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.210
she's actually one of our best windows

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:09.480
onto that world back then,

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.210
so she becomes a character in my story,

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.250
and that's, in fact, I think

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.950
how history and storytelling work.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.410
There's stories that become
objects of other stories,

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.910
and those stories become
objects of stories.

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:24.950
It's this ever elaborating
web of narrative,

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.103
which is what we swim
in with human beings.

00:30:28.031 --> 00:30:32.463
- There's a challenge here and a dilemma.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.400
The challenge it seems to me is

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:42.280
becoming a historian
requires learning rigor,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.430
learning how to pose a question,

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:47.880
learning how to interview
all sorts of things as one,

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.770
and actually you explore
this on your website

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.760
which I highly recommend,

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.010
but on the other hand it involves

00:30:59.238 --> 00:31:00.773
a kind of empathy,

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:05.430
the ability to write and
tell stories and so on

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:12.122
to actually bring out the
humanness of what you discover.

00:31:12.122 --> 00:31:14.850
Is this a dilemma or do the two,

00:31:15.941 --> 00:31:17.730
the rigor and the historian

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:21.580
which might lead to
boring text and long books

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.630
that people might not
read on the one hand,

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.633
whereas, the ideal,

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.870
you pose the ideal in
your historical address

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.050
as being people like
Michael Pollan a journalist,

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.280
and John Sayles the movie director

00:31:38.742 --> 00:31:42.740
as examples of good storytelling.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.740
Is there a conflict there or not?

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.132
- Well, I don't hold them up as the ideal.

00:31:48.132 --> 00:31:50.220
I'm a great fan of both of them.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.180
I hold them up as an ideal,

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.350
and I contrast their ideal to some extent

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:56.140
with what historians are permitted to do.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.420
It is absolutely true that John Sayles

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.250
can invent narratives about the past

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.860
that I believe convey
truths about the past.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:08.975
They're not lies, they're
not just, just fictions

00:32:08.975 --> 00:32:12.333
as if that just could
do justice to fiction.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.710
They're full of valuable
insight and meaning,

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.370
but they don't follow the
historians rules of evidence

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:21.720
that you're using you're
labeling with the word rigor.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.120
It is true that when I write history

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.170
I have to follow the rules of evidence

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.700
of my discipline or my colleagues,

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:32.130
and my discipline
generally won't recognize

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.130
that I've made a legitimate
claim about the past.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.900
Now I think you can do
that in very engaging ways.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.550
In fact, even when I'm arguing
I usually narrate argument.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.880
I usually will tell you a
story about an argument,

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.290
and I'll build that argument

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.750
as if it had a kind of
narrative shape to it,

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.902
a narrative flow I can tell you a story

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:54.095
that will step you through
the stages of an argument,

00:32:54.095 --> 00:32:58.600
but in my discipline I have
to show you my evidence.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.460
I have to show you what
the basis is back then

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.090
some fragment that has
survived from back then

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.380
that permits me to make
the claim that I'm making.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:12.600
My colleagues in this
discipline are very nervous

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.570
about certain kinds of leaps.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.570
Empathy is one of the
territories where we get nervous

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.997
because if I make

00:33:19.997 --> 00:33:21.920
an unearned leap,

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.920
and I imagine that I can put
myself inside the head of

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.880
Juliette Kinzie at the
Indian Agency House,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.640
and pretend that I'm her

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:35.160
very likely I will violate her reality.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.170
Very likely I will sort of say,

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:40.020
well, of course, she's like
me she's got the same fears.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.040
She's got the same beliefs,

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:46.210
and unless I've worked very
hard to bound that claim,

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.530
and say, you know,
people back in the 1830s

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.900
did not have that set of beliefs.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.120
They did not expect their
lives to look that way,

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.230
and if you take your
21st century assumptions,

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.702
and map them under her you're
actually describing yourself

00:34:01.702 --> 00:34:03.550
you're not describing her,

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:08.550
so we work very hard to
test those empathic move.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.910
I don't think that let's us
off the empathetic hook though

00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:14.760
because ultimately once
you've done all that work,

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.830
once you've tried to
understand her reality

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:17.710
you still have to say

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.960
now that I have this
much richer understanding

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.400
of what it would have been
like to be Juliette Kinzie

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.060
living on the Wisconsin frontier,

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.560
this educated New England
woman that finds herself

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.602
from her point of view out
in the middle of nowhere

00:34:29.602 --> 00:34:31.420
what would that have been like?

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.540
Well, then I can start
imagining within the bounds,

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.960
within the limits of my evidence,

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.260
and I think I can still make you

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.080
care about her by doing that,

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.110
but it's a tricky business.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:44.840
- How do you learn storytelling?

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.840
Do you learn from alternative
ways of doing storytelling

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.540
as you did in your presidential
address always pulling back

00:34:56.303 --> 00:34:59.997
as you just described because
you're not doing fiction

00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:03.350
in the way John Sayles is for example?

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:04.920
- Yeah, no, I would say that.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.640
I think the way I learned storytelling,

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.300
and the way I try to teach my students

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.030
to learn storytelling is to
recognize that it's all story,

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:17.280
everything story is
around you all the time.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.080
When you watch Steven Spielberg tell you

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.870
Abraham Lincoln's story,

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.770
when you read David Donald's
biography of Lincoln,

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.550
or when you read Lincoln's
own speeches and letters

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:32.000
they're all different takes on
this complicated human being

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.880
that you're trying to understand
and they're all fair game

00:35:37.352 --> 00:35:41.230
so that's one way of
looking at Abraham Lincoln.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.913
That's one way of
understanding his reality.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.590
I would say the more
different ways of that

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.943
you pay attention to.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:53.588
One of the things I tell my
students over and over again

00:35:53.588 --> 00:35:56.210
is that if you want to be a writer,

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.500
if you want to be a historian,

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.120
if you want to be a storyteller

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:03.500
you need to read not just
for content but for form,

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.760
and you need to read as a storyteller,

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.083
you need to read as a writer.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.050
Another thing I tell them
as part of that is that

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.650
when you're riveted by the story you're

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.590
turning the pages like
crazy pause, and say why?

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:23.330
What's this writer doing
that's doing this to me?

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:26.020
Conversely when you're
bored out of your mind

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.070
when you've turned the last five pages,

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.740
and realize you have no
memory of them at all

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.930
you've read the same paragraph five times,

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:35.190
and you just can't stay focused on it

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.410
that's actually kind of interesting.

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:40.690
It's actually not boring
to ask why is this boring?

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:44.000
So when you read as a writer even boredom,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.854
even a boring text can be
an exercise in figuring out

00:36:48.854 --> 00:36:53.125
how does a writer lose track
of their audience so much

00:36:53.125 --> 00:36:56.090
that they bore that audience,

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:57.460
and the audience stops reading.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.222
There's no more disastrous
thing for a writer to do

00:37:01.222 --> 00:37:06.222
then for the reader to go
I'm not coming back to that.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.900
I tell my students to
put a three by five card

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.840
over their writing space

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.233
that says will the reader turn the page?

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.130
Will the reader turn the page?

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:19.010
It's the scariest question
any writer can ask.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.190
- So a student of history
should not look at

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:23.240
Steven Spielberg's movie and say,

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:28.240
well, there are these historical
inaccuracies in the thing,

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.508
I mean, you do that.

00:37:29.508 --> 00:37:30.341
- [William] You should do that.

00:37:30.341 --> 00:37:31.174
- You should do that,

00:37:31.174 --> 00:37:34.180
but on the other hand you would
not then dismiss the work,

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.860
but see it as a way,

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.600
well, how did he make Lincoln interesting?

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.820
- Right, that's one thing,

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.020
and how did he get us to
empathize with Lincoln?

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.880
Why did he choose in the middle
of the Obama administration

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.830
to tell that particular
version of Lincoln's story?

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.210
How did he create a moral
fable that is as much about

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.023
the politics of the early 21st century

00:37:54.023 --> 00:37:56.380
as it is a story about the Civil War?

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.570
Notice one of the things historians do is

00:37:58.570 --> 00:37:59.840
we put everything in history,

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.550
so there is a history of
different representations

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.100
of Abraham Lincoln.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.110
In that story there's
nothing inaccurate about

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:10.410
Steven Spielberg's Lincoln

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.887
because that's a story not about Lincoln

00:38:12.887 --> 00:38:15.790
it's a story about stories about Lincoln,

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:18.770
and these days that story,

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:21.059
Spielberg's story, Tony Kushner's story

00:38:21.059 --> 00:38:23.840
based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's story,

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.550
notice the layers of story
that are happening there.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:30.680
Each of those is an absolutely authentic

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.340
totally accurate depiction

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.632
of what one group of artists
in the early 21st century

00:38:36.632 --> 00:38:39.890
had to say about Abraham Lincoln.

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:40.930
We can do that with anything.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.063
What I just did you can do with anything.

00:38:43.063 --> 00:38:45.440
Again, I joke to my students that

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:52.230
even documents that lie
that are total forgeries

00:38:52.466 --> 00:38:57.466
are totally accurate documents
for the history of forgery,

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.010
and for the history of lying,

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.620
so if you're writing a
history of counterfeiting,

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.950
counterfeit documents are
actually totally accurate,

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.580
100% accurate and indispensable

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.993
for the history of counterfeiting.

00:39:10.993 --> 00:39:15.993
- You identify in your
work during your presidency

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:17.720
at the American Historical Association

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.480
two really formidable challenges.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.530
One is the students,

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:28.150
and the extent to which
their prior education

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.670
when you get them in the classroom

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:34.300
may not have prepared them
to read, to think, to write

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.340
all of the values that
you see so important

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.480
for a liberal education,

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.210
so on the one hand there's the challenge

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:44.350
of the student body and
what we do about that.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:47.320
On the other hand is the
challenge of the digital age,

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.230
and both are leading

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:54.380
us away from critical thinking,

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:58.170
from rigor, from reading long-form books.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:39:59.693
Talk a little about that,

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:05.750
and how we address those two
challenges which are related

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:10.750
because the technology is
supporting the students

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:15.752
in their ability to not
have the standards of rigor,

00:40:15.752 --> 00:40:18.900
and of being able to read,

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.823
of distinguishing between
a book and a website.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.530
- Well, that's a really deep question,

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.020
and there were a number of
elements to that question

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.830
that I would want to
tease apart a little bit.

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.663
- [Harry] Please do.

00:40:30.663 --> 00:40:32.150
- One thing I would say is that

00:40:34.706 --> 00:40:38.930
if we take the classic 18
to 22-year-old undergraduate

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:40.890
which, of course, is
no longer is normative

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:43.940
in some ways as it once was as a category

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.210
they have always come to college

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:51.880
with a whole series of
misconceptions and limitations,

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.660
and the whole purpose
of college I would say,

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.230
and this I hope will never change

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.453
is our job as teachers is
to meet them where they are.

00:41:00.642 --> 00:41:03.320
It does no good to complain about,

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.810
well, in the wonderful
glory years of the past

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:08.687
students had all these
skills they don't have,

00:41:08.687 --> 00:41:10.750
and that isn't what you just said,

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.600
but there is a tendency
for middle-aged people

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.866
to look back on the glory
days of their youth,

00:41:15.866 --> 00:41:17.810
and kids today aren't like that.

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.130
I have no patience for that.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.950
These kids bring a wealth of experiences.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:27.950
They bring digital
competences, visual competences

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.860
that my generation for the
most part totally lacked,

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.530
so it's not that they
don't bring knowledge

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.380
they bring lots of knowledge,

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.250
but that's where the other
part of your question,

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.420
I think, kicks in which is

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:42.233
they are not used to reading long texts.

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:45.270
I would say actually
most adults are no longer

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:47.800
all that used to reading long texts.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.610
We are now all of us spending
more and more of our time

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:55.340
in chopped up bloggy, tweety, Facebooky

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.070
very short units of information,

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:01.170
which by their nature of
radically decontextualized.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:04.530
The experience of the search
engine the Google experience

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.670
is that when we need information

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.140
our dominant metaphor now is

00:42:10.077 --> 00:42:12.287
I grab the information,

00:42:12.287 --> 00:42:14.710
and I grab it and it's this big,

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.590
and in grabbing it the
way I just grabbed it

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.870
I ripped it out of the
context that it was in,

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.324
and I didn't actually
have to work very hard

00:42:22.324 --> 00:42:24.760
to extract it from that context.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.620
One of the things
historians believe strongly

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:32.310
is that that struggle to find
this piece of information,

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:35.730
and it's buried in this tangle,

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:38.151
and as we work our way into
the tangle to figure it out

00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:40.590
we learn not just the piece of information

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.530
we learn the tangle,

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.730
and it's the tangle that
educates our intuition,

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.620
and gives us this kind of
rich intuitive knowledge

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.750
about what that world was like.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:55.520
I would say kids today
like most of us today

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.900
are more impatient we want things quickly.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.710
I regularly this astonishes
me this never used to happen

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.910
I now regularly get emails.

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.650
That's the other thing we
think we can just email people

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.530
for information rather
than find it ourselves.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:13.960
I get emails from
undergraduates and I kid you not

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.130
I get more than one or
two of these a month,

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:20.550
and the kid says literally
my professor has assigned me

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.064
to write a book report about your book

00:43:22.064 --> 00:43:23.853
can you tell me what it's about?

00:43:27.128 --> 00:43:31.179
The kid is not trying to cheat.

00:43:31.179 --> 00:43:34.310
They don't think that they're
doing something wrong.

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:37.210
I don't want to be snarky
I'm a teacher to them too.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.300
My job is to meet them where they are,

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.660
and this is a student who thought

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.200
that the way you write a book
report is contact the author,

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.536
and ask the author what the book is about.

00:43:45.536 --> 00:43:48.800
Never in a million years
would that have occurred to me

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.730
as an undergraduate,

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:51.850
but, of course, it's so easy now,

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.860
so I have to very gently
and as kindly as I can say,

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:58.300
you know, the answer to
your question is in my book.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.600
You might want to read it.

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:05.810
It's changing that way of
thinking that idea that

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:09.890
you don't have a primary
experience of reality.

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:11.950
You have a virtual experience of reality,

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:14.781
and a Wikipedia summary is all you need

00:44:14.781 --> 00:44:17.117
as a way of accessing that reality.

00:44:17.117 --> 00:44:19.513
There's some complicated changes going on.

00:44:21.256 --> 00:44:25.000
- Historians in a way

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.400
are positioned to adapt to the web

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.591
even though they may resist the web.

00:44:31.591 --> 00:44:36.591
I draw this conclusion from
your emphasis on storytelling,

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:40.941
and also what you've
written about your teachers,

00:44:40.941 --> 00:44:44.810
and the way they might use

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:47.293
pictures or multimedia.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:54.060
In the classroom they
are having to articulate

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:57.380
their research in ways that

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:02.910
students can understand
and will be enthralled by

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:07.320
so in a way teaching and storytelling

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:12.113
are a stepping stone to
move into the digital age

00:45:12.113 --> 00:45:14.530
historians just have to think about it.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:15.843
- I think that's right.

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:18.890
It's a vice virtue thing.

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:21.690
One of our virtues is that
we do think in stories.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:25.010
Stories are accessible we
write in ordinary language.

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:28.310
Another advantage is that
almost alone, not quite alone,

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:30.860
but almost alone among
the academic disciplines

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.010
we're still a book discipline.

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:34.870
The vast majority of academic disciplines

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:37.660
now have their principle
intellectual output

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.890
in academic journals

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:41.970
which notice have the
interesting attribute

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.920
that they don't need to
assemble their audiences.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.720
The audience is already preassembled.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.782
The group of specialists is
gathered around that journal,

00:45:49.782 --> 00:45:53.123
and the goal is the most
efficient communication

00:45:53.123 --> 00:45:56.864
of new findings to that expert audience,

00:45:56.864 --> 00:45:59.780
so there's not a problem of translation.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.120
You've already got the experts,

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.690
and you want to get it to
them as quickly as possible.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:04.820
They don't want to be
bored with explication

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:07.550
because they already know
the context, whereas,

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:11.790
when you write a book you
have no guaranteed audience.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.050
Every book has to build its own audience.

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:16.530
It has to create its own audience,

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:21.410
so the narrative act
of imagining the other

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:22.890
to whom you're communicating,

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:24.310
and the commitment of my discipline

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:27.610
to ordinary language when I write a book

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:29.710
I do not just want my
colleagues to read it.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:33.620
I want anybody who is
interested to feel intrigued by

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.240
the invitation I'm giving them

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.370
to come into this really cool space

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:39.710
that I want to share with
them that's the virtue.

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:42.993
To finish, though, with
the vice we like books.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.370
The default of my discipline
we're never so happy

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.563
as when we can write
a 250 to 500 page book

00:46:50.563 --> 00:46:54.200
to tell you a long, long story

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.790
about what happened back then,

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:59.360
and that is not the way
most people now read.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.350
Long, long reading,
particularly, long complicated,

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:04.620
technical demanding reading

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:08.770
is less and less common
as an active pleasure.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:13.500
So I would say that the biggest
deficit as I experience it

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.100
that my undergraduates now
bring into the classroom

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.600
is they most of them, many of them,

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.103
no longer read long books for pleasure.

00:47:22.322 --> 00:47:24.760
It's not part of their lived reality

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.080
that you would pick up.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.260
We always name Harry Potter,
but I think Harry Potter

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.880
is the exception to prove the rule,

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.420
and Rowling is a genius
at the narrative momentum

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.880
that she can use to suck people up,

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.830
and carry them for 800 pages.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:39.580
That's not the way most books work.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:46.040
Persuading kids that reading long

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.550
is still a valuable
thing to do is hard work,

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:51.999
and here now I'll finally
answer your question this way.

00:47:51.999 --> 00:47:52.860
One of the things I believe,

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.020
and I don't think this comes
naturally to my discipline,

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.480
but it does come naturally to storytelling

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.850
is that there's a way in which any story

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:03.320
can be told at any length.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.740
I can tell you Anna Karenina in 800 pages.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:11.700
I can summarize it for you in 100 pages.

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.430
I can summarize it in a paragraph.

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:14.953
I can, in fact, tweet it,

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:18.770
and I can capture a
reality about that book.

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:19.930
Now if I tweet it

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:24.192
you're losing an awful lot
of Tolstoy when I do that,

00:48:24.192 --> 00:48:29.192
but remembering that all
narrative is scalable.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.540
It loses richness and
subtlety and complexity

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.401
as you scale it down,

00:48:34.401 --> 00:48:37.415
but I do think that that's
the lesson of the digital age.

00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:41.328
We need to learn how
to tell our narratives

00:48:41.328 --> 00:48:44.180
construct our arguments,

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:48.210
put things in the public
realm on multi scales,

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:50.540
and my anxiety one of my missions

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.640
in the time I have left to me

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.210
is to try to keep defending the long-form.

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:58.300
The full length Anna Karenina say

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:02.129
is just a fictional
metaphor for long narrative.

00:49:02.129 --> 00:49:03.480
At the same time

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.330
that I'm trying to help
me and my colleagues

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:08.510
get our work out into the blogosphere,

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:09.840
get it out into Facebook,

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.830
get it out into much smaller
units of argumentation,

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:16.150
or for that matter in multimedia
on television and video

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:17.740
the space that we're in right now.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:22.249
YouTube has opened up
this kind of conversation

00:49:22.249 --> 00:49:24.590
what was never possible before.

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:27.540
When you began these interviews
they were nowhere near

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.430
as accessible to the
world as they are now,

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:30.960
and that's a wondrous thing.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.360
It's an amazing thing that you
and I can talk for an hour,

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.998
and there will be people
all around the world

00:49:35.998 --> 00:49:37.440
that can access it

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.280
that's something that never
before could have been done,

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.890
and we need to lean into that

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:44.090
the way you've been leaning into it.

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:44.923
- Thank you.

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:48.810
Let's talk a little about
environmental history

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:53.810
because you are a leading
figure in environmental history

00:49:55.999 --> 00:49:59.230
what does history

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:02.360
bring to our understanding
of the environment?

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:05.242
At one point I think I
read where you said that

00:50:05.242 --> 00:50:08.270
one's goal as an environmental historian

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:12.720
is to bring nature into history basically.

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.560
Talk a little about that.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.050
- Environmental history is
the history of human beings

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:21.533
interactions with the
natural world over time.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.090
It's the history of
environmental politics.

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:29.573
It's the history of our
changing ideas of nature,

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:32.930
and one of the interesting things about

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:36.540
our ideas of nature taking
the United States as the frame

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.690
as I typically do I'm a U.S. historian.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:41.893
I work largely in the
geography of the United States.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.700
Nature in the United States has often been

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:50.660
a kind of romantic early
19th century nature which is

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:55.000
static and stable, beautiful,

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.870
equilibrated whole,

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:00.880
and there is a story that Americans

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.080
have often told themselves,

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.400
and that I would say environmentalists
still tell themselves

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.410
in which the human past is a story

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:13.074
of our taking that stable
nature and transforming it,

00:51:13.074 --> 00:51:16.390
and a story that was very
important to American history

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:18.210
was the story of progress

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:21.030
in which we take a savage wilderness,

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:24.380
raw nature and convert
it into civilization,

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:25.580
converted in progress.

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.780
That's Frederick Jackson Turner's story

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:32.020
of the American frontier which
has all sorts of erasures.

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.340
Native people have a very awkward place

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.500
in that particular narrative.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.280
There's an environmental
story which as often as not

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.020
says that nature was good and whole

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.470
before we got our hands on it
and boy have we trashed it,

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:48.260
and the story is a story
of a fall from that nature.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.500
Both of those are human ideas.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.968
Both of those stories say as much about us

00:51:53.968 --> 00:51:56.590
as they do about nature,

00:51:56.590 --> 00:51:59.540
so what environmental history seeks to do

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:02.330
is to call our attention to

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:08.910
a world out there of nonhuman
beings and processes,

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:13.523
landscapes, environments that
we could not exist without.

00:52:14.685 --> 00:52:19.685
Our life utterly, utterly depend
on all those relationships,

00:52:19.881 --> 00:52:23.850
and yet much of the time we pay
no attention to them at all,

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:26.410
or we put ourselves at
the center of the story,

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:30.710
and ignore all those beings
with whom we share this planet.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:33.421
I think the great achievement
of environmental history

00:52:33.421 --> 00:52:37.290
has been to say you can't write history

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:42.290
without at least paying
attention to pick something,

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.693
dandelions, smallpox,

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:48.630
the wheat plant and think about the story

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:50.253
of our relationship to those things

00:52:50.253 --> 00:52:53.633
because it's a really interesting,
really complicated story.

00:52:54.601 --> 00:52:58.900
- Does environmental history
have important lessons

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.923
for the environmental movement?

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.896
- I believe so.

00:53:03.896 --> 00:53:06.970
I've been working for a
while now on a book called

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:10.853
Saving Nature In Time
and the title is a pun.

00:53:11.781 --> 00:53:14.000
It basically makes the argument that

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:17.807
those mythic stories that we
do like to tell ourselves,

00:53:17.807 --> 00:53:19.040
and that have great power,

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.150
and that I like to tell myself too about

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:28.610
wondrously whole nature that
if only we could get back to it

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:30.790
the world would be good again.

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:32.380
Well, that's not actually the way

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:34.431
even nature without us looked like.

00:53:34.431 --> 00:53:37.360
That nature without us has a history too.

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.750
Geology tells that story,

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:41.080
evolutionary biology tells that story,

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.500
asteroids have hit this planet,

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:43.600
and species have gone extinct.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.142
There's some big dramatic stories

00:53:45.142 --> 00:53:48.525
that are part of that nonhuman past.

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:52.890
I would say one of the lessons
for environmental politics

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:55.960
is that when you start
telling yourself a story

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.090
that begins in a place of stasis,

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:04.090
and moves to a place of dynamism
that looks bad or crisis

00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:07.210
you should step back and ask yourself

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:09.936
whether that story is too easy.

00:54:09.936 --> 00:54:13.390
One of the criticisms and I'm
a lifelong environmentalist

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:16.369
I do this work because I believe in

00:54:16.369 --> 00:54:20.330
building a sustainable human relationship

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:21.730
to this world that we share

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:23.963
with all those beings
that I named earlier.

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:30.190
One of the things I
believe very, very strongly

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:35.190
is that it's very easy to
tell very dramatic stories

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:38.130
about how human beings
have affected the planet

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:43.130
that lead to despair and lead
us to say we're just awful.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:45.680
The world would be a much better place

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.570
if humanity would go extinct tomorrow.

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:50.390
Although I get that emotion,

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:51.620
I have felt that emotion.

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.410
Many, many people that care about nature

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:54.690
have felt that emotion

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:56.990
it's actually not a very useful emotion.

00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:59.222
I sure would not want to
build a political movement,

00:54:59.222 --> 00:55:04.222
or a cultural movement a
moral movement on despair,

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.700
so I'm actually a great
believer in complicated stories

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:12.018
that have fearful things in them,

00:55:12.018 --> 00:55:17.018
but that also have some kind
of vision of hope in them.

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:21.200
That's not a historical
project that's a moral project.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.860
It's a political project.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.870
If you ask what does environmental
history have to offer

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:28.700
environmentalism or to Americans

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.443
who may not call themselves
environmentalists,

00:55:31.443 --> 00:55:34.170
but they want to give a
sustainable relationship

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:37.039
to the world, to their
children and grandchildren

00:55:37.039 --> 00:55:39.586
then I think we need to
tell complicated stories

00:55:39.586 --> 00:55:43.120
that don't just lead to despair.

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.530
The Pollyanna sentimental
stories that say,

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:47.560
oh, do whatever you want it's all great

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.320
those are dangerous stories too.

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.720
We need something in between.

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:55.720
- So the interaction
between nature and humanity

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:59.510
that story involves interactions

00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:00.890
that aren't gonna go away,

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:05.560
but by understanding this complex story

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:09.536
then you inform choices
about the environment.

00:56:09.536 --> 00:56:11.520
- Right, one of the
lessons history teaches

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.230
very deeply, very deeply it's like one of

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:18.030
the core faiths of my discipline

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:21.560
is that we look at the
world as it is today,

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:24.300
and before we ask a
historical question about it

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:27.900
it looks given, it looks natural,

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.180
this is just the way the world is.

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:31.370
As soon as you ask the question,

00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:33.610
well, how did the world
get to be this way,

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:36.930
suddenly it's no longer a given thing.

00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:40.010
It's something that became this thing,

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:42.290
and as you go back as you start looking

00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:44.460
what you start to realize
going to your question

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:47.453
is people made choices.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.823
The world as we now experience it

00:56:50.823 --> 00:56:53.820
is a product of human choice,

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.090
and actually choices
by other organisms too

00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:57.240
in a funny kind of way.

00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:00.880
The more you learn that
the more you recognize,

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.303
well, you know, we're making choices too.

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:08.730
What choices should we be
making as we imagine the future

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:10.690
because we're writing history now too.

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:13.720
People are gonna be writing
about us 100 years from now.

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:16.127
What stories do we imagine
them telling about us,

00:57:16.127 --> 00:57:20.430
and what stories would we
like them to tell about us?

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:23.950
That leads to really
interesting politics I think.

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:28.880
- One final question as
somebody who is committed

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.790
to understanding the past,

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:34.713
and conveying that knowledge, information,

00:57:34.713 --> 00:57:38.395
and values to the present,

00:57:38.395 --> 00:57:42.530
but at the same time you're very sensitive

00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:45.270
to how the world is changing,
how nature is changing,

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:49.773
so how would you advise students
to prepare for the future?

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.850
- Get liberally educated.

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:56.770
I go back to it's an
old-fashioned piece of advice,

00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:59.690
but one of the things I
deeply, deeply believe

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:02.260
is the more you know about the world,

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.840
and I'm speaking passionately

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.230
about the historian's frame here,

00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:08.920
but I'm nearly as passionate
about the geologist's frame,

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.770
the chemist's frame, the
literary critic's frame.

00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:14.550
Those are all really,
really not just valuable,

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:19.320
and necessary frames
they're really cool frames.

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.290
They're really interesting.

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:24.110
So one thing I would say to a student is

00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:27.900
don't work on boredom don't be bored.

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:31.400
If you're bored by something
figure out why you're bored,

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.280
and figure out how not to be bored.

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:39.240
If a liberal education well
lived does anything at all

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.570
it teaches us how not to

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:45.020
move through the world as a boring place.

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:47.280
I think when people aren't bored,

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:50.710
and are generous in their curiosity,

00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:53.740
in their willingness to learn
about another human being,

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.528
or another way of being in the world

00:58:55.528 --> 00:58:58.340
I think that leads to good places,

00:58:58.340 --> 00:58:59.960
so don't be bored would
be one of the things

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.039
I'd offer as a lesson.

00:59:02.039 --> 00:59:04.000
- Well, on that note Professor Cronon

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.457
I want to thank you for taking the time

00:59:06.457 --> 00:59:09.630
for this absolutely
fascinating discussion.

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:11.160
- Thanks for having me it was a pleasure.

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.940
- Thank you very much for joining us

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:15.283
for this conversation with history.
