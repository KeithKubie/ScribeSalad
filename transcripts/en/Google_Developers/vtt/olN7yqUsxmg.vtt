DON DODGE: Hey, I'm here with
Robert Scoble, the world

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.600
famous Robert Scoble.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.990
Robert, you see hundreds
and hundreds of

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.270
startups every year.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.710
What have you seen recently
that excites you?

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.160
ROBERT SCOBLE: Well, I'm seeing
a range of things that

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.080
I call context, contextual
software.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.150
And that includes wearable
sensors, it includes weird,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.100
new databases, like cloud-based,
that let you do

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.210
writing and pulling out
of the data in 40

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.940
nanoseconds or less.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.580
It includes social software
like Facebook.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.180
Facebook is building an engine
where it brings you media

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.670
based on who you are, and the
more you tell who you are, the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.350
better the media, and the
better the advertising.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.660
It includes these
Google glasses.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.430
Which really are about 18
months from now, maybe,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.970
somewhere in that range.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.020
A year to two years
away, right?

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.600
But these are going to
have lots of sensors.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.350
They're going to have a camera,
so I'm going to look

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.960
at you, and maybe it'll do face
detection on you, and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.070
say, Don Dodge, and your
Google+ account or your

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.280
Facebook account.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.460
And they have a gyroscope,
right?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.480
So it can tell when I'm spinning
around or whatever.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.675
If I'm going skiing, it
has an accelerometer.

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:20.240
It has a compass, so it knows
I'm looking at you, south, or

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.570
east, or west, or whatever.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.990
And it has maybe some
other things.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.301
And it certainly has a
microphone and an earphone.

00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:32.130
It has GPS, so it knows I'm
standing here and you're

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.730
standing there.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.080
If we were both wearing glasses,
it would know where

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.160
we are in space.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.320
So, where does that all go?

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.250
And then, SRI is showing me
some stuff that's going to

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.470
turn into a new kind
of calendar.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.820
It's going to look into your
Gmail and your Google Calendar

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.250
and look for context.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.820
And what do I mean by that?

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.860
If we're setting up the meeting
for a week from now,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.360
and we're going to email back
and forth, and we're going

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.380
say, hey, I want to meet with
you and talk about startups.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.250
Talk about startups?

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.480
That's context.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.800
And so, can it pull that
out and show it to me.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.750
Oh yeah, Don wanted to
talk about startups.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.479
I need to get ready
for this meeting.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.680
And maybe it'll prompt me as,
hey, I need to get tuned up.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.100
I need to know what I'm talking
about so I know what

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.900
this meeting's about.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.700
Google Now is already showing
me that there's a place for

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.170
this new contextual world,
or smart notifications.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.600
Because it knows I'm going to
meet you in an hour, and it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.760
takes 49 minutes to drive there,
and maybe the traffic's

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.960
a little bit rough.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.390
It's going to look up at the
traffic and the weather, and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.750
it's going to tell me stuff
that I need to know.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.540
Hey, you better leave because
it's raining.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.900
You better grab a jacket
because it's raining.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.220
And you better and leave
now, because there's an

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.140
accident on the way.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.250
And so, it'll know the context
of what we're trying to do,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.460
and where I'm going
to do it with you.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.470
And it told me lots of stuff.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.960
So, there's so much coming.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.050
There's camera apps coming that
join our pictures just

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.440
because we were in the
same space and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.870
we're friends on Facebook.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.130
There's new TV apps coming that
are for the iPad and show

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.790
me TV based on our
liking behavior,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.580
both mine and my friends.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.370
Because my friends, if all my
friends like Mad Men, I'd

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.000
better watch Mad Men, because
that's important.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.310
So, all sorts of new stuff.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.110
It's really cool.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.460
So I'm really alive.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.880
I'm really, like, oh man,
there's something-- there's an

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.880
age coming, and that's why I'm
writing this book called The

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.870
Age Of Context.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.980
DON DODGE: Excellent.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.680
So you see startups all over.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.740
Not just Silicon Valley,
but all over the place.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.065
Where are you seeing the
best innovations?

00:03:38.065 --> 00:03:40.850
ROBERT SCOBLE: Well, you know,
Silicon Valley is still--

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.370
San Francisco, Silicon Valley,
San Jose, it's still special.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.150
There's no place like it.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.590
But geeks are centering around
innovation zones.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.400
You know, New York, Seattle.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.590
I'm going to Seattle
next week.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.920
Tel Aviv.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.796
Shenzhen, Shanghai,
and Beijing.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.240
After that, Berlin, London.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.130
After you name those six or
seven places, it gets tough to

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.560
tell you where innovation's
coming from.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.810
Maybe somewhere in Brazil.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.860
Maybe India.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.140
But after that, it's really
tough in the world to say

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.620
there's good innovation
happening, there's startups

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.000
happening, there's
an ecosystem of

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.690
entrepreneurialism, there's
something happening.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.550
It really happens in these
seven or eight ecozones--

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.200
or, not ecozones.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.750
Entrepreneur zones.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.730
Tech zones.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.000
DON DODGE: So you try
lots of mobile apps.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.090
You've probably seen more
than most people.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.350
What are the top four or five
apps that you use all the time

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.095
or that you love?

00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:55.570
ROBERT SCOBLE: I actually
have about 80.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.510
Because I deleted--

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.100
I went through my iPhone and
I deleted all apps that I

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.960
haven't used in the
last month.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.420
But like, this app, iTranslate
voice through traveling.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.690
And you're in a Spanish speaking
country, you can say,

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.420
"Can you get me a

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:20.230
beer, please?" Oh.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.312
"Can you get me a beer, please?"
Can you get me a

00:05:26.312 --> 00:05:27.120
beer, please?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.500
DON DODGE: Wow.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.420
ROBERT SCOBLE: And it says
it in Spanish, right?

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.140
If I turn on my speaker, you
could actually hear that.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.830
What else?

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.690
I use Waze while I'm driving
so I can see accidents in

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.740
front of me.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.170
I use Instagram and Facebook
for photos, Facebook for

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.390
keeping up with the world,
Twitter for studying my 33,000

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.210
friends in the tech industry who
are all talking talk about

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.660
cats or whatever they
talk about.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.990
Flipboard for reading.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.630
Twitter because it filters it
and makes it beautiful, and

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.880
it's more understandable.

00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:04.360
Oh, God.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.100
On and on.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.120
I mean, I could go for an
hour talking about apps.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.820
Let's just punch through
some of them.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.680
When I'm traveling, United
Airlines app.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.810
Hipmunk for finding flights.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.120
TripIt for telling me
information while I'm sitting

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.570
in the plane.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.950
Hey, your plane just
got canceled.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.090
Or when I get to the rental
car agency, here's your

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.185
confirmation number.

00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:28.660
DON DODGE: So when you see a new
app that replaces or has

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.880
some functionality similar to
what you already have, how

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.750
does it get you over the edge
to say, all right, I'll try

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.230
it, or I'll replace it?

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.090
ROBERT SCOBLE: That depends.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.755
If it's in a new place like
this translate app--

00:06:40.755 --> 00:06:43.270
first of all, this translate app
has a million users or 2

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.560
million users already before
I even found it.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.510
Part of why I listen to early
adopters is they tell me, hey,

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.050
you should try this thing.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.940
Early adopters are out there
trying new things.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.890
I can't see it all.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.720
I don't have enough hours in the
day to try 600,000 apps,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.430
but I watch patterns
in my friends.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.960
What gets me over the hump?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.980
If it's in a new space, if
it's some app that does

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.760
something radically new, it has
a lower bar, if it's an

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.800
app in a crowded space.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.510
For instance, if you were
pitching me a photo sharing

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.780
app, it has to do something
mind blowing.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.450
Something I just didn't
expect that's

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.490
magic, that's different.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.820
Like, I saw one coming in a week
that automatically joins

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.280
us together as we shoot pictures
in the same space.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.960
That's different than
Instagram, right?

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.770
Oh, OK.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.350
I can use that with my wife,
or I can use that taking

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.940
pictures of you right
now, right?

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.040
And it'll do something mind
blowing, different, magic.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.030
DON DODGE: So every
startup wants to

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.360
talk to Robert Scobel.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.390
Every startup wants you to use
their product and [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.290
ROBERT SCOBLE: And
Eric [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.310
and you.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.780
DON DODGE: So how do
they get to you?

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.120
ROBERT SCOBLE: There's
500 people.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.860
It's not just me.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.430
It's 500 people who are like
tastemakers, who are early

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.460
adopters, or who are insiders.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.880
How do I get you to give me
$100,000 for my new startup?

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.310
It's the same thing, and it's
the same thought process.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.800
We're looking for something that
nobody else sees, that is

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.940
earlier, that's different.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.025
DON DODGE: So how does
an unknown startup

00:08:21.025 --> 00:08:22.410
get to Robert Scobel?

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.740
ROBERT SCOBLE: Call me.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.910
425-205-1921.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.430
My phone number's on my blog.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.300
It's not hard.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.690
But you call me and
you go, hey,

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.760
Scobel, I have this startup.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.022
Well, then what?

00:08:34.022 --> 00:08:36.789
You know?

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.470
You have to have a story.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.080
DON DODGE: Right.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.230
So the pitch has to be a
two-minute pitch on what it

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.689
is, how it works, why
it's important.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.790
ROBERT SCOBLE: And why
you're different.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.340
Hey, I have a photo
sharing app.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.280
I know you've seen Instagram
and Flickr and duh duh duh,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.100
the Facebook app, but I have
an app that does something

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.270
that nobody else does.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.280
That's the key.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.020
You have to know what
differentiates

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.610
you from the crowd.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.170
Or, I have a 15-year-old female
founder, and she's

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.880
really cute.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.970
Some people pitch me that, and
sometimes that gets into the

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.540
press, right?

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.720
You have to know your story.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:19.820
The other day, an entrepreneur
picked me up in a [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.540
He said, you want to drive
a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.270
Yeah, I do, actually.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.880
Another startup said, hey,
we got Cuban cigars.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.120
You want to get together and
have some Cuban cigars?

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.470
Sure!

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.416
DON DODGE: So good
brides help.

00:09:32.416 --> 00:09:35.950
ROBERT SCOBLE: Having a story
that gets attention, that gets

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:40.270
me to not think of you as just
another schmo, helps.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.470
I'd rather see you have an
extraordinary product.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.700
But some of these startups
are seeing me early,

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.180
and they want feedback.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.640
They want to know how
they fit into the--

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.810
are they on the right track,
or do they have

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.920
an idea that matters?

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.760
And that's cool, too.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.060
I mean, I actually like seeing
companies early, not because

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.360
of me, but that tells me--

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.630
like Instagram showed me three
months before they shared.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.450
Flipboard was like three
months before.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.450
Saluto was three months.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.140
Siri was six months, because
it slipped in the time that

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.325
they came to my house
and showed it.

00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:19.955
But companies that do
that are better.

00:10:19.955 --> 00:10:20.580
And why?

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.850
Because they're showing
it around to people--

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.105
not just me--

00:10:25.105 --> 00:10:28.660
they're showing it around to
people, taking that feedback,

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.270
and making the product better.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.630
And I also have more time
to think about it.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:39.160
It's like, oh, Siri just showed
me this cool thing, and

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.400
I had a story when the
embargo ended, right?

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.890
And I had it written
out in my head.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.370
I could write it in 10 minutes,
because it was like

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.970
I've been thinking about
for six months.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.110
It was playing in my head for
six months, and I was talking

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.620
to other people about how
we fit into the world.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.050
And so, I had a really
a good story.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.200
If you call me an hour before
you launch, it's

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.930
like, what can I do?

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.600
All I can do is rewrite
your press release.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.940
I don't have any context
with you.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.870
I don't know your team.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.330
I don't know how this
fits into the world.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.160
I haven't had any of the
reciprocity that other

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.000
companies have put
into me so I feel

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.315
emotionally tied to the product.

00:11:19.315 --> 00:11:20.860
So all that fits.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.130
There is no one thing that will
get somebody like me, or

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:24.865
[? Errington, ?]

00:11:24.865 --> 00:11:27.700
or [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.950
to talk about you.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:35.330
It's a number of small, little
things, and I look at

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.040
companies as a process, not
as a on-time event.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.200
If you getting in the New York
Times is going to make your

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.330
company, you're really screwed,
because getting

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.040
Scobel to write about
you is not going

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.810
to make your company.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.110
As egotistical and as
narcissistic as I am, it's not

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.600
going to make your company.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.510
Because if you don't have a
great product, it doesn't

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.270
matter what I tell 101.9
million people.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.120
People are gonna try it
out and go, Scobel

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.880
you're full of it.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.436
DON DODGE: So how many new
products to you see each year?

00:12:05.436 --> 00:12:06.820
ROBERT SCOBLE: A better
question is

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.885
how many each week.

00:12:07.885 --> 00:12:08.770
DON DODGE: Each week.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.830
OK, let's start with
each week.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:15.250
ROBERT SCOBLE: Like, last
week was at least six.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:15.510
DON DODGE:.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.365
Six.

00:12:16.365 --> 00:12:18.450
ROBERT SCOBLE: So one
a day, at least.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:24.050
And I probably had twice
that many meetings.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.600
DON DODGE: Wow.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.110
And how many of those excite
you to the point

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.140
that you'll try it?

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.920
ROBERT SCOBLE: Last
week, four.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.570
DON DODGE: Four?

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:31.870
Out of six?

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.600
ROBERT SCOBLE: Which is
extraordinary, because I

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.930
haven't been this excited
about the

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.160
world in a long time.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.040
So, yeah.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.380
There's something happening
in the world.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:43.810
There's a new way, a new age
coming, this age of context.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:50.780
Sensors, maturing social
networks, right?

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.250
New kinds of databases
that let us write and

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.390
read in real time.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.670
There's like five or six trends
like this that I'm

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.400
seeing happen all at
the same time.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.310
And also, all these data silos
like Foursquare and

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:08.410
Foodspotting and Spotify and
Facebook are all hooking

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.410
together, are all coming
together, which means we're

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.050
going to see a new system come
down in the next two, three

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.650
years that's going to be
pretty mind blowing.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.970
DON DODGE: Well, it sounds like
the party is starting, so

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.022
thank you very much
for the time.

00:13:20.022 --> 00:13:21.006
ROBERT SCOBLE: Yeah, baby!

00:13:21.006 --> 00:13:22.256
DON DODGE: Thank you, Robert.
