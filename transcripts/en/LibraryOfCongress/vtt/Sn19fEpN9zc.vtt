00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.260
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:18.370
[ Pause ]

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.660
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Well,
my name is David Rubenstein,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.730
and I have the honor of
serving as the Co-Chair

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.480
of the 15th National Book
Festival with Jim Billington,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.870
The Librarian of Congress.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.350
And on behalf of the
National Book Festival Board,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.780
The Library of Congress, I
want to welcome everybody

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.510
to this extraordinary event, so
thank you very much for coming.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.610
[ Applause ]

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.660
We have everybody here
by definition is special.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.920
I could go through everybody's
name, but that will take too long,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.250
so please excuse me
for not mentioning you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.220
but I'll just do it generically.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.740
So we are very pleased
that we have a number

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.230
of members of Congress here.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.080
This is The Library of Congress,
after all, and the Congress

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.630
and The Library of Congress
have a special relationship.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.380
Many members of Congress
have shown enormous interest

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.680
in The Library of Congress.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920
I want to thank those members
who are here for doing that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.350
and for coming this evening.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.520
I also want to thank the supporters
of the Festival for many people

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.680
who have done a lot to make this
possible financially and otherwise,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.630
I'll mention some in a
minute, but thank you.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.200 position:56%
I want to thank the Madison
Council, which is an arm, in effect,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.630
the affiliate of The Library of
Congress, which helps with support

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.230
for The Library of
Congress, I want to thank them

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.550
for their support of this event.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.550
I want to thank book lovers,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.310
and that includes everybody
here, people who love books.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.550
I also want to thank a special
person who is here this evening,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.270
the First Lady of Ruanda,
Jeannette Kagame, where is she?

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.070
Jeannette, thank you.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.460
[ Applause ]

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.230
Jeannette is somebody who cares
deeply about reading and education

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.530
for children and is working

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.980
on putting together the first
Book Festival in Ruanda,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.480
so thank you very much
for coming this evening.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.190
All of us know that we could be
doing something else this evening

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.470
and all of us know that
it's a special weekend.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.970
And it's been my view for a
long time that people who go

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.440
to Book Festivals are
likely to live longer.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.300
[laughter] And to have
a healthier life.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.280
Now that's my observation, I
can't prove it, but it is my -

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.610
I do have it on good authority
that those who go to Book Festivals

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.960
on holiday weekends have a special
place in heaven reserved for them.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.510
[laughter] Now, again,
I can't prove that.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.050
[ Applause ]

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.490
So as you talk today or tomorrow
to your friends who are off

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.770 position:56%
to the Hamptons or Martha's Vineyard

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.130
or Nantucket you should let them
know that there's a special place

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.440
in heaven reserved for you and
they're not going to have it.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.740
[laughter] It's hard to believe

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.280
that this Book Festival
is only 15 years old.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.610
It seems like a tradition that's
gone on for 50 years or longer,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.560
but it's only 15 years, honestly.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.840
It was in 2001 that the
first Book Festival was held.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.880
There were 40 authors and there
were about 30,000 people attended.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.730
It was quite an event,
never had been done before.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.890
This year we have 170 authors and
we expect well over 100,000 people

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.380
on a Labor Day weekend,
which is extraordinary.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.300
So this is due to the work of a
lot of people and I'll mention some

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.620
of those in a moment,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.380
but the festival tomorrow
we will have 12 hours

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.840
of round-the-clock programming.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.660
Doors open at nine, from 10 o'clock
to 10 o'clock we're programmed,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.870
there are hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of events.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.340
And anybody that cares
about reading and books

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.570
and literacy will have
a great time there.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.130
Now The Library of Congress,
itself, for those who may not be

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.500
that familiar with it, has
grown a fair bit as well

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.150
since it's very modest beginning.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.280
The Library of Congress was an idea
that James Madison had around 1783,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.440
but Congress didn't really get
around to doing anything about it

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.980
until 1800 when legislation
was passed

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.700
to move the Capitol
officially to Washington,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.950
D.C. as part of that
legislation there was a provision

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.490
in the legislation to have a
Library of Congress and all

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.760
of $5,000 was appropriated for it.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.320
But the appropriation
actually occurred,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.790
it wasn't a continuing resolution.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:33.280
[laughter] And that $5,000 was used
to buy 740 books and three maps,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.020
and that was for awhile
the collection

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.710
of The Library of Congress.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.760
As we all know, in 1812 some
people from another part

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.220
of the Atlantic came to
Washington and did some things

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.380
that they probably now regret.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.630
One of those things was
burning The Library of Congress.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.160
At that time The Library of
Congress really had no books left

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.910 position:56%
and then Thomas Jefferson, who was a
great fan of The Library of Congress

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.630
and a great bibliophile offered to
sell his collection to The Library

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.700
of Congress and ultimately
the negotiations went forward

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.990
and happened, though interestingly
there were some people in Congress

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.580
who debated it because they thought

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.770
that Thomas Jefferson
really didn't believe in God

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.990
and if we bought his collection
there would be anti-God books

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.530
in the collection.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.430
So they went through every
single title before they agreed

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.770
to buy the collection.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.850
They bought it for about $23,950
and he sold about 6,487 volumes,

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.980
and that was The Library of
Congress collection for awhile.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.180
Then in 1851 another tragic
event happened, there was a fire

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.070
in The Library of Congress, 55,000
volumes were then in The Library

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.660
of Congress and about
two-thirds of them were destroyed

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.660
and about two-thirds of
Thomas Jefferson's collection

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.960
was destroyed.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.890
Now we're celebrating this year the
200th Anniversary of the purchase

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.480 position:56%
of Thomas Jefferson's collection and
while all of those books aren't here

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.570
because of that fire in
1851, through the leadership

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.460
of Jim Billington and others
we have restored virtually all

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.020
of those books, not the
originals from Thomas Jefferson,

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.920
but the same volumes and they
are here and you can see them

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.220
at any time and you'll be able

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.000
to see them this evening
if you're interested.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.100
So this is the 200th Anniversary
of that historic collection

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.650
and purchase from Thomas Jefferson.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.680
I want to thank Jim Billington
later and I want to mention him

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.550
in a few other remarks
I want to make,

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.280 position:56%
but Jim Billington is really the
father of the National Book Festival

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.810
and I will mention him
in passing in a moment.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.620
But I just want to
acknowledge that, Jim,

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.060
I know that this will probably be
your last time as the Librarian

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.550
of Congress presiding over
a National Book Festival

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.850
and there are other people
who are going to talk

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.290
about you this evening, and
I just want to say personally

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.170
that I have enjoyed working
with you extraordinarily.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.930
It's been one of the
great privileges

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.360
of my life to get to know you.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.090
You've done a great
job for the country.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.510
I can't imagine we would ever have
a better Librarian of Congress.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:05.150
[ Applause ]

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.610
But shortly somebody with far
greater eloquence than I will talk

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.060
about Jim Billington in the ways

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.930
that I think are worth
listening to, shortly.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.870
So I want to thank the sponsors who
made this possible this evening.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.540 position:56%
Let me mention them -- Wells Fargo,
which has been very, very supportive

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.980
of The Library of Congress
National Book Festival, AARP,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.160
The Institute of Museum and Library
Services, The Washington Post,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.420
The Madison Council and NEA.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.140
And as a result of their
gifts in kind and cash

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.180 position:56%
and other things we are able to have
the National Book Festival for free.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.930
And I'm committed to
making certain that as long

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.660
as I'm involved it
will always be for free

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.720
and I think it's a great thing for
the American people that we make it

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.890
for free, and so everybody who
wants to come tomorrow doesn't have

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.150
to worry about cost and
it's an extraordinary event,

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.890
unlike anything really that I've
seen anywhere else in the world

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.460
in terms of a Book Festival.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.510
So I would like to
just say that Jim ...

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:10.330
[ Applause ]

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.710
... how did we actually
come to this Book Festival,

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.770
how did it actually come about.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.110
Well, many different ways
that you can look at it,

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.380
but victory has a thousand
fathers and defeat is an orphan,

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.550
it is often said, and
this is a victory.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.390
But really there are only two
people that deserve the credit

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.690
for getting this off the ground.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.930
At the time of the Inaugural
festivities of George W. Bush,

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.360
Laura Bush mentioned to the
Librarian in the Congress,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.560
Jim Billington, that there
had been a Texas Book Festival

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.320
that she had helped to
start and she wanted

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.580
to know was there a
National Book Festival?

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.860
And Jim Billington said, well,
there isn't yet, but there will be.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.900
And Jim Billington then
began to work very closely

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:01.340 position:56%
with Laura Bush and, well, why don't
we let her tell you more about it.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.620
&gt;&gt; Laura Bush: Good
evening and welcome

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.140
to the 15th National
Book Festival's Gala,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.570
on the eve of our very first
National Book Festival.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:18.190
On Friday, September 7th,
2001wegathered right here

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.650
in the Coolidge Auditorium
of The Library of Congress

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.070
to begin what we hoped
would become a new tradition

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.750
in our nation's Capitol.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.560
President Bush, many members of
his Cabinet, and a marvelous group

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.800
of authors and book
lovers, just like you,

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.020
were here to help launch
what has since become one

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.850
of the most successful Book
Festivals in the world.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.090 position:56%
I am proud to have worked
alongside the Librarian of Congress,

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:48.530
Dr. James Billington, and
his excellent staff to bring

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.170
to Washington a National
Book Festival.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:56.040
As a lifelong lover of books
and a librarian I believe

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.700
that children everywhere
should learn to read and I know

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.660
that literacy is an essential
foundation for democracy.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.430
And like Thomas Jefferson,

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:11.010
who 200 years ago sent his lifetime
collection of books to be housed

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:17.530
in the building where you now sit,
I too cannot live without books.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.720
So it's a special joy to
welcome you here tonight

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.640
to celebrate the 15th Anniversary
of the National Book Festival.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.650
Thank you, Dr. Billington, for your
service as our nation's Librarian.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.150
Thank you to The Library
of Congress, the largest,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.470
most vibrant Library in the world.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.470
Thank you to all the friends
of The Library of Congress.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.140
Happy 200th Birthday to
our national treasure,

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.360
the Thomas Jefferson Collection.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.880
And Happy Birthday to yet
another American treasure,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.510
the National Book Festival.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:11:00.040
[ Applause ]

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.630
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All
right, you're going to now hear

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.120 position:56%
from some very distinguished authors

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.790
and then I think you'll
be quite pleased to hear

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.000
from their extraordinary comments.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:22.510
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kwame Alexander.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:35.510
[ Applause ]

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:40.050
[ Pause ]

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.380
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Good evening.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.590
I am just honored and
very grateful to be here.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.340
Thank you to Maria Rena [Assumed
Spelling], to Dr. Billington,

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.850
to the National Book Festival
staff for this wonderful event,

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.220
for 15 years of this
literary tradition.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.100
I grew up as a writer
here in this area.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:07.050
I became a poet in earnest across
the bridge in Arlington, Virginia.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:14.820
There was a woman, of course,
it always starts with a woman,

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.790
that I had a crush on and I needed
to be able to convey that to her.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:24.610
And the only way I knew
- I wasn't very cool,

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.800
I didn't get cool until recently.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.200 position:56%
[laughter] And so the only way I was
able to convey that I was interested

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.580
in her was through a poem,
but not just any poem.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.000 position:56%
I wrote her a poem a day for a year.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:54.670
[laughter] I am not a painter,
browns and blues we get along

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.940
but we are not close, I am no Van
Gogh, but give me plain paper,

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:05.440
a dull pencil, some Scotch
and I will hijack your curves.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.620
[ Applause ]

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.870
Take your soul hostage,
paint a portrait so colorful

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.680
and delicate you just may
have to cut off my ear.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:27.330
[laughter] And she married me.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:35.080
[ Applause ]

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.380
I'm a poet.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.990
My life's work is taking
the human soul entire,

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:45.090 position:56%
and like Langston Hughes said,
squeezing it like a lime or a lemon,

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.500
drop by drop into atomic words.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.900
I am a poet, I write
to explore and explode.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:58.490
I write to dream a world that
does better, that knows better.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:05.350
My heart is here with you
tonight at seven p.m.,

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:11.740
but my head is still some time
else at seven a.m. You see,

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:16.940
24 hours ago my family and
I arrived from Singapore.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.540
And to just further
illustrate what that means,

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.510
at two a.m. this morning I
hear music and dancing coming

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.140
from my seven year old's room

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:33.660
because she thinks it's two
o'clock p.m. We spent three weeks

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:38.900
in Singapore eating black pepper
crab, drinking lime juice,

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.580
and marveling at the greenest,
cleanest city we'd ever seen,

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.410
but it wasn't just fun,
well at least not for me.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.980
It was work, I was there to write,
or rather to share my writing

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.880
with 4,000 students at the
Singapore American School.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.240
Each day for three weeks
I did my normal thing.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.930
I talked about growing up in
a house with 10,000 books.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.800
I talked about wanting to be
cool in high school and figuring

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.220
out that the answer to
that was playing tennis.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.930
[laughter] I talked about writing
my first poem for my mother

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.520
on Mother's Day when I was 12,
the first line went something

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.410
like this - Dear Mommy,
I hate Mother's Day.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:27.500
[laughter] I talked about writing a
love poem for a girl I had a crush

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.090
on in college and then taking
an advanced poetry class

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.500
with Nicki Giovanni
[Assumed Spelling]

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.920
and getting a C minus on that poem.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:40.530
[laughter] I talked about the
20 plus rejections I received

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.870
from the Crossover
and then, of course,

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.230
I shared a poem from the Crossover.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:53.280
Josh Bell is my name, but filthy
McNasty is my claim to fame.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.970
Folks call me that
because my game is a claim,

00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.070
so downright dirty
it'll put you to shame.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.280
My hair is long, my
height is tall, see,

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.090
I'm the next Kevin
Durant, LeBron and Chris.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.100
You guys are a little slow tonight.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:13.670
[laughter] I'm the one jetlagged.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:14.970
My game is tight.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.270
My dad likes to gloat.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.070
I ball with Magic and the goat.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.770
But tricks are for kids, I reply,

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.400
don't need your games,
my games still fly.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.910
Mom says your dad is old
school, like an old Chevette.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.140
You're fresh and new,
like a red Corvette.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.430
Your game is so sweet
its crepe suzette.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:35.610
Each time you play
its all - much better.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:42.200
[laughter] During the q-and-a,
after one of the presentations,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.720
a boy raised his hand and asked why
do you write children's literature?

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.790
Because the older we get the
more unwelcoming we are to change

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.120 position:56%
or maybe we're just too busy for it.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.140
Sometimes when the world
is not so beautiful,

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.040
when the women have
lost their Sunday song,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.840
and when the men are
being blown away

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.400
like sand in a windstorm, I write.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.170
I write so that children can
imagine and reimagine a world

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.960
that is a little bit more
tolerant and more human.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.940
I write to my seven-year-old
daughter

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.420
so that she will have a mirror

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.240
that shows how beautiful
and brilliant she is.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.520
I write so our children
will have a window

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.110
to show them what is possible.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.490
I am a poet.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.610
I say yes to an authentic
and meaningful life,

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:29.420
so that I can have
something authentic

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.370
and meaningful to write about.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:35.090
That is why I write for children.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:39.380
And after I finish this answer
I sort of tear up a little bit.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:44.360
I'm not sure why, but the
students start staring at me sort

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.580 position:56%
of awkwardly and they're in
silence, and they don't know whether

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:54.390
to comfort me or just
sort of wait it out.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.230
That evening when I get back to the
hotel, a teacher sends me an e-mail

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:02.400 position:56%
with a note from one of the eighth
graders who was in the presentation.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:11.190 position:56%
It read, Kwame's poetry presentation
made me reexamine myself, my doubts

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.490
and what limits I place on myself.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:18.170
A common thing I like to do is
run away from problems, tests,

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.990
procrastinate, parents angry at
you, just lock the door and turn

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.780
up the speakers, bad
grades, screw school,

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.680
but when Kwame said
something along the lines

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.240
of don't let the no's define
you it sort of slapped me

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.340
in the face in a good way.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.150
And then the eighth grader
ended with this line,

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:45.140
these four words, I have to change.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.880
That is why I write for children.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.820
I'm a poet and poets are
dreamers, and I simply want

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.510
to dream a world that
is worthy of them.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.510
Thank you.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:12.090
[ Applause ]

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:19.510
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Ladies
and gentlemen, Andrea Wulf.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:27.090
[ Applause ]

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:31.850
&gt;&gt; Andrea Wulf: That is so
unfair to come after you.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.550
[laughter] Well, it is
a great honor to speak

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.450
about Alexander von Humboldt
here in the Jefferson Building

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.610 position:56%
of The Library of Congress because
there are some wonderful connections

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.940
between Humboldt, Jefferson
and this Library in Washington,

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:51.580
D.C. But let me start with a quote
about Alexander von Humboldt.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.630
This is what Ralph Waldo
Emerson said about him in 1869.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:01.920
Humboldt was one of those wonders
of the world, like Aristotle,

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.040
like Julius Cesar, who appear
from time to time as if

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.650
to show us the possibilities
of the human mind.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.690
Yet over the past few years
whenever I told someone

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.080
that I'm writing a book
about Alexander von Humboldt,

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.180
the most common reaction
I got was a blank face.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.850
Very few people in the
English-speaking world have heard

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:27.200
about him, yet his
name is everywhere.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.120
The Humboldt current,
that's the ocean current

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.780
which hugs the West Coast of South
America, the Humboldt penguin,

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.470
there are mountain ranges across
the world which carry his name.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.800
In North America alone
there are four counties

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.190
and 13 towns called Humboldt.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.190
There are mountains here.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.490
There are lakes.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.790
There's a river.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.630
Even the State of Nevada
was almost called Humboldt

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.850
when a name was discussed
in the 1860s.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.370
So who was this man?

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:04.420 position:56%
Humboldt was born in 1769 in Prussia

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.410
and he became the most
celebrated scientist of his age.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.210
His contemporaries thought
that he was the most famous man

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.580
after Napoleon and they called
him the Shakespeare of Sciences.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.900
He was also brazenly adventurous.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.710
He went on a five-year
exploration of Latin America,

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:28.920
and it was a voyage that
shaped his life, his thinking,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.460
and that made him legendary
across the world.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:37.020
He ventured deep into the
mysterious rainforest of Venezuela.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.540
He cross the Andes
from Bogota to Lima,

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.600
climbing the highest
volcanoes in the world.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.080
And it was during this voyage that
he came up with a concept of nature

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.700
that still very much
shapes our thinking today,

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.910
the idea that nature
is a web of life.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.910
He described earth
as a living organism

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.030
where everything is connected.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:08.960
He is also the forgotten
father of environmentalism.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.860
He warned of the devastating
environmental affects

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.810
of monoculture irrigation
and deforestation.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.950
Amazingly, he predicted

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:25.530
in 1800 harmful human
induced climate change.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:29.740
He brought together art,
the arts and the sciences.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.370
He said we had to feel
nature to understand nature.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.340
I could basically go on forever

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:41.060
because he was an extraordinary
polymerase [Assumed Spelling],

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.880
he was a genius polymerase
who crossed,

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.380
who roamed across the disciplines.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:53.840
And he influenced scientists,
writers, poets and artists.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.550
Thomas Jefferson called him one of
the greatest ornaments of the age.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.990
Napoleon was jealous of him.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.960
Charles Darwin said he would
have never boarded the Beagle

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.590 position:56%
without Humboldt and, therefore, not
conceived of the original species.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.380
Henry David Thoreau's Walden would
have been a very different book

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.190
without Humboldt.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.570 position:56%
John Muir's [Assumed Spelling] ideas

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:20.250
on forest preservation were
heavily influenced by Humboldt.

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:25.150
And even Captain Nemo in Jules
Verne's famous 20,000 Leagues

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:29.500
Under the Sea owned all
of Humboldt's books.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.690
But let me tell you a little
bit about Humboldt, Jefferson

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.830
and Washington, D.C. So
after his exploration

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:39.180
in Latin America Humboldt
returned to Europe,

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:44.200
but he did a little detour and he
stopped at Philadelphia and then

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.020
in Washington because he
wanted to meet the President

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.140
of the United States, Thomas
Jefferson, whom he greatly admired.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:56.590
He arrived in D.C. in early June
1804, and he was a very busy man.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.550
Everybody wanted to meet
the heroic explorer.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:02.110
James Madison hosted
a party for him.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:05.070
Jefferson hosted a party
at the White House for him.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.850
And he, of course, went to
The Library of Congress.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.330
He went here on the
4th of June, 1804.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.980
He also went to Mount Vernon,
spent the afternoon there,

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.340
and then had dinner in Alexandria.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.410
And there's a wonderful
description of that evening

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.570
by the artist, Charles
Willson Peale.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.240 position:56%
Basically what happened was they had
dinner in Alexandria, it was late,

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.630
they had come here,
there were two carriages.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.720
The two drivers of the
carriages were absolute drunk

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.140
by the time the dinner was done
and decided to race back to D.C.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.790
So every time one of the
carriage drivers tried

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.580
to overtake the other one, the
other one would kind of block them,

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.120
and there were quite
a few hairy moments

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.380
when the carriages
almost overturned.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:56.650
And I'm pretty sure that Humboldt
absolutely loved this mad race,

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:59.780
but I have to say I'm rather
glad that he didn't die on a road

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.240
from Alexandria to Washington, D.C.
I would not be standing here today.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.930
So this was the social
side of this visit,

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.620 position:56%
but there was also a political side.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:14.320
And the timing of Humboldt's visit
to D.C. could have not been better

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.930
because Jefferson had just
acquired the Louisiana Territory

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.510
in the previous year.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.660
And Jefferson bombarded
Humboldt with questions

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.260
about the new neighbor, Mexico,

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.990
because Humboldt had
just been there.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:33.780
And Humboldt delivered plentiful,
including 18 tightly written pages

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.340
which summarized information
about agriculture,

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.990
mining and commerce in Mexico.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:42.730
And these are still today
in The Library of Congress.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:47.100
This was exactly the kind of
intelligence that Jefferson wanted.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:53.400 position:56%
And over the next few years Humboldt
and Jefferson corresponded and many

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.750
of their letters are
here at the Library.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:26:01.240 position:56%
And Humboldt also sent Jefferson his
books whenever he published them.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.920 position:56%
So when Jefferson sold his
collection of more than 6,000 books,

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.290
exactly 200 years ago,
to The Library

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:13.270
of Congress there were quite a few
Humboldt books in that collection.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:18.460 position:56%
So my book, The Invention of Nature,
is my attempt to find Humboldt

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.930
and to restore him
to his rightful place

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.880
in the pantheon of
nature and science.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.850
And the great thing about writing
a book about an explorer is

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.880
that you actually get to travel
to pretty amazing places yourself,

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.090
obviously all in the
course of research.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:38.330
[laughter] So, for me, this
has been an incredible journey

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.190
through landscapes and letters.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:43.390
I went to the Andes, for example,

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.470
and went up the Antesun [Assumed
Spelling] which is a volcano,

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.970
and at 13,000 feet I found the hut

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.990
in which Humboldt had
spent the night in 1802.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.440
I climbed the Chimber Rock [Assumed
Spelling], so another volcano

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.560
in Ecuador, which had
been incredibly elemental

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.630
for Humboldt's vision of nature.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.290
I paddled along the
Orinoco and listened

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.330
to the strange bellowing
cries of howler monkeys

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.920
in the rainforest in Venezuela.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.990
I walked around Walden Pond
in freshly fallen snow,

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:16.880
and I went to the Yosemite

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.090
where John Muir had
implemented Humboldt's ideas

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.330
of forest preservation.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:26.440
Appropriately when
researching an explorer,

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.390
I also experienced a
hurricane, though admittedly not

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.530
in Latin America, but in New
York when I got stuck there

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:39.060
for five days during Hurricane
Sandy in October 2012.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.630
So now I'm here, finally
launching my book after many years

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:47.700
of research, in the city where
Humboldt and Jefferson first met.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.280
And I hope I've made you a
little bit curious about this man

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.330
because he was really extraordinary

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.320
and I think he deserves
to be known much better.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.060
He was, after all, as
one contemporary said,

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.240
the greatest man since the deluge.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.510
Thank you.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:16.100
[ Applause ]

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.510
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Ladies
and gentlemen, Rick Atkinson.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:26.080
[ Applause ]

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.450
&gt;&gt; Rick Atkinson: Well, that's
so unfair to follow both of you.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.400
Well, good evening, welcome.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.430
I've lived in Washington for
almost 40 years and this is a town

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:41.160 position:56%
that despite its dysfunction and its
deep weirdness appreciates books,

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.930 position:56%
those who write them, those who edit

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.590
and publish them, those
who sell them.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:51.540
I write about war, both the
inhuman side and the human side,

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.760
which is one of the themes
of this year's Book Festival.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.310
If you're from out of town and
you're looking for a touristy thing

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:02.240
to do this weekend after the
Festival I suggest you cross the

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.950
Potomac River and visit Section
60 of Arlington National Cemetery.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:12.390
Section 60 is where many of our
battle dead from Afghanistan

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:16.720
and Iraq are buried,
almost a thousand of them.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.570
I once called it the
saddest acre in America,

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:24.590
but it's actually almost
14 acres, sadly.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:29.520
First Lady Laura Bush gave us
the National Book Festival,

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.770
others gave us Section 60.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:36.980
As an Army brat I grew
up on Army posts and most

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.350
of them have a national
cemetery full of war dead.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:44.470
For a kid there was something
mesmerizing about these places,

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:49.230
including the regularity of the
gravestones, each 28 inches high,

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:55.710
bone white, perfectly aligned,
each grave containing a world gone.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.700
W.H. Alden [Assumed
Spelling] said we were put

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.810
on this earth to make things.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:06.120 position:56%
I think he would take a broad view
of what we should be making, a poem,

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:11.850
a novel, a cookbook, a gadget,
but the point is to be a maker.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:15.430
Like some of you I suspect it took
me awhile to figure out what it was

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.450
that I was supposed to make.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:23.200
I did the usual stumbling, fumbling
adolescent thing, post-adolescent.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:28.460
I thought I wanted to be an
Army officer like my father.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:34.760
I had an appointment to West Point,
David Petraeus' class in fact,

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.920
but decided at the very last
minute not to go because I wanted

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.580
to study literature and maybe
even try my hand at writing.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.160
I also wanted to go to a
place where there were girls,

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:49.520
and at that time West Point
admitted exactly zero.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.780
I stumbled into the newspaper
business, eventually stumbled

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.490
into The Washington Post because as
an Army brat I knew the difference

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:01.710
between an F-16 fighter and an M-16
rifle I was given military topics

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.380
to write about.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:09.510
I found that my calling was to
make something of all those graves,

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:15.310
those worlds destroyed,
those young men dying young.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.900
So what I do is write about
war, and that sadly never goes

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.690
out of fashion, it's
always a growth industry.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:28.280
I now consider myself a
recovering journalist,

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.570
instead of writing the first
rough draft of history,

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:34.730
trying to use a longer lens
writing narrative military history,

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.380
every scribbler since Eucides
[Assumed Spelling] knows

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:42.600 position:56%
that writing about war means
writing about love, valor, venality,

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.400 position:56%
the foolishness of fools, the
knavery of knaves, the whole panoply

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.810
of human behavior and misbehavior.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.120
In early 2003 between books I did
some backsliding into journalism

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.850
and went off to war, from Fort
Campbell, Kentucky to Iraq

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:04.920
with the 101st Airborne
Division, then commanded

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.910
by my non West Point
classmate, Dave Petraeus.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.520
One day just after the
invasion began Petraeus

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.820
and I were standing outside
in a screaming sandstorm

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.420
in a remote hellhole
of Southern Iraq,

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.850
our faces no more than
eight inches apart.

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:27.140
Things were not going very well
in the war, not very well at all.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:36.910
And he said tell me how this
ends, tell me how this ends?

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:42.110
I recently finished writing 750,000
words about the American role

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.770
in the liberation of
Europe in World War II.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.860
We just commemorated on
Wednesday the 70th Anniversary

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.670
of the formal end of the War.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.960 position:56%
Oddly enough during the home stretch

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.170
that question perplexed
me, tell me how this ends?

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.790
Authors know that finding an
ending can be as difficult

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:01.910
as finding a beginning sometimes.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.700
We all know how World
War II ends, right?

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:09.770
Ticker tape, America ascendant,
boom and post-war babies,

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.250
some of whom are sitting
in this room tonight.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:18.930
But then I came across a document
compiled by the US Army in 1946

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:24.170
that suggested how to put a
period on those 750,000 words.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:29.590
The document recounted in exquisite
detail how in a large warehouse

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:35.920
at 601 Hardesty Avenue in Kansas
City the US Army Effects Bureau had

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.090
begun as a modest quartermaster
operation

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:44.340
with a half dozen employees
in February 1942.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.880
That expanded to more
than 1,000 workers,

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:52.050
and by August 1945 they were
handling 60,000 shipments a month,

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:57.450
each laden with the effects of
American dead from six continents.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:03.250
Hour after hour, day after day
shipping containers were unloaded

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:07.470
on to a receiving dock and
then hoisted by elevator

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:10.080
to the Depot's 10th floor.

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:15.580
Here the containers traveled by
assembly line, conveyor belt,

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:22.630 position:56%
down to the 7th floor, as inspectors
pawed through each container

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:28.210
to extract pornography,
ammunition, perhaps amorous letters

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:32.630
from a girlfriend you didn't
want a grieving widow to see.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:39.120 position:56%
Workers used grinding stones and
dentist drills to remove bloodstains

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.690
and corrosion from
helmets and web gear.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:44.080 position:56%
A detailed inventory was then pinned

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:49.590
to each repacked container before
it was stacked in a storage bin.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:56.100 position:56%
And all the while in a huge adjacent
room banks of typists were banging

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:01.620
out letters, up to 70,000 letters
a month by December of 1945,

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:07.660
and the gist of those letters
was this - Dear Sir, Dear Madam,

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.860
we have your dead son's stuff,

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:16.470
you want it back, where
should we send it?

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:22.180
Over the years the Effects Bureau,
inspectors found amazing things -

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:28.660
tapestries, enemy swords, a
German machinegun, walrus tusks,

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.150
a shrunken head, a tobacco
sack full of diamonds.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:35.040
Among thousands of
diaries also collected

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.490
in Kansas City was a black
notebook that belonged

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:43.740
to Lieutenant Herschel G. Horton,
29 years old from Aurora, Illinois.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.240
Shot in the leg and hip during
a firefight with a Japanese

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.640
on New Guinea, he had dragged
himself into a grass shanty.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.580
And in the several days
that it took for him

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.500
to die he wrote a final
letter home to his family.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:03.330
And it began -- My Dear Sweet
Father, Mother and Sister,

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:09.380
I lay here in this terrible place
wondering not why God has forsaken

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.900
me, but why he is making me suffer.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:21.080
That's how it ends,
that's how it always ends.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:25.090
And I'll end this evening, since
we are in The Library of Congress

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:28.700
by quoting our recent Poet
Laureate, Natasha Trethewey,

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.240 position:56%
who ends her poem, Pilgrimage,
which is about a visit to Vicksburg,

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:38.880
with these lines - In my dream
the ghost of history lies

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:46.770
down beside me, rolls over,
pins me beneath a heavy arm.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:51.970
My job is to make the
reader feel that heavy arm.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:54.950
Thanks very much for the privilege
of being with you this evening.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:56.750
Thank you.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:07.190
[ Applause ]

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:11.400
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Ladies
and gentlemen, Louise Erdrich.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:18.730
[ Applause ]

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:22.000
&gt;&gt; Louise Erdrich: I feel like
I've been everywhere already,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:31.520
from a world being dreamed by
someone with a child who wants

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:38.930
to make it worthy for, to a
universe where Humboldt's,

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:42.500
in Saul Bellow's words,
Humboldt's dream

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:50.100
of nature is realized,
and to your world.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:55.140
I want to thank you, all of
you for bringing me there.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.550
The first thing I'm going to do

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.280
after this is read
your latest books.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.510
Thank you.

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:08.510
[ Applause ]

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:18.070
[ Foreign Language ]

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.850
I wanted to say something
in Ojibway because we're

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:21.540
in the Jefferson Building.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.720
I thought it would be exciting.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.530
The reason I know a
little Ojibway is

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:34.310 position:56%
because my mother is Turtle Mountain
Chippewa and my father met her

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:39.690 position:56%
when he went there to teach, and
the story is he looked across a road

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:42.540
and he saw her walking across
and he couldn't stop looking.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.590
And his brother was with him, and
he said I'm going to marry her.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.680
And they did.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.430
And so I'm here tonight.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:53.760
Thank you.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:39:00.380
[laughter] That's what
you do as a writer,

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.110
you get lost in your
own stories, I guess.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:12.340
When I was informed of this Award
I was astounded and I looked back,

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:19.240
as anyone would, through
literary history, heroes,

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:25.550
people and I noticed as a
woman and as a mother that,

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:30.870
and as a native woman, my father
is German, my mother is native,

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:40.160
that there were very
few women, fewer mothers

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:45.740
and very, very few native women.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:55.540
So I also want to thank reliable
birth control, family planning.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:02.620 position:56%
And I think that there's no
question that there is a coincidence

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:11.180
between the remarkable and
amazing novels and nonfiction,

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:15.130
everything that's being
written in the past 40 years

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:19.970
and the very simple
fact of birth control.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:24.140
So I want to say that because
as a mother [applause] -

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.390
I know I wouldn't have
had the presence of mind

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:34.440
without knowing something
about my future.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:42.040
I would also like to dedicate
these short remarks to my friend,

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.180
Loretta Monette's [Assumed
Spelling] literature class

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.330
at the Turtle Mountain
High School in Belcourt,

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:49.270
North Dakota on the Turtle
Mountain Reservation.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:53.800
And I'm just going to say this
because I'm hoping this is streamed

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.870
and I know they want to watch
it, so I'm addressing all

00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:00.620
of us although I'm going
to say young people.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.720
We're all young, so young people,

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:10.020
you can reach into another
person's most hidden self,

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:15.780
the existence you can't know
otherwise, by reading books.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:23.480
By reading you will reach into
yourself and find out who you are.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:27.880
Dear young people, reading
is about connecting hearts.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:33.750
So, as I said, I grew up in a
small town, and I was the oldest

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:37.360
of seven - in North Dakota - I
was the oldest of seven children.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:43.960
And our parents were and are - my
father is 90, my mother is 80 -

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.440
they were our schoolteachers

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:51.080
because as a teacher you never
lose your teaching instinct.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.620
Everything when I grew
up was labeled with,

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:59.740
every object had a German or
Spanish or French label on it

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.380
so that we would learn
these languages.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:06.510
And on the rare occasions
that we were permitted

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:13.460
to watch television we had to
cover our eyes during commercials.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:19.480
My father especially was very
worried that - he loved capitalism

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:27.530 position:56%
in many ways, but he really didn't
like this, how we would be persuaded

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:31.260
to buy useless objects if we
watched these commercials.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:35.100
And to this day he
is still that way.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:40.540 position:56%
He has never bought a pair of
socks, and that's going way too far,

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.460
he mends his own socks and he's 90.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.060
[laughter] Those were the days,
though, that a parent would say put

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.340
down that book and
do something useful.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.640
I got that a lot.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.730
And now we get this misty feeling

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.930
when we see a child somewhere
reading a book, right?

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:03.420
We don't want to disturb
that intimacy.

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:08.920
And as the daughter of
schoolteachers I'm very aware

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:14.220
that really the future of what
we hold so dear, of literature

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:18.960
and books, really is in the
hands of schoolteachers.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:21.540
Teaching a young person

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:25.560
to love reading is really a
mind-bending task, and they do it

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:29.830
and they do it every day
and they do it with love.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:35.030 position:56%
And I see every day, along with my
daughter Palace who is here with me,

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:37.780
that children do, do love books.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:44.190
It's like a natural sort of
once they really are committed

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:47.790
to reading they fall in love.

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:50.810
We own a bookstore, it's
called Birch Bark Books.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:55.840 position:56%
It's a little place in Minneapolis,
and we're going to stock your books,

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.460
we're going to sell our books.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:06.370
We love bringing books to people,
and we still see children walking

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.930
into the bookstore with
big handfuls of change.

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:10.840
I mean, you know, maybe
they held somebody up,

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:15.430
but they've got this money that
they've collected from babysitting

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:20.790
or under the couch cushions,
and they're still buying a book

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:24.070
that they've had to scrape
some money together to buy

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:26.320
and they want it to be theirs.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:31.150
But when I grew up we were
living in a small town,

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:34.490
schoolteachers didn't have much
money, and we had three books.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:38.260
We had Marjorie Morningstar
by the first author

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.820
who was awarded this
price, Herman Wouk.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:44.030
Marjorie Morningstar was on the
highest shelf so I couldn't read it

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:51.090
until I learned how to climb up the
side of some very rickety shelves.

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.990
I read it when I was about eight.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:58.170
Amazing. And we had the Bible.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.990
And we had Animal Farm
by George Orwell,

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:04.740
and I read that when I was nine.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.700
And I thought the best
pig story ever.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:13.840
[laughter] And when I
was 13 I read it again,

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:18.600
and I thought it changed everything
for me because I couldn't believe

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.160
that something could be
written on two levels.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:31.100
My escape or my treasure, the place
that I was educated was a library,

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:36.760
it was a town library endowed by
some very good people in the town.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:41.450
I read most of the books in there
or tried to read most of the books

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:45.530
in there before I left Wahpeton.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:49.770 position:56%
And, oh, my mother, I hope this
isn't streamed now because I'm going

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:56.280
to say this - my mother took out
a book called Portnoy's Complaint

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.590
because I told her it was great.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:03.890
[laughter] And she brought
it home and she read it.

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.950
This is a small town and you had

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.210
to sign your name on
library cards, right?

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:18.030
And she erased her name and put it
back in the middle of the night.

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:24.050
[laughter] So this prize is
especially meaningful to me.

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:30.140
It's meaningful that as a culture
we consider books so important

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:35.470
that we have established and
maintained a National Library.

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:43.980
To me, this says more about us as
a nation than our military power,

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:50.650
than our global influence,
than our wealth.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:59.210
This is our wealth, and what this
wealth involved is our freedom

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:04.360
to think what we think,
say what we say,

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.170
and publish what we
write for other people.

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.500
And then for these
works to be treated

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:20.930
as treasure this is what
is noble about our country.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:25.410
My first job in Wahpeton
was hoeing sugar beets.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:27.050
Now I've said that
writing was similar,

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:30.690
that I spend my days chopping words

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:34.820
out that suck the life
from sentences.

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:39.740
In a way writing is a
very miniscule, tedious,

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:44.860
almost insect-like
operation, you know?

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:51.800
I still feel very much like
the 13-year-old girl that I was

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:59.700
when I had my first job, and I
still feel so excited and so happy

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:04.580
that I don't have to have that job,
I don't have to hoe sugar beets.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.240
It's changed everything, too,
because once you know what it's

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:17.220
like to work on that level it
changes how you see the entire

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:23.150
structure of the world and
where this country came from,

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:27.580
the foundation upon which its
beauty and wealth and honor

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.540
and gorgeous buildings exists.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:37.030
It exists on the sweat and the hard
work, the pain of people who were

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:44.060
in slavery, the dispossession of
native people, backs of women,

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:49.260
all of that is all part
of what we write about.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:55.460
And all that is part of the
extraordinary complexity

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.310
that we find ourselves in.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:01.280
I was so nervous about coming here

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.800
because I realize again
whenever I'm going somewhere

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:08.640
that I have always forgotten
to invent a literary persona.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:14.550
Now it's completely too late.

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:19.040
[laughter] I'm writing
a book now that started

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:24.080
with an Indian boarding
school experience.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.560
My grandfather, Patrick
Garneau [Assumed Spelling],

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:33.860
who testified in Congress on behalf
of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa,

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.830
was educated not quite
to the eighth grade level

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:40.220
in Indian boarding schools.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:44.980
And I researched his life, I was
able to get all his school files

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:50.820
through The Library of Congress
Midwestern Archives in Kansas City

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:57.560 position:56%
to deal straight on with a wonderful
librarian and to have his very files

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.190
and his letters in his own
handwriting sent to me.

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:10.140
And he has been a hero, a family
hero of ours, very learned,

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.400
very interesting, wonderful
traditional dancer,

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.740
just a terrific man.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:20.830
I didn't know that he'd
run away from school.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:26.020
Now I didn't know that he
tried so hard to get back

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:31.150
into the boarding school
that he was sent away from,

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:36.470
and that the superintendent
had written him back a letter -

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:40.160
Dear Pat, we can't let you
in, it wouldn't be right.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.890
After the intoxicating substance

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:49.500
that you manufactured
behind the barn.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:56.350
[laughter] With the other sixth
graders, we just don't know

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:59.310
if we can let you back in.

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:02.380
These are - the libraries are
full of things we don't know,

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:09.120
and it's a discovery and it's
a marvelous thing that you do

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:16.200
as librarians and that we all can
participate in by supporting you.

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:25.660
In that book, as many
native people do,

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:34.210
in fact more native people per
percentage of population enlist

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:40.020
in the Armed Services than
any other population group.

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:45.570
In that book a young man in 2003
has joined the National Guard,

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.860
in which my father
served for 36 years -

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:54.810
he's joined the National
Guard, extremely excited.

00:51:54.810 --> 00:52:01.530
For as many people are and were
in the real parts of this country,

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:05.580
full of fervor, full of
excitement to change the world,

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:10.140
to make the world better,
but it's 2003

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:15.330
and to his disappointment
he finds that this action,

00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:19.990
this war that is going on in
Iraq will be over in 100 days.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:30.630
If I aspire to anything it is
to understand, acts of love,

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:40.050
self-sacrifice, trust,
bravery, shame of cowardice,

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:47.770
the learning opportunities
of failure, joy, absurdity,

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:54.650
everything about ourselves in
our singular human existence.

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:59.980
So this is who I am and this is all
I am, a writer trying over and over

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:03.730
with insane persistence
to understand.

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:05.530
Thank you.

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:20.040
[ Applause ]

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: How many people
here are attending their first Book

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:24.630
Festival, National Book Festival,
could you raise your hands?

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:29.530
Wow. How many have
attended the last five?

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:32.210
The last 10?

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:35.590
All 15? Wow.

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:37.610
Okay. Jim, we know
you attended all 15.

00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:41.590
[laughter] There are a
number of authors who were

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:43.870
at the first Book Festival
and I just want

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:45.480
to acknowledge a number
of them here.

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.510
Scott Berg, are you here, Scott?

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:53.040
[ Applause ]

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.340
Scott, stand up.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.840
Scott is the Author of great books
on Woodrow Wilson, Lindbergh,

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.830
among other things,
Katherine Hepburn,

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:00.820
and winner of the Pulitzer Prize.

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.910
Thank you for coming again, Scott.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:05.260
Tom Mallon [Assumed Spelling],
a great historical novelist,

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.510
where is Tom, is he here somewhere?

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:08.810
There he is in the back.

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.610
Thank you.

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:13.140
[ Applause ]

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:14.620
He was at the first
Book Festival as well.

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:15.920
Walter Moseley [Assumed
Spelling], a mystery

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.130
and crime fiction writer,
a great one.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:19.430
Where is he?

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:20.730
There he is.

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:22.030
Thank you.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:23.670
[ Applause ]

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:25.850
And is Tom Brokaw here?

00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:27.150
Tom is going to be here tomorrow.

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:28.450
Is Tom here now?

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:31.030
All right, he's going to be
here tomorrow and we're going

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:32.590
to have a great session with him.

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.870
And there's one other person
I want to acknowledge,

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:37.120
who was at the first Book Festival.

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:42.720
He's a person who I think has
done more to get Americans excited

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:47.390
about history and their history
than any other living writer.

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:49.560 position:56%
It's a man who has written 10 books,

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:51.960
two of them have won
Pulitzer Prizes.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.640
His books have sold more
than 10 million copies,

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.610
translated into 17
different languages.

00:54:57.610 --> 00:55:01.900
He is the recipient of more
than 50 honorary degrees.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:06.580
He has won the Medal of Freedom,
and he is the proud father

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:09.720
of five children and
19 grandchildren,

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.260
and is a man that I think has
done more to help The Library

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:17.680
of Congress practically than any
other living author by speaking

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.540
about The Library of Congress
so eloquently and so frequently,

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.590
and he did much of his
research on his books

00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:26.050
at The Library of Congress.

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:29.510
It's my honor to introduce
David McCullough.

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:50.120
[ Applause ]

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.760
&gt;&gt; David McCullough: Thank you.

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.260
Thank you very, very much.

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:59.100
I was speaking at a college
in California not long ago,

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:03.800
and in the question-and-answer
period I was asked aside

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.660
from Harry Truman and John Adams
how many other Presidents have

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.960
you interviewed?

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.260
[laughter] Well, appearances
notwithstanding,

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:23.120
I never knew either Mr.
Truman or Mr. Adams.

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:28.970
But I've been asked if I could be
somewhere to witness some event

00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:32.890
that took place in the lives
of either of those men?

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:38.560 position:56%
Because of my devotion to this great
institution here, I would have loved

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:44.230
to ask John Adams how he felt
signing the first Library

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:48.850
of Congress into law as President
of the United States in 1800

00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:54.630
on April 24th, a day that I think
all of us ought to know, that date.

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:59.080
It was probably one of the
very few things that he

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:03.890
and his Vice President,
Thomas Jefferson, agreed on.

00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:07.200
And, of course, they both
expressed their love of books

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.340
in a vivid fashion more than once.

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:15.180
Adams grew up in a house where
there were no books, maybe a Bible.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:16.970
His mother was illiterate.

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:21.230 position:56%
And, as he said, he went to Harvard,

00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.550
discovered books, and
I've read forever.

00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:30.110
When he was in his 80s he embarked
on a 16-volume history of France

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:33.380
in French, which he taught himself.

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:41.850
We have come a long way and for a
very good reason, by so many people

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:43.900
who went before us who did so much

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:47.310
that we should never,
ever take for granted.

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:50.180
And the establishment of an
institution, such as this,

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:54.480
here on the acropolis of our
country where it belongs was one

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:58.850
of the greatest of all American
achievements and still is.

00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:06.420
Think of it, the greatest Library
in the world, and it began here

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:11.600
and we are the beneficiaries,
all of us.

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:16.460
I speak tonight at this
celebrant occasion,

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:22.420
this wonderful Book Festival,
as one whose life was changed

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:29.480
by this Library, whose whole
direction as in my ambitions

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:33.360
of what I would make
of my life changed.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:38.670
Fifty years ago this year I
signed my first book contract

00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:41.470
and I couldn't believe that
a publisher was willing

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:47.940
to sign a book contract with
me because I'd come upon quite

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:52.500
by accident, a discovery
here, right upstairs,

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:58.150
about the disastrous plight in
Johnstown, Pennsylvania of 1889.

00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:00.980
I'd grown up in Pittsburgh,
which is not very far away,

00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.710
and heard about this
calamity all my life,

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:05.560
but I really didn't
know what happened.

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:08.460
And I saw a collection
of photographs lying

00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:13.820
on a big table upstairs
and stopped to look at them

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.270
and could not believe the scale

00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:19.950
of devastation revealed
in those photographs.

00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:22.320
So I took a book out
of the Library to read

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.050
about it, and it wasn't very good.

00:59:25.050 --> 00:59:27.560
So I took another book
out of the Library,

00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:29.760
and if anything it
was less satisfactory,

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:33.330
it was a potboiler
written at the time.

00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:37.470 position:56%
Well, in college as an English
major I had come under the influence

00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:41.330
of the wonderful Thornton
Wilder, who was a fellow

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:43.460
in Davenport College at Yale,

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:47.180
and I was a student resident
in Davenport College.

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:50.580
And you could go in and sit
down beside him at lunch

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:53.070
in the dining hall if
he happened to be there

00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:55.730
and talk with Thornton Wilder.

00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:59.810
And somebody once asked him
how did you get the ideas

00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:02.670
for your plays and your novels?

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:07.810
And he said, well, I would imagine
a story I would like to read

01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:11.710
or a play, a story I'd love
to see performed on the stage,

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:14.930
and I'd check around and find
out that nobody had written it.

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:17.700
I would write it myself so
I could see it performed

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.920
on stage, but read it in a book.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:26.910
[laughter] And I said to myself why
don't you try and write the book

01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:31.030
about the Johnstown flood that
you wished you could read.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:35.780
I'd never done any research of
a serious nature in my life.

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:37.660
I've had relatively little history.

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:40.220
I never - I knew I
wanted to be a writer.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:44.810 position:56%
I was here working for the US
Information Agency, which I had done

01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:49.380
because when Kennedy gave his call
for all of us to serve our country,

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.580
to do something for your country,
I thought I'm going to do that.

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.100
So I quit my job in New
York at Time and Life.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.820
I was still in my 20s,
came to Washington.

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.930
Knew nobody in the Kennedy crowd.

01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:02.510
Knew nobody here in the Government.

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:06.590
Wound up, stroke of luck, working
for the US Information Agency,

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:09.100
which was what brought me up
to The Library of Congress

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:14.390
to check something out for a
project I was involved with.

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:17.150
That was more than 50 years ago.

01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:21.600
I've just published my tenth
book, most of which is based

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.710
and the whole idea of the
book is based on what kind

01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:28.630
of human beings were
the Wright Brothers.

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:33.200
And I was able to find that
right here, upstairs - excuse me,

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.490
across the way in the new Library
in the Wright Brothers Collection,

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:41.680
which is one of the greatest
collections of letters in all

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.170
of the great collections
of The Library of Congress.

01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:48.930
Over a thousand private letters,
private correspondence just

01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:52.140
between the father, the two
brothers, and the daughter.

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:55.590
More than a thousand
letters written mainly

01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:59.730
by Wilbur Wright concerning
their professional efforts

01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:02.920
to discover the secret to flight.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:09.120
You can go inside their
lives, inside their worries,

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.680 position:56%
inside their determination to not be
stopped by failure, inside the fact

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:18.290
that they had the capacity to learn
from failure, and they were knocked

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:22.660
down and seemingly defeated
many, many times in many ways,

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:26.950
but they would not give up and they
always came back, what did we learn

01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:29.270
from that defeat, that failure?

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:38.480 position:56%
And to have the privilege of reading
those letters and discovering

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.550
that these two men who broke one

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:43.740
of the most highly technical
difficult problems of all time

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.270 position:56%
and then changed the world, changed
history with what they accomplished,

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:52.400
who had no money, who had no
education beyond high school,

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.080
but who grew up in
a houseful of books,

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:01.400
who grew up under the inspiration
and direction of a father

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:05.440
who had them read everything,
but mainly the great works

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:12.550
of literature - Virgil, Voltaire,
Mark Twain, Hawthorne, poetry,

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:17.420
drama, theater, Shakespeare,
natural history, everything.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:21.050
And to read above the level
always from the childhood on.

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:24.420
Who had what would
amount to a brilliant

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:28.580
and very full good
liberal arts education

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:33.790
in a tiny little wood frame house
on a side street in Dayton, Ohio.

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:38.610 position:56%
And yet they mastered this most
difficult of all technical problems,

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:41.650
not because they'd been trained
in technology or science,

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:45.240
but because they had that
reach of mind and that sense

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:49.900
of having purpose in
life, high purpose,

01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:57.450
and by being curious
about everything.

01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:03.410
Orville Wright was once asked if
he didn't agree with those who said

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:06.080
that he and his brother
were the perfect example

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:13.180 position:56%
of how far an American could go with
having had no advantages growing up?

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:18.420 position:56%
He said, oh, that's not true, we had
the greatest advantage any children,

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:23.150
any child could have, we grew
up in a house that stimulated

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:26.970
and encouraged intellectual
curiosity.

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:38.870 position:56%
I've had the privilege of using the
treasures, of having my mind opened,

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:45.700
my curiosity enhanced
by this Library

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:50.180
for every subject I have
undertaken, every one.

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:58.210
I owe my life's work to this
Library, and my gratitude

01:04:58.210 --> 01:05:01.960
and my appreciation can never
be sufficiently fulfilled

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.850
in what I hope I can do for
this Library as time goes

01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:08.330
on and have in years past.

01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:16.370 position:56%
And one of the greatest
privileges, the greatest friendships

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:24.510
that I have made in my life
is with Jim Billington.

01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:31.040
[ Applause ]

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:36.790
I want to tell you that that
man, that scholar, that thinker,

01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:43.780 position:56%
that Oxford Graduate, that Professor
of History at Harvard and Princeton,

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:51.930 position:56%
that man has changed this Library in
ways that no one could have imagined

01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:57.690
when he first became the Librarian
of Congress now 28 years ago.

01:05:57.690 --> 01:06:03.420
On the day that he was sworn
in as the new Librarian

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:10.280
of Congress he said some
things that I've recently read

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:16.690
that I think were the
prediction that was fulfilled.

01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:22.830
He said during his press
conference he maintained

01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:26.550
that celebrating the life
of the mind is something

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:32.280
that a free people needs to
do, the life of the mind.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:38.440
He also said in taking his
oath of office, as it were,

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:47.160
that the Library should move out
more broadly and more deeply.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:52.370 position:56%
Jim Billington has made this Library
an international institution.

01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:59.140
He has made it a resource
for the world to tap into.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:04.290
And he's delved deeper
into innumerable subjects.

01:07:04.290 --> 01:07:08.050
He's also an idea factory.

01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:11.370
I've never known anybody
like you, Jim.

01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:13.960 position:56%
He's got ideas coming out every day.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:18.290
It's so hard to keep up
just following the ideas.

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:24.280
And he has enthusiasm for
learning, enthusiasm for curiosity.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:29.450
And he has this wonderful optimism
about what can be accomplished.

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:38.310
Serving one's country, we think of
the Military of course and we think

01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:45.020
of some of our more admirable
representatives in our Government,

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:49.610
but we also ought to think of
those people who are doing the kind

01:07:49.610 --> 01:07:54.980
of work that the people who work
here do in this great institution

01:07:54.980 --> 01:08:02.670
and about their respect
for leadership.

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:05.070
I had a wonderful conversation
just today

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:12.760 position:56%
with a very important former member
of the staff with whom I have worked

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:17.670
over 25 years or more, now retired.

01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:21.750
We were talking about Mr.
Billington, Dr. Billington.

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:28.050
He said it takes a big individual
with big ideas to lead a big

01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:34.240
and an important institution
as he has and as

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.800
such institutions ought to be led.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:43.820
The gift of leadership is part of
James Billington's many abilities

01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:49.050
to which he has devoted so much
of his life and to the benefit,

01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:53.020
to the great advance
of this institution,

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:56.320
and consequently to our country.

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:03.010
He speaks eight languages,
eight languages.

01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:06.020
I can barely get by in one.

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:10.720 position:56%
He has innumerable honorary degrees.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.930
He is an important historian.

01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:17.470
He taught himself Russian on his
own by going to the public library

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:20.370
and using a dictionary when
he was still in high school

01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:25.500
because he wanted to read about
Russian history and Russian life.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.190
He is phenomenal.

01:09:27.190 --> 01:09:32.780
I think, it's my opinion he
could be classified as perfect

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:37.150
if he only had a sense of humor.

01:09:37.150 --> 01:09:43.550
[laughter] So, Jim, I express the
gratitude that so many of us feel

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:48.630 position:56%
in our hearts, as well as our minds,
for how you have served our country

01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:53.900
and enlarged the reach and
the scope and the appeal

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:59.510
of this great American institution,
The Library of Congress.

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:42.510
[ Applause ]

01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:43.930
&gt;&gt; James Billington:
Thank you, all, very much.

01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:47.140
Thank you, all, for being here.

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:53.970
And the applause you so generously
gave after that beautiful tribute

01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:59.320
by David McCullough, and
for the wonderful readings

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:05.330
of these Authors tonight,
so moving and so powerful,

01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:08.660
and you're all being here.

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:14.160
That I can only thank you and
say that the applause is for you.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.010
The applause is also
for the Congress,

01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:18.940
which has been the greatest
institutional patron

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:24.010
on a bipartisan basis through thick
and thin and really in the history

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:26.680
of the world the biggest patron.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:32.510
But also the extraordinary
patronage of those

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:36.740
who supported this Book
Festival, of the many Authors,

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:39.890
we have the biggest group
every coming this year,

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:45.020
of the many readers, of the
multigenerational power of reading.

01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:50.020
And also of our Host tonight
who spoke so eloquently

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:55.460
about this history and
who has made The Library

01:11:55.460 --> 01:12:01.060
of Congress Book Festival
something that will endure

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.210
by his generous backing
over a multiyear period

01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:09.330
as the really principal donor and
an extraordinary benefactor and,

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:13.700
himself, a live participant
and great enthusiasm

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:17.650
for reading, literacy and so forth.

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:23.670
It's a privilege to be in the
presence of these two people -

01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:28.330
David McCullough, who started it
out, was our first Book Festival,

01:12:28.330 --> 01:12:33.890
came and talked to me three
days before 9-11 occurred

01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:38.420
and said this is a great
idea, I want to help.

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.620
Well, help it, he did.

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:45.060
And its future is as
bright as its past.

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:48.870
And the big thing is not so much
what any one individual has done,

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:52.900
but we have an extraordinary staff.

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.290
So thanks to them.

01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:56.850
Thanks to the Congress who
has made this possible.

01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:59.910
Thanks to the donors who have
taken a special interest.

01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:06.100
And thanks to these two people
who are kind of the bookends -

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:09.950
David McCullough, which more than
anybody else, started this all up,

01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:16.690
started us on this adventure,
and David Rubenstein,

01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:18.620
who has made it permanent.

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:22.280
And all of you who
have participated.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.220
So the applause is all for you,

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:26.670
endless thanks, and
God bless you all.

01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:33.230 position:56%
And have a wonderful time at what
will be our largest group of Authors

01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:36.210
and all the other people
in this great world

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:42.200
of translating the human story
through the beauty of language

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.720
and the compactness and
the admiration of a book.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:51.740
I remember George Canon [Assumed
Spelling] once said late in life,

01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:54.760
close to his 100th birthday,
he looked out the window

01:13:54.760 --> 01:14:07.340 position:56%
of my office here and said I wonder
if everyone will ever always be able

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:12.720
to enjoy being alone with
a good book on a rainy day.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:18.220
It's the beginning of
conversation, of dialogue.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:22.270
This is a place where it happens,
it begins, for many of the families

01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:28.200
and fathers it began reading by
natural light before they went

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.960
to work in the society,
and then began talking

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.330
about the different
experiences they had,

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:37.510
the different books
that they'd read.

01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:41.240
Reading was so fundamental,
it always is.

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.990
Thank you, all, for supporting and
thank you, all, for being here.

01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:50.610
And thank you, most particularly,
to our Host and our Speaker,

01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:54.890
the person who really began it all,
sustained it all, and the person

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:57.500
who has made sure that
this thing will last

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:01.530
by his own wonderful
enthusiasm for books, reading,

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:03.290
literacy, the whole bang.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:06.510
Thank you, all, so
much for being here.

01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:19.050
[ Applause ]

01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:20.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Thank you, Jim.

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:24.150
This is a composite of the
posters for the 15 Book Festivals

01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:26.690
and on behalf of the
National Book Festival,

01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:28.870
The Library of Congress we
want to present this to Jim.

01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:30.670
Jim?

01:15:30.670 --> 01:16:12.250
[ Applause ]

01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:15.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So I just
wanted to say thank you to everybody

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.600
who has come this evening.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.830
We are going to have
dinner upstairs.

01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:24.210
The main Reading Room is open, and
tomorrow we have a Book Festival.

01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:27.850
And as we all know Thomas
Jefferson, one of the great patrons

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:30.740
of The Library of Congress
said that part of life is

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:33.720
about pursuing happiness,
and tomorrow all

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.890
of us get a chance
to pursue happiness.

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:39.370
So pursue some happiness
this evening, tomorrow.

01:16:39.370 --> 01:16:41.240
Jim Billington, thank you
for everything you've done.

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.850
And, David, thank you
for a great speech.

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:49.200
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
