00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.240
Women!

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.379
You can’t live with ‘em, can’t live
without ‘em.

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.150
Or can you?

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.709
Hello firestorm of sexism happening down in
the comments section, I’m Jules here for

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:14.709
DNews.

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.030
Making a baby is… pretty straightforward.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.400
At a base biological level, it simply comes
down to a sperm cell fertilizing an egg cell,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.650
also called an “oocyte”, which undergoes
cell division, develops into an embryo, which

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.800
itself develops into a lil baby.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.789
How that happens, whether it’s in-vitro,
or artificial insemination, or just plain

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.220
ol’ “doin’ it”, is kind of beside
the point as far as nature is involved.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.810
At least, since 1827, that’s what we always
thought.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.290
See, before 1827, scientists thought that
humans came pretty exclusively from semen,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.710
which they believed was the origin of a teeny-tiny
human, also called a “homunculus”, which

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.780
just grew into a bigger one inside the womb.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.050
But in 1827, Karl Ernst Ritter von Baer, Edler
von Huthorn, which a single person’s name,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.320
became the first to actually observe the egg,
called the “mammalian ovum”.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.100
Since that time, we haven’t found anything
else we can mix with sperm to make a baby.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.899
In 2004 there was a brief attempt at tricking
egg cells into thinking they had been fertilized,

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.680
which caused them to start dividing and turn
into zygotes.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.880
But as expected, you just can’t make a whole
mammal without both halves of the equation,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.719
that is, chromosomes, and the fake-fertilized
eggs died after a few days of development.

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.399
And so, that was it.

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.759
That is, until September 13th, 2016, when
Scientists at Bath University in the UK published

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.490
a study, wherein, using mice, they were able
to fertilize a type of embryo called a haploid

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.299
parthenogenote, which is NOT an oocyte.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.719
Many publications described it as being closer
to “skin cells”, as unlike an oocyte,

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.670
it had already undergone cell division.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.490
That’s kind of a huge deal because it kind
of implies that we really only need the “sperm”

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.689
part of the equation, which brings us right
back to the ol’ “homunculus” theory

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.689
of development.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.499
The idea that the female egg is interchangeable
seems kind of crazy.

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:57.700
And… that’s because it is.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.740
See, what nearly all of these publications
are neglecting to mention is that the haploid

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.719
parthenogenote which the scientists managed
to fertilize is derived directly from… a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.140
female unfertilized egg.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.300
In fact, it’s the egg in the exact same
stage of development that I mentioned earlier,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.380
where scientists tricked it into dividing.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.500
So, really, scientists fertilized cells that
had just stopped being an egg.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.520
Now, that’s not to say that what these scientists
discovered wasn’t groundbreaking; it absolutely

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.520
was.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.630
The fact that an egg that has been tricked
into starting development can be fertilized

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.050
afterwards means that whatever reprogramming
of the sperm that is going on to allow embryonic

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.360
development can happen outside of the singular
egg cell.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.410
While that doesn’t mean we can make a baby
out of some sperm and a toenail, it does uncover

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.990
something brand new about embryonic development.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.800
So, it sounds like we still need
women to make babies

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.550
Unless we can figure out some
way to get a man pregnant.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.520
Or have we already?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.480
Stay tuned and find out in a video coming out later today!

So put on your headphones and get ready to
experience videos in a whole new way!

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.200
So why do we even have sex in the first place?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.800
I know it seems obvious but watch this video with Trace

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.800
for a little more unique explaination.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.000
So what do you think? Do you think we'll ever

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
be able to make a baby without both halves

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.000
of the equation? Let us know down below in the comments
