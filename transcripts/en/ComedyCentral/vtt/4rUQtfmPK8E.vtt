00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.770
All right, it's time to play
Rock the Waffle House.

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.872
Rock the Waffle House.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.645
Normally, the jam served up
by Waffle House

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.847
come from a huge jar in the back
that needed to be replaced

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.650
months ago, but they've
been serving up musical jams

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:20.386
right under our goddamn noses.
Or earses.

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.889
Waffle House has their own
record lab... Oh, you know this?

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.223
Waffle House
has their own record label,

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:25.558
which they've had for 30 years.

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:28.561
They've been cooking up
hot songs like "Color Me Gone."

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:32.098
♪ Scattered, smothered, covered
and a cup of joe ♪

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.500
♪ Make it large, to go ♪

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:39.772
♪ Then there's no more highway
left to chase ♪

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.374
Yeah.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:44.243
(cheering and applause)

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:47.046
This is the one table at Waffle
House that's having a good time,

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.315
as opposed to the other seven,
where someone's taking a nap

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:50.850
before their custody hearing.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:52.852
Uh... now that we know

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.854
that America's favorite
breakfast home is releasing

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:57.323
such hot tracks,
let's help 'em out by coming up

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:59.859
