A lot of you have been asking us to debunk health fat so we went to LA to meet our friend Grace Helbig and try

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.219
Some of the weirdest wellness trends and search for the world's healthiest drink up first is shilajit used in traditional Indian medicine

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.440
Study shows the main active ingredient folic acid can help with alzheimer's disease and it may also help with Kidney stones

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.200
But some of the claims can't quite be backed up like it gives you better memory mood or "sharp intelligence"

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.145
- All right let's do it. shall we do it? 
- All right cheers

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.640
*Moans of Disgust from shitjalit"

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.180
it tastes like um some sort of earthly element like dust uh

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.460
What is it some people call this sweat of rock is it like decompose into rocks basically in many ways is like eating soil.  so it's compost

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.240
wait it's dead compost

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:54.440
yes, basically all of these claims have no significant evidence to back them up and on the flip side it can actually cause toxicity because

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.919
They found heavy metal ions in them, and in some cases traces of Mercury and Arsenic

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:08.368
You know one brown color well-deserving up. There's 30 bucks. Oh. Oh, that's nice compared to the dirt water

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.880
This is like straight up. Yeah, so this is popularized by gwyneth paltrow's goop have you heard of that. Oh big-time that was

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.259
Essentially, it's like a supplement

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.009
So it just has random nutrients and chemicals in it you aligned with the cosmic flow of great achievement is

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.169
That me what I think they just put the mater sound smart because it works and I

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.979
When I say I'm a digital entrepreneurs

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.600
Researchers have found that the photosynthetic pigment, and Iii live does have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.539
Properties, this is very similar to dark leafy greens like spinach which are really rich in antioxidants

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.050
Iii Live is a Bacteria and though. It itself is not toxic

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.660
it has been found have toxic strains within it some of these toxins can actually be deadly in wild animals and

What do you think thank you?

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.660
So silicon brings up images of plastic surgery or nanotechnology

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.759
This chemical element is found in several of our foods and fluids and is related to good Bone health

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.399
But since it is found in so many foods including cereals bananas beer and even the water

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.300
We drink no human has ever reported a silicon deficiency, okay?

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.739
Why would I do this when I can have a beer is?

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.039

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.120
When you just said anti-cancer because you can get away with claiming

Whatever you want as long as you have a disclaimer on the back somewhere. You can say like this will make you never die

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.439
