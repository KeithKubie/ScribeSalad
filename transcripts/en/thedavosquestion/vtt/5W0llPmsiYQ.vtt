00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.339
&gt;&gt; Hello this is Robert Skoval and I'm [pause]
giving you my thoughts on the Davos question,

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:12.910
which is how do you improve the world? One
thing I'm studying here while at Davos is

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.619
how to improve the water quality around the
world, because there's billions of people

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.130
who don't have the clean water that I do to
drink every day or use in their fields or

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:33.540
use to take bath in. And if you don't have
clean water, everything else doesn't quiet

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.180
measure up. It doesn't matter that you have
a cell phone or a computer if you don't have

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.181
clean water. doesn't matter that you have
food to drink, if you don't get clean water

00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:48.780
you're gonna be too sick to eat food or get
out in the fields and work or hang out with

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.040
your family so. If there's one thing that
I think we can do to improve the world it's

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.330
think about how to make clean water. There's
some innovations here that I heard about so

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.289
far that are pretty interesting. One guy built
a tricycle that while you drive it around

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.729
or ride it around. It is actually filtering
water for your family's use. That's pretty

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.369
interesting. Anyways, that's it from Davos.
