00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.850
&gt;&gt; Rachel Frick: Hi, thank you.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.860
Good Afternoon, my name's
Rachel Frick, I'm the director

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.030
of Business Development at
the Digital Public Library,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.710
and I've been working on a
number of eBook initiatives

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.670
with my colleague Michelle Bickert,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.380
who's our eBook Program
manager at DPLA.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.090
And we thought this would be a
great opportunity here at DPLA Fest

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.280
to bring up some folks who've been
working really hard in the area

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.210
of research and advocacy in eBooks

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.900
to help us inform building
really good, compelling services

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.750
for our libraries, and learn
a little more about this.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.800
So, we've got Michael Blackwell
from Readers First, as well as,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.740
Alison Bradley from the
Charlton Initiative.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.700
And then wrapping up everything
is our colleague Colin Rogister

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.260
from the White House
who's been helping us

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.490
in facilitating the
Open eBook Project.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.460
So, as moderator, I'm going
to just help with timing,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.110
and moving our folks along.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.620
We'll have time for maybe like, one
question in between each speaker,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.920
but we could hold all

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.900
of our questions toward the
end, that'd be really great.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.540
So, without further adieu, Michael.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.410
[ Applause ]

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Blackwell: Thank you so
much Rachel, I'm Michael Blackwell

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.920
from St. Mary's County
Library, and from Readers First.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.700
I've been with Readers
First for about three years,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.500 position:56%
Readers First, the name says it all.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.740
I think we've got a
reputation for being kind

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.790
of a technical oriented group, and
a large library oriented group.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.760
Our real purpose is making
reading easy for people,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.260
reading is the most important part.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.390
So, we're going to start with a
little bit of trip back in time,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.860
back to about 2009, 2010, and this
is what library eBooks were like.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.450
You probably all recognize
some of these things,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.050
there's our friend Adobe Digital
Editions, and there's a Nook.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.690
And what's the most
important part of that nook?

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.260
It's the plug, because
that's how you got eBooks

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.510
on it from your library.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.970
You had to have that
synchronized with an Adobe ID,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.140
and Adobe Digital Editions
synchronized with an ID.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.490
And if it didn't all work you
got an ACSM file sitting there

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.980
that nobody knew anything
what to do with.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.620
So, most of our users are
probably not very sophisticated,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.060
and I was on the frontlines then,
and I often dealt with people sort

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.000
of like ones we see
on your left here.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.310
"Oh, my grandchildren gave me
this ereader, can you show me how

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.150
to get content on that please?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.540
And when you did they gave you a
hug, and it was a great experience.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.470
They were in the 21st
Century, they could go home

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.480
and tell their grandkids,
"Look what I did."

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.990
But too often what we saw instead
is what you see on the right here,

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.130
people who were very frustrated
by that library eBook experience.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.400
This incidentally is
not a frustrated user,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.880
this is a librarian, she
was twenty-four years old

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.220
when this picture was taken, and
this is what the stress of trying

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.720
to teach eBooks at that time
were doing to libraries.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.220
See, she suddenly had
a couple tours in Iraq,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.030
and thought that was a
much safer and better job.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.680
So, eBook should be easy, we want
to take advantage of the benefits,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.150
that 24/7 access, it
should be easy to get.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.810
Nobody comes to you and say,
"How do I open this book,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.160
and how do I turn the pages?"

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.740
So, why should library
eBooks be so tough?

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.750
And that's where Readers
First got its start.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.400
Call in a couple of folks,
Micah May and James English,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.730
and Michael Santangelo, a couple
of them in the audience here

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.240
who were really instrumental
in moving this movement.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.120
So, currently we have
about 300 libraries,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.300
about 200 million readers,
and why not join?

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.560
First a word from our
sponsor, Readers First,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.690
helping with library
eBooks for four years.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.800
It's totally free, we have
two ways you can join,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.930
you can either simply be
a member and get updates,

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.620
or you can join our working group.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.220
Either way, you make
a huge difference

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.820
on how library eBooks work.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.670
Thank you from this
word from our sponsor.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.260
So, initial principles on this,
we wanted to launch eBooks

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.720
from the library catalog.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.350
Four ground libraries were the
provider, not those vendors,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.320
eBooks is not over-drive,
eBooks is your library.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.490
Manage accounts from
the library site.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.240
You shouldn't have to go to
all these separate places

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.090
in order to manage your account.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.390
You ought to be able to do it right

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.900
from the library site,
or the library app.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.740
And we want to make all
vendor content interoperable

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.220
across platforms.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.300
You don't have to have this device,
and that limits what you can do,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.700
or have this content
bundled, so that you've got

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.270
to visit particular
vendors to do that.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.030
And our initial way of
approaching this was develop APIs,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.840
or to advocate the
development of APIs.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.930
And, finally our aim was to try
to develop and promote apps,

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.810
and create some standards
for library eBook content,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.480
so that the vendors would all say,
"All right, here's what we've got

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.650
to do if we want to get
into the library market."

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.340
Now we didn't approach this
as if there were any devils,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.200
there's no demons out
there, we wanted to say,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.510
you know, you're our friends.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.400
Who put that that slide in there?

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.460
Cher, did you put that
slide in there?

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.750
Well, the gentleman on the left is
Mr. Steve Potash from OverDrive,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.400
and he's actually been
extremely pleasant to work with.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.730
Give you a specific example,
if you go to your app now,

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.610
you can log into OverDrive
with your library card number.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.580
That was a Readers First idea
we presented to the, so like,

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.540
kind of how we work
is, what's a good idea,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.570
and we approach the
vendors and talk about that.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.090
We say we've got 200
million readers,

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.520
don't you want to work with us?

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.370
So, that's not really fair to
Steve, who's a standup guy.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.810
The guy on the right, Mr. Bezos,

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.730
I believe that's actually an
actual un-retouched photo of him.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.870
Funny thing happened, we announced
our Principle Guider website,

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.730
started going to conferences, and
all these groups started saying,

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.020
"We're Readers First compliable",
said, really, who are you?

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.820
We didn't -- never even
heard of you before.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.230
So, our next step was to develop
a guide to library eBook vendors,

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.430
and we developed the
matrix to do that.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.160
Hence, the picture from the
Matrix, which ranked vendors

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.940
in about 37 categories,
all of them weighted.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.260
And we came up with a sort
of, composite score to try

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.730
to indicate how much
these people were

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.600
in compliance with Readers First.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.220
And it was amazing to see the
results, we were interviewing most

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.580
of the library vendors,
and we also had contact

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.880
with them though our libraries --

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.420
could actually evaluate
their products.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.920
And a lot of them started
developing things that we wanted,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.790
just so they would be
Readers Fist compliant.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.730
And if you do ever access
eBooks in your library catalog,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.380
and you're using APIs, so that it
launches right from that catalog,

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.250
I'm not going to take full credit
for that for Readers First,

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.710
but I will say we did have
a lot to do with that.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.260
So, then the golden period
of library eBooks began.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.080
Print started shrinking,
nobody got print anymore,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.010
everybody loved looking eBooks,
because they were so easy.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.110
Yeah, right.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.030
So, that brings us to the present,
we still have a lot of concerns

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.150
about library eBooks,
Yes, they're --

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.880
most of the vendors are using APIs,
it's gotten a lot easier to launch

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.350
from your catalog, but we
still look upon this process

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.280
as being too fragmented.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.910
It's too necessary to go
out to too many places,

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.730
and you're playing app
soup when you're trying

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.840
to get all library's content.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.450
We want them all to launch from
the single site, and the process,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.960
the very process of getting
eBooks can get in the way.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.400
And at smaller and less affluent
libraries this can be a particular

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.680
problem, because we may not have
the money in order to do some

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.650
of that API adoption
in the catalogues.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.100 position:56%
We're concerned about accessibility.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.850
Too often library eBooks
are not accessible to those

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.120
who might not see perfectly,
or have difficulty hearing.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.850
Privacy issues.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:37.170
Who owns the big data on
library digital content,

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:40.500
and what do they do with it?

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.640
If you know, please let me
know, because I have no idea,

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.260
I know what they say they
do, but there's a possible --

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.200
I mean, we want to
know it as libraries,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.560
but there's a possible
stream for the mayor,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.340
and I'm certain I want them
to be taken advantage of.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.920
Preservation of eBooks.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.830
Who's keeping track of them?

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.280
In ten years are we going
to have access to them?

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.210
Costs, this is a matter for
the publishers primarily.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.070
I think everybody in
this room is familiar

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.280
with how much a new popular
best-seller can cost as an eBook,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.550
and how much that might compare
to a print copy of the same thing.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.330
Finally, the business
models that some vendors

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.240
and publishers are using.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.750
Discovery of those titles can be
very problematic, that one user,

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.300
one book model definitely
limits the number

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.490
of books we can put
into people's hands.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.900
When you couple that with prices, I
think we're still doing our readers

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.070
out there, and libraries
a real disservice.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.660
We've seen astronomical growth in
library eBooks, what could it be

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.920
if we had a workable model where
people could access all the time,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.780
or access more frequently
than they do?

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.540
How many more hits could we have?

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.150 position:56%
How many more readers could we have?

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.760
Another concern, ILL, even if we've
just got a license to something,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.060
why can't we let somebody
else look at that?

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.440 position:56%
Now there's a growing vendor market,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.470
and there's newer library
eBook vendors,

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.940
and some of them are offering
very interesting models.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.080
So, that's a good thing, and
competition's always nice,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.610
but it's presenting challenges
too, because once again,

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.910
we've got more people
entering the market.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.370
How are we going to corral them?

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.850
How are we going to get
them working in a way

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.380
that will support Readers
First principles,

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.970
so we can launch all their
stuff from the same place too?

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.500
Finally, there's many, many voices

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.520
in the library eBook
-- I'm at ten minutes?

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.820
Ooh, I'd better hurry here.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.550
So, we're going to go -- do
the rest really quickly here,

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.430
what are we doing at Readers First?

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.120
First, keep calm and
raise your standards.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.530
We are supporting the
growth of standards

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.510
that will work across
vendor platforms.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.640
That's a huge thing for
us, and it's probably going

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.510
to continue to be our main focus.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.410
We're going to release
another version of our guide,

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.930
and try to give you some idea
of how compliant folks are.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.690
We're looking for some
marriages out here.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:06.990
The guy on the right is,

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.970
unfortunately not me
with my shirt off.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.980
I look a little more like
the person on the left.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.680
Incidentally, if you've never
seen the Librarian for Life

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.970
and Style blog, it's a lot of fun.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.280
We want to reach out and
work with other groups,

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.100
and we think that the DPLA
EBooks Working Group is going

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.640
to be a fantastic resource for us.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.120
We do want to be a part from that,
we want to share content with them.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.250
We want to share their content,
and work with other groups.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.870 position:56%
And we're just introducing ourselves

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.140
to the Charlotte Initiative you'll
be hearing from in a minute.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.910
We'd love to be working with you.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.860
What can you do for eBook advocacy?

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.940
Speak up, talk to your
vendors, but more importantly,

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.300 position:56%
get involved with this conversation.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.270
Become a part, join
one of these groups.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.510
We are soliciting members,
and it is totally free.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:12:01.890 position:56%
Here are our principles, and I don't
have time to review them in depth.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.160 position:56%
Okay, make sure you're
recognizing the library as provider.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.180
It shouldn't be, I access an eBook,
who's Overdrive, or who's 3M?

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.560
It should be the library
that you see, easy to acquire

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.650
and manage, no more than 3 clicks.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:21.640
Seamlessly available, available
across all different platforms,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.660
accessible, we need
those features built in.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.710
Private, and we need to
formulate this a lot much more,

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.280
but how much information
should be shared,

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.990
and who should it be shared with,
and should the restrictions be?

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:37.490
And finally, provided by a business
model, which is beneficial to all.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.230
Authors, yes, publishers, yes,

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.800
it's not like we don't think
people deserve a fair shake,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.330
but we think our readers
deserve a fair shake too.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:50.390
Quick shout out for Kelvin
Watson from Brooklyn, we were --

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.690
&gt;&gt; Queens.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.290
&gt;&gt; Queens, I keep saying that.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.290
I am sorry Kelvin, that's the
third time I have done that.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.030
I am -- I will now
bury my head in shame,

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:02.330
I have shamed this
cathedral of learning.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.300
The silver lining from
the hurricane that came

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.460
through there was the development
of some robust standards.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.950
We were talking in NISO for a
while, kind of flirting with NISO,

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.130
now we think those might be used.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.580
A number of our colleagues from
Readers Fist have been instrumental

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.800
in developing the SimpyE app,
and if you don't know about that,

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.960 position:56%
please find everything you can about
it, and plan on becoming an adopter,

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.300
because it is going to
revolutionize library eBooks.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.510
Thank you so much for
your time this morning.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:37.930
[ Applause ]

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.070
Oh, any quick questions?

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.720
We'll have time at the end too.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.660
Yes?

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.370
&gt;&gt; Are slides going to
be available afterward?

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.810
&gt;&gt; I'm told yes.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:54.970
No. I -- let's find
your presentation, okay.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.470
&gt;&gt; Alison Bradley: Nope.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.930
Yes.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.900
All right, I brought my own
timer because otherwise,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.200
who knows how long
I'll be talking for?

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.370
Okay. Hi, everyone.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.410
I'm Alison Bradley and the head of
Research and Information 'Services

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.710
at UNC Charlotte, and I'm here

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.360
to day representing the
Charlotte Initiative.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.100
This is a Mellon funded project
that is designed to convene a group

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.250
of publishers, librarians, and
consortia representatives to talk

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.080
about ways that we
can collect eBooks,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.660
and academic libraries
for the long-term.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.410
So, for a little bit of background,

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.210
this project was really
started several years ago,

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.590
and it's based upon our
library's assertive positon

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.140
on what we're willing to
tolerate in eBook collections

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.400
that we provide to our users.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.920 position:56%
Our first experiences with eBooks,
well, it's probably similar to a lot

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.220
of the other libraries out there,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.830
we had the net library
collections about ten years ago.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.680
They were purchased by
a state-wide consortium;

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.230
we were very excited
when we got them.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.530
We promoted them really heavily,

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.560
and our users gave us
feedback hot and fresh.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.240
They were frustrated with the
limitations on those collections.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.980
They didn't like the interface,

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.400
they didn't understand why only one
person could use a book at a time.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.920
And in academic library, they had
been trained for ten years prior

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.550
to that to use online journals,
when anyone could look at a copy

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.950
of any article at any time.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.250
They could download a pdf, they
could take it with them, print it,

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.310
save it, copy it, paste it.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.150
So, when we came in and
said, well, you know,

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.900 position:56%
the publishers are saying this eBook
needs to work like a print books,

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.190
they didn't really make
that connection quite

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.480
as easily the publishers had hoped.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.090
The particular bad feedback came

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:56.560
when our classroom instructors had
a book that they either assigned,

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.960 position:56%
or that they're students all found
at once that they all wanted to use.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.040
I think that the final
straw for us was

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.480
when we had a really nicely
phrased, but extremely angry email

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.780
from a professor who said,

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.140
"If I'd knew that your
eBooks worked liked this,

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.550
I would have told my students
not to use the library

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.990
at the beginning of the semester."

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.440
So, that's the kind of thing
a librarian never wants

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.740
to hear, right?

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.050
That's not what we're there for.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:24.280
Our Associate University librarian
for Collection Development,

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.760
Chuck Hamaker, came to the subject
librarians next department meeting

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.250
and said, "Hey, we've got
28,000 of these books,

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.780
can we just withdraw them?"

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.220
"Can we take them out
of the catalog?"

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.590
And that's probably the first
time in recorded history

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.340
that all of us agreed, right?

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.050
There were absolutely no dissenting
opinions, we were all happy to say,

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.590
we'll throw them out, and we
will not provide them any longer,

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.350
because they just don't meet
what a campus of our size,

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.730
and our type of research needs.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:56.850 position:56%
So, Chuck began writing and speaking
really actively on his position

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.010
on what an eBook collection
needed to provide

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.940
to serve an academic
campus like ours.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.440
He eventually drafted
three basic principles

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.930
of what we thought we
needed to have in order

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.760
to make these collections useful
for our students and our faculty.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.360
They're pretty simple, we
think that our collections need

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.930
to have unlimited,
simultaneous users.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.930
They need to have no
digital rights management,

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.700
and they need to have
irrevocable, perpetual access,

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.110
and archival rights
at the library level,

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.270
so that we can buy
this stuff and keep it.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.770
We see it as part of our
responsibility to be able to hold

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.070 position:56%
on to the materials that we
purchase for our student's research,

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.860
so that someone can go back
in 50 years or 100 years,

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.570
whether that material
is out of date or not,

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.310
and see how did we study
that stuff back then?

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.750
In fall of 2014, our
library had the opportunity

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.930
to pitch some different research
ideas to a program officer

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.820
from the Mellon Foundation's
Scholarly Communications program,

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.880 position:56%
and this was the one that he picked.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.640
So, we were invited to develop
a proposal on what we could do

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.080
if they gave us some money
related to these three principles.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.860
And, what we came up with was
to convene a working group,

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.210
which I mentioned very
briefly at the beginning.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:13.540
So, and spoiler alert, we were
funded to convene a working group

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.100
that consist of librarians
from all different types

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.680
of academic libraries across
the country, and also in Canada.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.520
Consortional representatives
who purchase for state-wide

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.920
and regional consortia, and also
publishers from university presses

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.760
and non-profit scholarly
presses in particular.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.990
So that we could talk about the
potential that there is for eBooks

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.960
to be provided to academic
libraries meeting these principles,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.690
but also what kind of
threats there might be

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.080
to those university
presses business models,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.870
because they're frightened
by these ideas.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:49.550
They think that this might actually
be the thing that kills them.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.870
We know that a lot of providers
either aren't currently,

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.890
or are refusing to sell books
that meet these principles,

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.330
but we want to understand
the ones that do.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.820
How they get past that fear,

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.320
and how they get past the
challenges that they see?

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.970 position:56%
So, the working group has about 25
members, we met in-person last Fall,

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.950
and we've been having regular
conference calls throughout the

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.250
Winter and the Spring.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.530
We'll have another
meeting this coming Fall

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.250
to discuss the high level issues
around these three principles.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:23.410
The second part of the
grant is our research teams.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.660
We have four mayorly
focused research teams

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.540
that are addressing specific
applications of this project.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.900
The first is Licensing
Principles team,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.930
they're studying public
ally available licenses

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.610
from scholarly presses on what they
offer as their default conditions

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.370
when they sell large
eBook collections,

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.600
or eBooks individually
to academic libraries.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.660
The Course Use Research
Team addresses

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.360
that angry professor's email.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.020
How can you buy these
eBooks in a way

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.110
that they make sense
for classroom use?

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.970
The User Experience Research
Team is addressing the ways

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.210
that our libraries assess how
their users feel about eBooks.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:03.730
In particular, how much of our
current research climate --

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.360
you know, they'll do a
study, they'll run a survey,

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.650
and they'll say, "Oh, people
feel "x" about eBooks,

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.610 position:56%
and they won't differentiate between
whether that person is thinking

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.100
of an OverDrive book they
got from the Public Library,

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.030
or a Springer title that they were
able to download the complete pdf

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.750
with one click, or something
from ProQuest's collection,

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:27.660
where each book can act differently
from one page to the next.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.970
It might be my least favorite,
and finally, we have a Platforms

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.470
and Reservations Research team
which is addressing the ways

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.940
that libraries themselves
can make use

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.640
of those archival rights
that we've negotiated.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.000
And who can -- they can actually
book, store, and preserve content

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.700
for the long-term, but serve
it on a single platform

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.970
to their users no matter what
publisher that material came from.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.220
So the essential work of the
project is to gather information.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.680
We're trying to get a
sense of what's happening

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.500
in the market right now, and
also to start discussions

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.470
so that we can better understand
how this market is changing,

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.770
and how we can frankly
promote the ideas

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.300
that we think are really
essential for eBooks

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.460 position:56%
to be useful in an academic library.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.200
The final reaming portion

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.770
of the grant is a comprehensive
environmental scan of the market,

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.040
which is including
a literature review

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.030 position:56%
of what publishers are -- I'm sorry.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.730
A literature review, a
survey of publishers to find

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:29.340
out who is willing, or
already offering collections

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.460
on the terms that we're suggesting.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.300
And also to find out
for the publishers

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.140
that aren't offering
collections to these terms,

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.090
or who don't like the idea when we
propose it, what's stopping them,

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:39.740
and what could we do
to meet them halfway?

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.850
And also just to review the
current practices of libraries,

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:49.010
how many of them are trying to
provide content to their users

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.630 position:56%
under these parameters, and how many
of them are not concerned as we are?

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.190
And finally, each of the research
teams will also be writing,

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.740
publishing, and presenting
on their findings,

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.220 position:56%
but also on the additional questions

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.470
that are raised throughout
the work of the grant.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.680
And we're anticipating that we
will probably have more questions

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.150
than answers at the
end of this two years.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:12.880
But the final portion of the grant
is going to be an open conference

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.490
that we'll be hosting in
Charlotte in March of 2017.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.540
Each of the research teams will be
reporting out on their findings,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.590
the working group will
be reporting out on --

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:25.730
well, anything that we've managed
to answer, but more likely,

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.880 position:56%
most of the questions that we expect
everyone to be facing together.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.950
It will be free and
open to the public,

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.270
and I hope that everyone
will consider attending.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.510
Yeah, okay, thank you.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:41.070
[ Applause ]

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.890
&gt;&gt; We have some time
for some questions.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alison Bradley: Question, anyone?

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.770
&gt;&gt; Colin Rogister: All right.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.680
Thanks so much Rachel
for having me here today.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:36.630 position:56%
So excited to be here in The Library
of Congress, and talk about eBooks.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.790
And so, I just want to
talk a little bit today

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.890 position:56%
about the Open eBooks initiative,
but before I delve into Open eBooks,

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:49.660 position:56%
I kind of want to back up a few
years to where this all got started.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.080
So, the President in 2013

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.000
in June launched an
initiative called ConnectED

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.030
in Mooresville, North Carolina.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.180
The big goal of ConnectED was
kind of the yank our schools

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:06.080
and libraries into the 21st
Century, and build atop a lot

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.090
of the innovation that is -- had
gone on the EdTech sphere already,

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:17.060
and also on folks like, the Digital
Public Library have in libraries.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.800 position:56%
So, the big goal of ConnectED was --

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.710
is to connect 99% of students
in schools and libraries by 2018

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:26.870
to high speed broad-band and Wi-Fi.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:30.120
The good news is we're on
track to meet that goal,

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.900
already 20 million more students as
of last June have been connected.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.520
We'll see more data on the
Fall on where we are now,

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.290
but things are going well there.

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.760
And it's not just about
connectivity though,

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.830
the pillars of ConnectED are
connectivity, training, teachers

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:52.650 position:56%
and librarians to be able to utilize
the high speed Wi-Fi and technology,

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:57.450
and devices and quality
digital content.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:01.130
So, the President challenged
the FCC to step up

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.400
and help us meet the
connectivity goal.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.920 position:56%
They changed -- they did some e-rate
modernization, and raised the cap

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.620
on e-rate by 1.5 billion per year.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.550
Happy to say that it's going
well, and hundreds of millions

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.420
of dollars have already gone
out to schools and libraries.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.190
One quick -- one change that was
really important was making Wi-Fi

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.460
available for funding again.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.950
And we've seen a lot of
instances where schools

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.870
and libraries have gone from,
you know, 10% connectivity

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.730 position:56%
in the buildings, to 100% not today.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.010
Moving to training.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:45.930 position:56%
So, in terms of training, we kind
of addressed that with Future Ready.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.830
So, Future Ready is kind
of the train the trainer --

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.390
train the teacher and
educator type of thing.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.980
So, thousands of superintendents
have committed

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.220
to make their schools future ready,
and they have attended summits

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.240
from around the country to
receive high quality professional

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.170
development, and also
have a network of support.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.510
And really excited that
-- that that was --

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.810
we were able get it off the ground.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.370
The Alliance for Excellent
Education is a partner,

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:18.380
as well as many library
groups as well.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.470
And, so, moving to the device side,

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.100
the President challenged
device makers

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:29.550
to make devices price
competitive with a text book.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.110
And we have seen prices
drop significantly

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:36.450
over the past few years, obviously
some of that is Moore's law,

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:41.070 position:56%
but also some of it is, for example,
Microsoft made a big commitment

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:45.700
where they cut essentially the
Windows fee that would have gone

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.750 position:56%
into a computer out of the equation.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.430
So, schools got about 100
bucks off every single device,

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:56.220
and you've seen device prices
being driven down significantly.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.730
And you can get Chromebooks
or other tablets

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.280
for as cheap as $150.00 these days.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.260
So, and also Apple
stepped up in a big way,

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.910
and committed a hundred-million
dollars' worth of free IPads

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.820
and other software to
low-income schools.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.780
And those have already been rolled

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.900
out in schools all
across the country.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:21.610
So, the last piece is content,
that's what we'll talk about today,

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.540
high quality digital content.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:29.960
So, in challenging the
private sector we, you know,

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.770
we got a lot of different
commitments on the device

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.300
and connectivity side, but we
hadn't -- other than Safari Books,

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.280
hadn't gotten a lot on
the digital content front

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.020
until about a year ago.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:44.390
And that's when we worked
with The Institute of Museum

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.820
and Library Services, which
already had project --

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.880
as you mentioned, Library
Simplified underway

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.680
with New York Public Library.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:56.530
And we were just thinking about how
we could reach kids that, you know,

00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:00.550
buy books at home, don't have many
books at home, and provide them

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.200
with a scalable solution
that would allow them

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.580
to have a world class
library at their fingertips.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.770
So, working with Moira Marks,
who's here today, you know, they --

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.360
we utilized -- leveraged the
grant that they already had

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.000
with New York Public Library.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.650
Connected with the
Public Library of America,

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:25.180
who is providing content curation,
and a lot more to the project.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.300
As well as First Book, who's
providing authentication,

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:35.740
and Baker &amp; Taylor's kind of
serving the eBook from their server

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.510
to the students through the New
York Public Library developed app.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:44.250
So, that's kind of the genesis
of how it came together working

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:49.200
with Nancy Weiss in the Office
of Science and Technology policy,

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.650
and my others in Domestic
Policy Council.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:59.060 position:56%
And the partners kind of took this
from a nascent idea to a real thing,

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.240
and we were able to
work with publishers

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.850
to get thousands of eBooks donated.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:09.140
These are not, you know, just
the bottom of the shelf eBooks,

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.630
these are really top quality.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.580
You have things like
Twilight, which, you know,

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:18.430
the kids love apparently, and we
recently added National Geographic.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.360
So, there are a total of ten
publishers, and you know,

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.440
for example, Macmillan stepped
up in a big way and gave all

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.920
of their age appropriate
titles away to this project.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.320
So, that's just the start,

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.490
I just want to talk a little
bit about eligibility.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:40.120
So, first, this is the first
book criteria of eligibility,

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.160
so in order to become a
part of Open eBooks you have

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.460
to join the first book network.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.810
In order to join the first book
network, you essentially have

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.590
to serve low-income
students, or students in need.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:55.820
So, this reaches students in
Title I schools, students in --

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:59.060
libraries that e-rate
are above 90% --

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:03.640
percentage, and federally
qualified healthcares,

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.040
USDA Summer Food Service Programs.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.810
Students that primarily in
the Special Education classes,

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:15.550
or pull out and push
out, push in situations.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:20.400
And then also, schools that are
on military bases, or 70% or more

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.500
of the students in a school
are from military bases.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:30.180
So, a lot of eligibility, and just
one quick note on this, you know,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.310
when we started, that one

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.650
of the qualifications is you're
served by a homeless shelter.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:41.800
When we started there was kind
of some question about, you know,

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.720
will these kids have
devices at home?

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.500
You know, there's low
penetration, and that's true,

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.600
at the time that we started
the percentage was lower,

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:57.030
but recent data came out showing
that 85% of students in families

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:02.600
with kids ages 6-13 have
either a tablet or smartphone.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:09.860
And 90% of smartphones or
tablets can utilize Open eBook,

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.400
so Android, and IOS.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:18.130
And so, what that basically means
is that there's a huge proportion

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.660
of kids out there -- they're
eligible, and its tens of millions.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:28.530 position:56%
And one quick story, I was talking
to a principal last week in Brooklyn

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:32.960 position:56%
who has a student who came up to her
and said -- he's a homeless student,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.080
said that Open eBooks has
been a game changer for him.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.750
They had been sending home hardcopy
books to him, and he kind of moved

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:45.150
from shelter to shelter, but the
hardcopy books were stolen often.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.810
And kind of, counter
intuitively, but the --

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.610
actually having a tablet
is more safe be said,

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.670
because he can keep
it on his person.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:59.670
And so, he's checked out an
e-reader, and is able to read it

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:03.560
at home with his family, and
they're really excited about that.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.290
So, just wanted to give you a quick
overview of what it looks like,

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:12.200
this is an IPhone view of what
Open eBooks might look like.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.420
There are all different
categories, should mention

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.430
that DPLA has put together
a fantastic curation quarter

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:24.940
where they've gotten some of
the nation's top librarians

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:30.130
to basically take all of the
books the publishers donated,

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.440
and have curated them
into different swim lanes.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.280
You'll see here, informational
books,

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.690
National Geographic was a
recent addition to the group,

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:42.340
and we really have tried to --
we meaning the curation core,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.040
have really tried to make sure

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.620
that the books really matched the
students that were reading it.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.340
So, we've really tried to have a --
as many diverse titles as possible.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.960
They're encouraging publishers
to give more, they have books

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:01.240
in Spanish, and are working
towards having even more languages.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.690
So, this is just a quick
look of what it looks like,

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.250
and I just noticed that New
York Public Library is here,

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.110
Micah May has been spear heading it

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.190
from New York Public
Library's standpoint,

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.470
and put together a fantastic app.

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:16.930
You'll see here that it's you know,
very slick, you've got a catalog,

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:20.480
you've got a section of My Books
where you can store the books

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.680 position:56%
that are yours, that that you have
already checked out, you click read,

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.760
you return them when you're done.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.070
They're -- the cool thing about
this is that it's multi-use,

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:32.660
simultaneous, so you could return
that Ashley Bryan book, and decide,

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.650
oh, wait, I want to show it to my
brother, check it right back out.

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:40.810
So, although there is a limit of
ten, and the reason for that is,

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.150
they -- teachers and other
librarians have, kind of,

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.970
thought it would be too
much to have ten at a time.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:49.190
Although, it's a limit of ten,
it's essentially unlimited.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:54.930
So, that is Open eBooks, I want
to leave some times for questions,

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.320
but really want to encourage
you to, either go yourself

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.420
to Open eBooks.net and
take advantage of it,

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.130
or encourage your network to do so.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.330
We really think it's
a great resource,

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:09.040
and we've actually seen
incredible demand that's gone way

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.500
above our expectations.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:14.000
So, thanks so much, and
happy to take questions.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:19.850
&gt;&gt; Any questions?

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.150
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I'm sorry.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:27.130
I'm a public librarian at Prince
George's county, digital services.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.770
I want to tease out a bit the
notion of the known [inaudible]

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:32.550
versus open access to eBooks.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:35.070
I've seen the debates
on social media

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:38.550
and I'm still not totally convinced

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:42.710
that you know everyone
has access to a device.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:46.120
I just wanted to hear
some further --

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:50.390
&gt;&gt; Colin Rogister: Sure, no I
mean, and that's definitely true.

00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:53.010
I think the -- what
the partners wanted

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:57.780
to do here is provide a
great resource to those kids

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.750
that do have access to devices.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:03.390
So, although, you know, they
essentially didn't want to wait

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.700
until there's 100% device
penetration to move.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:11.140
And you know, for kids like the
homeless student in Brooklyn,

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:16.420
who were able to checkout e-readers
can be a huge plus to them.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.190
I do -- would say that, you know,

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:22.340
there's a lot of research
showing that, you know,

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:27.210
in a very few years we might
be at 100% penetration.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:32.140
And the New York Public
Library is working --

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.790
what they're developers are
working on a web based version,

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:40.130
which should open it up even more,
so just beyond the Android and IOS,

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.340
so that essentially you
can have it on any device,

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.190
any laptop, any computer.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.490
So, that's a great question,

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.510
and something that we're
certainly working on.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.380
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.680
Sure, hey.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Micha May: So, I'll jump in here.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.850
I think, you know, [inaudible] I
couldn't, can't resist, you know,

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.940
keep my mouth shut or whatever.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.950
But I guess, one thing that
I thought about a lot is,

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:04.330
I think that in device lending
space it's a very much a time

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:05.900
of experimentation, right?

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:11.260
You see many schools going to one
to one, and you see others not.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.800
And you know, within the
New York City Department

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:17.320
of Education there is a wide
variety of experiments being run,

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.050 position:56%
and evaluation of those experiments.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.060
And I think that has
made sense to me, I mean,

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.160
part of it isn't just
the financial fact of it,

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.460
we don't have a magic wand

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.000
to buy everyone a device,
we couldn't do that.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.740
And we somehow created and
discovered a magic wand

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.040
to give everyone content,
and that's pretty cool.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.960
But further than that I think
it makes sense in a way to start

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.350
with content first, and if you have
devices and you have nothing to put

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.710
on them, which I think is
sometimes a problem, right?

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.490
And we've got a device for
every student in our school,

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.040
but like literally
what do we put on it?

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.340
And so, in a way you want

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.130
to have the content solution there
first while how devices will be

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.650
provisioned is still a
landscape of experimentation,

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:54.020
and a thousand flowers
are blooming in the space.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.600
So, that all of those experiments
can test, and then give us feedback

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.510
about how best to deliver
the content.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:02.320 position:56%
So, if you're going to do one first,
I think it makes sense to start

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.560
with content, and I think we all
very much agree that, you know,

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.530
getting devices and
[inaudible] is still a challenge,

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.430
and something we probably
need to work on.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.040
And I would say there's a positive
reinforcement there, right?

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.950
If you're considering providing
devices, and there's nothing to put

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.810
on them, it's not a
very compliant case.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.300
If you're considering
providing devices and you say,

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.120
and we can give every
student this great, you know,

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.160
collection of eBooks along with
other educational software,

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.400
then it makes a lot more
sense to make an investment.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.460 position:56%
So, hopefully having a content
solution in place will actually help

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.440
to drive positive devicing option.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.160
Do you think there's
other, you know,

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.040
angles or questions we're missing?

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.150
&gt;&gt; I'm not really either
[inaudible],

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:43.460
but I -- the administrators in
my organization are, you know,

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.780
we're a public library, so we're
already provided the access

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:52.040
to eBooks in some sense
with or without the reader.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.420
Having a reader to me, or having
a device may be more important.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:02.380
I do see your point about the
content first solution, thanks.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.680
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.720
&gt;&gt; Thanks James that
was a great question.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.280
Any other questions?

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.580
&gt;&gt; Colin Rogister: Yes?

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.770
&gt;&gt; Big supporter about the eBooks,
and when it first rolled out I got

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:14.960
in a couple of [inaudible] to
push and say, this is great,

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.440
and incidentally with the
simultaneous access wouldn't it be

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.040
great if we could all offer that?

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.300
I think it's a pretty serious
push back on something,

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:29.580
and that was like really saying,
I can't go to my coach and say,

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.550
I'm sorry, you're just not
cool right now at these books.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.200
And say we won't adopt at all,

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.920
because we use them
to serve everybody.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.220
At some point at talking point,

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.040
what do we say back next time
somebody says that to me?

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.140
&gt;&gt; Colin Rogister: Sure, I mean,
I think that the way we were able

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.550
to make this work with
publishers was to have it go

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.660
through the First Book Network.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:39:00.630 position:56%
And so, you know, although we are
working on a solution that all kids,

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:06.130
and all families can access,
right now this is where we stand,

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:12.460
and you know, I think it's a tough
message to say, but essentially,

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:16.220
you know, I think you can -- if
you're in a library you can talk

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.590
about all the library books
that you have there available.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:22.180
I mean, this is certainly
seen as a supplemental program

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.710
that builds upon the
-- a top the great work

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.010
that libraries already have.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.310
Michah, do you want to jump in?

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.340
&gt;&gt; Michah May: Yeah, I think I
might have a punch counter to that

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.740
which is, you know, libraries
I think, even schools are used

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.560
to giving some special
benefits to low-income, right?

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.220
We have free lunch, there's
Title I, it's very much done,

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.740
and libraries we try to
really hard to say it's equal,

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.220
and everyone has access
to everything.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.600
And I guess there's a question,
if you have the ability

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.100
to give special access to a limited
population, do you want to do that,

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.400
even though you can
give to everyone?

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.080
And as a thought experiment you
might ask these directors, okay,

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.790
if [inaudible] system, if you have,
you know, give me seven branches,

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:57.560
a few of them fall [inaudible].

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.140
To get you new funding
we have to apply,

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.130
administrate that community
as low-income.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:05.400
So do we not do that application,
because every branch can't have it?

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.280
No, we take it where
we can get it, right,

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.430
and in some ways this is
analogous, if you have a resource

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:16.160 position:56%
that can only -- think, publishers
are not going to give away the books

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.460 position:56%
to everyone, how could they do that?

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.030
So, if you have a resource that's
available only to low-income,

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:22.080
just in the same way that you know,

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:26.170
that we apply for [inaudible]
funding only for the branches

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:30.150
that qualify, I would say that
is a benefit to the library's

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.130
in the system that potentially
you know, allows us to reinvest

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.430
in [inaudible] serving
those who don't qualify.

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Blackwell: Well
and we've targeted groups

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.290
that can't use it, you know --

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:37.590
&gt;&gt; Colin Rogister:
There you go, yeah.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:38.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Blackwell:
Head Start Kids.

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.270
Maryland has what we
call juvie centers,

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:43.220
which is early child
literacy, kids in poverty.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:47.060
Targeted those kids who
have homeless backgrounds,

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.770
so we've been doing outreach
especially with the schools

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.800
to target it, but I just, you
know, wanted to hear what you'd say

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.100
to that, because that
doesn't get any push back.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.420
&gt;&gt; Rachel Frick: We all have
the same goal, we want to spark

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.040
that lifetime love for any reading,

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.960
we want to grow our
universal leaders, and this is

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.260
yet another tool in our
toolkit that allows us

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.560
to have a little bit
more, I guess [inaudible].

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:16.070
So, I just wanted to say just
kind of, once again to point out,

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:19.500
Open eBooks is really the
first production ready to point

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:24.250
at assembly, and I don't
take enough time to say that.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.600
And I think simply as part
of this whole kind of,

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.100
one of the main ingredients
in increasing our bandwidth

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.400 position:56%
to be more powerful with our eBooks.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.110
Because I think there's some
development simply so that

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:36.520
if there is a child at their public
library, and is authenticated

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.810
with their public library, and then
they have another authentication

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:41.250
through eBooks, they can have
access to multiple libraries

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.070
through this one particular app.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:49.080
So, I think that's the
direction we're going,

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.010
and like any project
Open eBooks is --

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:58.140
we're committed for a few
years to work together on this,

00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.440
this is our first iteration.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.740
This is the first deployment
[inaudible] is SimplyE, you know,

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.040
this is the first roll out of the
first collection of the eBooks,

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.940
so if anybody has any
questions, comments,

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.550
suggestions for partners,
and ways to improve

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.360 position:56%
and grow this, it's really welcomed.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.370
So, yes, you have a question?

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:15.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yes. Related to that, how open
is First Book to doing this on mass?

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:20.510
So, you know, as a large library
system we qualified easily,

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:24.910
it wasn't a problem, I was
able to order some licenses.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:27.930
People aren't really
asking for it though,

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.920
we do library registration drives
for our kindergarteners every year,

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.350
couldn't we just hand them
a [inaudible] access code.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.730
&gt;&gt; Rachel Frick: When you
say on mass, how many?

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:37.420
&gt;&gt; 20,000?

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.290
&gt;&gt; Rachel Frick: Last time
we had to get the camera,

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.620
it does not [inaudible] voice.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.070
20,000?

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:43.370
&gt;&gt; It would be in the thousands.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:44.960
&gt;&gt; Rachel Frick: I would say
let's talk to First Book,

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.850
because I think we want
to make sure that kids

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:52.220
that are qualified are
getting those particular codes,

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.520
and we've worked on that.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.820
We have worked with First Book
on large [inaudible] codes,

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.790
but we want to connect the kids
that qualify to those programs,

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:03.810
but we also -- it's not just I
guess, handing out the codes,

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:08.510
but we want to make sure that
we connect with the parents,

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:11.260 position:56%
download the app, and make sure that
they know how to work through it,

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.010
so we have successful book reading
experience at the end of that.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.410
&gt;&gt; And I think they need a
packet to go with that library --

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:19.670
&gt;&gt; Rachel Frick: They have a parent
letter, but you know, we have --

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:21.440
our friends at First Book
would love to work with you

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.740
on that type of large scale Lola.

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.040
So, yes, let's connect,
and [inaudible].

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.230
&gt;&gt; Colin Rogister: And your
question actually brought up --

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:29.390
reminded me of something that's
incredibly important as part

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.420
of ConnectED, which is the
ConnectED Library Challenge,

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.520
which IMLS is spear heading.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.300
And that is essentially,
the idea of, you know,

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.310
not every kid has a
library card today.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:44.550
When I taught we had to do a
trip to the library, you know,

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:45.860
rent a bus and all of that.

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.400
Why can't we just have
the kid, when they show

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.100
up for school the first
day, get a library card?

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:55.100
And so, you know, for example
in D.C. they made the commitment

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:59.070
to the ConnectED Library Challenge,
they went from about 5,000 students

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.770
to 70,000 students
having library cards.

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:06.810
So, it's a huge jump, and
so, yeah, and I also wanted

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.630
to mention two other initiatives,
ConnectHome and ConnectAll,

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:14.080
that if you have questions about
I'd be happy to talk to after.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.920 position:56%
ConnectAll is something that's
recently announced by the President,

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:24.500
both of them try to reach kids
at home to provide more access

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.040
to the internet essentially.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.550
And ConnectHome is through
housing developments,

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.560
and ConnectAll is essentially
all Americans,

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.230
so it's not necessarily just kids.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:39.680 position:56%
And it's kind of, we're working with
a lot of different entities on that.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.890
One big change that kind of
spurred this was the modernization

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:48.040
of the Lifeline program, which
will now allow low-income Americans

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:53.280
to use Lifeline for broadband.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.580
&gt;&gt; Rachel Frick: Last question.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.910
&gt;&gt; What is the status of the
Connected Library Challenge?

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.370
About a month ago -- we're
working with our schools,

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:03.340
we got a new 503 kids card app
that massively increase the number

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.750
of young kids with cards.

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:07.300 position:56%
So, we said, hey, we want to be part
of the Library Connected Challenge,

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.460
and got into that, okay that's
great, but we're kind of you know,

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.040
in a holding pattern right now,

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.410
because so many people
recently wanted to join,

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:16.090
I just wanted to know,
where we might be with that?

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Colin Rogister: Okay, well, I
think we should definitely follow-up

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.870
with you if you haven't
heard back yet.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:27.100
The ULC is working with IMLS on
kind of, supporting folks that want

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:32.200
to make the pledge, and what
we've had to date, you know,

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.200
hundreds of thousands of kids
have gotten library cards.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.950 position:56%
We're gathering the data from
librarians to all across the country

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.060
to try to aggregate that.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:45.140
Nancy Weiss is here, do you
want to comment to that?

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:47.130
&gt;&gt; Nancy Weiss: Yeah,
yeah, we talked about it,

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.070 position:56%
and we also have some resources, and
more [inaudible] to speak as well,

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:51.680
and [inaudible] coming out.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.250
But perhaps we can
follow-up on that.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:57.870
&gt;&gt; Rachel Frick: In order to keep
on us on track here on the program

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:01.040
with the program [inaudible]
it's 2:30, right?

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.340
Or am I reading my clock wrong?

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:07.140
And it's time for a break, so if
you have any additional questions,

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.440
please ask our speakers,
and please [inaudible].

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.310
[ Applause ]

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:12.880
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library
