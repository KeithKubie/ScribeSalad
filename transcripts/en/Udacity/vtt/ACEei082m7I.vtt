00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.469
When building an app that uses
the Google services, you'll generally

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.820
use an Asynchronous Programing Model
that looks a little bit like this.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.300
In the onCreate of your activity,
you create a Google API client.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.020
And then in the onStart
of your activity,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.490
you connect that Google API
client to the relevant APIs.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.660
In this case Location Services.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.870
In order to use this,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.840
you're going to need to override
a number of different methods.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.750
One is OnConnectionFailed,
which the services will

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.290
call whenever the connection drops and
you need to handle what to do.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.600
Generally just reconnecting.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.940
One is OnConnectionSuspended, which is
very similar to OnConnectionFailed and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.710
will be called if the connection gets
suspended but not necessarily broken.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.230
And you might want to
cache some information.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.800
When you succeed in making
a connection to Location Services,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.760
Location services calls
back to OnConnected,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.630
telling you that you're now
connected to the services.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.465
And in the case of
something like location,

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:58.100
you'll then create a LocationRequest.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.350
They had passed to Location Services
to get your location details back.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.120
And it would call you back
with OnLocationChanged,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.510
letting you know that your location
request details have changed,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.530
and there's new location
information available to you.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.370
And you'll get a Location object,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.660
which you can then use
to write to your screen.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.790
So in the application that we just saw,
that location object included

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.180
a latitude, and I was able to update
my screen and write the latitude to it.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.520
Now this programming model isn't
just limited to location services.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.230
As I've said, many of the services that
you'll be using during this course

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.600
follow a very similar
programming model to this.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.660
You're going to have an OnCreate and
an OnStart.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.970
You're going to have a GoogleApiClient
that you connect to the services that

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.050
you want to use.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.910
And then you have to
handle certain overrides.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.850
Usually, they'll be OnConnectionFailed,
OnConnectionSuspended, OnConnected, and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.460
then an override that's specific
to the services that you're using.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.720
In this case, it's OnLocationChanged for
location services.
