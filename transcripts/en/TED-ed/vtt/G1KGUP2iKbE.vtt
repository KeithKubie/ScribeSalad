00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:19.302
Optics, or the enhancement of our natural vision,

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:23.718
has been one of the biggest catalysts for science over the past 500 years,

00:00:23.718 --> 00:00:30.901
Interestingly, it wasn't scientific interest, but more practical matters that led to the initial advancements in optics,

00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:35.901
starting around 1440 when Johannes Gutenberg invented his printing press.

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:39.235
In short order, books, which had been a rarity,

00:00:39.235 --> 00:00:41.887
were now becoming a widespread phenomenon.

00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:45.435
All that new reading material meant more knowledge was circulating,

00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:48.868
but it also meant that more people were straining their eyes,

00:00:48.868 --> 00:00:51.518
likely as they read by candlelight.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:55.268
And while spectacles had been invented in Italy around 1286,

00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:59.302
the need for reading glasses increased substantially.

00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:02.586
Now that people could use lenses to see things more clearly,

00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:09.367
they started wondering if vision could be enhanced to see things the human eye couldn't perceive by its own devices.

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:16.451
Robert Hooke pursued microscopy, and 1665 he published his findings of worlds inside worlds,

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:21.049
which he called "cells" in the book "Micrographia."

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.151
At the other end of the spectrum,

00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:25.835
Galileo innovated with telescopic lenses,

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:33.351
and in 1609, he had refined a telescope until he had an instrument powerful enough to see distant objects in the sky

00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:37.435
with an accuracy no one had before him.

00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:39.816
He found that the moon had craters and mountains,

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:47.151
that Jupiter had moons of its own, and the whole system governing the earth and space was brought into question.

00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:50.552
Not everyone was thrilled with all the things Galileo saw though.

00:01:50.552 --> 00:01:55.551
For instance, it was taught at the time that the moon was a perfectly smooth sphere.

00:01:55.551 --> 00:02:00.735
Yet here was visual proof that was awfully hard to discount.

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:07.567
Upon finding moons around Jupiter, he also verified what Johannes Kepler had surmised:

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:10.451
that the earth was not the center of the universe,

00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:14.151
dispelling another central dogma of Galileo's day.

00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:17.001
Then almost exactly a year after Galileo died,

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.666
Isaac Newton was born.

00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:22.450
A lot that had been unknown was visible by now,

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.100
but much of it was simply the foundation for further questions.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.136
What was light anyway? And color, for that matter?

00:02:31.136 --> 00:02:34.268
What were the laws that governed the earth, and the heavens?

00:02:34.268 --> 00:02:37.552
And could we capture them through keen observation?

00:02:37.552 --> 00:02:40.368
Newton experimented extensively with optics,

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:43.366
and came to understand light as something of substance,

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:47.719
and colors as components of light at different frequencies.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:53.517
Before Newton, people widely believed that the color was due to different amounts of light,

00:02:53.517 --> 00:02:57.237
with red being lots of light, and blue being mostly dark.

00:02:57.237 --> 00:03:03.984
Newton's prism experiments showed that white light could not only be broken into its component colors with one prism,

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:08.785
but that a second lens could recompose those colors back into white light again,

00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:14.001
thus showing that color was a matter of light's refraction rather than how light or dark it was.

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:18.450
Newton's studies of optics led to the development of the reflecting telescope.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.534
This, together with his study of planetary motion, led to his theory of gravitation,

00:03:23.534 --> 00:03:28.184
one of the world's greatest examples of learning to see something invisible

00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:31.401
by observing its effect on things that are visible.

00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:35.052
So fast forward a few hundred years, and here we stand.

00:03:35.052 --> 00:03:40.700
We've evolved from a single lens to optics that reveal the birth of a star in another galaxy,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.218
or a child developing in the womb,

00:03:43.218 --> 00:03:46.151
or an electron whirling around an atom.

00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:53.951
At a time when so much is visible, how we see the world around us matters even more than what we see.

00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:58.851
Will we see a world where everything important has already been discovered?

00:03:58.851 --> 00:04:06.016
Or will we see one in which yesterday's discoveries are but a doorway to the breakthroughs of tomorrow?
