00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The restoring force must grow.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In fact the restoring force has to be proportional to this displacement from equilibrium.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Only then will we have our ball making a back and forth motions, our spring making up and down

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
motions, and our pendulums swinging with equal time intervals between well swings or

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
bounces up and down or back and forth rolling.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's take a deeper look at one of these examples--specifically, the mass on the spring.
