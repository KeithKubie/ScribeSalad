have a choice so so high school students

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
have a choice so so high school students
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.710

in some cities get matched to to a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720
in some cities get matched to to a
 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.210
in some cities get matched to to a
choice system where they submit

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220

preferences and the schools have
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.499
preferences and the schools have
requirements or perhaps preferences also

and and then some decisions are made

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
and and then some decisions are made
 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.219
and and then some decisions are made
about who goes where and that's what

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
about who goes where and that's what
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.719
about who goes where and that's what
matching is about it's about who gets

matching is about it's about who gets
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.899
matching is about it's about who gets
what and we try to in school choice we

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
what and we try to in school choice we
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.280
what and we try to in school choice we
try to make that happen in a way that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
try to make that happen in a way that
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990
try to make that happen in a way that
that's efficient that doesn't send

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
that's efficient that doesn't send
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.120
that's efficient that doesn't send
people to schools that they would rather

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
people to schools that they would rather
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.120
people to schools that they would rather
swap with with other people and if the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
swap with with other people and if the
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.149
swap with with other people and if the
schools would allow them and if your

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159
schools would allow them and if your
 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.380
schools would allow them and if your
students are in high school then they're

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390
students are in high school then they're
 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.060
students are in high school then they're
going to go through many matching

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070
going to go through many matching
 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.039

work has a lot of practical applications
 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.780
work has a lot of practical applications
in our lives school applications may be

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790

you driven as an economist by these

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
you driven as an economist by these
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.580
you driven as an economist by these
questions by applying your theories to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
questions by applying your theories to
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.880
questions by applying your theories to
real life yeah economics is about real

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
real life yeah economics is about real
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.070
real life yeah economics is about real
life so so I'm very interested in that

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080
life so so I'm very interested in that
 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.770
life so so I'm very interested in that
and when you recruit postdocs and

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780
and when you recruit postdocs and
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.930
and when you recruit postdocs and
students

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940
students
 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.390
students
you apply the same theories well my

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400
you apply the same theories well my
 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.820
you apply the same theories well my
postdocs are all are all different and

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830
postdocs are all are all different and
 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.550
postdocs are all are all different and
but they're all interested in economics

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560
but they're all interested in economics
 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.640
but they're all interested in economics
and how it shapes our lives and how we

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650
and how it shapes our lives and how we
 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.590
and how it shapes our lives and how we
can learn more about it you know we we

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600
can learn more about it you know we we
 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.300
can learn more about it you know we we
want to try to make things better but we

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310
want to try to make things better but we
 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.490
want to try to make things better but we
also want to learn to understand that

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500
also want to learn to understand that
 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.170
also want to learn to understand that
those are those are related tasks

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180
those are those are related tasks
 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.550
those are those are related tasks
different postdocs you know have

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560
different postdocs you know have
 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.740
different postdocs you know have
different points of view yeah indeed so

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750
different points of view yeah indeed so
 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.510
different points of view yeah indeed so
as a young person what inspired you to

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520
as a young person what inspired you to
 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.810
as a young person what inspired you to
become an economist well I didn't become

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820
become an economist well I didn't become
 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.250
become an economist well I didn't become
an economist until till rather late in

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260
an economist until till rather late in
 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.740
an economist until till rather late in
life my PhD is in operations research I

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750
life my PhD is in operations research I
 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.660
life my PhD is in operations research I
was interested in making things work

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670
was interested in making things work
 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.210
was interested in making things work
better and using mathematics to help do

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220
better and using mathematics to help do
 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.400
better and using mathematics to help do
that and so that's what I operations

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410
that and so that's what I operations
 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.440
that and so that's what I operations
research is what I studied as an

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450
research is what I studied as an
 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.290
research is what I studied as an
undergraduate and as a graduate student

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300
undergraduate and as a graduate student
 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.360
undergraduate and as a graduate student
but the kinds of things that I found

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370
but the kinds of things that I found
 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.040
but the kinds of things that I found
myself interested in trying to

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050
myself interested in trying to
 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.930
myself interested in trying to
understand and try to make work better

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940
understand and try to make work better
 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.940
understand and try to make work better
wear things that involved people and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950
wear things that involved people and
 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.580
wear things that involved people and
that led me to economics and today you

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590
that led me to economics and today you
 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.070
that led me to economics and today you
teach a course called experimental

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080
teach a course called experimental
 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.110
teach a course called experimental
economics is that what you're talking

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120
economics is that what you're talking
 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.460
economics is that what you're talking
about now is oh can you tell us more

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470
about now is oh can you tell us more
