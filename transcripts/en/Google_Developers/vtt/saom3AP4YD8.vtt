JANA MOUDRA: Hi.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.290
My name is Jana Moudra, and
I'm a co-founder of Juicymo.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.030
I love to talk about technology.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.300
So this is the reason why I'm
a Google Developer Expert.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.200
I grew up on the web.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.270
At first, I started with design.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.980
And then I just started coding.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.970
It was difficult to me at first
but then I started to love it.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.440
And now it's my dream job.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.070
Later, I explored Android,
the green little robot.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.350
And I decided to explore
it because I wanted

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.200
to create a mobile app, which
I can share with the world

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.910
and show it to my friends.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.230
So I started, and you can
imagine how I enjoy that.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.930
Nothing is impossible in
this world, believe me.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.510
I really wanted to start using
my [INAUDIBLE] language called

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.760
Dart with a service
called Firebase.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.980
There was no library to do so.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.130
So I implemented it.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.670
And a couple of months later,
Google merged my repository

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.830
into their own.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.000
So my library became official.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.880
And then I could
share how to build

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.190
great apps with
Dart and Firebase

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.260
under official Dart conference.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.210
And that's very motivating.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.010
I get a lot of very
interesting opportunities.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.959
I could organize even the GDC.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.560
Or as a member of Google
Developer Expert program,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.590
I could meet lots of
very inspiring developers

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.200
all around the world,
and create new friends.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.930
I love how tech is not
just about programming.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.770
You can do beautiful designs
or marketing for your product.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.750
And if you think
that you as a woman

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.480
will have difficulty
in tech then Google

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.700
thinks of you with the program
called Women Techmaker.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.150
Becoming a part of the tech
community is really easy.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.800
It was one of the best
things I've ever made.
