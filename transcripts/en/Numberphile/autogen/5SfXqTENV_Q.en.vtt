now in the middle of the video we will

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199
now in the middle of the video we will
 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.960
now in the middle of the video we will
encounter some of that heavy artillery

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
encounter some of that heavy artillery
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.300
encounter some of that heavy artillery
but not for too long and stick with us

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
but not for too long and stick with us
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.250

could take you know our Pentagon doesn't
have to be a regular anything here's the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
have to be a regular anything here's the
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.819
have to be a regular anything here's the
Pentagon and we take a number

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
Pentagon and we take a number
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.069
Pentagon and we take a number
I don't know number six and now we want

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079
I don't know number six and now we want
 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.889
I don't know number six and now we want
to cut this Pentagon into six pieces and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
to cut this Pentagon into six pieces and
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.840
to cut this Pentagon into six pieces and
the condition is that the six pieces

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850
the condition is that the six pieces
 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.599
the condition is that the six pieces
have the same area which is easy so for

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609
have the same area which is easy so for
 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.640
have the same area which is easy so for
example if you want to cut it into six

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
example if you want to cut it into six
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.770
example if you want to cut it into six
pieces of equal area we could just slide

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780
pieces of equal area we could just slide
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.230
pieces of equal area we could just slide
over and could say you know this is one

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
over and could say you know this is one
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.940

drawing isn't good but I think the idea

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
drawing isn't good but I think the idea
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.749
drawing isn't good but I think the idea
should work out but these pieces will

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
should work out but these pieces will
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.390
should work out but these pieces will
have quite different perimeter I think

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
have quite different perimeter I think
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.010
have quite different perimeter I think
it's quite obvious that even if we

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
it's quite obvious that even if we
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.929
it's quite obvious that even if we
really make them equal area they will

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
really make them equal area they will
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.609
really make them equal area they will
have different parameter and the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
have different parameter and the
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.710
have different parameter and the
question is whether you know for any

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
question is whether you know for any
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.670
question is whether you know for any
polygon and any number like six I'll try

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
polygon and any number like six I'll try
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.380
polygon and any number like six I'll try
it again whether there's a different way

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
it again whether there's a different way
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.539
it again whether there's a different way
to cut it up have something like like

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
to cut it up have something like like
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.870
to cut it up have something like like
this one to six pieces and we want to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
this one to six pieces and we want to
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.420
this one to six pieces and we want to
have them equal area and equal perimeter

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
have them equal area and equal perimeter
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.340
have them equal area and equal perimeter
at the same time it seems that this

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
at the same time it seems that this
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.200
at the same time it seems that this
should be possible it's not that easy to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210
should be possible it's not that easy to
 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.139
should be possible it's not that easy to
work out examples let's say even not a

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
work out examples let's say even not a
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.690
work out examples let's say even not a
Pentagon let's take a triangle and you

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
Pentagon let's take a triangle and you
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.550
Pentagon let's take a triangle and you
want to take this triangle and cut it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
want to take this triangle and cut it
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.429
want to take this triangle and cut it
into three pieces equal area equal

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
into three pieces equal area equal
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.749
into three pieces equal area equal
perimeter it's not so clear no actually

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
perimeter it's not so clear no actually
 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.969
perimeter it's not so clear no actually
there's three mathematicians who then

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979
there's three mathematicians who then
 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.679
there's three mathematicians who then
published a paper in advances in

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689
published a paper in advances in
 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.440
published a paper in advances in
mathematics proving this problem but

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
mathematics proving this problem but
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.389
mathematics proving this problem but
only for this special case of three

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
only for this special case of three
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.510
only for this special case of three
pieces and all kinds of machinery

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
pieces and all kinds of machinery
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.110
pieces and all kinds of machinery
involved and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120
involved and
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.360
involved and
harmless-looking problem so I think what

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370
harmless-looking problem so I think what
 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.720
harmless-looking problem so I think what
we should do here is solve the problem

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730
we should do here is solve the problem
 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.360
we should do here is solve the problem
but for N equals two just to see that

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370
but for N equals two just to see that
 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.180
but for N equals two just to see that
given a polygon why can we cut it into

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190
given a polygon why can we cut it into
 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.000
given a polygon why can we cut it into
two pieces of equal area and equal

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010
two pieces of equal area and equal
 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.340
two pieces of equal area and equal
perimeter so we take a polygon again and

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350
perimeter so we take a polygon again and
 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.470
perimeter so we take a polygon again and
I don't know if there is one and we want

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480
I don't know if there is one and we want
 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.780
I don't know if there is one and we want
to cut it into T and to piece two pieces

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790
to cut it into T and to piece two pieces
 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.930
to cut it into T and to piece two pieces
of equal area and equal parameter so the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940
of equal area and equal parameter so the
 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.880
of equal area and equal parameter so the
pieces have to be convex so there's no

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
pieces have to be convex so there's no
 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.699
pieces have to be convex so there's no
in dentin or so so if I cut something

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709
in dentin or so so if I cut something
 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.309
in dentin or so so if I cut something
into two pieces of two convex pieces

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319
into two pieces of two convex pieces
 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.770
into two pieces of two convex pieces
then this just means cutting by a line

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780
 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.780
no curved lines are not allowed because

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790
no curved lines are not allowed because
 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.580
no curved lines are not allowed because
if you use a curved lines then on one

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590
if you use a curved lines then on one
 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.550
if you use a curved lines then on one
side of the curve it's not connects so

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560
side of the curve it's not connects so
 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.009
side of the curve it's not connects so
it has to be really straight lines let's

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019
it has to be really straight lines let's
 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.990
it has to be really straight lines let's
just do a vertical line and I'll do the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000
just do a vertical line and I'll do the
 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.420
just do a vertical line and I'll do the
vertical line so that we have equal area

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430
vertical line so that we have equal area
 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.880
vertical line so that we have equal area
let's assume that's it all right but now

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890
let's assume that's it all right but now
 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.509
let's assume that's it all right but now
I think this left side will have larger

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519
I think this left side will have larger
 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.539
I think this left side will have larger
perimeter than the right side okay and

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549
perimeter than the right side okay and
 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.030
perimeter than the right side okay and
now the trick is what we do is we rotate

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040
now the trick is what we do is we rotate
 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.150
now the trick is what we do is we rotate
this line which means we can rotate it

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160
this line which means we can rotate it
 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.759
this line which means we can rotate it
in such a way that at every single

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769
in such a way that at every single
 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.880
in such a way that at every single
moment there's the same area on the left

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890
moment there's the same area on the left
 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.250
moment there's the same area on the left
side and on the right side all right and

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260
side and on the right side all right and
 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.220
side and on the right side all right and
while we rotate it so the next one will

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230
while we rotate it so the next one will
 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.900
while we rotate it so the next one will
be here perhaps and next one will be

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910
be here perhaps and next one will be
 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.539
be here perhaps and next one will be
here always the same area but the

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549
here always the same area but the
 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.680
here always the same area but the
perimeters will change and the perimeter

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690
perimeters will change and the perimeter
 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.990
perimeters will change and the perimeter
will change continuously it may be that

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000
will change continuously it may be that
 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.699
will change continuously it may be that
on the left side the perimeter gets

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709
on the left side the perimeter gets
 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.590
on the left side the perimeter gets
larger on the right side it gets smaller

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600
larger on the right side it gets smaller
 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.229
larger on the right side it gets smaller
so what we can do is look at the

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239
so what we can do is look at the
 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.300
so what we can do is look at the
quantity which just says the perimeter

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310
quantity which just says the perimeter
 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.250
quantity which just says the perimeter
on the left side minus the perimeter on

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260
on the left side minus the perimeter on
 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.110
on the left side minus the perimeter on
the right side and at the beginning with

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120
the right side and at the beginning with
 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.960
the right side and at the beginning with
a vertical line perimeter on the left

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970
a vertical line perimeter on the left
 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.789
a vertical line perimeter on the left
side was larger than on the right side

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799
side was larger than on the right side
 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.979
side was larger than on the right side
so the difference is positive and now we

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989
so the difference is positive and now we
 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.620
so the difference is positive and now we
rotate and while we rotate the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630
rotate and while we rotate the
 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.380
rotate and while we rotate the
perimeters change and once we've rotated

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390
perimeters change and once we've rotated
 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.410
perimeters change and once we've rotated
180 degrees we have the same vertical

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420
180 degrees we have the same vertical
 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.990
180 degrees we have the same vertical
line again but left and right have

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000
line again but left and right have
 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.509
line again but left and right have
interchanged and which means this

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519
interchanged and which means this
 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.270
interchanged and which means this
difference of perimeter to the left -

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280
difference of perimeter to the left -
 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.699
difference of perimeter to the left -
perimeter to the right has changed to

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709
perimeter to the right has changed to
 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.250
perimeter to the right has changed to
its negative value so if in the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260
its negative value so if in the
 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.740
its negative value so if in the
beginning this was three inches long

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750
beginning this was three inches long
 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.800
beginning this was three inches long
on the left side then in the end it's

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810
on the left side then in the end it's
 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.420
on the left side then in the end it's
three inches longer on the right side

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430
three inches longer on the right side
 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.870
three inches longer on the right side
and somewhere in between it must have

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880
and somewhere in between it must have
 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.840
and somewhere in between it must have
been equal end of proof so what have we

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850
been equal end of proof so what have we
 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.060
been equal end of proof so what have we
used we've used that these quantities

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070
used we've used that these quantities
 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.000
used we've used that these quantities
changed continuously and you have to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010
changed continuously and you have to
 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.000
changed continuously and you have to
think about it a bit that if you rotate

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010
think about it a bit that if you rotate
 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.490
think about it a bit that if you rotate
the perimeter changes continuously but

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500
the perimeter changes continuously but
 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.750
the perimeter changes continuously but
that's true and we've used a theorem

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760
that's true and we've used a theorem
 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.300
that's true and we've used a theorem
that people learn in high school and

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310
that people learn in high school and
 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.590
that people learn in high school and
capitalist classes called the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600
capitalist classes called the

intermediate value theorem which just

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330
intermediate value theorem which just
 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.500
intermediate value theorem which just
says that if you have a quantity that

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510
says that if you have a quantity that
 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.540
says that if you have a quantity that
changes from a positive value to a

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550
changes from a positive value to a
 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.120
changes from a positive value to a
negative value and if the change is

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130
negative value and if the change is
 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.790
negative value and if the change is
continuous then somewhere in between you

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800
continuous then somewhere in between you
 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.800
continuous then somewhere in between you
get zero and my point is that this is

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810
get zero and my point is that this is
 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.540
get zero and my point is that this is
not a theorem of calculus

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550
not a theorem of calculus
 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.180
not a theorem of calculus
it's a topology theorem because it's not

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190
it's a topology theorem because it's not
 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.440
it's a topology theorem because it's not
important that the quantities change

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450
important that the quantities change
 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.170
important that the quantities change
smoothly and probably they don't it's

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180
smoothly and probably they don't it's
 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.570

there's all kinds of open questions but

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390
there's all kinds of open questions but
 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.500
there's all kinds of open questions but
it turns out that well now comes the

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510
it turns out that well now comes the
 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.950
it turns out that well now comes the

a theory called optimal transport for us

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020
a theory called optimal transport for us
 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.390
a theory called optimal transport for us
it tells the following you take a

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400
it tells the following you take a
 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.400
it tells the following you take a
polygon let's assume I have a bunch of

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410
polygon let's assume I have a bunch of
 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.680
polygon let's assume I have a bunch of
points in there here's five points and

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690
points in there here's five points and
 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.130
points in there here's five points and
from optimal transport I get that I can

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140
from optimal transport I get that I can
 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.560
from optimal transport I get that I can
give weights to these points so that if

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570
give weights to these points so that if
 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.900
give weights to these points so that if
I look at the domains of influence would

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910
I look at the domains of influence would
 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.780
I look at the domains of influence would
look something like this so that's what

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790
look something like this so that's what
 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.770
look something like this so that's what
they call a weight and weighted Voronoi

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780
they call a weight and weighted Voronoi
 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.300
they call a weight and weighted Voronoi
decomposition there they're always hard

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310
decomposition there they're always hard
 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.040
decomposition there they're always hard
to draw I'm not going to do this

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050
to draw I'm not going to do this
 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.110
to draw I'm not going to do this
correctly but so I think it will be

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120
correctly but so I think it will be
 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.290
correctly but so I think it will be
something like this this is a partition

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300
something like this this is a partition
 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.969
something like this this is a partition
associated with these points you see

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979
associated with these points you see
 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:30.490
associated with these points you see
this is not equal area so I didn't do it

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500
this is not equal area so I didn't do it
 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.790
this is not equal area so I didn't do it
right

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800
right
 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.640
right
but this theorem by contour ovitch and

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650
but this theorem by contour ovitch and
 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.490
but this theorem by contour ovitch and
others says that if I adjust the weights

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500
others says that if I adjust the weights
 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.710
others says that if I adjust the weights
right so like this point should get more

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720
right so like this point should get more
 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.869
right so like this point should get more
weight

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:39.879
weight
 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:43.439
weight
so in the end its domain that's larger

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449
so in the end its domain that's larger
 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.629
so in the end its domain that's larger
and perhaps this one should get a

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639
and perhaps this one should get a
 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.929
and perhaps this one should get a
smaller weight and and so you know this

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:48.939
smaller weight and and so you know this
 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:51.389
smaller weight and and so you know this
would rather be the domain and if I put

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:51.399
would rather be the domain and if I put
 

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:54.299
would rather be the domain and if I put
the weights right then I get an equal

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:54.309
the weights right then I get an equal
 

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:57.329
the weights right then I get an equal
area partition that's the theorem and if

00:06:57.329 --> 00:06:57.339
area partition that's the theorem and if
 

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:01.559
area partition that's the theorem and if
I move the points then these unique

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:01.569
I move the points then these unique
 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:03.899
I move the points then these unique
weights will move continuously so it's

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:03.909
weights will move continuously so it's
 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:07.079
weights will move continuously so it's
again continuous and this means that the

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:07.089
again continuous and this means that the
 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:10.439
again continuous and this means that the
space of n distinct points in the

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:10.449
space of n distinct points in the
 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.189
space of n distinct points in the
polygon gives me basically a parameter

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199
polygon gives me basically a parameter
 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.609
polygon gives me basically a parameter
space for nice partitions of the polygon

00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:17.619
space for nice partitions of the polygon
 

00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:19.649
space for nice partitions of the polygon
into equal area so which means I have

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:19.659
into equal area so which means I have
 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:22.439
into equal area so which means I have
the space doesn't give me all partitions

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.449
the space doesn't give me all partitions
 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.659
the space doesn't give me all partitions
but it gives me many of them and

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:24.669
but it gives me many of them and
 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:26.879
but it gives me many of them and
actually enough of them this is just the

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:26.889
actually enough of them this is just the
 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:28.980
actually enough of them this is just the
equal area now we have to get equal

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990
equal area now we have to get equal
 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.399
equal area now we have to get equal
perimeters and that basically means that

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:32.409
perimeters and that basically means that
 

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:36.600
perimeters and that basically means that
for every configuration of points I know

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:36.610
for every configuration of points I know
 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.759
for every configuration of points I know
how to get equal area but and now I have

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:38.769
how to get equal area but and now I have
 

00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:41.249
how to get equal area but and now I have
to compare the perimeters and that

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:41.259
to compare the perimeters and that
 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:44.189
to compare the perimeters and that
basically means I have I get a map from

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:44.199
basically means I have I get a map from
 

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:47.639
basically means I have I get a map from
this space of configurations of points

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:47.649
this space of configurations of points
 

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:50.699
this space of configurations of points
to a space of values we solve the

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:50.709
to a space of values we solve the
 

00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:53.999
to a space of values we solve the
problem if we can show that there is no

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:54.009
problem if we can show that there is no
 

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:56.850
problem if we can show that there is no
good map which would never give me all

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:56.860
good map which would never give me all
 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.249
good map which would never give me all
parameters equal and not all perimeters

00:07:59.249 --> 00:07:59.259
parameters equal and not all perimeters
 

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:02.089
parameters equal and not all perimeters
equal means basically we mapped the

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:02.099
equal means basically we mapped the
 

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:05.100
equal means basically we mapped the
space of points to the space of values

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.110
space of points to the space of values
 

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.829
space of points to the space of values
and we never hit zero which means we

00:08:07.829 --> 00:08:07.839
and we never hit zero which means we
 

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:09.869
and we never hit zero which means we
always go around that and now the

00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879
always go around that and now the
 

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:12.689
always go around that and now the
question is does that map exist and now

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:12.699
question is does that map exist and now
 

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:15.359
question is does that map exist and now
comes the next part it's something that

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:15.369
comes the next part it's something that
 

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:17.549
comes the next part it's something that
we take from algebra of topology and

00:08:17.549 --> 00:08:17.559
we take from algebra of topology and
 

00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:20.609
we take from algebra of topology and
somewhere in there is a theory called a

00:08:20.609 --> 00:08:20.619
somewhere in there is a theory called a
 

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:22.679
somewhere in there is a theory called a
covariant obstruction theory actually

00:08:22.679 --> 00:08:22.689
covariant obstruction theory actually
 

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:25.109
covariant obstruction theory actually
there's not that much bigger theory it's

00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:25.119
there's not that much bigger theory it's
 

00:08:25.119 --> 00:08:26.999
there's not that much bigger theory it's
it's basically it's a theory which just

00:08:26.999 --> 00:08:27.009
it's basically it's a theory which just
 

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:29.489
it's basically it's a theory which just
consists of one theorem but this one

00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:29.499
consists of one theorem but this one
 

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:32.879
consists of one theorem but this one
theorem says that this map doesn't exist

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:32.889
theorem says that this map doesn't exist
 

00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:35.429
theorem says that this map doesn't exist
if and only if a certain core homology

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:35.439
if and only if a certain core homology
 

00:08:35.439 --> 00:08:38.339
if and only if a certain core homology
class is nonzero so this sounds

00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:38.349
class is nonzero so this sounds
 

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:42.990
class is nonzero so this sounds
amazingly abstract and it is and the

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.000
amazingly abstract and it is and the
 

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.819
amazingly abstract and it is and the
good place to learn a covariant

what's the value of a book without
 

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.080
what's the value of a book without
pictures or conversations so there's no

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.090
pictures or conversations so there's no
 

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.400

and I'm not really an algebraic topology

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:11.770
and I'm not really an algebraic topology
 

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.480
and I'm not really an algebraic topology
I admire these tools if I want to use it

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:15.490
I admire these tools if I want to use it
 

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.940
I admire these tools if I want to use it
and I have to make it concrete and I

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:17.950
and I have to make it concrete and I
 

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.470
and I have to make it concrete and I
think I can show you on paper what

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480
think I can show you on paper what
 

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.270
think I can show you on paper what
really happens there except I'll need a

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:21.280
really happens there except I'll need a
 

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.960
really happens there except I'll need a
new sheet of paper for that so we try

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:24.970
new sheet of paper for that so we try
 

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.210
new sheet of paper for that so we try
and make a concrete which means our

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:27.220
and make a concrete which means our
 

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.490
and make a concrete which means our
concrete now here means N equals three

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:29.500
concrete now here means N equals three
 

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.370
concrete now here means N equals three
again we have a polygon and let's assume

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:32.380
again we have a polygon and let's assume
 

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.500
again we have a polygon and let's assume
that this is a polygon that we cannot

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:34.510
that this is a polygon that we cannot
 

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.470
that this is a polygon that we cannot
cut into three pieces of equal area and

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:37.480
cut into three pieces of equal area and
 

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.230
cut into three pieces of equal area and
equal perimeter so you're assuming that

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240
equal perimeter so you're assuming that
 

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.180
equal perimeter so you're assuming that
the whole thing we're trying to do is

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.190
the whole thing we're trying to do is
 

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.300
the whole thing we're trying to do is
impossible yes so proof by contradiction

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.310
impossible yes so proof by contradiction
 

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.240
impossible yes so proof by contradiction
and now if this is impossible this means

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.250
and now if this is impossible this means
 

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.360
and now if this is impossible this means
that for any configuration of three

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.370
that for any configuration of three
 

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:57.920
that for any configuration of three
points hmm there's a unique equal area

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:57.930
points hmm there's a unique equal area
 

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.200
points hmm there's a unique equal area
partition with the right weights but

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:01.210
partition with the right weights but
 

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.770
partition with the right weights but
then I get the values which is these

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:03.780
then I get the values which is these
 

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.250
then I get the values which is these
perimeter one perimeter two perimeter

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:08.260
perimeter one perimeter two perimeter
 

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.140
perimeter one perimeter two perimeter
three the perimeters of these three

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.150
three the perimeters of these three
 

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.780
three the perimeters of these three
pieces and these three parameters are

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:12.790
pieces and these three parameters are
 

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.510
pieces and these three parameters are
not equal what we really translate this

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:15.520
not equal what we really translate this
 

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.300
not equal what we really translate this
in is that we say we have here on the

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:18.310
in is that we say we have here on the
 

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:22.220
in is that we say we have here on the
one hand we have the space of

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:22.230
one hand we have the space of
 

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.530
one hand we have the space of
configurations of three distinct points

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:25.540
configurations of three distinct points
 

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.790
configurations of three distinct points
and over there we go to something that's

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800
and over there we go to something that's
 

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.750
and over there we go to something that's
the space of three numbers numbers have

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760
the space of three numbers numbers have
 

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.490
the space of three numbers numbers have
to show up somewhere right because this

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:35.500
to show up somewhere right because this
 

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.520
to show up somewhere right because this
is number four and there's three numbers

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:38.530
is number four and there's three numbers
 

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:44.040
is number four and there's three numbers
not all equal and actually we can assume

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.050
not all equal and actually we can assume
 

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.710
not all equal and actually we can assume
that this is three numbers which sum to

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720
that this is three numbers which sum to
 

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.110
that this is three numbers which sum to
zero because we just subtract you the

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120
zero because we just subtract you the
 

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.380
zero because we just subtract you the
average so if we work out what these

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:52.390
average so if we work out what these
 

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.900
average so if we work out what these
spaces are then in the end it will turn

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:54.910
spaces are then in the end it will turn
 

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.940
spaces are then in the end it will turn
out that here really we're talking about

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:56.950
out that here really we're talking about
 

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.290
out that here really we're talking about
maps to a circle

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:58.300
maps to a circle
 

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.990
maps to a circle
you know from any three numbers that are

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000
you know from any three numbers that are
 

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.080
you know from any three numbers that are
not equal you can make a point on the

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.090
not equal you can make a point on the
 

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.140
not equal you can make a point on the
circle by subtracting the

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:06.150
circle by subtracting the
 

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.420
circle by subtracting the
average which gives you three numbers

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:08.430
average which gives you three numbers
 

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.230
average which gives you three numbers
that sum to zero and then you divide by

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240
that sum to zero and then you divide by
 

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.240
that sum to zero and then you divide by
the sum of squares so you get three

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:14.250
the sum of squares so you get three
 

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.860
the sum of squares so you get three
numbers for the sum of squares equals

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:15.870
numbers for the sum of squares equals
 

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.280
numbers for the sum of squares equals
one and that's a circle and now it turns

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:19.290
one and that's a circle and now it turns
 

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.880
one and that's a circle and now it turns
out that one can understand the space of

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:21.890
out that one can understand the space of
 

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.710
out that one can understand the space of
configurations of three distinct points

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720
configurations of three distinct points
 

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.560
configurations of three distinct points
in the plane and basically this space

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:27.570
in the plane and basically this space
 

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.440
in the plane and basically this space
can be glued together from hexagons

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:30.450
can be glued together from hexagons
 

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.530
can be glued together from hexagons
where basically

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:32.540
where basically
 

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.640
where basically
hexagons could look like this I just

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:34.650
hexagons could look like this I just
 

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.860
hexagons could look like this I just
draw one of these hexagons in the end it

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:36.870
draw one of these hexagons in the end it
 

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.830
draw one of these hexagons in the end it
will be six of them and the meaning of

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:39.840
will be six of them and the meaning of
 

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.920
will be six of them and the meaning of
this hexagons is basically I can label

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:42.930
this hexagons is basically I can label
 

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.700
this hexagons is basically I can label
this by one two three and one two three

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:45.710
this by one two three and one two three
 

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.460
this by one two three and one two three
really just means I have three points in

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:49.470
really just means I have three points in
 

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.270
really just means I have three points in
the plane one two and three and point

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:53.280
the plane one two and three and point
 

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.000
the plane one two and three and point
one is to the left of 0.2 and this is to

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.010
one is to the left of 0.2 and this is to
 

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:01.040
one is to the left of 0.2 and this is to
the left of 0.3 whereas perhaps this one

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.050
the left of 0.3 whereas perhaps this one
 

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.840
the left of 0.3 whereas perhaps this one
here would be 1 3 2 which means again

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:05.850
here would be 1 3 2 which means again
 

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.630
here would be 1 3 2 which means again
this is sort of symbolizes 3 points in

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640
this is sort of symbolizes 3 points in
 

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.540
this is sort of symbolizes 3 points in
the plane but one is to the left of 3

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:11.550
the plane but one is to the left of 3
 

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.730
the plane but one is to the left of 3
and left of 2 if I look at all

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:15.740
and left of 2 if I look at all
 

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.050
and left of 2 if I look at all
configurations of three points in the

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060
configurations of three points in the
 

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.090
configurations of three points in the
plane then of course it could also

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.100
plane then of course it could also
 

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.370
plane then of course it could also
happen that they're just not sorted left

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380
happen that they're just not sorted left
 

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.590
happen that they're just not sorted left
to right but let's say point two is

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600
to right but let's say point two is
 

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.020
to right but let's say point two is
above point three and this basically

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.030
above point three and this basically
 

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.200
above point three and this basically
means the space I get will more look

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:30.210
means the space I get will more look
 

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.530
means the space I get will more look
like this and we can work out the

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540
like this and we can work out the
 

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.510
like this and we can work out the
combinatorics of that we're not going to

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:35.520
combinatorics of that we're not going to
 

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.610
combinatorics of that we're not going to
do the detail on that this here

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620
do the detail on that this here
 

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.280
do the detail on that this here
basically this red line corresponds to

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:40.290
basically this red line corresponds to
 

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:44.410
basically this red line corresponds to
three points but two is above three and

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:44.420
three points but two is above three and
 

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.390
three points but two is above three and
this is again the points one two and

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:47.400
this is again the points one two and
 

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.500
this is again the points one two and
three in the plane but one and two is

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:51.510
three in the plane but one and two is
 

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.010
three in the plane but one and two is
below point three so each of the

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:55.020
below point three so each of the
 

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.190
below point three so each of the
elements of this space we can sort of

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:58.200
elements of this space we can sort of
 

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.590
elements of this space we can sort of
interpret as certain types of point

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600
interpret as certain types of point
 

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.570
interpret as certain types of point
configurations in the space in the plane

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:04.580
configurations in the space in the plane
 

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.630
configurations in the space in the plane
getting a bit too complicated I think

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:08.640
getting a bit too complicated I think
 

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.120
getting a bit too complicated I think
what we'll do is say that now some magic

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.130
what we'll do is say that now some magic
 

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.060
what we'll do is say that now some magic
happens what comes out is that in the

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.070
happens what comes out is that in the
 

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:19.520
happens what comes out is that in the
end this map doesn't exist so this map

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:19.530
end this map doesn't exist so this map
 

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.240
end this map doesn't exist so this map
from

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:20.250
from
 

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.910
from
space of configurations of three points

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:24.930
to the space of three numbers that are
 

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.500
to the space of three numbers that are
not all equal so we have the problem

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:27.510
not all equal so we have the problem
 

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.010
not all equal so we have the problem
solved if this map doesn't exist and it

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:31.020
solved if this map doesn't exist and it
 

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.980
solved if this map doesn't exist and it
turns out that this is the case if and

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:33.990
turns out that this is the case if and
 

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.320

and where this X and this Y are supposed
to be integers and just to illustrate

where the threes come from these three

00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.250
where the threes come from these three
 

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.180
where the threes come from these three
comes from one three is this edges or

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.190
comes from one three is this edges or
 

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.250
comes from one three is this edges or
these or these it's sort of

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:04.260
these or these it's sort of
 

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.890
these or these it's sort of
combinatorics of the hexagons and the

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:06.900
combinatorics of the hexagons and the
 

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.170
combinatorics of the hexagons and the
other thing is the other three edges of

other thing is the other three edges of
 

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.690

where the magic happens and now the
 

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.650
where the magic happens and now the
questions does this equation have a

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:18.660
questions does this equation have a
 

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.960
questions does this equation have a
solution in the integers and you stare

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:20.970
solution in the integers and you stare
 

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.970
solution in the integers and you stare
at it for a while and you say well

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980
at it for a while and you say well
 

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.420
at it for a while and you say well
obviously not because if I put in any

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:26.430
obviously not because if I put in any
 

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.100
obviously not because if I put in any
integers there I get something that's

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:28.110
integers there I get something that's
 

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.460
integers there I get something that's
divisible by three and I add one and I

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:31.470
divisible by three and I add one and I
 

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.960
divisible by three and I add one and I
get something that's not divisible by

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:32.970
get something that's not divisible by
 

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.240
get something that's not divisible by
three so we've learned that this

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:35.250
three so we've learned that this
 

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.270
three so we've learned that this
equation does not have a solution which

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:38.280
equation does not have a solution which
 

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.920
equation does not have a solution which
means the counter example does not exist

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:41.930
means the counter example does not exist
 

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.710
means the counter example does not exist
which means every polygon can be cut

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720
which means every polygon can be cut
 

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.410
which means every polygon can be cut
into three pieces of equal area and

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420
into three pieces of equal area and
 

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.440
into three pieces of equal area and
equal perimeter N equals 3 N equals 3

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:51.450
equal perimeter N equals 3 N equals 3
 

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.230
equal perimeter N equals 3 N equals 3
now we get a bit overexcited and we say

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240
now we get a bit overexcited and we say
 

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.720
now we get a bit overexcited and we say
if we can do it for N equals 3 turns out

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:56.730
if we can do it for N equals 3 turns out
 

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.700
if we can do it for N equals 3 turns out
with the same pattern if we take the

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:58.710
with the same pattern if we take the
 

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:03.770
with the same pattern if we take the
equation one plus two x equals zero

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:03.780
equation one plus two x equals zero
 

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.410
equation one plus two x equals zero
that's even easier to see that this

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:06.420
that's even easier to see that this
 

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.150
that's even easier to see that this
doesn't have a solution right because

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160
doesn't have a solution right because
 

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.340
doesn't have a solution right because
this is even plus one is odd doesn't get

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:10.350
this is even plus one is odd doesn't get
 

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:15.770
this is even plus one is odd doesn't get
zero so this is N equals 2 check which

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:15.780
zero so this is N equals 2 check which
 

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.590
zero so this is N equals 2 check which
we already knew even without the missing

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600
we already knew even without the missing
 

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.480
we already knew even without the missing
details and the magic in the beginning

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:20.490
details and the magic in the beginning
 

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:27.710
details and the magic in the beginning
then we did 1 plus 3 X plus 3 y equals 0

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720
then we did 1 plus 3 X plus 3 y equals 0
 

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.350
then we did 1 plus 3 X plus 3 y equals 0
and this doesn't have a solution because

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360
and this doesn't have a solution because
 

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.140
and this doesn't have a solution because
of divisibility by 3 and that solve the

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:33.150
of divisibility by 3 and that solve the
 

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.710
of divisibility by 3 and that solve the
problem

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720
problem
 

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.440

n equals three for N equals four and it
turns out same pattern the hexagon will

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120
turns out same pattern the hexagon will
 

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.120
turns out same pattern the hexagon will
be replaced by the permute ahead run

which is wonderful polyhedron to study
and we've solved the problem for n

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:46.290
and we've solved the problem for n
 

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.830
and we've solved the problem for n
equals four if this equation doesn't

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:48.840

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.150
equals four if this equation doesn't
have a solution one plus four x 6y plus

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160
have a solution one plus four x 6y plus

4z equals zero and you stare at it for a

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.260
4z equals zero and you stare at it for a
 

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.650
4z equals zero and you stare at it for a
while and you say well four and six and

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:00.660
while and you say well four and six and
 

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.810
while and you say well four and six and
four they're all even so if I plug in

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820
four they're all even so if I plug in
 

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.330
four they're all even so if I plug in
any integers there this is even plus one

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:05.340
any integers there this is even plus one
 

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.400
any integers there this is even plus one
doesn't give zero which means we've

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:07.410
doesn't give zero which means we've
 

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.160
doesn't give zero which means we've
solved the problem for N equals four we

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:10.170
solved the problem for N equals four we
 

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:18.310
solved the problem for N equals four we
go on five x + 10 y plus 10 Z plus five

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320
go on five x + 10 y plus 10 Z plus five

go on five x + 10 y plus 10 Z plus five
W equals zero does this have a solution

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:21.890
W equals zero does this have a solution
 

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.590
W equals zero does this have a solution
no it doesn't because all of this is

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600
no it doesn't because all of this is
 

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.320
no it doesn't because all of this is
divisible by five which means we've

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:27.330
divisible by five which means we've
 

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.990
divisible by five which means we've
solved the problem for N equals five and

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000
solved the problem for N equals five and
 

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.110
solved the problem for N equals five and
so on you might hope or guess and that's

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120
so on you might hope or guess and that's
 

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.880
so on you might hope or guess and that's
not true because the next step is 1 plus

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:37.890
not true because the next step is 1 plus
 

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:51.560
not true because the next step is 1 plus
6 X plus 15 y plus 20 z plus 15 W + 6 u

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:51.570
6 X plus 15 y plus 20 z plus 15 W + 6 u
 

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.920
6 X plus 15 y plus 20 z plus 15 W + 6 u
equals 0 so perhaps we should reveal the

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:54.930
equals 0 so perhaps we should reveal the
 

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.810
equals 0 so perhaps we should reveal the
mystery what are these numbers that show

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820
mystery what are these numbers that show
 

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.910
mystery what are these numbers that show
up here and it turns out this is

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920
up here and it turns out this is
 

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.820
up here and it turns out this is
binomial coefficients from Pascal's

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:01.830
binomial coefficients from Pascal's
 

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.640
binomial coefficients from Pascal's
triangle and if you don't want to

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:04.650
triangle and if you don't want to
 

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.100
triangle and if you don't want to
memorize these numbers actually every

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:07.110
memorize these numbers actually every
 

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.890
memorize these numbers actually every
number here is just the sum of the two

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900
number here is just the sum of the two
 

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.809
number here is just the sum of the two
numbers above of them that's the rule of

00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819
numbers above of them that's the rule of
 

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:15.439
numbers above of them that's the rule of
how you do Pascal's triangle so 1 plus 5

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:15.449
how you do Pascal's triangle so 1 plus 5
 

00:17:15.449 --> 00:17:19.130
how you do Pascal's triangle so 1 plus 5
is 6 5 plus 10 is 15 10 plus 10 is 20 10

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140
is 6 5 plus 10 is 15 10 plus 10 is 20 10
 

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.610
is 6 5 plus 10 is 15 10 plus 10 is 20 10
plus 5 is 15 and 5 plus the missing 1 is

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620
plus 5 is 15 and 5 plus the missing 1 is
 

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.579
plus 5 is 15 and 5 plus the missing 1 is
6 so that's the pattern which means 6

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:25.589
6 so that's the pattern which means 6
 

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:27.949
6 so that's the pattern which means 6
this is the sixth row of Pascal's

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959
this is the sixth row of Pascal's
 

00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:29.960
this is the sixth row of Pascal's
triangle except for a 1 in the end

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:29.970
triangle except for a 1 in the end
 

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.200
triangle except for a 1 in the end
missing and the question again is now we

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:33.210
missing and the question again is now we
 

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.820
missing and the question again is now we
are at N equals 6 does this equation

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:37.830
are at N equals 6 does this equation
 

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.270
are at N equals 6 does this equation
have a solution in the integers and

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:40.280
have a solution in the integers and
 

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.320
have a solution in the integers and
indeed it does

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.330
indeed it does
 

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:48.160
indeed it does
if you for example put 1

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.170
if you for example put 1
 

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:54.350
if you for example put 1
plus 6 times minus 1 sum 1 minus 6 plus

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360
plus 6 times minus 1 sum 1 minus 6 plus
 

00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:03.890
plus 6 times minus 1 sum 1 minus 6 plus
15 times 1 plus 20 times minus 1 and the

15 times 1 plus 20 times minus 1 and the
 

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.440
15 times 1 plus 20 times minus 1 and the
rest you take zeros are I think I got it

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:06.450
rest you take zeros are I think I got it
 

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.720
rest you take zeros are I think I got it
wrong I take plus 1 here and I take

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:08.730
wrong I take plus 1 here and I take
 

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:14.150
wrong I take plus 1 here and I take
minus 1 here then I find 1 plus 20 is 6

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160
minus 1 here then I find 1 plus 20 is 6
 

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.700
minus 1 here then I find 1 plus 20 is 6
plus 15 right this means we have a

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:16.710
plus 15 right this means we have a
 

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.669
plus 15 right this means we have a
solution to this equation in integers

00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679
solution to this equation in integers
 

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:21.260
solution to this equation in integers
which means we do not have a

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:21.270
which means we do not have a
 

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.990
which means we do not have a
contradiction which means this map might

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000
contradiction which means this map might
 

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.340
contradiction which means this map might
exist which means the counter example

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:28.350
exist which means the counter example
 

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.350
exist which means the counter example
might exist so we plainly have not

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360

equals 6 and actually if you continue

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:37.830
equals 6 and actually if you continue
 

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:42.260
equals 6 and actually if you continue
and equal 7 again we can solve the

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:42.270
and equal 7 again we can solve the
 

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.500
and equal 7 again we can solve the
problem easily by the same pattern now

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:45.510
problem easily by the same pattern now

explains to us what we've done here
 

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.750
explains to us what we've done here
namely it solved the question for which

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760
namely it solved the question for which
 

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.100
namely it solved the question for which
values n does the in throw of Pascal's

triangle have a common factor that's

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:24.510
triangle have a common factor that's
 

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.560
triangle have a common factor that's
exactly what we were looking at here and

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:26.570
exactly what we were looking at here and
 

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:31.850
exactly what we were looking at here and
it turns out that always if N is a power

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860
it turns out that always if N is a power
 

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.490
it turns out that always if N is a power
of a prime number we look at this role

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500
of a prime number we look at this role
 

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.150
of a prime number we look at this role
and we disregard the ones and we asked

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160
and we disregard the ones and we asked
 

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.220
and we disregard the ones and we asked
do all these numbers have a common

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:40.230
do all these numbers have a common
 

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.850
do all these numbers have a common
factor - yes and here the common factor

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860
factor - yes and here the common factor
 

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.390
factor - yes and here the common factor
is 3 and here the common factor is 2 and

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400
is 3 and here the common factor is 2 and
 

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.870
is 3 and here the common factor is 2 and
here the common factor is 5 and these

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880
here the common factor is 5 and these
 

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.850
here the common factor is 5 and these
numbers don't have a common factor it's

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:52.860
numbers don't have a common factor it's
 

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.549
numbers don't have a common factor it's
not 2 because this is odd and it's not 3

00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559
not 2 because this is odd and it's not 3
 

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:58.610
not 2 because this is odd and it's not 3
because this is not divisible by 3 yeah

00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620
because this is not divisible by 3 yeah
 

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.230
because this is not divisible by 3 yeah
so this one has a common factor again

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240
so this one has a common factor again
 

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.830
so this one has a common factor again
namely there

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840
namely there
 

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.180
namely there
divisible by seven and if we do still

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:05.190
divisible by seven and if we do still
 

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.720
divisible by seven and if we do still
the next one then this is eight and this

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:08.730
the next one then this is eight and this
 

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.820
the next one then this is eight and this
is 28 and this is 56 and this is 70 and

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:12.830
is 28 and this is 56 and this is 70 and
 

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.250
is 28 and this is 56 and this is 70 and
fifty-six and twenty eight and eight and

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:16.260
fifty-six and twenty eight and eight and
 

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.970
fifty-six and twenty eight and eight and
they are all even so it again has a

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:19.980
they are all even so it again has a
 

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.070
they are all even so it again has a
common factor and that's if we have a

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080
common factor and that's if we have a
 

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.019
common factor and that's if we have a
common factor then this original problem

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:24.029
common factor then this original problem
 

00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.980
common factor then this original problem
is solved

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:24.990
is solved
 

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:29.029
is solved
and what are these numbers so this is

00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039
and what are these numbers so this is
 

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:33.080
and what are these numbers so this is
two is a prime number three this is the

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:33.090
two is a prime number three this is the
 

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.220
two is a prime number three this is the
brownie numbers your eyes

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:34.230
brownie numbers your eyes
 

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.080
brownie numbers your eyes
yes that's the row number so that's row

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:36.090
yes that's the row number so that's row
 

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.090
yes that's the row number so that's row
number two does rule number three three

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.100
number two does rule number three three
 

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.180
number two does rule number three three
is also a prime number this is four and

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:41.190
is also a prime number this is four and
 

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.730
is also a prime number this is four and
four is not a prime number but it's a

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740
four is not a prime number but it's a
 

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.389
four is not a prime number but it's a
power of a prime it's two squared and

00:20:46.389 --> 00:20:46.399
power of a prime it's two squared and
 

00:20:46.399 --> 00:20:50.690
power of a prime it's two squared and
this is five which is again a prime

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:50.700
this is five which is again a prime
 

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:54.289
this is five which is again a prime
number and this here is six and 6 is 2

00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:54.299
number and this here is six and 6 is 2
 

00:20:54.299 --> 00:20:56.870
number and this here is six and 6 is 2
times 3 it's not a prime and it's not a

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880
times 3 it's not a prime and it's not a
 

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.820
times 3 it's not a prime and it's not a
prime power but it's a product of

00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:58.830
prime power but it's a product of
 

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.460
prime power but it's a product of
different primes and that's where we

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:01.470
different primes and that's where we
 

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.470
different primes and that's where we
don't solve the problem that's Paula

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480
don't solve the problem that's Paula
 

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:09.680
don't solve the problem that's Paula

a prime and 10 is 2 times 5 which means
 

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.470
a prime and 10 is 2 times 5 which means
again we have not solved our problem

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480
again we have not solved our problem
 

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.019
again we have not solved our problem
going back to a polygon this means we do

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:27.029
going back to a polygon this means we do
 

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:29.870
going back to a polygon this means we do
not know whether every polygon can be

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880
not know whether every polygon can be
 

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.860
not know whether every polygon can be
cut into ten pieces of equal area equal

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:33.870
cut into ten pieces of equal area equal
 

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.169
cut into ten pieces of equal area equal
perimeter it may be possible that this

answer is also pretty magical

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:01.890
answer is also pretty magical
 

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.529
answer is also pretty magical
of course someone at some point has to

00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539
of course someone at some point has to
 

00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:05.480
of course someone at some point has to
solve the problem for the other values

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:05.490
solve the problem for the other values
 

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.610
