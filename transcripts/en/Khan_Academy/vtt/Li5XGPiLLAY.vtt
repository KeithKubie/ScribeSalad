00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.790
Abby and Ben did household
chores last weekend.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.020
Together they earned $50.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.050
Let me underline that.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.680
Together they earned $50.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.740
And Abby earned $10
more than Ben.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.570
Let me underline that as well.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.930
Abby earned $10 more than Ben.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.170
How much did each earn?

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.820
Now, we could just go and solve
it, but it looks like

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.920
they want to ask
something else.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.900
If you were to use the graph
above, which strategy is most

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.400
useful in helping you find the
answer to the problem?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.930
So we don't even have
to solve for it.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.820
They just want us to tell them
what is the best strategy for

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.080
solving the problem.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.380
So the first choice they say,
finding an equation

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.470
for the blue line.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.100
So let's look at this graph that
they've also given us.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.330
So the blue line here is the
graph using the information

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.430
that Abby earned $10
more than Ben.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.050
That's what that says.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.290
It's written a little
bit small, but

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.960
hopefully, you can see it.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.800
Abby earned $10 more than
Ben, which is this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.730
information over here.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.560
And so if you call this over
here, the B-axis for the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.900
amount Ben earned and this is
the A-axis for the amount Abby

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:12.330
earned, the equation of this
line would be the amount Abby

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.010
earned is going to be $10 more
than the amount Ben earned.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.310
So that's the equation of
that line right there.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.270
Well, that by itself isn't going
to help you figure out

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.610
how much did each earn.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.390
So that by itself won't
solve the problem.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.560
Finding the red line's
y-intercept.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.540
So let's look at the red line.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.810
The red line C. is using the
information that Abby and Ben

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.510
earn $50 combined.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.600
It's this information up here.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.230
And the equation of that would
be Abby's earnings plus Ben's

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.980
earnings are equal to $50.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.065
If you were to just find
the y-intercept there,

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:44.780
it's just at 50.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.370
That's really not giving you
any information in figuring

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.360
out how much did they each
earn and actually

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.950
solving for A and B.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.230
So B by itself won't work.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.310
Finding the lines' point
of intersection.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.140
Now, that's interesting
because the point of

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.080
intersection gives you-- so let
me circle that a little

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.820
bit bolder.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.590
Let me do that in orange
and a magenta color.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.850
So the point of intersection
right there, that gives us an

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.140
A and B value that will satisfy
both equations.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.710
And if they're satisfying both
equations, it'll satisfy both

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.960
constraints.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.990
So if we just eyeball it off
this chart, it looks like B is

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.210
equal to 20 and A
is equal to 30.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.270
And if we just use these numbers
relative to this,

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.000
together they earned $50.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.830
That works.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.750
If Abby earns 30 and Ben earns
20, they'll earn $50.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.550
And 30 is $10 more than 20.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.250
So this worked.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.970
By looking at the point of
intersection, we were able to

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.870
figure out how much Abby
and Ben earned.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.000
So I would go with C.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.010
We don't even have to read D,
but they say, you cannot tell

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.840
how much they earned because
there are two

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.430
lines on the graph.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.440
No, that's complete silliness
right there.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.370
So the choice is
