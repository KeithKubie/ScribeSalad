00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:05.767
Tsai: On behalf of
the entire YouTube API team,

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.901
I just want to welcome you guys
to "Powered by YouTube."

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:11.234
This is our first ever
API developer event

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:13.033
here at the YouTube office.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.400
Um, my name's
Christine Tsai.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.300
I'm part
of the YouTube APIs team.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.033
And, um, I'm your resident
housekeeper for the day.

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:21.934
Um, we launched the APIs
back in March,

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:23.200
and since then,
you know,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.567
we thought it would
be really great that--

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:26.667
you know, the community
is one of the biggest features

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:30.133
on YouTube.com that we think
really makes YouTube special.

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.067
We thought "Hey, we could bring
that same community

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:34.067
"to developers,
and, you know,

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.000
"really get the word out
about our APIs,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.934
"educate developers on,
you know, what exactly

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:39.234
"you can do
with the APIs

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:41.300
in bringing YouTube
to your users."

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.534
So, um, this event
is kind of like our, you know,

00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:46.567
first step in really spreading
the word.

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.133
Um, before we get started
with Hunter,

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.701
I wanted to give
a quick shout-out

00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:52.267
to our office hours staff.

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:54.567
Office hours is the area
you saw in the lobby

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:55.667
with the signs.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.000
Um, these are
our friendly TAs.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.601
They're all members
of the developer ops

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.100
or engineering team.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.167
I'm gonna let Stephanie Liu
give you a very quick spiel

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:07.234
on what office hours
is all about.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.534
Liu: Hey, guys.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:09.901
So if you look
at the back of your badge,

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:11.334
you'll see we have
a pretty packed agenda today.

00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:13.501
But if at any point,
you want to wander out,

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:15.167
or, uh, you know,
get your hands

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:17.434
on some of the stuff
that you're hearing about,

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:19.000
we'll be outside.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.834
Um, we're all engineers that
work with outside developers,

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:22.067
or some core engineers
as well.

00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:23.367
My name's Stephanie.

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:27.100
And we have Jochen,
Geoff, Ryan, Jeff, Max,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.767
and John will also be around.

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:30.400
And anybody you see in one
of these shirts will probably--

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.701
you know, you can approach.

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:33.367
But we'll be
the ones outside.

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:35.367
Um, but yeah,
if you want to--

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:37.501
We have some one-sheeters,
we have some, you know,

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:38.601
sample code
to get you guys started.

00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:39.701
You can ask us questions,

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:40.701
we can probably do
some demos for you,

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:41.701
things like that.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.901
So at any point,

00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:47.067
come outside,
we're pretty friendly.

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:48.300
Tsai: Great.
Thanks, guys.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.300
And with that,
I will hand it off

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.634
to Hunter Walk.

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:53.868
Walk: Hey.
That's right, clap!

00:01:53.868 --> 00:01:57.234
[applause]

00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:59.100
Um, so thanks, Christine.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.968
Uh, so there's
my way-too-big picture.

00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:03.267
Let's get rid of that.
There.

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:05.701
Um, so yeah,
so as Christine noted,

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:08.067
this is the first
developer day,

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:09.367
so, uh,
appreciate it,

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:11.167
because what YouTube
really is--

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:14.167
and I lead
product management here--

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:15.400
What YouTube really is,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.133
it's a platform
for people.

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:19.767
And so I think
what we've always believed

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:22.367
from day one
is that, um,

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:25.601
it's not about trying
to pick what content

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:28.400
is gonna
be successful,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.300
or trying to, uh--
trying to sway

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.200
the community move
in a certain way.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.868
It's just providing
a platform

00:02:33.868 --> 00:02:37.634
where people can upload,
share, and create.

00:02:37.634 --> 00:02:40.300
And extending that offsite,
I think,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.300
is really part of our--
part of our DNA.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.200
And so what started
with the embedded player,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.000
you know, sort of the ability
to kind of grab a YouTube video

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.300
and put it
anywhere you want,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.868
has now evolved into the APIs
that you see in front of you.

00:02:53.868 --> 00:02:56.868
And I hope for folks who aren't
as familiar with the APIs,

00:02:56.868 --> 00:02:59.934
that they have the chance today
to learn a little bit more.

00:02:59.934 --> 00:03:01.968
For folks that
have been using them,

00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:03.834
I'm sure you won't be shy
about finding people

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:05.300
in gray T-shirts
and telling them

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.067
exactly what you want to see
from the next version.

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:09.467
Um, so I'm just going
to spend a few minutes

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:12.534
talking a little bit
about what YouTube has

00:03:12.534 --> 00:03:14.434
to offer
to you guys.

00:03:14.434 --> 00:03:16.734
Uh, and then,
a few tips and trends

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:19.167
that I've sort of seen
in our API development.

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:20.801
Uh, and then we can get
into sort of some of the meat

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.968
of the technical discussion.

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:25.601
So the first thing
that I believe YouTube has

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.234
is of this incredible corpus,
right?

00:03:27.234 --> 00:03:29.334
So in fewer
than three years,

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.734
it's the most diverse,
the broadest,

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:34.167
the deepest collection of video
that you've ever seen.

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:37.100
Um, in fact, we now get
more than 13 hours

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.501
of new video
every minute.

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:40.067
So that's
an incredible amount.

00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:42.534
It's about
20,000 hours a day.

00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:45.100
Uh, I was doing sort of, like,
back-of-the-napkin math,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.901
trying to compare
the productivity

00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:50.400
of the YouTube user base
to traditional media.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.067
And so that's the equivalent of
if Hollywood was releasing

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:58.067
57,000 new full-length films
into theaters each week.

00:03:58.067 --> 00:04:00.067
And, just like Hollywood,

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:02.400
some of those YouTube videos
become quite popular,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.234
others are more sort of
your niche independent,

00:04:05.234 --> 00:04:06.901
uh, and some
are just plain weird,

00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.234
and, uh, God only knows
why they exist.

00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:12.767
But we celebrate them--
We celebrate them all.

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:13.767
And what does that mean?

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:15.701
It means that
no matter whether

00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:17.567
you're creating an application
that's focused

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:19.701
on a very specific idea,

00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:21.601
or just trying
to broadly appeal

00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:24.167
to, um, you know,
the internet community,

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:26.067
we have a corpus
for you to program from.

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:27.267
So I was checking out--

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.601
We have over
200,000, uh, Madonna videos.

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:31.000
Uh, quite exciting.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.067
In fact, when she released
her new album, she, you know--

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:36.033
Some of these celebrities now
are starting to film things

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:38.167
exclusively for YouTube
to try to sort of reach out

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:39.834
and talk
to the YouTube community.

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:41.267
And I guess she was
on the set of her video

00:04:41.267 --> 00:04:42.634
with Justin Timberlake.

00:04:42.634 --> 00:04:44.667
And she was vacuuming,
and sort of, like,

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:46.434
"Oh, hey, YouTube," you know,
"you caught me off guard"

00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:47.834
type of thing.

00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:49.501
And, uh--and then she's like,
you know,

00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:51.934
"I want you guys
to keep uploading videos,

00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:54.000
you know, singing my song,
and Madonna videos and stuff."

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.467
And we all kind of looked,
and, like,

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:57.801
"She just didn't tell everybody
to start, like, you know,

00:04:57.801 --> 00:04:59.567
ripping and uploading
Madonna videos, did we?"

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:01.567
Like, "Somebody let
her record label know."

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:02.834
But it turns out that, um,

00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:04.267
they were all
really cool about that.

00:05:04.267 --> 00:05:05.868
And I think what we're seeing
is sort of an evolution

00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:07.834
where folks are getting
more and more comfortable

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:10.100
with, um, different ideas
of relationships

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.634
between creators and fans.

00:05:11.634 --> 00:05:13.567
And so that's
really exciting for us,

00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:16.100
and, um, allows us
to continue sort of enabling--

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.767
bring people
closer together.

00:05:17.767 --> 00:05:19.701
So 200,000 Madonna videos,

00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:22.400
in case you want to create, uh,
a Madonna fan site.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.434
But maybe you have
a very particular interest,

00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:26.701
such as the sport of,
uh, wife carrying.

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:27.901
[laughter]

00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:29.234
And if that's the case,

00:05:29.234 --> 00:05:31.367
I'm not here to judge you,
that's cool.

00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:32.868
Uh, totally,
do your thing.

00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:35.133
Uh, apparently, there's
a few hundred other people

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:37.567
who are really
into that too.

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:39.934
And, uh, thus,
uh, don't--

00:05:39.934 --> 00:05:41.601
You know, don't worry
about going out and trying

00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:43.767
to commission, or find,
or sort of scare up video

00:05:43.767 --> 00:05:46.367
to create that--
to create that dream site

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:47.601
or that dream application.

00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:49.100
Just start borrowing it
from YouTube.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.701
But what's interesting
is there's some things as--

00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:52.868
as niche and,

00:05:52.868 --> 00:05:55.434
uh, interesting
as wife carrying might be,

00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:57.767
there's some things where--
I'm sad to say--

00:05:57.767 --> 00:06:00.501
YouTube still doesn't have
enough video for you guys.

00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:02.400
Um, fingerstaches.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.534
So if you don't know
the fingerstache,

00:06:03.534 --> 00:06:05.000
the story
of the fingerstache

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.734
is there's literally
this guy who got a tattoo,

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:09.801
uh, of a little moustache
on his index finger,

00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:11.968
so that, I guess, you know,
right at the opportune moment

00:06:11.968 --> 00:06:14.000
when he's talking to you,
he can kind of go like this.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.634
[laughter]

00:06:15.634 --> 00:06:17.834
Um, and as compelling
as that is,

00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:20.267
for some reason, we only have
six fingerstache videos.

00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:22.634
Um, so either we have a bunch
of fingerstache videos,

00:06:22.634 --> 00:06:24.701
and they're just
not properly labeled,

00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:27.300
or that quite hasn't caught on
in the YouTube community yet.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.300
So I'm sure within, uh--
before the day is up,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.033
somebody out there
will have created,

00:06:32.033 --> 00:06:33.901
uh, a fingerstache
YouTube app.

00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:35.968
And, uh, by the time
I check this later today,

00:06:35.968 --> 00:06:38.167
you know, maybe we'll have
60 or 600.

00:06:38.167 --> 00:06:40.267
So besides an incredible
corpus of video

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:41.534
for you guys
to draw from,

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:43.067
um, we have a community.

00:06:43.067 --> 00:06:44.701
We have a community
that can--

00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:48.467
um, you can both deliver
content into,

00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:49.701
but that you can also use

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.767
to make aware
of what you're doing.

00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:55.100
So YouTube's community,
if it was a country,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.901
would actually be the third
largest country in the world.

00:06:57.901 --> 00:07:01.300
Uh, we would probably have
a very strange-looking flag.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.701
But I think what's
just incredible is, uh,

00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:07.501
maybe even more so than
any other internet property,

00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:10.334
I think we have the chance
to make the entire internet

00:07:10.334 --> 00:07:11.968
into YouTube's user base.

00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:13.434
Why?

00:07:13.434 --> 00:07:15.501
I think exactly what
we were talking about before.

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:17.100
Sort of the breadth
of what goes on here,

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.467
but also the reach.

00:07:18.467 --> 00:07:20.667
The fact that in order
to encounter YouTube content,

00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:22.868
you don't have to come
to YouTube.com.

00:07:22.868 --> 00:07:25.601
In fact, uh, each, uh--

00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:28.167
Each month, videos are viewed
on more than 10 million

00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:32.334
websites, blogs,
uh, social network profiles.

00:07:32.334 --> 00:07:35.767
And that's in large part
to a lot of the amazing work

00:07:35.767 --> 00:07:37.667
that folks like yourself
are doing.

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:39.734
How to take
the YouTube experience

00:07:39.734 --> 00:07:41.801
and bring it outside
of YouTube.com.

00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:43.100
A little bit later today,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.000
uh, Brian Glick will talk
a little bit

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.801
about how the YouTube.com
experience is evolving.

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.634
Um, but I think
what we've really seen

00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:51.868
is that the YouTube experience
evolves not just because

00:07:51.868 --> 00:07:53.367
of what we do,

00:07:53.367 --> 00:07:55.300
but because
of what you guys do.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.467
And I think one
of the biggest changes

00:07:57.467 --> 00:07:58.868
in the last few quarters,

00:07:58.868 --> 00:08:00.000
as I look back
and sort of think

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.167
about where we were
last year

00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:02.434
and where we're going,

00:08:02.434 --> 00:08:04.667
is that experience
is not just web-based anymore.

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:06.367
So I don't know
how many folks in this room

00:08:06.367 --> 00:08:08.801
are, uh,
application developers,

00:08:08.801 --> 00:08:12.267
or have been working with,
um, various maybe, uh, hardware,

00:08:12.267 --> 00:08:13.901
um, or other solutions.

00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:16.100
But increasingly,
the YouTube experience

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.767
is not limited
to the PC.

00:08:17.767 --> 00:08:20.300
So the general promise
of YouTube

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.901
is that for the first time,
the user is at the center

00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:24.434
of their media experience.

00:08:24.434 --> 00:08:27.734
And that media experience
tends to be a blend

00:08:27.734 --> 00:08:29.167
of mass media, right?

00:08:29.167 --> 00:08:32.300
So music videos, other things
that are generally popular.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.400
Niche media,
and personal media,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.334
things that are just being
shared by family and friends.

00:08:36.334 --> 00:08:38.467
And so whether
you're looking at, uh,

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:40.501
the mobile, uh, devices,

00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:42.400
or, increasingly,
the living room.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.501
Um, whether it's capture,

00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:47.200
or things like, uh,
the Flip video camera,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.601
or delivery streaming
through set-top boxes,

00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:51.467
increasingly,
YouTube is out there.

00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:53.033
And, uh, we really want
to figure out

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.067
how to continue
to help you guys

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:56.868
take advantage
of that footprint.

00:08:56.868 --> 00:08:58.467
Because especially what
we're seeing from consumers,

00:08:58.467 --> 00:09:00.501
is that sort
of a "powered by YouTube."

00:09:00.501 --> 00:09:03.000
A YouTube,
you know, YouTube-enabled

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.367
is a real great driver
for demand and adoption

00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:06.434
of new devices.

00:09:06.434 --> 00:09:08.000
It's a use case
people understand.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.133
"Oh," you know,
"why do I need a new camera,

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.467
"or why do I need
a new phone?

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:12.734
"Because I can upload
easily to YouTube?

00:09:12.734 --> 00:09:15.067
Sounds great."

00:09:15.067 --> 00:09:16.634
So before I let
you guys go,

00:09:16.634 --> 00:09:18.467
and get into a little bit more
of the technical discussion,

00:09:18.467 --> 00:09:20.467
I want to talk a little bit
about three API trends,

00:09:20.467 --> 00:09:24.067
and, um, hopefully how you guys
can take advantage of this,

00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:27.367
uh, to create even more and more
successful applications.

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:30.501
Uh, the first is redefining
exactly what is video

00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:32.534
and what can be uploaded
to YouTube.

00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:34.467
So a few years back,
YouTube--

00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:35.868
I think one of the reasons
they succeeded

00:09:35.868 --> 00:09:38.934
was easiest way
to get a video file

00:09:38.934 --> 00:09:42.400
off your hard drive
and onto the web.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.868
Um, but to some extent,
sort of that basic feature,

00:09:44.868 --> 00:09:46.200
the upload button,
you know,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.367
has sort of become a commodity,
right?

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:48.767
You can find that
a lot of places.

00:09:48.767 --> 00:09:50.367
And so I think one
of the reasons

00:09:50.367 --> 00:09:52.000
that YouTube continues
to succeed,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.934
and why our, uh,
content contribution

00:09:54.934 --> 00:09:56.367
continues to grow
from the community

00:09:56.367 --> 00:09:58.434
is we're now focused
on making it easier and easier

00:09:58.434 --> 00:10:02.067
to get content--create content
right from devices.

00:10:02.067 --> 00:10:03.734
So what you see here
is a screen shot

00:10:03.734 --> 00:10:06.334
from, uh,
the video game Spore,

00:10:06.334 --> 00:10:08.067
uh, Electronic Arts
is putting out.

00:10:08.067 --> 00:10:09.834
Uh, you guys may be
familiar with this.

00:10:09.834 --> 00:10:11.601
Will Wright, the guy
who did "The Sims,"

00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:13.334
one of the best-selling games
of all time,

00:10:13.334 --> 00:10:15.234
has now taken it up
another level,

00:10:15.234 --> 00:10:17.467
and you can, uh,
essentially create a creature,

00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:19.267
uh, and inhabit
a whole world.

00:10:19.267 --> 00:10:21.033
So building buzz
for the game,

00:10:21.033 --> 00:10:23.067
they brought out
the creature creator, right?

00:10:23.067 --> 00:10:24.367
So this was sort of like
a creature modeler.

00:10:24.367 --> 00:10:25.434
You can play--and they're
actually running

00:10:25.434 --> 00:10:26.667
a really cool contest
on YouTube

00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:28.400
where you sort of
make your creature dance.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.934
And, uh--
and you can win.

00:10:29.934 --> 00:10:32.133
So what they did
was use our upload API

00:10:32.133 --> 00:10:34.434
directly in
the application itself.

00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:36.634
So with one click,
you start doing screen capture,

00:10:36.634 --> 00:10:38.067
and can upload
to YouTube

00:10:38.067 --> 00:10:39.868
using your user name
and password

00:10:39.868 --> 00:10:42.400
without ever
even leaving Spore,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.300
or without ever having
to come to YouTube.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.033
So before as where you thought
that the output

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:48.667
of, you know,
a video file

00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:49.968
would be something
that came from a camera.

00:10:49.968 --> 00:10:51.334
Now, more and more,
you can think,

00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:54.167
"Wow, anything people are doing
that I can capture,

00:10:54.167 --> 00:10:55.501
"and turn into a file,
and upload

00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:57.000
is something
that people want to share."

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.868
And of course, this turned into
a lot of creative, uh, things.

00:11:00.868 --> 00:11:02.734
You may have
heard about sporn,

00:11:02.734 --> 00:11:04.234
um, which is, uh--

00:11:04.234 --> 00:11:07.667
Let's just call them
genetically enhanced,

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.200
uh, creatures.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.767
Um, I won't go into it.

00:11:11.767 --> 00:11:13.400
If you haven't heard it before
and you're interested,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.834
just search for it
on YouTube and you'll see.

00:11:15.834 --> 00:11:18.434
But, uh, if you have kids
in the room, hide their eyes.

00:11:18.434 --> 00:11:21.667
Um, the second trend,
uh, anthropomorphic dogs.

00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:24.334
No, it's actually more
about how to make use

00:11:24.334 --> 00:11:27.567
of YouTube's community
to build your application,

00:11:27.567 --> 00:11:29.200
to build your community.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.601
So what we're seeing,
of course,

00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:33.167
is lots of people who want
to put content into YouTube

00:11:33.167 --> 00:11:34.901
directly from their application.

00:11:34.901 --> 00:11:36.667
Uh, this is, uh, Dogbook.

00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:39.801
Uh, a dog community, and, uh,
has a Facebook application.

00:11:39.801 --> 00:11:43.467
And you can upload there
directly from Facebook.

00:11:43.467 --> 00:11:44.767
But what we're seeing
more and more,

00:11:44.767 --> 00:11:46.634
are people making use
of the presence on YouTube

00:11:46.634 --> 00:11:49.000
to help drive
awareness and traffic

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.434
back to their application.

00:11:50.434 --> 00:11:51.601
And that's great,

00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:53.200
we love that
bidirectional aspect of it.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.567
What are some ways
you can do that?

00:11:54.567 --> 00:11:56.434
Um, well, obviously,
you can sort of

00:11:56.434 --> 00:11:58.434
insert metadata
and tag the source.

00:11:58.434 --> 00:12:02.100
You can put a URL
into, um, the metadata file.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.567
You know, "created on
www.url.com,"

00:12:05.567 --> 00:12:07.133
and it allows
the YouTube community,

00:12:07.133 --> 00:12:08.400
as they find your videos,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.701
to go and then experience
your service

00:12:10.701 --> 00:12:12.801
in the context of the way
you're building it.

00:12:12.801 --> 00:12:14.167
So I think that's
gonna be some place

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:15.901
where folks who love
to do sort of, you know, like,

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.601
A/B testing
and other things...

00:12:17.601 --> 00:12:18.701
we don't know
all the answers yet.

00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:20.067
You're probably
gonna find out

00:12:20.067 --> 00:12:21.400
what's the best way
to make the YouTube community

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.067
aware of services outside
of the YouTube.com world.

00:12:24.067 --> 00:12:26.467
Um, but we definitely want
to support that.

00:12:26.467 --> 00:12:28.734
Uh, and the third are
really, really innovative

00:12:28.734 --> 00:12:30.667
and interesting, uh,

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:34.033
displays of the,
uh, YouTube content.

00:12:34.033 --> 00:12:35.634
So one things we know--
one thing we know

00:12:35.634 --> 00:12:38.834
is that, um, there's no way
that YouTube.com

00:12:38.834 --> 00:12:42.334
can help users find all
the content they're looking for

00:12:42.334 --> 00:12:44.334
in all the ways
they want to find it, right?

00:12:44.334 --> 00:12:45.601
So for instance,
I always joke

00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:47.534
that I'd love to see
a view of content

00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:49.167
that sort of shows me
what was, uh, you know--

00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:50.834
sort of the time machine.

00:12:50.834 --> 00:12:53.734
What was on, uh, TV when I was,
you know, eight years old?

00:12:53.734 --> 00:12:56.901
Or what were things that
were filmed on this date?

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.534
Um, and, you know, we try
to make all these things

00:12:59.534 --> 00:13:01.000
come to life.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.434
But with a corpus
that's just so large,

00:13:03.434 --> 00:13:05.133
a lot of these needs
are going to be met

00:13:05.133 --> 00:13:07.467
not on YouTube.com,
but outside.

00:13:07.467 --> 00:13:09.534
Uh, and so this is a cool
application called "TimeTube,"

00:13:09.534 --> 00:13:11.200
from a start-up,
uh, Dipity,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.467
which, uh,
using the API,

00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:16.067
plots for particular concepts,

00:13:16.067 --> 00:13:18.167
uh, videos along a timeline,

00:13:18.167 --> 00:13:22.834
as well as relative, um,
priority and relevance ranking.

00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:26.033
And so this is, uh,
the history of "Chocolate Rain."

00:13:26.033 --> 00:13:28.601
Uh, and, uh,
all started with a dream,

00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:31.667
and then, uh, became, uh--
became a phenomenon.

00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:33.300
So, uh, in wrapping up,

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.434
basically, I think
the storyline here is that

00:13:35.434 --> 00:13:38.067
YouTube is built
on openness.

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:41.834
Uh, we succeeded
because we took a first step

00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:43.467
when not a lot of people
were thinking

00:13:43.467 --> 00:13:45.501
about pushing content out
across the web,

00:13:45.501 --> 00:13:46.801
uh, with our embedded player.

00:13:46.801 --> 00:13:48.667
And since that time,
have tried to move quickly

00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:52.300
to push more and more
of that into the APIs.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.801
Uh, I think one
of the most interesting features

00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:58.701
that we've done this year
is the chromeless API,

00:13:58.701 --> 00:14:01.033
that Jeff will do a little bit
more of a talk on later today,

00:14:01.033 --> 00:14:03.968
which basically says "Hey,
here's just a video stream,

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:05.367
"build whatever application--

00:14:05.367 --> 00:14:07.133
whatever player you want
around this."

00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:08.801
Um, but at the end
of the day,

00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:10.234
the magic isn't gonna come
I think

00:14:10.234 --> 00:14:11.667
just from the tool set
we enable.

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:13.767
It's gonna come from what
you guys do on top of it.

00:14:13.767 --> 00:14:15.367
So, um, if anything,

00:14:15.367 --> 00:14:17.367
I hope today is sort of
a call to action to inspire you

00:14:17.367 --> 00:14:18.934
not only from
what you hear from us,

00:14:18.934 --> 00:14:20.334
but from talking
with one another.
