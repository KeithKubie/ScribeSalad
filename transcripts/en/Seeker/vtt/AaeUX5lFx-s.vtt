00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.789
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
HARRY’S.

00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:04.490
So, it's cold and flu season.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.490
That sucks.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.339
But whenever I feel crappy, I can't tell if
I've got the cold, or the flu -- does it matter?

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.450
What's the difference?!

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:23.720
When I get a cough, or a headache or whatever
for a few days, I always assume it will go

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.520
away, or that I just have a cold… but sometimes…
it's the FLU!

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.630
Even though the medicine says its for both
the cold and the flu, they're entirely different

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.630
viruses.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.230
The common cold is caused by over 200 different
viruses!

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.520
Coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, metapneumoviruses,
enteroviruses and parainfluenza viruses all

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.630
make the short list; but they really are all
different.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.120
This is why we can't "cure" the common cold.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.840
The flu, on the other hand, is caused by influenza
viruses.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.470
These respiratory viruses invade the body
and set up shop and cause very similar symptoms,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.360
because the human body only has so many ways
to fight.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.320
When your body is invaded by a virus, chances
are you'll get the same symptoms every time,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.520
dry or sore throat, coughing and sneezing,
mild fever, congestion and maybe a headache.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.740
Pretty standard stuff.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.830
If it's REALLY bad, you'll get aches and pains
and exhaustion too.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.340
This happens because your body is spending
resources fighting off the viral infection.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.380
In general, flu is worse than the common cold,
the fever is higher, the aches and level of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.770
exhaustion are more pronounced, and the cough
can be more intense.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.580
While there's almost no way to tell the difference
between the two infections… colds tend to

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.330
produce a fever less than 101 (38C), affects
the throat and cause a runny nose.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.000
The flu, affects the lungs and the joints
-- so you're likely to feel more achy than

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
leaky.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.200
Telling the difference is one thing, but once
you're infected you only have a couple days

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.220
to get treatment.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.270
After the first 48 hours, the infection has
usually stopped multiplying and is wreaking

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.290
havoc on the body instead.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.210
Regardless, once symptoms start for viral
infections, there's no simple cure.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.439
Antibiotics WILL NOT HELP, because they fight
BACTERIA not VIRUSES.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.950
Taking an antibacterial drug during a viral
infection is pointless.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.090
In fact, a lot of the remedies for colds and
the flu aren't really based on… well science.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.430
Many people take vitamin C like it's going
out of style, but a study from the University

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.370
of Alberta looked at results and found there's
really no evidence that it helps.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.739
Results suggest it MIGHT help with marathon
runners who have compromised immune systems

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.431
due to exhaustion, but even then it's a minor
help.

00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:37.540
I like to take zinc when I'm starting to feel
ill, and science DOES support that.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.980
Zinc is used by human immune cells as a catalyst,
so when you boost the amount of zinc your

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.930
immune cells can protect the body a bit better,
but too much can damage it -- so don't overmedicate.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.560
In the end, a cold will persist for 10 days,
while some flu symptoms will persist for three

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.170
weeks; long after the influenza virus has
been eradicated.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.920
If you REALLY want to avoid getting sick,
get a flu vaccination.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.530
Only 30 percent of surveyed adults get vaccinated
year over year.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.910
Flu vaccines are made every year by specialists
who use massive datasets to predict which

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.670
influenza viruses will dominate this season
-- see, there's more than one mutation, and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.230
they vie for power and bodies to infect.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.409
The 2014 flu vaccine will protect against
Influenza A H1N1 and H3N2, as well as a couple

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:28.510
influenza B viruses.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.320
You might recognize H1N1, we're still seeing
that left over from 2009's unexpected flu

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.320
epidemic!

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320
Crazy right?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.540
So yes, there IS a difference between colds
and flu, but if you catch one of the over

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.220
200 viruses that cause these crappy feelings
the best way to handle it is to drink fluids

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.980
and help keep yourself hydrated and rest.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.030
If you minimize nutritional strain on your
immune system by enjoying warm chicken soup

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.370
and let your immune system do it's work, you'll
be fine.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.959
Empathy can also help, studies have shown
people who have families or even an empathetic

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.341
doctor recover faster than those who don't
so help out a friend if they're sick, but

00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:06.739
don't catch it yourself.

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.060
If you insist on medication, decongestants
and antihistamines will treat the symptoms

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.559
of both cold and flu, but again -- don't take
antibacterial meds unless you know it's a

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:21.629
bacterial infection -- that's something a
doctor can tell you.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:24.960
And speaking of stuff you keep in the medicine
cabinet, if you’re looking for a good razor

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.089
to shave with try Harry's!

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:30.819
Harry's was started by a couple guys who liked
shaving so much that bought a razor factory

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.180
to make their own.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.720
They're cheap, they show up at your door,
and they're sharp both in look and… well,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.720
sharpness.
