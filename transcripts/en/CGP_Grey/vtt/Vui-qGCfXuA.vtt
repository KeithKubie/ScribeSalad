00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.120
When it comes to neighbors, most countries
have several options: like North to Canada

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.440
or South to Mexico.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.280
But there are countries that don't have this
freedom of choice, not because they're islands

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.679
but because they're trapped in another country.

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:17.070
For example: tiny Vatican City, which fits
inside of not just Italy, but also just Rome.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.410
How Vatican City got surrounded is complicated,
but not unique for there is also the Republic

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.120
of San Marino, home to 30,000 citizens which
Italy also completely surrounds.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.500
Italy, apparently, is a country that likes
countries in its country.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.410
But trapping nations is not just Italy's thing
for there's also Lesotho, in South Africa

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.890
which is both the largest encircled country
at 70 times Vatican City's size and the most

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.440
populated with over 2,000,000 citizens.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.960
The thing that makes these three countries'
borders bizarre is that any path in or out

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.010
must go through the one and only neighbor
they have.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.090
But now take a look at The Gambia, which excluding
that tiny ocean border, is as surrounded as

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.510
any nation can get.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.240
If we amend the previous rule to every land
route, now we've made a category of single-neighbored

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.240
nations.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.320
Which includes all four of these and countries
like Portugal, where the only way in or out

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.510
is through Spain.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.740
Who else is on this list?

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.650
Well, there's Monaco which must go through
France, Qatar through Saudi Arabia Denmark

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.549
through Germany, South Korea through North
Korea (though South Korea might as well be

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.119
an island nation for most practical travel
purposes)

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.760
East Timor and Papua New Guinea both through
Indonesia, Brunei through Malaysia

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.820
And there are two sets of twins: there is
The Dominican Republic whose only neighbor

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.770
is Haiti and Haiti, whose only neighbor is
The Dominican Republic.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.790
And the second set is: Ireland through the
United Kingdom and the United Kingdom through

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.790
Ireland.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.790
A side note here:

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.120
While there are tons of 'British' places around
the world, some of which border other nations

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.340
-- these are not part of the United Kingdom.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.420
It's complicated.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.340
Though if you wanted to, you could argue that
the United Kingdom technically dug a land

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.560
border under the channel to the continent,
presumably to be closer to France, her best

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.560
friend ever.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.790
Finally, there's one more country in this
category: Canada: the largest single-neighbored,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.620
nation in the world.
