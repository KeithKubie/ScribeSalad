00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.679
This is a bar of glycerin soap. It'll moisturize
and soften your skin, and it even smells like

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.320
cinnamon. Who would have guessed it's actually made out of bacon. In this project we're making

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.300
this natural bar of shower soap, from a pack
of bacon, and some household drain cleaner.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.010
For this project we're gonna need a 1lb
pack of "American Style" bacon, and some crystal

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.240
drain cleaner. I'm using this one because
it's 100% lye, which in this case is pure

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.300
Sodium Hydroxide. Now let's go ahead and get
the frozen bacon out of the package and begin

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.960
chopping it into strips. The thinner you make
your strips, the better this is gonna work,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.260
and by the time you're done cutting, the meaty
slab should look something like this. American

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.960
style bacon has a lot of fat, and to get it
out, we'll need a good sized cooking pot,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.600
with a lid. Let's go ahead and transfer this,
into the pot, making sure the bits of bacon,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.329
are getting separated. That's just gonna
help it cook a lot better. Now we can go ahead

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.590
and move this onto the stove, and add the
lid, to help trap the heat. We're gonna

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.689
render the fat, out of this bacon, and the
temperature needs to be set very low. My gauge

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.770
settled right around 95ÂºC, and that seemed
to work great. After about 8 hours of simmering

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.630
you'll have a pot full of cooked bacon. Now
believe it or not, this smells so good, your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.590
mouth will be watering. But don't eat it yet,
because we've got work to do. The sizzling

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.920
liquid in the pot, is rendered pork fat, and
if we use the lid as a strainer, we should

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.409
be able to get most of it out. Now chances
are that some small impurities will get through

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.450
as well, so the easiest way to purify the
fat, is to mix it with some water. You can

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.920
see that it instantly separates into two layers, where the impurities sink to the bottom,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.380
and the clarified fat, floats to the top. 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.460
I put this batch in a separate bowl, and let i firm up in the fridge overnight, so the fat could be skimmed off the top.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.460
The end result is a beautiful, food-grade, ball of lard, and some people actually use this for baking.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.260
Now it looks like we got about 70 grams, so
our soap recipe will be based off that.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.290
To make this into soap, we'll need to re-melt
the lard on low heat, and while that's warming

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.970
up, we can measure out the next two ingredients.
Let's weigh out 26 grams of distilled water,

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.060
followed by 9 grams of sodium hydroxide. This
will need to be mixed thoroughly, and before

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.170
you try this yourself, make sure you're fully
aware of the hazards, listed on your bottle

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.760
of lye . When the solution is crystal clear
again, it's ready to be added to the melted

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.379
fat, so carefully pour it in, and start mixing
it together. Now, I chose to mix this by hand,

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.129
and the method that works well for me, is
to stir constantly for the first 5 minutes,

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.650
then come back every 5 minutes after that,
and stir for another 2. We're looking for

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.510
the mixture to thicken up, and after about
25 minutes, it's got the consistency of a

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.410
thick gravy. After 35 minutes it looks like
vanilla pudding. When the mix is tracing like

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.550
this, we can and add some color, and some
fragrance. Now I like the smell of this, essential

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.730
oil. It's called "Cassia", and 7 drops into
the mix, will make it smell like cinnamon.

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.959
Let's follow that with 7 drops of red food
coloring, and you can see when it all gets

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.749
mixed together, everything turns a bright
pink. Now to make this look like a real bar

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:31.060
of soap, I fashioned a little soap mold out
of silicone, and you can see the soap mix

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.060
is just runny enough to fill it up. The last
step is to let our bar of soap, saponify.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.090
Let's go ahead and turn the oven light on,
and place the mold inside, with the oven door

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.879
closed, for about 24 hours. Just the heat
from the oven light, is enough to help cure

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.099
the soap, and hardens it to the point where
we can release it from the mold. And there

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.290
you have it. A fresh bar of homemade soap.
Now you could use this right now, but it's

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.389
still pretty soft, and might need to cure
a little bit longer. If you let your soap

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.029
age for a few weeks, it'll be noticeably firmer, and will last a lot longer in the shower. 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:10.249
Just for fun lets use some litness paper to test the PH. 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:16.149
According to this the PH value is somewhere between 7 and 8 making this bar slightly alcholine.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:20.809
In any case, you'll be able to tell if its done by giving the bar a little lick.

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:23.289
If it tastes like soap, it is!

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.750
On the other hand, if it feels like you're getting
zapped by a 9 volt battery, it needs a little

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.820
more time to cure.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.580
If we use the soap to wash our hands, you

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.680
can see it suds up the way you'd expect it
should. And because we didn't take the glycerin

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.280
out, its got a smooth, creamy lather, that
helps moisturize and soften your skin.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.270
Well now you know how to make a beautiful bar of soap, from household

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.010
drain cleaner, and a pack of bacon.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.920
By the way, rather than throwing away your bacon meat,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.320
try spreading it out on paper towels to make a batch of homemade bacon bits.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.460
We used these ones for dinner, on our baked potatoes.
Well that's it for now. If you liked this

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.820
project perhaps you'll like some of my others.
