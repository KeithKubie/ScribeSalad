00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:02.627
- Hey, I'm Mickey.

00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:03.837
Let's come on in.

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:06.256
Gonna get to it.
[bell rings]

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:07.882
<i>Me and a buddy of mine,</i>

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:09.676
<i>we started putting stuff
together here in the shop.</i>

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.678
<i>Right here,
we got a 42-ton press</i>

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.097
<i>that we worked on
putting together,</i>

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.516
and it's made out of
this big ol' I-beam here.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:20.019
Just getting the I-beam in
with nothing else on it,

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.813
I think it took
about six of us,

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.940
and there was
a good possibility that,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.692
if that thing would've fell,
it would've killed somebody.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.193
Trust me.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.154
<i>I started off--I heard
that a couple files</i>

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.613
<i>would make a good knife.</i>

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:31.740
Back then,
I didn't have nothing

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.616
but a stone grinding wheel.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:36.161
I'd grind out a knife,
put a little deer antler on it,

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.204
and happened to
see my taxidermist.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.206
<i>And the next thing you know,
she says,</i>

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.791
"Hey, can you make two of those
for me for Christmas?"

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.209
So I just figured,
you know, hey,

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.711
<i>I can make a little money
at this,</i>

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.379
<i>and one thing led
to another one,</i>

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.424
and I've been making knifes
for over 15 years now.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.593
I--see, and I love
every minute of it.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.636
It's a--
it's an addiction.

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.263
- I'm Cullen Erbacher.

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:59.100
This is my humble shop-slash-
yard equipment storage-

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.811
slash-winter storage shed,
so...

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.438
It's multi-purpose.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.315
Inside I have a folding table.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.900
I have a work bench I built.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.153
It's got my vise.
My coal forge is back there.

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.113
Plus I got
my small grinder here

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:13.740
and I got my drill press.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.284
Usually before and after
I work, I have a pipe,

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.995
just to--it helps me think,
work things out

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.455
in my brain
before I do something,

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.248
and then, when I'm done
with something,

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.417
I'll have one to think about
what I just did.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.961
What did I do wrong?
What did I do right?

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.463
How would I do differently?

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.799
It just kind of helps me think.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.343
- That out there is Ugly Betty.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:34.469
It looks ugly,

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.262
but that gas forge out there

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.307
will weld just about anything
you put in it.

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:43.269
<i>Other stuff we make besides
just blades at times.</i>

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.063
We made some dogwood flowers.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:46.606
We're getting ready to make
a lamp out of them

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.775
and put the dogwood flowers
at the bottom.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.945
We make snakes
out of horseshoe rasps.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.571
Just take 'em
and fold 'em over.

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:54.739
Shape it out.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.074
This is the start
of a hummingbird.

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:57.617
Right here, we forge out
hummingbirds,

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.494
so we do
a little ornamental stuff.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.871
Any time you can make
something different

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.289
over at the forge,

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.124
you're working on
your hammer control anyway,

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.627
and you can use that knowledge
you got to make blades with,

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.462
make it quicker,
simple, easier.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:12.465
It's what we do at the shop.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.592
[birds singing]

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:15.802
<i>♪ ♪</i>

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.303
<i>- Some of this equipment
or stuff</i>

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.597
<i>that I have
that means a lot to me.</i>

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:21.224
This hammer head
actually belonged

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.017
to my paternal grandfather.

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:25.937
He had it when he was working
on the railroads in D.C.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.313
I decided to use that

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.107
as my primary hammer
for blacksmithing.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.651
This is a pocket watch
that says "grandpa."

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.236
This was a gift
because I just recently

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.113
became a grandfather this year.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.365
So, I don't know,
maybe down the road,

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.117
I'll be turning
this hammer over

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.702
to my grandson
when he's old enough.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.579
So that's it.
That's my shop.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.206
These are some things
that mean a lot to me,

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:46.499
that help me
get through things,

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.167
you know,
connects me to history.

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:51.087
And enough of that.
Ready to get working.
