RAHUL GAIROLA: Should we
being with some context

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.740
or do folks have questions?

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.000
I reckon there are probably
a bunch of questions.

00:03:11.262 --> 00:03:13.913
AUDIENCE: Have things gotten
worse in the three years

00:03:13.913 --> 00:03:15.118
since you've made this film?

00:03:15.118 --> 00:03:18.394
I mean, this is pretty
terrifying stuff.

00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:19.810
SAAD KHAN: The
only answer to that

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.410
would be, I'm here
now after three years.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.470
But I do work in Pakistan.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.140
I made that film
three years ago.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.960
It was played at almost
50 film festivals.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.100
And last year I shot this film--
you just saw the trailer--

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.950
and just like the
first film it was very,

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.800
like, gonzo, very--
you know, really

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:56.360
had to do it like hiding from
the authorities, I should say.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.370
But yeah.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.950
I mean, this one
was more dangerous

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.150
because we had to go to
villages and towns of Pakistan.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.860
So yeah.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.570
We just had like a three-person
crew and that is what we did.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.060
The first one was-- it
was shot in two weekends,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.430
but we spent like a month
and a half with the community

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.030
because it's really hard
to get into that community.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.840
So there was a whole lot of
time researching with them,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.020
and there's a lot
of handycam footage

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.751
which also ended
up into the film.

00:04:35.751 --> 00:04:36.250
So yeah.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.540
I mean, the film
was never played.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.800
The first film that you
saw-- the film that you saw

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.080
was not played in Pakistan
for two, two and a half years.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.150
And last year in November
we played it at our own film

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.340
festival that we did, and
it's for sexual minorities

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.820
in Pakistan.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.070
It's funny because we don't
even have a film festival.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.944
We had one film festival
called the Kara Film

00:04:57.944 --> 00:05:07.140
Festival, which was canceled
because they didn't have money.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.410
So in November we started
this film festival

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.290
for transgender and sexual
minorities in Pakistan.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.332
That's where we played the
film, in Islamabad and Lahore.

00:05:17.332 --> 00:05:19.540
So that was the first time
it was played in Pakistan.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.873
RAHUL GAIROLA: And I think
one of the interesting things

00:05:21.873 --> 00:05:25.430
about-- because I remember, I
believe I was at the premiere.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.226
Wasn't it the United
States premiere in Seattle?

00:05:29.226 --> 00:05:29.850
SAAD KHAN: Yes.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.180
No.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.721
Actually, no.

00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:32.440
Frameline was the premiere.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.660
Frameline, San Francisco.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.650
RAHUL GAIROLA: But one thing
that you folks might not

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.110
be aware of is,
despite-- because I

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.827
remember hearing from Saad
on how difficult it was.

00:05:40.827 --> 00:05:42.410
You almost had to
sneak around, right?

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.860
Because there are even
goons and spies and so on.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.660
But this is even in
light of the fact

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.930
that since 2012 Pakistan is one
of the first countries in South

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.700
Asia to actually have
a law that recognizes

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.380
the so-called third sex.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.030
This didn't happen
in India until 2014.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.160
And right now Thailand in
this year is considering this.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.540
But this really,
in a sense, when

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.110
we think about
queer identity or we

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.210
think about being
progressive in the ways

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.997
that we think about
gender, sexuality-- I

00:06:10.997 --> 00:06:12.970
mean, here in this
country it's blowing up

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.460
because Hillary just announced
her intent to run, right?

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.146
And we think that
that's, you know--

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:21.460
the leaders of the free
world or the so-called West

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.920
are so innovative and
progressive with gender,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.950
and actually these
kinds of things

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.800
have been a part of
South Asian culture,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.580
iconography, and even
legally since 2012.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.510
We don't even have,
in the United States,

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.410
a third sex or a so-called
"third gender" recognized.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.950
SAAD KHAN: So its third
gender law, which means now

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.040
we have three options
on our identity card.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.170
We have the male, the female,
and a third gender option.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.130
So anyone who's transgender
or, as we call it,

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.540
khawaja sara, which
is an umbrella term,

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.260
and you put all of gender
and sexual minorities in it

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.540
so they can opt for that.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.210
But no one really opts
for it because then they

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.380
can't travel to the
UAE and they can't

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.700
go to Saudi Arabia
for the pilgrimage.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.030
And also you don't have that
option on your passport.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.260
So, I mean, people
are saying it's

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:23.760
a step towards identifying
transgender rights,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.500
but no one's really
opting for it.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.432
RAHUL GAIROLA: And
something else-- yeah.

00:07:28.432 --> 00:07:29.390
Thanks for the context.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.120
And something else
that may interest

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.770
you folks in terms of thinking
about what you've just seen,

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.250
and surely when you go and
see "Showgirls," and also

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.110
in the context of other
queer or gay or lesbian,

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.605
LGBTQ visual texts that
you might have seen--

00:07:42.605 --> 00:07:44.480
I'm sure everyone's seen
"Brokeback Mountain"

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.270
and other more popular
sort of American texts--

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:53.470
but one thing to note, if you
saw at the end, the writing

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.790
at the end said that Kami was
arrested under section 377.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.790
And it's important to
know, this is actually

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:05.549
a pan-British colony section,
so when the British colonized

00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:07.090
a lot of the countries
in the world--

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.464
as you may or may
not have known,

00:08:08.464 --> 00:08:12.290
the presence in South Asia
was for over two centuries--

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.160
they instituted the
British penal code

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:20.440
377 which criminalizes any
sexual acts against nature

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.400
or any sexual acts that
articulate offenses

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.770
against nature.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.500
This is even just same sex.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.050
It can even be
queer sex, or sodomy

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.880
between heterosexual couples.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.270
But what you saw
there, that's also

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.580
the same law that is--
there's a huge civil rights

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.320
movement right now in India
right now to repeal that.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.830
So it's also interesting to
me how his work-- I mean,

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.620
both the films, because the
new one as well-- is really

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.030
challenging not just the
conventions of gender

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:57.030
and sexuality but also how those
conventions have been inherited

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.060
and instituted in
the legal code that

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.440
was inherited by the
former colonizers,

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.730
the former oppressors.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.370
Which I find really interesting.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.610
Because when we
think about the ways

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:15.370
that queer phobia,
sexism, misogyny, and also

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.985
Islamophobia-- I have to bring
that up because, you know,

00:09:17.985 --> 00:09:19.910
we're in the US.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.550
And our country tends
to-- certain people

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.600
from certain places often get
demonized in certain ways.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.300
But it's ironic that
even in the wake of all

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.870
that we see these kinds
of representations.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.480
And for me that makes it
really important to question

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.570
how liberal really are
Western conceptions of gender,

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.230
sexuality?

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.130
Especially when these laws,
section 377-- that is British

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.010
instituted.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.690
And that's the
actual history of it.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.890
SAAD KHAN: So yeah.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.780
India was trying
to get rid of it.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.220
And they did get rid of it,
but they reinstated that.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.170
But in Pakistan in
the '80s-- so we

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.350
have the same law, the
anti-homosexuality law.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.280
But the penalties--
like, after the '80s

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.510
there was a dictator,
Zia-ul-Haq--

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.380
the penalties are now Islamic.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.200
So the penalties
are based on Sharia.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.625
So it's the same law
bequeathed from the British Raj

00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:19.880
or from Great Britain,
and it's the same law

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:26.200
but the penalties now
are based on Sharia.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.800
That is the difference
in Pakistan,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.660
which means that
you can get, like,

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:36.160
a certain number of
lashes if you're gay.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.890
Never really happens,
but that's the law.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.210
Let's talk about
if you guys have

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.640
any questions about the-- yeah.

00:10:45.564 --> 00:10:49.994
AUDIENCE: What are the issues
about safety of your subjects?

00:10:49.994 --> 00:10:50.910
SAAD KHAN: Definitely.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.826
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:54.874 --> 00:10:55.671
SAAD KHAN: So--

00:10:55.671 --> 00:10:57.004
AUDIENCE: Were there issues of--

00:10:57.004 --> 00:10:59.954
RAHUL GAIROLA: There
are mics on the sides

00:10:59.954 --> 00:11:01.766
if folks wanted to
speak into them.

00:11:01.766 --> 00:11:03.390
SAAD KHAN: So he
asked if there were

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.540
any issues about the
safety of the subjects.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.660
For "Hide and
Seek," the subjects

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.530
traveled with us to film
festivals in Copenhagen,

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.835
Bangkok, and in Australia.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.910
That was definitely
like the main concern,

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.380
and that's why we didn't
show the film in Pakistan.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.300
And also it was just
shown in film festivals.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.130
We didn't give any
big interviews.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.220
This is a question which is
very relevant to my new film,

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.130
because the trailer
was online for six days

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.200
because we had to get funding
for our post-production.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.300
And it was on
Indiegogo and it was

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.990
just like picked up
by Pakistani media

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.710
and also like
international media.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.200
And they started
writing about it.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:58.740
And that led to threats to the
girls and us, and in six days

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.250
we have to take it off.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.640
So we're still dealing
with the second film.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.010
We don't know how
we're going to do it.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.890
I don't-- we're still
thinking about it.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.540
But the first film, you
know, it's been three years.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.851
Kami was arrested twice.

00:12:16.851 --> 00:12:18.350
But that was because
he was-- I mean

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.790
he was coming from
the screening,

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.930
and to be honest he was
arrested because the police said

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.250
he looked too flamboyant, like
he looked like too effeminate

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.210
on the airport and that's
why he was arrested.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.400
Yeah, but he was out
in like three nights.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.680
[? Waseem ?], on the other hand,
we never got in touch with him.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:45.670
Because as you could see,
he was raped by his uncle.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:52.460
He uses the word rape,
but that's like-- yeah.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.860
It just means sex in Urdu.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.220
He doesn't-- that is
the word that he uses.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.160
And the guy was
praying at the back

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.680
when I took him to the rooftop,
from the room to the rooftop.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.840
We only had three or
four hours with him.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.290
And from the room to the
rooftop, and he was over there,

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.470
and the film starts and he's
like, my uncle's watching me.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.780
And I'm like, what is he--
why is he watching us?

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.370
And he's like, he's afraid I'm
going to tell you the truth.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.720
So that was the uncle
who had the kid who

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.070
was also in the film.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:28.780
And when he figured it out, he
had to-- him and his father,

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.510
they pushed us out of the house.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.940
And we tried to get
in touch with him,

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.560
and always his father
used to pick up

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.380
or his uncles used to pick up.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.399
This year, at my
brother's wedding--

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:41.940
because he was a
wedding entertainer,

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.530
at my brother's wedding, he
was a wedding entertainer.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.680
And I saw him after,
like, three years.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.790
And I told him about
the film, because he

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:53.552
was the only one who didn't
know what happened to the film.

00:13:53.552 --> 00:13:54.760
So I told him about the film.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.940
He was really happy.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.315
And he was telling
me that he was

00:13:57.315 --> 00:14:02.220
going to go to Dubai to be
a wedding entertainer there.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.290
[? Jenny ?], on the
other hand, in the film

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.280
she's really depressed
because she was not

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.650
allowed by her college
to fully transition,

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:17.260
and was obviously
dealing with issues

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.780
with her religious
identity, and also she

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.570
comes from a tribal family in
[INAUDIBLE] so she was dealing

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.970
with a lot of issues and
obviously she was not

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.170
allowed to fully transition.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.810
That is a problem
she's dealing with.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.700
But last year she came to
the screening in Pakistan,

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.040
in Islamabad.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.230
And she was-- that
was the first time

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.890
she saw the film in public.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.059
And she is happy.

00:14:45.059 --> 00:14:46.100
She's fully transitioned.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.100
She lives as a woman
in Islamabad now.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.300
So things have changed
in three years.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.196
AUDIENCE: I wanted to know
about Kami's boyfriend-- what

00:14:55.196 --> 00:14:58.668
happened to him, and
is he outwardly gay?

00:14:58.668 --> 00:15:01.644
Is he publicly gay in
Pakistan where he workds?

00:15:01.644 --> 00:15:06.310
SAAD KHAN: Yeah, Kami's--
Kami's-- Kami's simply--

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.170
I was telling him I was
listening to Kami again--

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.295
AUDIENCE: Kami's boyfriend.

00:15:10.295 --> 00:15:11.440
SAAD KHAN: Yeah.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.534
I was just telling him
that Kami himself is like--

00:15:13.534 --> 00:15:15.200
RAHUL GAIROLA: I'm
not Kami's boyfriend.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.783
SAAD KHAN: No.

00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:18.410
But I was telling him,
Kami's simply love.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.570
Like he's great.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.390
He's so brave, and
so is his boyfriend.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.880
He's from [INAUDIBLE],
lives in Karachi.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.260
Yes, he's openly gay in a way
that his family doesn't know.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.390
But yeah, he works as
an editor in Karachi.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.158
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:40.158 --> 00:15:41.035
SAAD KHAN: Yeah.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:44.380
Yeah.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.700
He wanted to be there.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.060
We actually recorded a long
interview with him as well,

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.070
but it didn't make
it to the cut.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.804
But yeah, he was in the film.

00:15:54.804 --> 00:15:57.294
AUDIENCE: I really
enjoyed the film.

00:15:57.294 --> 00:16:00.033
Two questions-- how did you come
to select the four individuals

00:16:00.033 --> 00:16:00.780
that you did?

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.768
What was the rationale behind
selecting those four people?

00:16:03.768 --> 00:16:07.254
And my second question is,
what was your overall objective

00:16:07.254 --> 00:16:08.748
with making a film like this?

00:16:08.748 --> 00:16:13.230
What were you trying to achieve?

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.140
SAAD KHAN: If I really
get into the details,

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.470
it was three years ago.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.080
I was studying at
Boston University

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.320
and I wrote a short story, and
it had a transgender character

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:23.820
in it.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.460
I tried to get funding for
that film, that short film,

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.840
and obviously I couldn't
get funding for it.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.170
I got back home, put it
up online, got in touch

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.640
with the producer of this film.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.800
He wanted to produce that.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.290
And I told him, like--
he was Danish Pakistani,

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.920
but really hadn't been to
Pakistan in a long time.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.520
So I told him that if he wants
to do my short film, which

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.940
deals with a few transgender
people, he needs to come down

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.560
and we should research.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.960
So he came down to Lahore
and we started researching,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.230
and got in touch
with one person,

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:04.510
and then it's like--
through that person

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.839
we got in touch with a
bunch of other people.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.260
And we were--
initially we wanted

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:17.119
to have some-- talk to some
lesbian subjects, as well.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.119
But they were obviously
at that time not willing.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.510
There was also this guy who was
[INAUDIBLE] of a mosque, which

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.400
means he calls the prayer.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.490
And he was like
[INAUDIBLE] cleric.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.230
And he wanted to
give the interview,

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.927
but he didn't show
up the first time.

00:17:37.927 --> 00:17:40.260
We scheduled it again, he
didn't show up the second time

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:40.780
as well.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.110
So this happened with
like a bunch of people.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:47.320
And as you can see, the film is
like we never really planned.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.470
We never really knew what was
going to happen in those days

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.340
when we were shooting.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.750
But it was all about the
community, the community

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.850
that we got into
and spent time with.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.490
My producer actually spent
most of his time with them.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:06.780
And that's how we got
in touch with them.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.410
And we still are in touch with,
except [? Waseem ?], all three

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.600
of our characters.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.700
And [? Neli ?] was the guest
of honor at the Copenhagen LGBT

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:24.550
pride parade two years ago, and
she was also at the premiere.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:29.150
And yeah, so we really
believed to have our subjects

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:34.260
and they should also be a part
of the success of the film.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.540
What was the motive.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:42.030
I think it was
really because I'm

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:46.795
interested in groups on
the fringes of the society,

00:18:46.795 --> 00:18:49.730
especially Pakistani society,
because I grew up in Lahore.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:57.270
And growing up in a
very rundown area,

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.490
I used to peep
outside of my window

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.900
and there used to be
transgender groups who come

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.075
and perform, like,
every weekend.

00:19:06.075 --> 00:19:07.450
They used to
perform in the '90s.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.910
Now it's-- I mean, it doesn't
really happen that much.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.209
And they used to
come and dance, and I

00:19:14.209 --> 00:19:16.000
used to peep outside
of my window as a kid,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.960
and I was like really fascinated
but also kind of afraid,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.620
because I didn't know
what to make of them.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:30.190
Because obviously
they're ostracized by us,

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.440
but then they were also very
much a part of me growing up.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.320
I used to see them every week.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.820
And there was this one
time I was peeping outside

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.900
of my window and these
two transgender women,

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.280
they were on the
curb of my house.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.467
And they were-- one woman asked
the other woman, she's like,

00:19:49.467 --> 00:19:51.300
your hair really good,
like what do you use?

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.370
She says, I use
the papaya shampoo.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.650
And that was really
vivid in my head.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.400
So you know I was like-- that
was the first time that they

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.760
were not doing that
all act of, you know,

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.930
flirting with the burly
men of the neighborhood

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:10.760
and dancing on child-- Like,
they were not putting an act.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.360
It was just a
candid conversation

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.890
between two people.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:18.140
So that really stuck in my head.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.390
And that is same thing
with show girls, as well.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.330
I grew up watching mujras.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.080
My father used to watch it, and
then my brother used to watch.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.475
Mujras are like the dance that
these girls do in theater.

00:20:30.475 --> 00:20:32.760
There used to be this
dedicated cable channel which

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.195
used to show these dances.

00:20:35.195 --> 00:20:37.320
And my father used to watch
it, and my brother also

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.340
used to watch it,
and eventually I

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.006
used to watch it as well because
we were, like, men of the house

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:44.670
and that is what they watch.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.960
And they would watch
all of these mujras,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.480
and at the end of the
entire dance sequence--

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.420
the girls dance
on-- these songs,

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.140
they're laden with
sexual innuendo,

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:02.050
and they do like
these suggested moves.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.890
And it's very interesting.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.380
And by the end of that
song, like for my father

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.200
and my uncles, they
were always the whores.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.360
They were like oh, they're
the whores, you know.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.960
And that was the kind
of-- I mean, for a kid,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.714
it's very confusing.

00:21:17.714 --> 00:21:18.880
I mean you're watching them.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.876
You're consuming them.

00:21:19.876 --> 00:21:21.000
You're going to watch them.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.030
You're paying tickets
to watch them.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.410
But by the end of it,
just to call them whores.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:31.810
So that music itself and
also these women dancing,

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.730
they were all a part
of me growing up.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.920
So I don't know, I
was at an interview

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.090
and they were asking
the same question,

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:44.200
like why are you interested
in these themes, groups

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.110
on the fringes of the society.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.640
And I was like, because I grew
up-- kind of grew up with them.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.770
So maybe it's like an
exploration of my childhood

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.630
through these films.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.960
To be very honest, I just think
like they're passion projects.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.090
They're about exploration
of my childhood.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.660
That's exactly what it is.

00:22:08.255 --> 00:22:09.546
Yeah.

00:22:09.546 --> 00:22:12.255
AUDIENCE: So for
the show girls, I

00:22:12.255 --> 00:22:14.840
know in like Thailand
they're also--

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.690
it's almost like a
tourist attraction, right?

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.610
Do you know if it's the same,
is it like culturally different

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:21.110
there?

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:25.130
It seems more open
or more prevalent?

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.140
Or is like religious
or cultural feelings

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.566
different with regard
to sexual minorities?

00:22:32.566 --> 00:22:36.090
SAAD KHAN: So this is
like mass entertainment,

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:40.190
but not for the bourgeois or
like the creme de la creme.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.800
This is like for someone
who works all day long

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.530
and they would go to
like a seedy theater

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.860
in these cities, a
few cities, and they

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.940
would watch these shows.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.610
And that's just a way
for them to relax.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.550
So even when people watch--
like for six days when

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.040
the trailer was
online, people were

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.080
like oh, well,
this thing happens,

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.054
or some people were shocked.

00:23:05.054 --> 00:23:06.720
But then some people
were like oh, we've

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.410
seen this thing happen, but
it hasn't been shown this way.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:15.230
They've always seen it in
like a kind of cable channel

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.830
which they would just skip.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:25.640
So it's mostly for
the working class.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.670
A guy who works all
day long and goes

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.560
to the theater to just
get his rocks off.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.820
That is what it is.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.230
So there are these--
the interesting part

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:44.780
is how the government
controls these dances,

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.170
or these theaters.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.710
There's more control in the
cities, like the big cities.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:53.560
But once you go away from it and
you are in villages and small

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.280
towns, the girls even take their
tops off and no one is there

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.419
to-- the government doesn't--

00:23:59.419 --> 00:24:00.502
RAHUL GAIROLA: Surveil it.

00:24:00.502 --> 00:24:01.660
SAAD KHAN: Yeah.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.710
They don't do that.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:09.850
But in big cities, they have to
wear kind of like body suits.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.000
And they have to
do a dance in front

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.890
of five people from the
local police department

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.230
before the show, like
a week before the show.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:19.850
So it's like an audition.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:26.200
It's like-- what is the
equivalent of Britain's-- like

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.660
"America Got Talent," you
know, something like that.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.180
So you have like five
six, girls queued up,

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.440
and there are five men
of the police department,

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.339
no woman in those like--

00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:38.630
RAHUL GAIROLA: And they're
enjoying every moment of it.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:39.670
SAAD KHAN: No, they're not.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.320
AUDIENCE: Are they not?

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.278
SAAD KHAN: Because they're
not going to get it.

00:24:42.278 --> 00:24:45.810
They really are there
to censor the dance.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:49.600
So the girls, they just
really do a modest dance

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.610
in front of them.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:57.530
But once the show is on,
they just really sex it up.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.610
Because obviously people
are there to watch them,

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.590
and they have to make money.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:08.000
So then the police department,
they would-- some girls

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.970
get banned, some girls
don't get banned.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.275
It's just so interesting.

00:25:17.392 --> 00:25:18.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah I
was just wondering

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.250
what the situation is around
female to male transgenders

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.580
in Pakistan.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.496
SAAD KHAN: Yes.

00:25:25.496 --> 00:25:27.006
That is a very
interesting question,

00:25:27.006 --> 00:25:28.380
and actually I
know someone who's

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.420
working on a project--
I think they're

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.410
working with Vice on that.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:39.430
But obviously they're-- I don't
know who said in the film that

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.990
transgender are the only--
transgender people are the only

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:47.000
visible sexual minority in
Pakistan because you see them

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.380
on the streets, dancing, and
they're begging at traffic

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.190
signals.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.660
Kami said that, right?

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:03.720
But then comes the
G and B people.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:09.930
But the L and female to
male transgender, they're

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.000
totally in hiding.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.570
Or they're not in
the mainstream,

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.380
for obvious reasons.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.190
They're not going
to be accepted.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:24.810
The reason male to
female transgender people

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.730
are accepted is because of the
historical context of South

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:36.860
Asia, because in the Mogul era
the transgender people, male

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.440
to female transgender
people, were

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.550
the guardians of the harems.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.920
And also in poetry, we have--
they're called khawaja saras.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:49.900
It comes from this poet called
Khawaja [? Amir ?] [INAUDIBLE],

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:54.190
who used to write in Persian
and also in Hindustani,

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:56.500
like South Asian language.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:03.040
And it comes-- he used to
talk about gender being fluid

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.370
and about being
transgender, and that's

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.100
where the respect comes in.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.490
And also because
people would not

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.270
say anything bad
to the transgender

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.770
people on the street
because they're

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.702
afraid that they're going to
get a bad omen or, you know.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.760
That is how they know.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.110
But obviously like
female to male,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.160
it's totally out
of the question.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.480
RAHUL GAIROLA: And I
guess just to follow up

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.390
on your question really
briefly is what that--

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.300
and we had actually
discussed-- this came up

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.466
in Baltimore, at University
of Maryland in Baltimore

00:27:37.466 --> 00:27:39.910
where we last saw each
other, but not University

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:43.710
of Washington back
when I first met you.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:48.930
And one interesting thing about
your question and the answer

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.980
is that still indicates
a kind of sexism

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.030
around queer
sexuality, doesn't it.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.660
That's the crazy part about it.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.420
On the one hand, men performing
women or being eunuchs is OK.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:05.000
But on the other hand, women
being lesbians or F to M

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.880
is totally transgressive, right.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.960
It's the most
abject of the queer.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.127
So it's very ironic how--
I mean but we-- we're

00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:17.210
all here in New York City.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:21.170
We all know how even
gay male identity

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.520
can be very misogynistic.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.610
It can be sexist.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:24.740
It can be racist right.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.370
We're exposed to enough here
to realize those nuances.

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:33.130
But I find it really interesting
that in this context that Saad

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:38.740
explores in his work that
what seems to be liberatory

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:39.875
can also be oppressive.

00:28:42.585 --> 00:28:46.020
AUDIENCE: Someone in the
movie said something about,

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.640
I'm not a gay who is
begging in the street,

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.510
but I go to the cafes.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.260
So there's an inherent
classicism, as well?

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.280
SAAD KHAN: Yeah, and
that's very interesting.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.540
[? Jenny ?] talks about it.

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.500
She calls herself a
modern transgender,

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.400
because she went to school.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.760
And she doesn't want
to be classified

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.030
in the same category as the
traditional transgender people

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.310
who beg on the streets or who
dance on weddings and that's

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.070
how they make money.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:19.100
But she calls-- she's
like, I'm different.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:23.120
But then that also leads to
her being doubly marginalized

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.950
because A, she's marginalized
my her family, B,

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.420
the only place
she can get refuge

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.170
is the traditional
transgender community, which

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.810
is very strong.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:40.500
So it has like a hierarchical
kind of family structure.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.720
It's mostly transgender
people are ostracized

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.160
by their families,
and they end up

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:50.310
in these transgender
families which have--

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.420
they have this hierarchy.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.890
There's a guru on the top,
and then there are proteges.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.650
So [? Jenny ?] cannot
fall into that,

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.440
because she doesn't want
to be associated with it.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.610
So she's doubly
marginalized in that way.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.200
She doesn't have
support from anywhere.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.730
Not from her family,
obviously, and then also

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.800
not from the traditional
transgender community.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:17.780
And that also kind of led to
her being depressed in the film.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:22.016
So yeah, there is-- Yeah.

00:30:22.016 --> 00:30:22.890
So the answer is Yes.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:23.389
Yes.

00:30:26.142 --> 00:30:28.710
AUDIENCE: So I think you
did a really good job

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:34.530
of the fly-on-the-wall,
especially with [? Jenny ?].

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.550
You really let her talk
herself into the circle

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:40.960
and just prompted her with,
well you said you're depressed.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.390
And you really let her do
that, which I find impressive.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.620
I'm just wondering if there was
a point in time where you ever

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.880
found that difficult while
shooting to not impose

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.360
any kind of your own ideas
or your own thoughts on one

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.042
of their interviews
are on a situation.

00:30:57.042 --> 00:31:00.520
SAAD KHAN: So when I shoot
and mostly I have the camera,

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.480
I really try-- it's
hard, because I

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.690
have to connect with the subject
as well but at the same time

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.680
kind of disconnect as
well so that I don't have

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.510
a breakdown like my producer.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.520
But [? Jenny ?], at
that very moment,

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.100
like he couldn't shoot for
like three or four days.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:23.090
And then I was with my friend
covering the other days.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:27.070
Because it was too depressing
and it was just too deep.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.250
And he is questioning her.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.650
And I'm not really.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.170
I just asked, like, a few
questions because I just

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.840
wanted to distance--
I knew I couldn't

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.750
deal with it at that
point, and he was there.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:43.850
And that is what
teamwork is all about.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:49.210
There are moments
when-- with show girls,

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.370
there are three subjects.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.780
All three of them speak
different languages.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.650
And I speak all those
three different languages.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:32:00.090
And I was the only one who
had to connect with them.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.570
It was kind of
hard in that film,

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.190
because I knew with
"Hide and Seek"

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.800
I had my producer backing me up.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.250
But in "Showgirls,"
I had a producer

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:14.380
who was Canadian Pakistani,
and she could initially

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.090
barely speak Urdu, which
is my first language.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:21.850
And she couldn't speak the rest
of the three regional languages

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:23.870
that the girls talked in.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:29.040
And so it was actually hard for
me in "Showgirls of Pakistan"

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:36.450
because I'm very much
attached to my subject.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.560
And to be honest, and
I'm just still processing

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:44.130
how to really like get it
out there, but also make sure

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.670
that the subjects are safe.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.530
Because they're in like
villages and towns.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:54.051
That is-- that's
not a safe spot.

00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:54.550
Yeah.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:57.390
RAHUL GAIROLA: One thing
that might interest you

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.050
and the rest of
you that are here

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:03.397
is there was actually, when
we did this event in Seattle--

00:33:03.397 --> 00:33:04.980
and I hadn't even--
we hadn't met yet.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.700
I turned up through a
queer South Asian group.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.270
The president of the
queer South Asian group

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:15.027
refused to moderate
this talk, and that's

00:33:15.027 --> 00:33:17.360
actually how I stepped in, I
don't know if you remember.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.390
And one of the-- it
was really interesting,

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.900
because one might think, well
the queer South Asian groups,

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.520
here in New York
it's called Salga,

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.340
in Seattle it's called
Trikone-Northwest,

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.440
in DC, when we last saw each
other, it's called Khush DC.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.820
And there was a faction, and
I, lo and behold, surprise,

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:41.590
surprise, it was the gay--
upper-class gay Indian males

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.324
of that group--
I'm one of those,

00:33:43.324 --> 00:33:45.240
but I didn't agree with
what they were saying.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.260
They had a major
problem, because they

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:53.270
felt like Saad was, why did you
have to one of the characters,

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.280
he's saying, oh well my
uncle used to rape me.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.734
So you're projecting us
as, well, we only have sex

00:33:58.734 --> 00:34:00.150
through rape, or
there's some sort

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.560
of sexual violence connected
to same-sex attraction.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.844
That's-- the logic is
really flawed in that,

00:34:05.844 --> 00:34:07.260
but I don't need
to get into that.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.270
The second big complaint
was, at the end,

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:14.085
why did you have to have a
character, a subject, why

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:15.460
did you have to
represent or give

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.909
a voice to someone who regrets
having-- to being castrated.

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:19.620
Why?

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:23.679
Because you're proposing,
you're representing us

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:27.489
as rapists and eunuchs and
full of regret and all.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:29.199
Remember when that--
in Seattle, and it

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.310
was this huge thing
that happened.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.810
So--

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:33.518
SAAD KHAN: There was
also an announcement

00:34:33.518 --> 00:34:37.480
before the screening where at
the Seattle South Asian Film

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.710
Festival, they
were like oh, we--

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:43.120
it's totally at your discretion
if you guys want to walk away.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.620
Like it was crazy.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.260
But then also my answer
to that was these

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.449
are personal stories
of these individuals.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:51.940
And they're important.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:58.579
And I also told you, you wanted
to talk about it at the Q&amp;A

00:34:58.579 --> 00:35:00.620
session, and I think we're
talking about it right

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.430
now because I didn't want
to talk about it that time,

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.846
because I was like if someone
has a problem with the film,

00:35:04.846 --> 00:35:07.280
they should come and watch
it and ask me a question.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.060
Then I can answer.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.851
But I don't want to
take the spotlight away

00:35:09.851 --> 00:35:13.720
from the personal stories
of these subjects who

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.560
put their lives at stake.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.409
And you're watching
their stories,

00:35:17.409 --> 00:35:18.950
and we're going to
talk about someone

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.300
who has a problem with
it who are not even

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.360
going to like show up in the
audience and talk about it.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.090
But one thing that
we have to understand

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.000
that these are personal
stories of these individuals,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.470
and they're very,
very important.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.567
That is exactly--
I think that is

00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:37.150
what I said to you,
as well, because I

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:38.100
didn't want to talk about it.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.460
I was like if they had a
problem, they have a problem,

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.680
they should come and ask me.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.020
RAHUL GAIROLA: I
actually came up to him

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.811
before and I said,
these are the two issues

00:35:44.811 --> 00:35:46.730
and let's come up
with answers now.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.859
Because I'm not-- I wasn't-- I
was having nothing doing with

00:35:49.859 --> 00:35:52.400
oh sure, if you have a problem
with what you're about to see,

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.560
get up and walk out.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.520
I'm teaching "The Bluest Eye,"
Toni Morrison, right now.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.870
I had to do the whole
disclaimer to the class.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:00.760
Oh, it's got rape and
incest and all this.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.080
And then I said to them,
welcome to college.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.900
It's rape, it's incest,
it's racism, it's violence,

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.350
it's prostitution.

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:09.940
Better us talk about it
in here in this safe space

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.040
than you go outside and have to
deal with it in your real life.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.373
SAAD KHAN: But here's the thing.

00:36:13.373 --> 00:36:16.090
These are-- you have to
understand the cultural nuances

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:17.990
and the cultural context.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:20.800
When he says rape
well, that's kind

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.770
of-- he's not saying-- that
is the only way he can put it.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:28.700
Like for him, sex is
not in his vocabulary,

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.010
so he uses the word rape.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:33.900
Because that is how he's
learned it from Bollywood films.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.430
And that's how he puts it.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:45.820
It sounds like consensual--
yeah, consensual sex

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.310
between these two individuals.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:50.570
And the guy happens
to be his uncle.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:54.380
And that is what it was.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.860
That was his own personal story.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:01.350
And it's so important that
he's shared it with us,

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:06.286
and we have show it.

00:37:06.286 --> 00:37:07.660
RAHUL GAIROLA:
Are we about done,

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.326
or does anyone have
any other questions?

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.720
AUDIENCE: [? Jenny ?]
spoke about counseling.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.930
I think she was the
only one who spoke

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.154
about [INAUDIBLE] So
[? Neli, ?] she's somebody

00:37:21.154 --> 00:37:22.645
who works for their rights.

00:37:22.645 --> 00:37:24.136
Are there any
other organizations

00:37:24.136 --> 00:37:27.731
that are working for counseling
for all these people,

00:37:27.731 --> 00:37:29.106
because there are
a lot of issues

00:37:29.106 --> 00:37:30.597
that they don't
speak about, right.

00:37:30.597 --> 00:37:32.585
Besides talking
about [INAUDIBLE],

00:37:32.585 --> 00:37:34.573
are there any groups--

00:37:34.573 --> 00:37:36.570
SAAD KHAN: There
are a few groups,

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.040
and actually
[? Neli ?] is a part

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.570
of that group, that specific
big group, and also Kami.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.220
So they belong to that group.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.200
And they do provide counseling,
and they do HIV testing

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:55.140
and they do various things
for the LGBT community.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.816
AUDIENCE: And that's completely
privately-funded thing--

00:37:57.816 --> 00:37:58.708
the government--

00:37:58.708 --> 00:38:00.385
SAAD KHAN: It's
internationally-funded,

00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:01.890
and also-- yeah.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:06.174
AUDIENCE: We also want
to know what [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:06.174 --> 00:38:06.840
SAAD KHAN: Dude.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.890
It was so interesting.

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:11.580
I think someone asked
a question to me

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:15.490
in one of those-- in one
of these Q&amp;A sessions

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.300
that what was the thing
which was-- I mean all of it

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.030
was interesting
to me shooting it,

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:25.390
but this bar was in the basement
of a mosque and in [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:29.100
So that was the
most interesting.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.724
AUDIENCE: It must be
quite underground.

00:38:30.724 --> 00:38:33.129
I've lived there all my
life and had no idea--

00:38:33.129 --> 00:38:34.160
SAAD KHAN: Yeah.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.430
AUDIENCE: For an outskirt
of Lahore, it's quite--

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.280
SAAD KHAN: Yeah it's like,
it's-- yeah, central Lahore.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.410
We only got like 20, 25
minutes, or maybe a little more

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.200
to shoot.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.770
It was pitch black,
packed with people.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:49.710
And that is the
only place we had

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.919
to put like artificial
fluorescent lights.

00:38:52.919 --> 00:38:53.960
I don't think it's there.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.714
I asked-- like whenever
I go back I ask.

00:38:58.714 --> 00:39:00.880
I asked my producer as well
last year if it's there,

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.850
and he was like I
don't think it's there.

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.190
There was another
one in Jeff Heights,

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.170
you know Jeff Heights, right?

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:08.730
In Lahore.

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.771
AUDIENCE: It's kind of a
space that keeps moving,

00:39:10.771 --> 00:39:11.970
like an underground space.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.990
RAHUL GAIROLA: Like a rave.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.030
SAAD KHAN: He--

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.250
RAHUL GAIROLA: A queer rave.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.630
SAAD KHAN: Yeah,
the Jeff Heights one

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.300
was very-- they didn't give
us permission to shoot.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.680
But this one did.

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:28.480
Yeah.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.717
Yeah, you had a question.

00:39:29.717 --> 00:39:32.530
AUDIENCE: So sexuality,
needless to say,

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:33.613
is subject to [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:38.483 --> 00:39:41.892
And when you are talking
to sexual minorities

00:39:41.892 --> 00:39:45.227
about their sexual practices
and their orientation,

00:39:45.227 --> 00:39:46.768
there's always a
level of discomfort,

00:39:46.768 --> 00:39:49.063
especially if you don't
have a rapport with them.

00:39:49.063 --> 00:39:52.056
And this is something that I've
faced in my own research which

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:54.759
is on [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:54.759 --> 00:39:57.315
And a lot of times I've
felt like my informants

00:39:57.315 --> 00:39:58.452
were performing for me.

00:39:58.452 --> 00:40:02.348
And when you add another
layer, which is a video camera,

00:40:02.348 --> 00:40:04.783
in front of them, that just
complicates the situation

00:40:04.783 --> 00:40:05.757
even more.

00:40:05.757 --> 00:40:07.705
Did you at any point
during your filming

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:09.653
feel as though your [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:13.549 --> 00:40:16.520
SAAD KHAN: Not at
all, because we--

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.990
the key is to spend
time with your subjects.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.862
And we still have a
relationship with-- I

00:40:21.862 --> 00:40:23.570
just talked with our
subjects, and I just

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:29.380
talked about how I feel like I'm
in love with one of my subjects

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.000
from "Showgirls of
Pakistan" because I

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.750
have such intimate
relationships with them.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.680
And that's why there
comes a point where

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.880
your subjects totally forget
that there's a camera there.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.010
You've seen this
one scene in which

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:47.430
the [INAUDIBLE] or the proteges
and [? Neli ?], the guru

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:50.220
of the transgender clan,
they're on a mattress

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.310
and they're doing their thing.

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:54.860
And it's just--
it's very candid.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.820
I mean at that point
I felt like-- that

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.450
was one of the moments
when I felt like a voyeur,

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:02.060
like I'm just there.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:06.190
And the camera was running
for like 30, 40 minutes.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.410
And they were just
doing their thing.

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:10.550
They just forget that
the camera is there.

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:13.830
Yeah.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.922
I mean obviously
like if I go and if I

00:41:17.922 --> 00:41:19.630
don't have a relationship
with my subject

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.270
and I just like put
a camera on, and also

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.400
one thing that I don't like
is putting so many lights on

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.570
and putting like a caller mic.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:31.470
And that changes the entire
narrative right at that point,

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:36.490
because all of these things
affect the actual story.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:42.410
So I mean I never have like
a caller mic or lights,

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:46.830
except that bar scene
I had to put it up.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:51.620
Just to have like a
very personal connection

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.285
with my subject.

00:41:54.285 --> 00:41:55.660
I'm sure a lot of
people do that.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.290
But that is the only
way I can do it.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.230
Obviously like shooting
with small cameras,

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:04.880
I can't move with like big
cameras and do these things.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.860
Any-- done?

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.762
RAHUL GAIROLA: Well
thank you all for coming.

00:42:14.762 --> 00:42:15.970
SAAD KHAN: Thank you so much.

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:19.620
