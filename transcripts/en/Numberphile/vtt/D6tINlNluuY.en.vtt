00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:03.910
JAMES GRIME: OK, so 42 is
maybe not such a special

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.870
number in mathematics,
but a very special

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.796
number in nerd culture.

00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:09.242
PHIL MORIARTY: Good.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:09.900
Good, good, good.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.760
Did you want to do something
with 42?

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.490
JAMES GRIME: Yes.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.540
So you take a piece of paper.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.420
It's very thin.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.030
Let's fold this in half.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.020
Fold it in half again.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.210
Fold it in half again.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.090
Imagine you can keep doing this,
and in reality you can't

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.690
keep doing this.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.660
But imagine you can keep folding
it in half, and each

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.700
time you do, it will double
in thickness.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.259
And if you fold it 42 times,
that's enough to reach from

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.220
the Earth to the moon.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.810
You notice when 42 turns up,
you keep noticing it.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.360
But that's not really all that
remarkable, since any two

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.210
digit number will turn up one
hundredth of the time.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.760
GERARDO ADESSO: Today we're in
my office, and we are talking

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.520
about numbers.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.950
And when I was asked about
thinking about the number, I

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.930
just realized that there is a
number that I see every day

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.970
when I enter my office,
and this number is 42.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.880
Because we are in this
office, B42.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.990
JAMES GRIME: 42 is maybe not
such a special number in

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.550
mathematics, but a very special

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.500
number in nerd culture.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.370
42 is the answer to life, the
universe, and everything.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.150
GERARDO ADESSO: If you'll now
go on Google, the answer to

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.740
life, the universe,
and everything.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.520
So Google calculator gives
you as an answer, 42.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.610
PHIL MORIARTY: 42 is the answer
to life, the universe,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.070
and everything.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.290
I am a huge, huge, huge
Douglas Adams fan.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990
My favorite book is The Hitch
Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.890
All my favorite books are the
trilogy of five books that

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.185
makes up Douglas Adams' work in
terms of a character called

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:46.740
Arthur Dent.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.050
JAMES GRIME: The author Douglas
Adams, a great comedy

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.657
writer, wrote first a radio
series called the Hitch

00:01:52.657 --> 00:01:55.230
Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.280
In the show they built a super
computer, a giant super

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.490
computer to work out the meaning
of life, the universe,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.650
and everything.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.160
And after millions of years, it
decided that the meaning of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.160
life, the universe, and
everything was 42.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.320
PHIL MORIARTY: At which point
the people who programmed the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.740
computer and built the
computer were rather

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.610
disappointed, but the computer
quite rightly said, well,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.530
what's the question?

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.925
And they said it's the
ultimate question.

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:22.880
The ultimate question of life,
the universe, and everything.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.270
But what's the question?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.200
Which is, I think is a
completely valid thing.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.550
So then the idea was to build
a supercomputer which would

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.260
calculate the ultimate
question.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.600
And the supercomputer was Earth,
and we formed part-- or

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.910
humans formed part of that
organic framework.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.305
JAMES GRIME: You've
ruined the ending!

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:41.610
PHIL MORIARTY: Oh, yeah, if you
really haven't listened

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.970
to, or watched, or read the
Hitch Hiker's Guide To The

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.540
Galaxy books, you
haven't lived.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.865
So go out and get them now.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:48.170
JAMES GRIME: A perhaps
slightly embarrassing

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.380
confession is that I used to
be involved with the Hitch

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.540
Hiker's Guide To The
Galaxy fan club.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.860
And I use to help
run it, briefly.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.560
Just a few years ago when the
film came out, I remember it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.560
was quite an exciting time.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.680
I don't see them anymore.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.460
It's a shame, but I know more
things about 42 than I

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.420
really ought to.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.210
GERARDO ADESSO: This
number, 42, is said

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.270
to be a pronic number.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.172
JAMES GRIME: A what, sorry?

00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:17.375
GERARDO ADESSO: A
pronic number.

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:18.300
JAMES GRIME: What
does that mean?

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.230
GERARDO ADESSO: I can
write it for you.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.860
So a pronic number is a number
which is obtained as the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.360
multiplication of two
successive integers.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.230
So for instance, in the
case of 42, 42 is

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.020
equal to 6 times 7.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.320
These are one after the other,
and any number which is like

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.180
this is called pronic.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.770
For instance, 2 times 3,
3 times 4, and so on.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.830
JAMES GRIME: Douglas Adams,
I think chose this number

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.370
because it kind of has
a funny sound.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.110
40, all those O's, 42,
it's a funny sound.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.020
PHIL MORIARTY: Again, if you go
on the web, and if you read

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.010
some of the articles about 42,
there are arguments ranging

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.330
from, well actually it's 101010
in binary, which is a

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.290
nice binary number.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.840
And in fact, in the television
program that flashes up.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.580
When they say 42, you
see the binary.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.010
JAMES GRIME: You'll find 42
comes up a lot in comedy and

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.795
other shows, partly because of
Douglas Adams and because he

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:17.690
used it, but partly because
it's just a funny sound.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.290
GERARDO ADESSO: Then there is
another interesting property,

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.959
which is slightly more
complicated about this number.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.630
And it is the fact that it's
defined to be a primary

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.800
pseudoperfect number.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.860
JAMES GRIME: A what?

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.285
GERARDO ADESSO: A primary
pseudoperfect number.

00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:33.540
JAMES GRIME: Go on, what
does that mean?

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.620
GERARDO ADESSO: OK, so first of
all, you have to find out

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.820
what are the prime
factors of 42.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:46.900
OK, so write down 42 as 2 times
3, which is 6 times 7.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.920
So these are its
prime factors.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.240
Primary to the perfect number
is such that the sum of the

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.980
inverse of each prime factor
plus the sum of the inverse of

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.540
the number itself is 1.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:06.700
1 over 2 plus 1 over 3 plus 1
over 7, and these are the sum

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.660
of the inverses of each
prime factor.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.660
Then plus 1 over the
number itself.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.240
If you work out this
calculation, you can put

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.550
everything under the
common denominator.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.210
The result is one.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.120
There are not so many numbers
that have this property.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.980
The next one after 42
is, I think 1,806.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.850
And then you immediately go
to very huge numbers.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.370
So it appears like
any [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.740
property, but it's not.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.735
JAMES GRIME: The story
is he sat--

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:39.540
he wrote it in his garden, he
sat in his back garden.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.330
He thought, what number
should I choose?

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.790
It should be a sort of
smallish number.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.860
It should be a sort
of boring number.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.050
42 will do, and he picked 42.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.630
PHIL MORIARTY: There's also
arguments that 6 times 9, if

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.965
you look at that problem
in base 13, out

00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:55.590
pops the number 42.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.020
All these mad, mad things that
Douglas Adams himself said

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.770
were absolutely bonkers.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.650
He said he chose 42 because
it's a funny number.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.320
He thought it was
a funny number.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.010
GERARDO ADESSO: And then there
is another, for instance

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.590
another one which
42 belongs to.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.150
It's the sequence of
harshad numbers.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.890
Harshad is written like this.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.990
So what is a harshad number?

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.620
It's a number that
is divisible by

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.110
the sum of its digits.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.670
So you have 42, take 4 plus 2.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.710
This is 6.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.890
And 42 is divisible by 6.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.400
So any number with
this property is

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.900
called harshad number.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.342
JAMES GRIME: Do you think
it's a funny number?

00:06:35.342 --> 00:06:36.180
PHIL MORIARTY: Oh,
I don't know.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.180
If it's an interesting one.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.430
Would I have gone for 42?

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.270
I don't know.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.200
What number is funnier
than 42?

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.500
71?

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.160
I don't know.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.810
68?

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.640
GERARDO ADESSO: If you're very
bright in mathematics, and you

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.230
participate in the International
Olympiads of

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.320
Mathematics, and the total mark
to achieve the perfect

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.034
score is set at 42.

00:06:56.034 --> 00:06:57.506
JAMES GRIME: Is that a
coincidence, or do you think

00:06:57.506 --> 00:06:59.100
someone did that on purpose?

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.150
GERARDO ADESSO: Well,
this I don't know.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.050
We need to ask the people who
are involved in these

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.550
committees.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.820
But before Douglas Adams, that
was already quite a lot of

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.950
attention on this number from
works by Lewis Carroll.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:16.930
And you know, mathematicians,
they are known to have a

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.980
particular taste for
recurrences and

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.070
nerdiness, so to say.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.140
So it may be that this was
chosen on purpose.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.770
But I don't know.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.200
JAMES GRIME: In the fan club
magazine, they would have a

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.120
column all about where
people have seen

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.720
the number 42 recently.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.360
And it was a bit of fun,
except for one guy.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.415
He took it quite seriously.

00:07:39.415 --> 00:07:41.540
He actually thought there
was a mystical meaning

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.580
behind the number 42.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.540
Genuinely thought there was.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.200
And he used to go through the
phone book and look for

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.670
multiples of 42 in peoples'
phone numbers.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.530
He used to find a multiple of
6, find a multiple of 7,

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.550
multiply them together
and go oh, look.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:58.790
It's a multiple of 42.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.000
How amazing.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.800
It really isn't that remarkable
if you look for

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.860
things like that.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.060
PHIL MORIARTY: Soon as I see
it, there's an instant

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.620
resonance there when I see 42.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.940
And in fact, one of the
experiments I want to do,

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.350
we're working with taking
a silicon surface.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.230
Surface like this, where we
put hydrogen atoms on it.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.190
And then we take a tip of a
scanning probe microscope and

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.190
remove the hydrogen atoms
one at a time.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.340
And one thing I really want
to do is put 42 on

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.590
a surface in atoms.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:38.460
JAMES GRIME: Fox Mulder's
apartment in the X-Files was

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.530
apartment 42, which may be a
reference to Hitch Hiker.
