joining us so the progress was

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900
joining us so the progress was
 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.710
joining us so the progress was
phenomenal we know we are on the right

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720
phenomenal we know we are on the right
 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.770
phenomenal we know we are on the right
track and we will continue to push for

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780
track and we will continue to push for

piece in tribal compliance we feel that

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700
piece in tribal compliance we feel that
 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.020
piece in tribal compliance we feel that
it has a lot more potential than that

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030
it has a lot more potential than that
 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.449
it has a lot more potential than that
so we set out a goal to make GSI be more

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459
so we set out a goal to make GSI be more
 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.360
so we set out a goal to make GSI be more
accessible and useful not just for

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370
accessible and useful not just for
 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.810
accessible and useful not just for
device makers but also for the general

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820
device makers but also for the general
 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.140

step toward that goal is to make GSI

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110
step toward that goal is to make GSI
 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.750
step toward that goal is to make GSI
available in LSP so for this we have

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760
available in LSP so for this we have
 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.100
available in LSP so for this we have
published PI GSI in USB so now you can

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110
published PI GSI in USB so now you can
 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.520
published PI GSI in USB so now you can
download and build PI 3si today we are

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530

also get early feedback from you so the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590
also get early feedback from you so the
 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.880
also get early feedback from you so the
benefit is mutual so please stay tuned

we understand that trying out GSI can be

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230
we understand that trying out GSI can be
 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.850
we understand that trying out GSI can be
cumbersome sometimes we are looking into

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860
cumbersome sometimes we are looking into
 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.240
cumbersome sometimes we are looking into
different ways to improve the process

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250
different ways to improve the process
 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.330
different ways to improve the process
right now we have an idea of trying out

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340
right now we have an idea of trying out
 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.230
right now we have an idea of trying out
GSI without actually flashing GSI under

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240
GSI without actually flashing GSI under
 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.400

to that we also prepare a set of devices

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960
to that we also prepare a set of devices
 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.460
to that we also prepare a set of devices
they are all running on the same PI GSI

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470
they are all running on the same PI GSI
