00:00:00.361 --> 00:00:03.347
- Hi, I'm Dan Quinn, originally from McLean, Virginia,

00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:07.252
and I created the video about the tears of wine

00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:09.644
that form around the edge of wine glasses.

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:12.287
Most people who drink wine have seen the weird drops

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:14.906
that form around the side of the glass.

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:18.911
Traditionally, they're called "tears" or "legs" of wine.

00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:21.977
But, what most people don't realize is that,

00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:23.948
if you watch patiently, these drops are

00:00:23.948 --> 00:00:25.879
actually moving around.

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:28.276
My favorite part is when I'll be at a party or something,

00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:30.327
and someone has a glass of wine

00:00:30.327 --> 00:00:32.724
and they're twirling it around and they see the legs of wine

00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:34.192
or the tears of wine and they say,

00:00:34.192 --> 00:00:36.647
"Oh, Dan. Come explain this to us."

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:39.002
- Students, before lab, I can see them

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.441
in the hallways watching my videos.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.961
And then also, during lab, sometimes they'll, like,

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.789
have it on their phone and they'll be like,

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.375
"Well, what did he do in the video?

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.141
Just bring it up on your phone."

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.315
- My students think it's super cool.

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:52.898
(laughs)

00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:57.091
- The second they heard that I had a video on YouTube,

00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:59.510
they were, like, really excited.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.541
The mushy food lands in your stomach,

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:03.795
where gastric acid and chemicals

00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:06.193
break down the food even more.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:08.917
- To be a really good teacher,

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:10.968
you just have to be a really good communicator

00:01:10.968 --> 00:01:14.199
and you need to also be able to relate to your students.

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:18.099
- I think that a good teacher is engaged and supportive

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:21.301
and responsible and should treat

00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:24.169
his or her students with respect.

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:25.881
- If you put yourself in an ivory tower,

00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:27.592
or spew and force wisdom onto the masses,

00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:29.477
like, that's not gunna help anybody.

00:01:29.477 --> 00:01:32.077
The truth is your students are just as smart as you are,

00:01:32.077 --> 00:01:33.398
you just happen to know

00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:35.023
a little bit more than them for the moment.

00:01:35.023 --> 00:01:36.405
- You know, when you're teaching it,

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:39.188
you know it all very well but when you're teaching it

00:01:39.188 --> 00:01:42.703
to someone else, you have to think of what they're thinking

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:45.567
and, when I make the videos, I, sort of, keep in mind

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:48.311
what questions pop into their head first.

00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:51.846
If you're telling me that we have a seeing threshold

00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:53.999
just like how we having a hearing threshold,

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.249
wouldn't that mean that there's light waves?

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.521
I think what's really important is that they love it

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.167
because, when a teacher loves something

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:05.560
and they teach it to you, you, sort of, love it too.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.669
- Usually, when I create a new video,

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:08.526
it's because I found something that's really exciting

00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:09.886
that I wanna talk about to people.

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:12.060
And so, I, kind of, can't not talk about it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.362
and I wanna get it all into one thing

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:15.128
that can be my packaged, you know,

00:02:15.128 --> 00:02:17.120
delivery of this idea to the world.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.293
- The thing that excites me the most

00:02:19.293 --> 00:02:23.906
about video making is actually YouTube comments.

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:29.086
Because of the nature of the content that I produced,

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:32.541
it didn't really attract a whole lot of trolls.

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:35.974
So, all of the comments were just uniformly constructive

00:02:35.974 --> 00:02:38.575
or helpful or they would say, "David, you screwed up here."

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.993
But they would say it, like, real politely.

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:44.629
- Other fantastic comments include, "That was tolerable."

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.783
and "I did not want to blow my brains out

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:48.815
after watching your video."

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:50.236
Those are from harsher critics.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:52.005
- Ok, so one of my biggest worries

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.057
about putting things on YouTube,

00:02:54.057 --> 00:02:57.043
you know, YouTube's notorious for critical comments.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:58.973
And I don't care about that.

00:02:58.973 --> 00:03:01.046
That's much better than no comments, in my mind.

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:03.870
But, I was worried that my mom might, you know,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.230
she's naturally gunna watch videos.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.119
She cares about what her son's doing.

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:08.556
And I don't want her to see people

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:09.923
saying bad things about her son.

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.387
No mother wants that.

00:03:11.387 --> 00:03:13.682
So, I was a little bit stressed about that

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:15.104
to start 'cuz I don't care.

00:03:15.104 --> 00:03:17.826
That's just critical feedback, especially with education.

00:03:17.826 --> 00:03:19.981
So, it was a bit of a relief, when, at least, you know,

00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:23.415
so far, people are, by and large, very, very nice about it.

00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:26.441
- The initial feedback I got from my students

00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:30.221
about the videos and providing that has just been amazing.

00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:34.244
And I never thought that it would be as well received.

00:03:34.244 --> 00:03:36.275
And, of course, I also never thought that

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:38.917
that would lead to being here at Khan Academy.

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:41.476
- And so, I would encourage anyone

00:03:41.476 --> 00:03:43.751
who wants to do this, who thinks they have something to say

00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.521
about history, science, mathematics,

00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:51.066
to just go out there and give it to the world.

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:54.398
- I feel like teaching is the best way to learn sometimes.

00:03:54.398 --> 00:03:55.961
- Each professor, each teacher,

00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:59.173
each tutor has their own style and, I think,

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:01.143
any person can bring out their own style,

00:04:01.143 --> 00:04:02.606
from their personality, from the way

00:04:02.606 --> 00:04:03.966
they think about things.

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:06.019
That's something that only they can offer

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.421
and they can offer it the best.

00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:09.189
- I hope my videos show that, you know,

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.236
if you break it down into one step after the other,

00:04:12.236 --> 00:04:16.366
you can really understand even the most complex phenomenon.
