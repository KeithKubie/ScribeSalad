1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,560
I got home from the comedy store, I'd
like to, and then I watched some goofy,

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:06,870
I've been on this Ufo documentary kick

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,480
watching you a foe. Documentaries.
Yeah. I told you it was David. That was,

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,050
I'd seen it. I started talking about
it though. We were talking about that.

5
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:15,680
What were you, did you have something
specific that you saw recently?

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,533
The documentary,

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,600
one of them is air area 51 Bob Lasar
and alien area 51 and flying saucers.

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,770
It's uh,
some,

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,350
a documentary on this guy who claimed
that he worked on these alien ships in

10
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:34,861
area 51 in the 1980s and
chills as time's gone on more,

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,870
more of the things that he said
have proven to actually be true,

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,940
including an element that he talked about.
Element one 15,

13
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:45,460
I think it was called like an
organism from outer space. No, no, no.

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,180
An element like a man created element,
you know, at this carbon, right? Yeah.

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,220
Well there's an element that they created
that he talked about way before it was

16
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:58,510
ever publicized and he talked about this
thing and then it turned out to be true.

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,990
He talked about these,
um, there's these, um, uh,

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,940
hand monitors that you would put your
hand on this thing and these lines,

19
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:11,941
these metal lines would detect the
distances in the bones of your fingers,

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,650
the exact distances and
everyone is different.

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,580
It's like a signature thing and that
they could find out if it was you or not

22
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:21,370
you, it was trying to go through.
So the way they would scan people,

23
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:25,120
that bio scan would literally measure
the bones and their fingers and people

24
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:27,670
said that was horseshit. It's
all about this. In the 1980s,

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,660
people said it was horseshit,
but then later on turned
out, no, they did have that.

26
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:35,380
And Los Alamos, they did
have that in, in area 51.

27
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,750
And that this technology was very,
very uh,

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,620
in advance, very not just at
very advanced but very not,

29
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,360
it was not well known at all.
Like very few people did.

30
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:48,040
And this guy who was creative
with this documentary,

31
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,430
it was very difficult for them to
get photos of this hand scanner.

32
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,020
But this hand scanner did exist and
existed exactly as this guy described it

33
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,870
in the 80s. I mean that's
super progressive for that
time. It also a Plinko

34
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,180
that did approve is top secret
clearance to get to this place.

35
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:06,780
They know that he actually worked there.
There's people that um,

36
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,560
worked in the same Los
Alamos lab with him.

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,320
They tried to say he never worked there,
but his name's on the manifest.

38
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,281
It's very strange.

39
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:18,690
It's like they've tried to erase parts
of this guy's passed because he um,

40
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,780
he filmed a bunch of their crafts
as they were flying around.

41
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:25,050
Like he knew what days. This is
the thing, that thing right there,

42
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:28,150
you put your hand on that and it
actually measures the distance of your,

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
the size and length of your bone.

44
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,020
That looks like something that's
inside of an escape room in La.

45
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,250
[inaudible]

46
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,250
I went into this documentary, skeptical.
I wasn't sure. Yeah, but I am.

47
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:46,660
I'm so done with all those things.
But listen to this guy talk for awhile.

48
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,450
After awhile I was like,
what if he's telling the truth?

49
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,910
Like what if he is
actually telling the truth?

50
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,410
Because if he's actually
telling the truth,

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,680
there is some part of the government that
had access at least in the 19 to alien

52
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,264
technology.

53
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,380
I mean it probably is.
It probably is some truth to that.

54
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:07,590
Crazier things have happened. And also
like just your mentality of believing him.

55
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,970
It's probably the same thing that made
Dr Malakai Lovejoy Robinson the third

56
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:16,440
become successful. A con artist.
Yeah. I mean either this dude,

57
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,420
there's validity of what he's
saying in this documentary,

58
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:21,840
which I can't wait to watch or he's
just really great at painting a picture.

59
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,880
Some people are so good at convincing
you that's true of truths. True.

60
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,690
There's,
you know,

61
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,130
people with like borderline personality
disorder in every sort of spectrum in

62
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:34,290
between there they become
really good manipulators.

63
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,990
That is true. However, usually they
do that in more than one avenue.

64
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,360
Absolutely. And this guy's
not doing that. Yeah.

65
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,740
So if it's just a documentary then also
hasn't varied a story like you mean he

66
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:49,760
might've like changed the way he says
things in terms of like the words he

67
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:50,594
chooses.

68
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,430
But the actual story is exactly the
same as he was telling a long time ago.

69
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,450
Is this a self produced documentary or
is there a production company in the oil

70
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,210
production company? That's
where was like, hmm, okay,

71
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:00,400
there's probably some validity to this.

72
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,950
This guy's been around for a long time.

73
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,760
I remember reading about him and watch
videos about him, you know, 20 years ago.

74
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,770
I mean, don't you think you're
somebody who you said you, you know,

75
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:12,010
and I notice about you, you love space.
You're, you're obsessed with that.

76
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,760
The idea of what we are in,
in the solar system and beyond,

77
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:20,230
like how impossible is it to think that
there could be a creature that could

78
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:24,250
breach our atmosphere with some advanced
technology and be able to just sort of

79
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:26,620
chill, you know, scoot around,

80
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:29,380
scoot scoots macoutes check
us out and fucking piece out,

81
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:32,860
back up to wherever they're from.
That's how they would do it. But yeah,

82
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,630
I know what you're saying. Exactly.
They scoot, scoot, scoot codes. Yeah.

83
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:40,000
They just kind of cruise around.
You know, they're looking at us.

84
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, he had an initial reconnaissance.
He said if you brought a um, uh,

85
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,120
uh,

86
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,120
an atomic engine to these people that
live in the Victorian era and said,

87
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:56,190
hey, this is a, this is a nuclear power
plant, like here, here, check this out.

88
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,880
They would fuck with it. They'd
wind up getting sick from radiation.

89
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:03,270
They'd wind up dying. No one would
understand what it was or how it worked.

90
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,640
They would never figure
it out. Right. He goes,

91
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,700
why would we assume that this is only
from that one time with this one device?

92
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:16,740
Why would we assume that there'd be
some other technology that maybe we'll

93
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:19,860
create some day in the future?
I'm paraphrasing and very poorly,

94
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,570
or someone else from another planet would
create that we wouldn't understand at

95
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:24,901
all.

96
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:28,440
And he said that's what we were dealing
with when we're trying to back engineer

97
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,760
the propulsion systems
that these things use the,

98
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:35,130
they use some gravity based propulsion
system and it was just something that

99
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:37,890
would manipulate gravity in front
of, it's very, look, I don't,

100
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,780
I'm too stupid to know the science of it.
I don't know if he's town,

101
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,180
like if you're a scientist, you're
supposed to know these things. Yeah.

102
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,980
I have to get my to Joseph Rogan degree
so I can call myself doctor. You should.

103
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,110
I just want to get an honorary one.
Like Cosby had.

104
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,800
Oh, it's gone now. He doesn't have it.

105
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,110
He doesn't have it anymore.
They

106
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,100
take back, take him back. He can't
keep those. He can keep that. Actually,

107
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,620
I think he wrote an essay and that's
why they gave him his doctorate.

108
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,770
I'm just neither here nor rose.
Probably got more than one doctorate.

109
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,190
I'm sure he did and he didn't. He
didn't deserve that. But I think,

110
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:15,590
I mean there's gotta be stuff out there.
Oh,

111
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,300
a hundred percent a hundred
percent I like to say there's not,

112
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,680
it's like, ah, stop. No,
no, I don't think it is,

113
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,670
but it is entirely possible.
Um,

114
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,670
I use that phrase too often
and it's entirely possible.

115
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,030
You've got to get a mash up of
all of those. It's sort of you're

116
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:41,030
hilarious. 150,000 of them. To be honest.

117
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,820
It's possible that we're the,
we're the most advanced.

118
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,630
That's possible too because something
has to be the most advanced. Absolutely.

119
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:48,650
And something has to be the least.

120
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:52,070
We could also be on that part of the
spectrum or maybe where the last two we

121
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:55,490
evolve. It's a hundred percent a
hundred percent possible. If there's,

122
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,120
if there's an infinite number
of life forms out there,

123
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:02,270
like if there's an infinite number of
planets and there's an infinite number of

124
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:06,260
earth, like planets that could, you
know, have beings like us on it.

125
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,860
Who's to say that we're
not the most advanced?

126
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,030
Maybe they're all like people from the
1820s they haven't caught up to the

127
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:17,870
ceiling shit. They're still doing, you
know, I don't think they chiseled chisels,

128
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,840
but I'm talking like old old shit.
They don't even have pens and papers yet.

129
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,280
Like the orangutan that
was fishing with a spirit.

130
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,300
There's just a bunch of advanced
orangutans that are like, you know,

131
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,320
putting hieroglyphics in caves.
It's possible. It is very possible.

132
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,160
It's totally possible.
But because we're just,

133
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,400
we're just basing it off of our own
experience and perception of what we have

134
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,800
been exposed to. We have no
idea. You know, the other, um,

135
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,170
really interesting scenario is
that there are time travelers. Oh,

136
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,400
that's really,

137
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,490
that's exciting to think about ar is some
being from the far distant future that

138
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:53,960
understands that it could come back and
observe us and see like where things

139
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:55,460
went wrong,
where things went right,

140
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:59,210
but do so in a way that's as minimally
intrusive as possible and occasionally

141
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,680
interfere.
That's things.
