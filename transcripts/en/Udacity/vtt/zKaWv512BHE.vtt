00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.390
Suppose that the sustained rate that a

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.400
subscriber subscribes to is ten megabits per

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.670
second but they like to burst at a rate of fifteen megabits per second. Suppose

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.380
that the bucket size is one megabyte or eight megabits. How long can the sender

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.140
send at the higher rate? Please give your answer in decimal form in seconds.
