00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630
 

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.100
After you cross the troll's
bridge and you save the prince

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.060
or princess, you return them
back to their father, the King.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.330
And he's so excited that you
returned their son or daughter

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.430
to him that he wants to
throw a brunch in your honor.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.430
But he has a little
bit of a conundrum

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.960
in throwing the brunch.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.731
He wants to figure out how
many cupcakes should he order?

00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:29.230
He doesn't want to
waste any, but he

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.511
wants to make sure that
everyone has enough to eat.

00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:33.260
And you say, well
what's the problem here?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.509
And he says, well I know
adults eat a different number

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:37.066
of cupcakes than children eat.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.190
And I know that in my
kingdom, an adult will always

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.290
eat the same amount
and a child will always

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.690
eat the same amount.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.255
And so you say, King, well what
information can you give me?

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:47.130
I might be able to help
you out a little bit.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.110
You're feeling very confident
after this troll situation.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.680
And he says, well I know at the
last party we had 500 adults

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.420
and we had 200
children, and combined

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.220
they ate 2,900 cupcakes.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.944
And you say, OK,
that's interesting.

00:01:11.944 --> 00:01:14.110
But I think I'll need a
little bit more information.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.160
Have you thrown
parties before then?

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.250
And the king says,
of course I have.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.257
I like to throw parties.

00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:19.090
Well what happened at
the party before that?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.840
And he says, well there
we also had 500 adults

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660
and we had 300 children.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.002
 

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:30.460
And you say, well
how many cupcakes

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.501
were eaten at that party?

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:37.200
And he says, well we know
it was 3,100 cupcakes.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.750
And so you get a
tingling feeling

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.552
that a little bit of algebra
might apply over here.

00:01:41.552 --> 00:01:42.760
And you say, well let me see.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.010
What do we need to figure out?

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.720
We need to figure out the
number of cupcakes on average

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.260
that an adult will eat.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:56.750
So number of cupcakes
for an adult.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.220
And we also need to
figure out the number

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.760
of cupcakes for a child.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.464
So these are the
two things that we

00:02:06.464 --> 00:02:07.880
need to figure out
because then we

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.880
can know how many adults
and children are coming

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.210
to the next brunch that are
being held in your honor

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.310
and get the exact right
number of cupcakes.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.310
So those are things you're
trying to figure out.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.360
And we don't know
what those things are.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.720
Let's define some variables
that represent those things.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.160
Well let's do a for adults.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.170
Let's let a equal the
number of cupcakes

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.370
that, on average,
each adult eats.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.010
And let's do c for children.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.700
So c is the number of cupcakes
for a child on average.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.060
So given that
information, let's see

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.810
how we can represent what the
King has told us algebraically.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.620
So let's think about this
orange information first.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.626
How could we represent
this algebraically?

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:49.580
Well let's think about
how many cupcakes

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.470
the adults ate at that party.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.670
You had 500 adults, and
on average, each of them

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.520
exactly a cupcakes.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.730
So the total number of
cupcakes that the adults ate

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.170
were 500 times a.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.420
How many did the children eat?

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.460
Well same logic.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.360
You had 200 children and
they each ate c cupcakes.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.180
So 200 times c is the
total number of cupcakes

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.320
that the children ate.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.500
Well how much did
they eat in total?

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.249
Well it's the total
number that the adults

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:17.370
ate plus the total number
that the children ate

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.830
which is 2,900 cupcakes.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.830
So let's do that and apply that
same logic to the blue party

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.760
right over here, this
blue information.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.690
How can we represent
this algebraically?

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.410
Well once again, how many total
cupcakes did the adults eat?

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.656
Well, you had 500
adults and they each

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:40.115
ate a cupcakes, which
is an unknown right now.

00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:41.490
And then what
about the children?

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.639
Well you had 300 children
and they each ate c cupcakes.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.180
And so if you add
up all the cupcakes

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.670
that the adults ate plus all the
cupcakes that the children ate,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.984
you get to 3,100 cupcakes.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.650
So this is starting
to look interesting.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.910
I have two equations.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.360
I have a system of two
equations with two unknowns.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.570
And you know from your
experience with the troll

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.440
that you should be
able to solve this.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.105
You could solve it graphically
like you did in the past,

00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:08.480
but now you feel
that there could

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.480
be another tool in your
tool kit which is really

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.850
just an application of the
algebra that you already know.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.440
So think a little bit about
how you might do this.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.800
So let's rewrite this first
equation right over here.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:30.110
So we have 500a plus 200c
is equal to 2,900 cupcakes.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.720
Now, it would be good if we
could get rid of this 500a

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.530
somehow.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.090
Well you might say, well
let me just subtract 500a.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.770
So you might say, oh, I
just want to subtract 500a.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.040
But if you subtracted 500a
from the left hand side,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.519
you'd also have to subtract
500a from the right hand side.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.060
And so the a wouldn't
just disappear.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.950
It would just end up
on the right hand side,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.640
and you would still
have one equation

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.190
with two unknowns which
isn't too helpful.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.720
But you see something
interesting.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.720
You're like, well
this is a 500a here.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.340
What if I subtracted
a 500a and this 300c?

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.770
So if I subtracted
the 500a and the 300c

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.880
from the left hand side.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.030
And you're like, well
why is that useful?

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.890
You're going to do the same
thing on the right hand side

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.550
and then you're going to have
an a and a c on the right hand.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.207
And you just say, hold on,
hold on one second here.

00:05:15.207 --> 00:05:17.040
Hold on, I guess you're
talking to yourself.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.640
Hold on one second.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.630
I'm subtracting the left
hand side of this equation,

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.640
but this left hand side
is the exact same thing

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.040
as this right hand side.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.050
So here I could
subtract 500a and 300c,

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.140
and I could do 500a and
subtract 300c over here.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.570
But we know that
subtracting 500a and 300c,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.430
that's the exact same
thing as subtracting 3,100.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.690
Let me make it clear.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.060
This is 500a minus 300c
is the exact same thing

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.260
as subtracting 500a plus 300c.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.920
And we know that 500a plus
300c is exactly 3,100.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.040
This is 3,100.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.640
This is what the second
information gave us.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.190
So instead of subtracting
500a and minus 300c,

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.770
we can just subtract 3,100.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.720
So let me do that.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.260
This is exciting.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.390
So let me clear that out.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.860
So let's clear that out.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.270
And so here, instead
of doing this,

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.380
I can subtract the exact same
value, which we know is 3,100,

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.172
subtract 3,100.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:22.630
So looking at it
this way, it looks

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.150
like we're subtracting
this bottom equation

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.540
from the top equation, but
we're really just subtracting

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.010
the same thing from both sides.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.180
This is just very
basic algebra here.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.920
But if we do that,
let's see what happens.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.940
So on the left hand side, 500a
minus 500a, those cancel out.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.280
200c minus 300c, that
gives us negative 100c.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.640
And on the right hand
side, 2,900 minus 3,100

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.720
is negative 200.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.950
Well now we have one
equation with one unknown,

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.500
and we know how to solve this.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.140
We can divide both
sides by negative 100.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.320
These cancel out.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.250
And then over here, you
end up with a positive 2.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.630
So c is equal to positive 2.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.510
So we've solved one
of the unknowns,

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.010
the each child on
average drinks two cups.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.210
So c is equal to 2.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.274
So how can we figure
out what a is?

00:07:17.274 --> 00:07:18.815
Well now we can take
this information

00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:22.370
and go back into either one
of these and figure out what

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.960
a has to be.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.560
So let's go back into the
orange one right over here

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.550
and figure out what a has to be.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:38.710
So we had 500a plus 200c, but
we know what c is, c is 2.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:46.720
So 200 times 2 is
equal to 2,900.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.390
And now we just
have to solve for a,

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.560
one equation with one unknown.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.540
So we have 500a,
200 times 2 is 400,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.100
plus 400 is equal to 2,900.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.570
We can subtract 400 from
both sides of this equation.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.880
Let me do that.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:10.620
Subtracting 400, and we are
left with this cancels out.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.200
And on the left hand
side, we have 500a.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.280
This is very exciting.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.540
We're in the home stretch.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.950
On the right hand
side, you have 2,500.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.330
500a equals 2,500.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.750
We can divide both
sides by 500, and we

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.700
are left with 2,500
divided by 500 is just 5.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.690
So you have a is equal
to 5 and you're done.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.980
You have solved the
King's conundrum.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.390
Each child on average drinks
2 cups of water-- sorry,

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.200
not cups of water.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.658
I don't know where
I got that from.

00:08:41.658 --> 00:08:46.140
