00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.020
There’s a lot of people out there claiming
to know the best diet, based on what our ancestors

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.020
ate.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.500
But how do we separate the hogwash from the
history?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.650
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.330
There are some people who like to make inferences
on how we should live based on some “ideal”

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.330
past.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.920
Take a recent trendy diet.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.820
The basic tenets of the paleo diet come from
a few current hunter-gather societies, suggesting

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.140
we should eat more like we did before the
invention of agriculture.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.470
We want an easy answer for how we should live,
or more specifically eat, but the real story

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.440
is so much more complex.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.230
So what does evidence say ancient humans ate?

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.321
From looking at teeth, skull fragments, environmental
conditions, and even computer models, our

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:47.170
ancestors lived in a wide range of habitats,
leading to a variety in diets.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.030
Optimal Foraging theory suggests that diet
is influenced by a food’s value and distribution

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.230
within the habitat.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.950
For most of human-ish history we were hunter
gatherers.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.570
Well, mostly gatherers.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.610
Before 4 million years ago, our ancestors
ate a surprising amount of fruits and leaves,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.930
similar to how chimps eat now.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.670
Researchers found isotopic evidence in teeth
enamel of a transition around 3.5 million

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.409
years ago, early hominid species starting
expanding their diets.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.530
They added other plants, like tubers, roots,
and succulents.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.510
The researchers had to add that perhaps these
isotopes are from animals they ate, that ate

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.830
the plants.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.370
Speaking of meat, it’s not certain when
meat entered early human’s diet.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.860
Whether hunted or scavenged, researchers find
evidence of marks on animal bones dating back

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.270
2.6 million years.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.299
A skull found in Tanzania dating back 1.5
million years ago showed that meat had become

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.920
crucial for brain development in early humans.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.820
It’s thought that eating meat regularly
triggered changes in our brains, making us

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.080
the kind of smart apes we are today.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.080
Then there’s teeth.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.650
You can tell a lot by the teeth.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.090
Teeth size and shape and even how our jaws
fit together tell a story.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.310
We have bunodont - back teeth that are low
with rounded cusps that lend themselves well

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.360
to eating below ground food, roots, tubers,
the like.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.799
Our crooked teeth are probably the result
of cooking food.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.390
Cooking opened up a new way of getting nutrients.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.390
But our teeth changed with the invention of
fire.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.420
As we started softening our food by cooking,
our jaws got smaller, but our teeth haven’t

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.440
caught up yet.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.560
hence all the crowding and crooked teeth.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.900
Then about 12,000 years ago we settled down
in communities and started growing our own

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.250
food rather than foraging for it.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.640
This is commonly called the Neolithic Revolution
or Neolithic Demographic Transition.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.069
During this time, humans introduced cereals
into their diet - the Neolithic Founder Crops,

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.010
including, wheat, barley, lentils and peas.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.870
Although, there’s evidence that of charred
barley and wheat from Israel dating to about

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.400
23,000 years ago.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.510
There also some evidence that might move back
the introduction of grain into the human diet

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.239
to about 100,000 years ago.

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.600
Researchers from the University of Calgary
found starch granules on stone tools.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.040
Evidence found in pottery shards suggest that
humans also added dairy products to their

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.560
diets, around 7,000 years ago.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.560
While these advances are more recent, our
guts evolved to keep up.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.319
A genetic mutation in central Europe just
over 7 thousand years ago for humans to make

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:07.340
drinking milk a thing.
