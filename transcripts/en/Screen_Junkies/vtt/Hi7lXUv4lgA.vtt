00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.620
From the minds behind
Snow White And The Huntsman,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.940
and Transformers 2, 3 and 4?

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.960
Oh, no.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.020
Comes the glossy Hollywood adaptation
of a beloved Japanese anime

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.360
that goes about as well
as you expect.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.740
_

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.140
Hollywood is running out of stuff
from the 80s and 90s to remake.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.260
Now they're remaking a film they've
already been ripping off for decades.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.240
But with controversial casting...

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.660
A dumped on plot...

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.000
"Your shell belongs to them,
but not your ghost."

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.840
Just enough recreated scenes
from the anime to put in the trailers.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.380
And a complete lack off understanding about
what made the franchise popular to begin with.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.840
Because as Dragonball Evolution
taught American film executives.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.540
If at first you don't succeed, blamed the reviews
and learned nothing from your mistakes.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.700
You've seen Scarlett Johansson
as a special OPs soldier.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.280
An enhanced human.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.040
A stoic outsider.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.580
A sexy robot voice.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.660
"Can you feel me
with you right now?"

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.620
And a white girl feeling
out of place in Asia.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.660
Now she'll combine them all
as the Major.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.340
An enhanced special OPs sexy robot voice
stoic outsider white girl who feels out of place in AsIa.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.000
"I don't know who
to trust anyone."

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.720
She's a RoboCop
with a weird RoboWalk.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.040
And only one weakness...

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.680
Getting snuck up on
by dudes with tasers.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.000
"(Major writhing)"

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.960
"(Major convulsing)"

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.020
"(Major writhing)"

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.140
You know, for all the gadgets,
maybe invest in a rear camera.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.100
Watch as the studio avoids
a whitewashing controversy

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.520
by showing off how multicultural
their version of Hong Kong is.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.680
And explain that Major's body
is just a robot shell for someone else's brain.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.280
"We made you a new body."

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.900
"A synthetic shell, 
but your ghost is still in here."

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.900
Which... 
Alright, I'll bite.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.580
Then cringe in disbelief as the studio manages
to ruin their own solution by revealing that...

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.660
Yep, she was full blown
Japanese all along.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.940
"What's your name?"

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.300
"Motoko."

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.580
Way to double down gang.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.060
You just try to put out a dumpster fire 
with much larger easily avoidable dumpster fire.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.520
"(explosion)"

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.060
Jack in as the Major teams up with side characters
who get two to four lines of dialogue.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.060
Led by Japanese legend,
Beat Takeshi.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.360
Who was smarter enough to know this movie
wasn't worth speaking English for.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.100
"(Speaking Japanese)"

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.940
Together...They'll chase down
an evil max headroom hacker.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.800
"(robotic glitch) Lesson... Took... 
F-f-from my... failure..."

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.340
"This is...
(robotic glitch) headroom..."

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.280
In a cat and mouse game of shifting loyalties
that will have you wondering...

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.760
Can you see her boobs or not?

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.800
I...I can't tell. And I definitely
don't care about what else is going on.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.280
This movie is really boring.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.280
So gear up for the latest movie
with John Carter syndrome.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.480
Where the source material was so influential 
that now it feels like it's copying the films that inspired.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.820
And witness the newest lame attempt
at a live-action anime film.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.780
Which we should really just leave
to the Japanese to this point.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.240
"(screaming in Japanese)"

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.880
Or... Not.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.080
_

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.500
_

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.660
_

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.240
_

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.780
_

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.600
_

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.360
_

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.800
_

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.480
_

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.060
"Cyber-made liver.
Been saving up for a while.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.860
Now it's last call every night."

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.080
Uhh... guys.
Your friend is an alcoholic.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.360
_

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.160
_

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.740
_

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.560
_

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.720
_
