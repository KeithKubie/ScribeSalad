00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.900
From the Wachowski Brothers, err-- siblings
comes the mind-blowing sci-fi game-changer

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.910
and the two sequels that took a huge steaming
dump on it.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.090
The Matrix.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.759
And it’s sequels.

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.379
Prepare for the most original sci-fi franchise
since Star Wars

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:29.910
that ultimately went all Jar Jar Binks on
itself.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.509
Kinda like Star Wars.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.020
Relive all the awesome moments you loved from
the first film.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.350
That one sequence you liked from the second.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.660
And absolutely nothing from the third.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.150
"Sh*t."

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.039
Jack in to The Matrix, a virtual reality simulation
of the late 90’s, full of flip phones

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.039
Payphones

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.039
MiniDiscs

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.420
Outfits straight out of a Marilyn Manson video.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.510
And AOL screennames.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.609
“This is Apoc,

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:59.609
Switch,

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.699
and Cypher.

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:01.699
Tank,

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.680
and his big brother Dozer.”

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.870
"You've got mail!"

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.480
Watch as one hacker named Neo, which is an
anagram for one, becomes “The One” who

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.729
can only make one facial expression.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.100
But he’s not alone.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.740
Meet Trinity, the love of Neo’s life

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.050
and Morpheus, the...other love of Neo’s
life.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.760
"What you know you can't explain, but you
feel it.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.930
It is this feeling that has brought you to
me."

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.390
"You are the one, Neo.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.560
I've spent my entire life looking for you."

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.370
"Try and relax.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.039
This will feel a little weird."

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.880
"He is the one."

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.490
Get a room, you two.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.810
Together, they’ll face off against Agent
Smith, a villain so cool...

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.210
they just copied him a bunch of times instead
of coming up with another cool bad guy.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.179
Watch as these two battle in this awesomely
choreographed kung-fu fight

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.320
Then in this CGI bullshit

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.150
And then in this Dragonball Z ripoff.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.170
Kamehame-nah!

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.250
Journey to the Matrix, a world of limitless
possibilities, that had audiences questioning

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.870
their own existence.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.550
And then journey to Zion, a world of...sweaty
cave ravers?

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.550
Really?

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.440
We’re gonna spend half of this trilogy here?

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.530
Ugh, can we just watch some bullet time again?

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.970
Nice.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.690
So settle in for a film that spawned a thousand
imitators...

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.810
From it’s effects

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.890
To its tone

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.240
To its wardrobe

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.490
To its own sequels.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.200
And prepare for the thinking man’s action
franchise, that got stuck way too far up it’s

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.500
own ass by the end of part two.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.290
“While this answer functioned, it was obviously
fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.660
contradictory systemic anomaly, that, if left
unchecked, might threaten the system itself.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.730
Ergo, those--"

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.450
I have no idea what he's talking about.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.620
Is it too late for me to take the blue pill?

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.730
Starring...

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.850
Kung-Fu Jesus

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.540
and Monica Bellucci

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.130
Hah, just kidding.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.130
Boobs.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.130
The Matrix.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.600
And its sequels.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.690
You know its a bad sign when your video game
and direct-to-DVD cartoon are better than

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.460
your movies.
