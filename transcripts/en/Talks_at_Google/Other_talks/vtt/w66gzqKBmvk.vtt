00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:16.370
&gt;&gt;commentator: Good afternoon everyone. We're
proud to have Steve Lehto, author of Mis-Michigan's

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:33.030
Columbus: The Life of Douglass Houghton here
in our Ann Arbor Google office today.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:45.140
It was named one of Michigan's most notable
books of 2010. Steve brings us this captivating

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:57.030
story of Douglass Houghton. As Michiganers
we know that the name Houghton is incredibly

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:09.500
well known and graces the name of not only
a city, a county, a lake, waterfalls, schools,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.070
and even a Google conference room.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.740
This story is about Michigan's first geologist
turned explorer, Houghton's Journey. He discovered

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:29.410
more than any man before him, became the Mayor
of Detroit, and taught at the University of

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.430
Michigan all before the age of 36.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.630
In addition to being a talented author, Steve
is also an attorney and professor here in

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.430
Southeast Michigan. He spends a lot of his
time speaking about these topics and other

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.040
Michigan history whenever he gets the opportunity.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.890
So without any further ado, please help us
in welcoming our guest, Steve Lehto.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.890
[applause]

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.251
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Thank you.

00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:09.960
I'll do my best without the audio-visual presentation.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.920
Douglass Houghton is the subject of the book,
Michigan's Columbus, and it's interesting

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.160
because I did not coin the phrase "Michigan's
Columbus." That was actually a phrase attributed

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.900
to, given to him by several other people previously
and it's-it's one of those things people ask

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.640
me they say, "Steve why would him Michigan's
Columbus?" I say, "Well, don't worry Columbus

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.890
didn't actually discover America and Houghton
didn't discover Michigan," but he was an explorer

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:46.010
and that's the whole point is that the most,
foremost explorer in Michigan history is Douglass

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.010
Houghton.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.840
So Douglass Houghton born in New York in the
early 1800's and in a town called Fredonia,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:02.560
New York, believe it or not near Troy, and
he grew up in the area and went to school

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.140
and went to Rensselaer Polytechnic where he
got a degree in geology.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.090
And while he was attending their school he
also was working on getting his medical degree.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.070
This is a time back then when you wouldn't
go to medical school to become a doctor you'd

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.990
actually apprentice with someone, and after
you learned enough medicine you'd then go

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.920
stand before the local medical board and if
they thought you were good for doctoring you'd

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.440
became a doctor.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.740
And so as he was finishing up his bi-geology
degree and his medical degree the people of

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:50.400
Detroit decided that they needed someone to
come into town and help them out.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.040
And in the 1830's the population of the City
of Detroit was two thousand. At one point

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.650
in time the population was 2222, two thousand
two hundred and twenty two people. And at

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.959
that point in time it was simply just like
the entryway to the Northwest Territory. If

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.500
you look on a map you'll see that the Lake
Ontario, Lake Erie and then the Michigan Territory

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.320
would spread far of the west from that.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.980
And the Michigan Territory at that time, the
1830's, actually included what is now Michigan,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.970
Wisconsin, Minnesota, and half of North and
South Dakota. So for instance, the headwaters

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:48.820
of the Mississippi River were in the Michigan
Territory in 1831.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:05:00.490
So the fathers of Detroit actually sent an
emissary back east to Rensselaer with the

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:07.330
mission to find somebody who could come to
Detroit and deliver lectures on wholesome

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:15.440
topics. They actually thought that if they
didn't have something like this going on there'd

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.730
be too much temptation among the local people
to do things like drink and gamble and womanize,

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:29.360
unless of course you're a woman and whatever
the equivalent to that is.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.360
[laughter]

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.320
And so they asked Houghton if he would come
back to Detroit and deliver lectures. And

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:46.270
so interestingly enough, he agreed to do it.
He was a young man probably 20, 21 years old

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:54.650
when he got the offer and he agreed to come
to Detroit and the promise of employment was

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.830
simply, "You can give lectures and people
will attend the lectures and you can charge

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.010
admission and that admission will be your
salary."

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.180
So Houghton moves to Detroit, he delivers
the lectures, and it turns out they were a

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.970
raging success. Houghton is delivering lectures
on things like rocks and trees --

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.970
[laughter]

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.449
and plants and farming, all extremely important
things though on the frontier.

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:25.330
And at that point in time Detroit is also
the capital of the Michigan Territory. So

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:32.500
although there's only two or three thousand
people there, a lot of them are the important

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.180
people in the Territory. People like Lewis
Cass, Henry Schoolcraft and the names that

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:45.330
you see now on maps in Michigan or on streets
in Michigan or on roads around Google.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.330
[laughter]

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.430
Okay, that's where a lot of these names came
from.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:58.520
So when Houghton was in Detroit giving his
lecture invariably a lot of the famous people

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:06.139
in Detroit, the movers and shakers, came and
saw him speak and so he became very well known.

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:13.780
And Henry Schoolcraft in particular recognized
that here's a young guy, he's a scientists,

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:20.570
he's a doctor, but he's also a very, very
smart guy who can explain stuff to people.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.479
So Henry Schoolcraft approached Houghton and
said, "I'm putting together an expedition

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:31.460
to go find the headwaters of the Mississippi."
They'd never been marked by white men before.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.740
So Schoolcraft got federal funding, Douglass
Houghton and a bunch of other men and they

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:42.050
went up to find the headwaters of the Mississippi[bad
audio] in the Michigan Territory.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.130
Amazingly enough they went there from Detroit
by canoe.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.130
[laughter]

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:53.610
So they got in a canoe and paddled up the
Detroit River, across Lake St. Clair, up Lake

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:59.940
Huron, dragged the canoe over the falls at
St. Mary's Falls, and then canoed across Lake

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:06.100
Superior, and then went down into Minnesota,
and eventually found the headwater of the

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.100
Mississippi.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:14.820
They made that trip twice, once one year and
once the second year. And in the second year

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:21.229
they did it they actually found the headwaters
of the Mississippi and Henry Schoolcraft has

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:28.840
gone down in history as being the first white
man to mark the headwaters of the Mississippi,

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.080
which are now in Minnesota.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:38.179
But while Houghton was on that trip he also
was exploring and making note of the geological

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:43.759
things he saw. And along the way he actually
did see the Ontonagon Boulder and visited

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:51.420
the copper country which is the [Quina] Peninsula
of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. So he

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.899
became very, very aware of that in the 1830's.

00:08:54.899 --> 00:08:58.290
So after these trips were over he wrote some
reports about this and in fact one of his

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.040
reports was circulated in Washington D.C.
because at that time portions of the Northwest

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:12.019
Territory were not states. Michigan wasn't
even a state yet. And there was a lot of speculation

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:16.389
about whether or not Michigan should become
a state or what they should do and how they

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.389
should divide up the area.

00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:23.860
So in 1835 Michigan actually had enough people
to apply for statehood. You needed to have

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.079
60,000 people living within your borders and
then you draft a constitution and you apply

00:09:27.079 --> 00:09:28.079
for statehood.

00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:32.399
So Michigan applied for statehood, we hold
a constitutional convention, and we get blocked

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:37.334
by Ohio. And I like to mention for number
one because we're in Ann Arbor obviously and

00:09:37.334 --> 00:09:38.334
everyone knows that the old saying, "Oh how
I hate Ohio State." It actually dates back

00:09:38.334 --> 00:09:41.079
to the Ohio war that Michigan had with-with
them and the Toledo war.

00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:45.660
And there's a borderline between Michigan
and Ohio and if you look on a map it's not

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:56.089
straight. The reason it's not straight is
that when Ohio became a state in 1803 they

00:09:56.089 --> 00:10:01.600
unilaterally declared a straight line from
the bottom of Lake Michigan over above Toledo

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.779
to Lake Erie.

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:08.389
When the federal government surveyed it they
actually said is should be a straight line

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:18.899
to the bottom of Lake Michigan over to the
bottom of Toledo which would put Toledo in

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:24.860
Michigan. But Mi-Ohio became a state first,
they declared Toledo as part of their state.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:31.160
If you went to Toledo in the 1820's and asked
people there, "What state do you live in?"

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.759
Most of them would have said, "We-we live
in Michigan." But Ohio didn't think that.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:43.089
So when we applied for statehood, Congress
has gotta pass on any state that wants to

00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:48.519
join the Union. And Ohio actually lobbied
actively to block us from getting into the

00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:59.660
Union. And we had no votes in Congress because
we're not a state yet. So we go to Congress,

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:06.110
they vote us down. We go to Congress, they
vote us down.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:13.250
While all this is going on, a friend of Douglass
Houghton's who's the Governor of Michigan,

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:20.720
Stevens T. Mason, they call him "the little,
the boy governor." Stevens Mason was about

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:26.029
this tall and Douglass Houghton was about
this tall --

00:11:26.029 --> 00:11:27.029
[laughter]

00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:31.559
they called Douglass Houghton a little doctor,
he five foot four, so he's probably about

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:32.559
this tall.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:39.040
Stevens T. Mason rounded up a militia of Michigan
men, a Michigan Militia, and basically sent

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:46.459
them down to protect the Toledo strip from
Ohio marauders. And it's a fascinating concept,

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:54.399
there's a whole, been books written about
the Toledo war.

00:11:54.399 --> 00:12:03.279
We actually sent Michigan Militiamen down
there. They sent up Ohio Militiamen and there

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:11.079
would actually be skirmishes in the Toledo
Strip. And at the time there wasn't much there.

00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:18.940
No one ever got shot; no one ever got killed;
and the only injuries we know of was that

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:28.720
someone got stabbed in the back in a bar on
a Friday night, which happens every night

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.720
in Toledo.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720
[laughter]

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:36.850
So we're not sure if that's actually a war
wound or not, but that's the upshot of it.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:45.639
What wound up happening though was after all
the squabbling got back and forth and it was

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:50.990
getting to the point where it was very embarrassing
that this is happenin', somebody pulled aside

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:57.160
Stevens T. Mason and said, "Look you guys
are never gonna' win this 'cause you, you

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:03.920
don't have the votes in-in Washington to do
it. How 'bout this? We'll give you the western

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:17.149
two-thirds of the Upper Peninsula as part
of your state and you give up the little strip

00:13:17.149 --> 00:13:21.889
of Toledo." And so they agreed to do that.

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:30.010
So it took two years of squabbling but we
basically gave up the strip of land that contained

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:38.949
Toledo it's like just a few hundred square
miles and we picked up a couple hundred thousand

00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:42.149
acres of land in the Upper Peninsula based
on that.

00:13:42.149 --> 00:13:52.420
And so we got the western two-thirds, we actually
got all the way up from Sault Saint Marie

00:13:52.420 --> 00:14:01.399
all the way over to what is now the-the line
between us and Wisconsin, Iron River, Iron

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:08.110
Mountain, Iron Wood, the Irons over there.
So we picked up all that land in exchange

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.110
for it.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:15.769
The amazing thing is that back then all the
editorials in the newspapers talked about

00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:19.629
how we got ripped off.

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:20.629
[laughter]

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:31.990
Because you think about this, in a time before
transportation, no roads, the only way to

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:38.350
get up there was by canoe and it takes you
a month to get there, very few people in Detroit

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.569
would ever see the Upper Peninsula. So to
have given up Toledo which is their backyard

00:14:43.569 --> 00:14:50.009
for someplace, it's like giving us something
on the moon or the North Pole.

00:14:50.009 --> 00:14:51.009
[laughter]

00:14:51.009 --> 00:14:55.509
So we got the Upper Peninsula in exchange
for that.

00:14:55.509 --> 00:15:04.509
Now that we're a state, Detroit's the capital,
they hold a legislative meeting, we elect

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:12.149
all kinds of people, and the first thing the
legislature does when their in session is

00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:15.089
they appoint Douglass Houghton state geologist.

00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:22.429
It's interesting because we still have a state
geologist today but nost, most people have

00:15:22.429 --> 00:15:28.559
no idea who he is. I've met the guy, he's
a very nice guy.

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:29.559
[laughter]

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:36.179
But back then it was an extremely important
position. Michigan was a young state. To raise

00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:42.749
money they either raised taxes, which they
don't wanna do first day in office, or they

00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:48.359
could send somebody out and say, "Find natural
resources that we can exploit."

00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:55.480
So they sent Houghton out with the job of
looking for natural resources that could be

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.629
exploited especially if he could find any
minerals that could be mined: copper, gold,

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:02.220
silver, and then also salt.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:07.919
When you're on the frontier in the 1830's
there's no refrigeration, you need salt for

00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:14.379
your food otherwise stuff spoils, you can
get all kinds of weird diseases, so salt is

00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:23.850
extremely important and we were importing
a lot of salt from the State of New York at

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:29.639
that time. We had a trade deficit with New
York on salt.

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:34.399
So Douglass Houghton goes out in 1837 in the
fall to explore Michigan. Now it's kinda late

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:42.199
in the year, he can only do a short trip,
so him and his men pack up their wagons and

00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:48.549
they hike for an entire day out of Detroit
and camp for the night in Royal Oak.

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:58.970
So those of you who are familiar with the
layout of Michigan you know that you can do

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:06.810
that drive today by car in about 10 minutes,
on a bicycle you can do it in an afternoon.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:15.240
And they camped for the night in Royal Oak.
The next morning they get up, they pack up

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:22.470
all the stuff, they hike for another complete
day and they camp the night in Pontiac.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:28.810
The third night they're camping so far out
in the wilderness that one of the guys writes

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:38.210
in his journal about how they're hearing wild
animals they don't know what they are, they're

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:46.000
seeing trees they've never seen before, they're
out in a crazy wilderness, and they're still

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.300
in Oakland County.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.300
[laughter]

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.360
But that's how undeveloped it was at the time.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:58.210
So these guys travel, they finally make it
up to Tittabawassee River which is up near

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:07.100
Corunna and they get in the canoe and they
paddle out to the Saginaw Bay area, and while

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:13.030
they're out there they actually find the salt
wells that became part of the basis believe

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.120
it or not for the Dow Chemical Company.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:24.170
And if you go to the town of Sanford, Michigan
today there's a historical marker where the

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:32.360
first salt well was sunk by men that Douglass
Houghton said, "Dig a well here."

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:41.070
So the first year, and people from Michigan
know about this, the first year they went

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.760
up and around the thumb like this.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.750
The second year he then went up and went around
the entire lower Michigan.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:52.820
And every time he went he'd bring a bunch
of guys with him and he would be keeping a

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.270
journal everywhere he went and his journals
survived. We still have them today.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.190
And also with him on the trips there was always
two or three other guys keeping journals and

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.890
a lot of their journals survived as well.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:05.540
And it's fascinating because some of these
trips there'd be Douglass Houghton and two

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:12.700
or three other guys all keeping daily journals
of everything they did. And you can compare

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:20.000
them side by side and reconstruct these trips
on a daily basis, so it's fascinating.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.990
Because Douglass Houghton is gathering samples
largely rocks and the other guys are doing

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:33.440
the paddling, they'd actually hire guys to
do nothing but paddle. He'd hire, they called

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:43.100
'em voyagers or couriers, and they would do
nothing but paddle for you all day long. You're

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.100
like hired mules but in a canoe.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:50.110
And so they went up and around and he's always
looking for marketable resources. So for instance,

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:58.160
in the Lower Peninsula not far past Saginaw
there's a town called Alabaster, still on

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:14.270
the maps today. If you go there today there's
not much there, but you can see the evidence

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:24.190
where there used to be open pit mines there
and they used to mine gypsum and alabaster.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:31.970
If you ever read the book Devil in the White
City by Erik Larson about the Chicago World's

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:39.690
Fair in 1893 and the-the serial killer there,
it's a fascinating book. Anyways they called

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:44.320
it The White City because they built these
buildings that were bright, brilliant white

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:50.640
and the-the white in the cement came from
gypsum and alabaster from Alabaster, Michigan

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.690
and that was discovered by Houghton and his
men in 1838.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:21:02.680
So they also found like this rocks that he
 [ ] Drummond Island. They found clay in a

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:09.310
bunch of different places. They found salt
springs over in Grand Rapids and so on.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:18.180
So he'd do, he'd do a trip around, come back
to Detroit for the winter, write his report,

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:23.520
give his report to the legislature. And he's,
he's a government official so he's getting

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.410
paid a salary to do this and then a-a-a-a
budget to do this as well.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:32.500
So 1837 he does the thumb; 1838 does lower
Michigan; 1839 he goes up and he goes across

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.410
the bottom of the Upper Peninsula and then
back around Lake Michigan.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:45.930
And on that trip, for instance, he actually
encounters a-a-a-a flower growing on the beach

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:52.180
that looks like goldenrod. And Houghton beside
being a geologist and a doctor was also an

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:58.550
amateur biologist and he recognized that the
goldenrod looked funny so he brought some

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:05.520
samples home and he showed them to a friend
of his named Zina Pitcher who is also I think

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:12.850
a professor at U of M and he said, "Yes, that
is a previously unidentified goldenrod." So

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.470
it's now called Houghton's goldenrod.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:22.680
So if you go to the DNR Website for the State
of Michigan under endangered species there's

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:31.780
actually goldenrod that you can only find
it growing in the wet sand between the high

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:40.630
water mark in the sand dunes at the tops of
Lake Michigan and Lake Huron and its endangered.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:47.620
It only grows in this little, tiny little
strips of grass and most people don't know

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:54.500
what they are but its goldenrod, it looks
a little different than typical goldenrod.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:02.680
The whole time Houghton's doing his exploring
though he was being pushed the whole time

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.220
because people wanted him to go explore the
copper country.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:13.559
People had known about the copper in the Upper
Peninsula for probably about 300 years at

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:20.641
that point. There are stories in Europe in
the 1600's of there being large deposits of

00:23:20.641 --> 00:23:21.641
copper someplace in the new world.

00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:28.400
And a lot of people outside of Michigan don't
know this but copper in nature normally does

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:36.010
not occur in its natural form. Usually it's
ore that has to be processed and crushed and

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:45.490
smelted, but if you go to the Upper Peninsula
of Michigan you can sim-simply walk around

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:53.300
on a rock pile and find pieces of pure copper.
They call it native copper.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.970
And native copper's unusual in the world but
it-it-it's largest concentration is in the

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.450
Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:05.130
People have known about that for years and
in fact when Houghton had gone to the Schoolcraft

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:12.290
expedition they had visited a boulder that's
called the Ontonagon Boulder. The Ontonagon

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.000
Boulder was this large piece of copper out
in the woods next to the Ontonagon River.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.990
And every single person that went to the Upper
Peninsula back then who's an explorer would

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:28.120
visit this boulder and it was a rock that
was so big that grown men couldn't move it.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.620
And they'd come back to Detroit where ever
they came from, Montreal, and they'd tell

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:39.000
their friends, "We-we hiked up in the woods
and there's this boulder out there and we

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.020
couldn't move it."

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:44.240
And the funny thing is by the time people
stumbled back to civilization after spending

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.920
months getting out to this thing, the boulder
got bigger and heavier.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.920
[laughter]

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:55.710
So that by the time the story got told it
was always a 10,000 pound or 20,000 pound

00:24:55.710 --> 00:25:01.140
boulder. And in fact in Schoolcraft's book,
he wrote several books, one of his books he

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:09.280
has an illustration showing the boulder and
he shows a canoe of Indians paddling across

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.630
the river over towards this thing the size
of a garage --

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:15.630
[laughter]

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.180
and in reality the Ontonagon Boulder is about
the size of a microwave oven. It's about this

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:27.520
big. And we know how much it weighs, it weighs
3,700 pounds. But the interesting thing is

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:35.470
that the tales of the Ontonagon Boulder coming
back to Detroit, the stories coming down had

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.470
spurred to think, "Oh my gosh there's this
copper laying around up there just to be picked

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.320
up off the ground."

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:49.730
So in 1840 Douglass Houghton and his men went
across the shore of Lake Superior on the northern

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:55.610
shore of the Upper Peninsula, got to the copper
country and spent a lot of time exploring

00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:03.530
Quina Peninsula. While they were up there
Houghton gathered samples of both the native

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:16.540
ore and the copper ore and, the native copper
and the copper ore, and the ore he brought

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:23.570
back was 47 percent pure. And there was a
copper industry in Cornwall, England based

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:32.690
on ore that's no better than 12 percent copper.
So he said, "This ore shows that they can

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:43.570
mine it up here" and that's great. And he
also noted the fact that there this-this native

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:47.741
copper there in huge quantities as well.

00:26:47.741 --> 00:26:55.120
So he wrote that report and they referred
to that as his 1841 report and that's the

00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:04.600
one that they often talk about being the one
that sparks the copper industry up there because

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:13.011
he was the first person of any learning to
actually write a report that said, "Yes it's

00:27:13.011 --> 00:27:20.220
up here. It can be mined and-and someone can
establish an industry based on this."

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:32.980
People took his report to Boston and got investors
to put up the money to start the companies

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:41.900
that became the Quincy and the Cliff and the
Calumet and Hecla and so on.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.750
So that's Houghton's work as a geologist.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:53.460
So it's 1841 he's basically done now though.
So Douglass Houghton then on top of everything

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:59.710
else he's done, then approaches the federal
government and he-he's also trained as a surveyor.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:05.500
Back then surveyors were very common, it's
kinda like lawyers today, everybody knew a

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.760
surveyor. They often joked that Mt. Rushmore
is three surveyors and a president,

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.760
[laughter]

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.130
because three of the four presidents on Mt.
Rushmore were surveyors.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:20.630
So Douglass Houghton went to the federal government
and got a contract to finish the survey of

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:28.260
the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. And if you
ever go to Sault Saint Marie there's actually

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:34.880
a-a-a-a spot, I have a photograph of it I'd
like to show it to you later.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:41.250
If you look at a map of Michigan there's Baseline
Road which is the baseline that runs across

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:47.710
the bottom of the State of Michigan, it's
also 8 Mile Road. There's also a line that

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.770
runs North-South called the Meridian. And
the Meridian when it goes through Lansing

00:28:51.770 --> 00:29:01.000
for instance becomes a road called Meridian
and there's a mall called Meridian Mall on

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:11.090
that road. Every property description in Michigan
is based on its relationship to the intersection

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:16.220
of those two lines. It's like a big grid.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:22.880
So they would start in Sault Saint Marie and
survey their way across working west from

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:30.870
the Meridian and they knew how far north they
were from the Baseline.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:43.680
So it's an interesting thing is that if you
go up the Upper Peninsula today and find the

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:51.950
property descriptions, and go find the corners
of those property descriptions many of those

00:29:51.950 --> 00:30:00.400
corners were marked by Douglass Houghton and
his men back in 1844 and 1845.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:13.440
And in fact in the book I've got a photograph
of a Barren Tree. And what that is is when

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:21.720
they got to a corner of an intersection it's
very, very important, like the corner between

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:30.880
two townships, if there was a tree near it
they'd actually take out a big piece of metal

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:44.330
and they'd carve off the bark and take a scribe
and carve numbers into the side of the tree.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:56.660
So it'd say like, "33 north, 58 west, section
16." And then they'd make a note in their

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:06.500
field book that, "Okay, we marked the corner
of that intersection on the side of this tree."

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.590
And so years later people would when they're
redoing the surveys or they're checkin' the

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:16.930
property descriptions would actually find
the tree and say, "Okay, there's the tree

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.570
that was marked."

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:24.400
And I've spoken to guys at Michigan Tech in
this, they have a survey department there,

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:32.120
they actually teach surveying as a, as a,
as a vocation, who told me that to this day

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:38.970
they still walk the woods and find barren
trees marked by these guys in the 1840's and

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:44.700
1850's. The trees are still there. Some of
them have fallen over but the photograph that

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:51.900
I have in the book was taken in 1910 I believe
which would have been 55 years after Houghton's

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:58.470
men marked it. The tree was still alive and
kicking then and it was just many, many years

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:04.610
later it may have fallen down. They've gone
back and remarked these things.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:12.040
The amazing thing is that these guys were
actually working with nothing more but-but-but

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:18.240
basically the transits that you look through
and basically rumors, big chains they would

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:26.980
stretch to measure distances. And even working
that way across the state very, very slowly

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:36.380
they actually on the far end of the state
had a margin of error plus or minus only like

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:41.730
10 feet, which is amazing to think about in
a day long before GPS's and satellites.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:46.910
If you think about just the difficulty of
shooting a straight line across a swamp or

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:50.950
through woods or across a mountain ridge and
it's interesting because when I was researching

00:32:50.950 --> 00:33:00.530
the book I'd known about him doing the geological
work, I didn't even know that he was a-a surveyor

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:05.150
when I first [ ] work on the book.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:11.710
I actually found a, an article written by
his nephew and his nephew had actually worked

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:19.151
for him one summer doing survey work. And
his nephew had basically gotten a job as a

00:33:19.151 --> 00:33:23.150
gopher on the expedition of 1845 and one of
the things he talks about doing is carrying

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:24.150
barometers.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:29.350
And that answered one of the questions that
I had is how they do elevation changes because

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:36.010
if you think about it, I mean I suppose you
could triangulate elevation changes, but actually

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:43.300
it's easier to for instance when you're at
Copper Harbor where they spent one summer

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:52.310
you have one guy sit down at the lake shore
with a barometer and take barometric readings

00:33:52.310 --> 00:34:04.120
at the top and bottom of every hour. And then
if you're out in the woods hiking and you're

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:18.529
surveying you get to the top or bottom of
something you stop there and wait for the

00:34:18.529 --> 00:34:25.099
top or bottom of the hour and you get your
barometric pressure reading and then at the

00:34:25.099 --> 00:34:36.109
end of the day you go back and you recorrelate
those two. And what's amazing to get is that

00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:44.539
all of this stuff turns out to be relatively
accurate especially considering how primitive,

00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:48.480
primitive this was at the time.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:55.779
So the other interesting thing that came out
of Houghton's survey work as he surveyed the

00:34:55.779 --> 00:35:02.999
Upper Peninsula is that as they're workin'
their way across he contracted out a lot of

00:35:02.999 --> 00:35:09.259
the work and one of the guys he contracted
with was a guy named William Burt. And William

00:35:09.259 --> 00:35:16.829
Burt was inventor and he had invented a typewriter
that he had a patent on already and he also

00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:23.329
had invented a thing called equatorial sextant
which was a-a basically a solar compass. It's

00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:29.599
the kind of thing that you see a pirate using
to measure the stars if you look at the stars,

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:36.880
but this was designed to be used from daylight
to measure the angle of the sun to figure

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.040
out north, south, east, and west.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.830
And when he patented it people had actually
said to him, "This is a nonsensical thing.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:52.279
You don't need this on land because you can
always use a compass." Well when they were

00:35:52.279 --> 00:35:58.920
surveying across the Upper Peninsula when
they got to the Negaunee Marquette area compasses

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:05.750
don't work because there's so much iron ore
in the ground.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:09.849
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Hum.

00:36:09.849 --> 00:36:21.309
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: And so his men stopped, they
didn't know what to do, and Burt whips out

00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:30.431
his solar compass and says, "Guys I got the
answer here. I got a solar compass." And the

00:36:30.431 --> 00:36:48.180
amazing thing is that his men found iron ore
samples in the ground and said, "Here's the

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:59.440
problem. It's the iron ore samples." And so
they wrote a report describing the iron ore

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:07.260
deposits in the area and those reports later
became the foundation of the iron ore industry

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.430
up there.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:15.369
And yet when Burt talks about it, all he talks
about is, "My solar compass works. I've been

00:37:15.369 --> 00:37:18.609
vindicated." And so it's interesting because
the other guys are like, "Hey someone gonna

00:37:18.609 --> 00:37:20.109
get rich." He's like, "No my solar compass
works."

00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:21.109
[laughter]

00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:22.140
So, so when it comes to Houghton's discoveries
Burt's often credited with being the one who

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:27.599
discovered the iron and that's fine, but Burt
was actually working for Houghton, so he gets

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:30.180
kind of like an assist on that.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:36.839
So along with that, one of the most important
stories I-I kinda touched on was I mentioned

00:37:36.839 --> 00:37:42.749
the Ontonagon Boulder. The Ontonagon Boulder
was out in the woods 'till about 1843. And

00:37:42.749 --> 00:37:46.819
what happened was as the stories drifted south
about it an enterprising guy in Detroit named

00:37:46.819 --> 00:37:47.890
Julius Eldred decided he's gonna go get it.

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:48.890
[laughter]

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:55.650
And so this was back wild, wild west days
almost. He gathers up some men and some equipment

00:37:55.650 --> 00:38:01.989
and he heads up to the Ontonagon Boulder and
there's a whole story behind it because some

00:38:01.989 --> 00:38:05.190
other guy sitting on claims it's his. It's
like a Dr. Seuss story.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:14.380
And this guy manages to talk the other guy
out of it to pay him some money and he starts

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:23.160
using winches and blocks and tackle and all
kinds of heavy equipment and he manages to

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:31.160
pry the thing out of the ground and he gets
it loose. He then puts it on a train car and

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:38.299
he actually brought his own train tracks up
there and actually brought train tracks and

00:38:38.299 --> 00:38:46.329
rolls it and he does this thing where he brings
the train tracks around. There's a Wallace

00:38:46.329 --> 00:38:51.119
and Gromit cartoon that does the exact same
thing --

00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:52.119
[laughter]

00:38:52.119 --> 00:38:53.529
but much faster motion.

00:38:53.529 --> 00:39:01.109
So he gets the iron the-the-the Ontonagon
Boulder down to the shore just as the army

00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:08.720
shows up. And the U.S. Army had sent somebody
up there 'cause they'd heard the rumor that

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:15.680
someone's prying the Ontonagon Boulder lose
and the Army said, "Guess what? That's federal

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:19.170
property. You don't have a permit to pull
that out the ground. It's ours now."

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:20.170
[laughter]

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:27.529
And so the federal government seized the Ontonagon
Boulder from Julius Eldred and took it to

00:39:27.529 --> 00:39:35.089
the War Department in Washington. Julius Eldred
followed it there and filed a lawsuit against

00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:40.549
the government saying it was his. He wound
up paying a couple thousand dollars for it

00:39:40.549 --> 00:39:44.410
and long story, it winds up at the Smithsonian
in the basement.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:51.400
So if you go now to the Smithsonian you can
see the Ontonagon Boulder. Like I said it's

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:56.690
about this big. The amazing thing is it weighs
three thousand seven hundred pounds. Now thirty-seven

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:05.290
hundred pounds is a lot of weight. A lot of
cars on the road today are right around that,

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:07.150
thirty-seven hundred pounds.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:14.539
But amazingly by today's standards that's
not even a significant boulder because they

00:40:14.539 --> 00:40:17.349
have found much larger boulders than that.
So if you ever go to the Upper Peninsula and

00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:22.910
you go to the town called Calumet, as you
drive into Calumet there's a park called Agassiz

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:28.029
Park and there's a statute of a guy named
Rudolph Agassiz sitting there and-and directly

00:40:28.029 --> 00:40:33.244
in front of him is a big piece of copper and
it's about the size of this screen here but

00:40:33.244 --> 00:40:36.579
upright on the side of the road, and that
weighs 9,000 pounds. So it weighs more than

00:40:36.579 --> 00:40:40.890
double what the Ontonagon Boulder weighs and
that's just by the side of the road. Anybody

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:49.460
can go by it with a tow strap and just grab
it, okay? About three bucks a pound these

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.019
days so, get you some money.

00:40:51.019 --> 00:40:52.019
[laughter]

00:40:52.019 --> 00:40:55.529
The weird thing is that that's nowhere near
the largest boulder they found up there. They

00:40:55.529 --> 00:41:01.900
actually found a larger boulder that's on
display if you, you went to Tech?

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.980
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Um-hum.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.989
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Up at the top of the hill the
other side of this, the canal the Quincy Mine

00:41:05.989 --> 00:41:06.989
Hoist

00:41:06.989 --> 00:41:07.989
&gt;&gt;female in audience: yeah.

00:41:07.989 --> 00:41:09.489
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Okay, the houses up there.
Inside that building they have on display

00:41:09.489 --> 00:41:14.869
this huge boulder of copper they found at
the bottom of Lake Superior that weighs 33,000

00:41:14.869 --> 00:41:19.789
pounds and it's about 20 or 30 feet of water.

00:41:19.789 --> 00:41:28.970
Some scuba divers were out there and one of
them noticed that this looks like copper.

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:40.549
They came back and checked sure enough it's
all copper. And they got a barge and one of

00:41:40.549 --> 00:41:45.979
these huge listing straps and they picked
this thing up off the bottom of the lake and

00:41:45.979 --> 00:41:52.829
they put it on display, 33,000 pounds. That's
the third largest boulder we know about up

00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:53.829
there.

00:41:53.829 --> 00:42:01.130
About two or three years ago some construction
workers working near the top of the hill doing

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:08.249
a parking lot for Portage Health Systems scraping
down, hit a piece of copper that weighed 56,000

00:42:08.249 --> 00:42:11.430
pounds. And that was such a big piece of copper
that it actually was in the way and the company's

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:12.430
called Moyle Construction and Moyle's a big
name up there. And the Moyle Construction

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.430
actually went to the property owners and said,
"We'll split the cost with you if you'll let

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.430
us remove this and sell it." And so they took
the 56,000 pound boulder out of there and

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:15.430
sold it. The rumor is they sold it to the
Chinese 'cause they're chewing up all kinds

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:16.430
of copper right now their infrastructure building,

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.430
[laughter]

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:18.430
dams and all that.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:19.430
But they've actually found an even a larger
piece of copper. It's on private property

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:20.430
out there, the [ ], but that's just kinda
funny because the Ontonagon Boulder turned

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:21.430
out to be so small by-by comparison. But that's
the one that had all the imagination sparked

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:22.619
of all the prospectors and so on.

00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:23.619
So anyway as Houghton's done with all his
exploring, he's done with all his surveying,

00:42:23.619 --> 00:42:25.080
he's 36 years old. He's been offered a job
to teach at the University of Michigan, which

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.950
he's accepted by the way.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:30.070
But you have to remember that U of M back
then is different than the U of M today. When

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:31.070
U of M started in Ann Arbor, it was actually
originally in Detroit and they moved it. If

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.160
you're ever in the City-County Building, which
is the building in Detroit that's got the

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.819
Spirit of Detroit out in front of it, there's
a plaque inside the building on the wall and

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:36.819
it says, "This is the site of the original
University of Michigan."

00:42:36.819 --> 00:42:42.339
They moved it to Ann Arbor. It had a class
out here, the entire student body was 12 students.

00:42:42.339 --> 00:42:43.339
So I like to explain to people that you could
probably have fielded a basketball team, if

00:42:43.339 --> 00:42:44.339
they'd invented the game yet --

00:42:44.339 --> 00:42:45.339
[laughter]

00:42:45.339 --> 00:42:46.339
but you couldn't fill the full football team,
unless you wanna play both ways which I suppose

00:42:46.339 --> 00:42:47.339
you could.

00:42:47.339 --> 00:42:48.339
And then the student body dropped below that
before it recovered and eventually became

00:42:48.339 --> 00:42:49.339
what it is today.

00:42:49.339 --> 00:42:50.339
But Houghton had agreed to work out here and
he's going to be on the faculty. He was technically

00:42:50.339 --> 00:42:51.339
on the faculty before that but it's unclear
if he ever actually traveled out here to teach

00:42:51.339 --> 00:42:56.720
or he may have come out here and guest lectured
or something but.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.569
He was also the Mayor of Detroit one term,
president of the first Detroit Public School

00:43:00.569 --> 00:43:03.930
Board. He did all the exploring we talked
of the reports we talked about.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:08.700
And in 1845 as he's wrapping up his expedition
he was in Eagle River in October, which is

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:12.270
kind of late in the year up there. And he
had some men who were down on the beach who

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:16.539
were still surveying and they were wrapping
up their work for the, for the season.

00:43:16.539 --> 00:43:19.400
So he went down by boat to visit them and
to drop off some supplies and also to pick

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:23.380
up two men who needed to get back into a boat,
a ship to get back to Sault Saint Marie.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:27.509
And on his trip back they got hit by a snow
storm in October. Now if you're ever at the

00:43:27.509 --> 00:43:31.700
Upper Peninsula you know it can snow up there
in August. I've been up there in August and

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.479
it snowed. So they get hit by a snow storm
in October and the boat capsizes and Houghton

00:43:34.479 --> 00:43:36.059
and two of the men in the boat with him drowned.

00:43:36.059 --> 00:43:38.950
The two voyagers with Houghton actually make
it to shore as his dog makes it to shore as

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:39.970
well, it's important to the story.

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.509
And the voyagers go into town and say, "Hey
look Douglass Houghton's boat just capsized."

00:43:42.509 --> 00:43:48.640
They come out, they search, they don't find
him. They find one of the guys the next morning

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.030
and they actually find one of, they find Houghton
himself, they find his body the following

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.030
spring.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.440
And when the news reached Detroit that Douglass
Houghton had drowned it was a-a big deal as,

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.770
it had the equivalent of like a state funeral
in Detroit. All the mayors were there, the

00:43:58.770 --> 00:43:59.770
Governor was there.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:00.770
He's buried in the Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.
So if you ever get a chance to go to Detroit

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:01.770
and visit the cemetery Elmwood a lot of important,
famous people in Michigan history are buried

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:02.770
there including Douglass Houghton.

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:03.770
There is memorials to Houghton around. There's
actually a memorial to Houghton here on the

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:04.770
campus over by the graduate, the-the Hatcher
Graduate Library and it's a, it's, they call

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:05.770
it a cenotaph. It's a [pillar] that's chopped
off at the top indicating a life cut short

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:06.770
and they call it the Professors Monument because
it's Houghton and three other professors who

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:07.770
all died young right around the same time:
Houghton, Fox, Denton and Whiting. And it's

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:08.770
kind of tucked up against the building most
people don't know it's there.

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:09.770
There's also a memorial to Houghton at Eagle
River not far from where he drowned and then

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:10.770
as you mentioned there's waterfalls that are
named after him called the Douglass Houghton

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:11.770
Falls. Did you ever seem them when you were
up there?

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:12.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: I don't think so.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:13.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: The Douglass Houghton Falls
are on private property now. But they're the

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:14.770
tallest waterfalls in Michigan.

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:15.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Um.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:16.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: And it's very sad because there
is a, you'd never imagine that they're there

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:17.770
about two or three miles southwest of Calumet,
kind of out in the woods --

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:18.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Yeah.

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:19.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: and there, you're walking on
[Elson's] Dropoff and it's like a hundred,

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:20.770
I don't know if it's a hundred feet down.
Drunken Michigan Tech students liked going

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:21.770
over there --

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:22.770
[laughter]

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:23.770
and scaling up and down the side of that wall.
As you can imagine that's what else can you

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:24.770
do up there for entertainment?

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:25.770
[laughter]

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:26.770
And it got to the point where the sheriff
was going up, taking people off the side of

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:27.770
this cliff every so often, and the owner of
the property realized that one of these days

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:28.770
someone's gonna fall and sue him saying, "You
shouldn't have let me climb your waterfall."

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:29.770
So he actually had to put a fence up across
the thing so you can't go there now. And the

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:30.770
weird thing about is that number one, the
falls are misspelled it's always Douglass

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:31.770
dash Houghton and his name's not hyphenated.
I don't know why they do that.

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:32.770
[laughter]

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:33.770
Number two, there's no evidence that he ever
saw the waterfalls because he doesn't mention

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:34.770
them in any of his writings. And in fact he
never actually made it to that part of the

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:35.770
peninsula because that was right dead center
and he went around the edges for the most

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:36.770
part. So he probably didn't even see it. But
it's interesting 'cause it's named after him.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:37.770
[laughter]

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:38.770
I-I often get asked about Houghton Lake 'cause
there's a Houghton Lake and people go, did,

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:39.770
and it was named after him but again he didn't
discover that lake.

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:40.770
But if you look at it, it's Houghton, Higgins,
Burt, and Mullett are the four lakes right

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:41.770
across the knuckles. All four of them are
surveyors. So Burt I already told you about,

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:42.770
and Mullett and Higgins were two other surveyors.
So it's a good trivia question if you wanna

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:43.770
know why those lakes were named that way.

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:44.770
[laughter]

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:45.770
It's interesting I spoke at a library at Houghton
Lake not too long ago and someone asked me

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:46.770
about that and I had to explain to them that
the bad news is that Higgins was actually

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:47.770
a very bad surveyor.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:48.770
[laughter]

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:49.770
And we know this because in books on the history
of surveying in Michigan, Sylvester Higgins

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:50.770
when you got a job to contract to survey property
who's to say you're doing it right? I go out

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:51.770
in the woods and I come back and say, "Yep,
it's surveyed. Here you go, here's your papers,"

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:52.770
and you pay me and I leave. So to make sure
you would do a good job you had to post a

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:53.770
bond to guarantee that you did it.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:54.770
And in fact for Houghton to get the job in
the Upper Peninsula he's probably one of the

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:55.770
few people who could get that job because
the bond was so exorbitant that very few people

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:56.770
could have gotten that much of a bond back
then.

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:57.770
Sylvester Higgins posted a bond, did a bunch
of really bad survey work, got sued by everybody,

00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:58.770
it ate up the bond, and they, it got to the
point where they were going to come after

00:44:58.770 --> 00:44:59.770
him personally and he fled the state. And
he spent his later years surveying in California.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:00.770
[laughter]

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:01.770
So, but-but he got a lake named after him
so that-that's good.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:02.770
[laughter]

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:03.770
So but unfortunately Houghton died in 1845
like I said. It's interesting because he died

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:04.770
so young. He had been elected a Mayor of Detroit.
There's no question though that he probably

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:05.770
would have gotten elected Governor or some
other type of high political office. It's

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:06.770
interesting because so many people know-know
his name, because his name's on stuff, but

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:07.770
most people don't know what he did.

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:08.770
So it's the exploration of Michigan, it's
reports that pop, that he got the word out

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:09.770
popularly as to where the copper was and what
it takes to get it out of the ground, and

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:10.770
then he also would have had to have know more
about Michigan than anybody else, than anybody

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:11.770
else during his lifetime.

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:12.770
And it's interesting you go back and look
at the history of America, as-as-as the civilization

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:13.770
headed West. You know you've got the explorers
and right behind them you've got the surveyors.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:14.770
And Houghton was both and so at one point
in time though he was probably the guy who

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:15.770
knew the most about the State of Michigan.
So that's the story of Douglass Houghton and

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:16.770
I got answers if you've got questions.

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:17.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: What happened with his
dog?

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:18.770
[laughter]

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:19.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: His dog?

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:20.770
[laughter]

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:21.770
I'm glad you asked me that.

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:22.770
[laughter]

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:23.770
His dog is named Meem and you wouldn't know
from the cover here but you'd know if you

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:24.770
look in the inside photograph here that his
dog is at his feet in this painting by Alvah

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:25.770
Bradish.

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:26.770
And Alvah Bradish was Douglass Houghton's
brother-in-law.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:27.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Um-hum.

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:28.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: And Alvah wrote a very, very
nice biography of Douglass Houghton in the

00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:29.770
1880's which is not probably not terribly
historically accurate. It's filled with all

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:30.770
kinds of glowing praise and the guy walked
on water. And one of the things that he does

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:31.770
mention though is that Meem made it back to
Detroit and was shipped back East and spent

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:32.770
his last years of his life on Douglass Houghton's
parents' farm.

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:33.770
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: Oh my gosh.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:34.770
[laughter]

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:35.770
So if it's true, it's a great story. I don't
know if it's true. I was discussing that with

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:36.770
somebody recently and they said, "Well what
are the logistics of shipping a dog back in

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:37.770
the 1840's?"

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:38.770
[laughter]

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:39.770
And I'm not sure.

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:40.770
[laughter]

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:41.770
I do like to point out though that Alvah Bradish
was a painter and he's not a bad painter I

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:42.770
mean he did, he did the portrait on the cover.
But he wasn't a terribly great painter either.

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:43.770
He spent a lot of his time trying to talk
people into letting him paint their portraits.

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.770
[laughter]

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:45.770
And when I was doing research on this I encountered
correspondence between Bradish and other people

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:46.770
and there all these rejection letters saying,
"Dear Mr. Bradish. Thank you very much for

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:47.770
your, for the offer to paint my wife's portrait
or my portrait but at this point in time we

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:48.770
don't need our portrait painted." This, over
and over and over again, rejection after rejection.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:49.770
And the one time that Douglass Houghton sat
for a portrait, Bradish painted in about 1835,

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:50.770
he's seated in a chair as typical portrait
guy sitting in a chair painting. And that

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:51.770
painting still exists, it's at the Geological
Survey at Lansing.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:52.770
After Douglass Houghton died, Alvah Bradish
then painted this life size portrait, full

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:53.770
size portrait of him standing in front of
what he imagined the pictured rocks looked

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:54.770
like. Alvah Bradish never saw the picture
of rocks. That's obvious by the painting.

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:55.770
[laughter]

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.770
But it's funny because in a time before photographs
how would you know what they look like? And

00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:57.770
so you'd have drawings of the pictured rocks
or else you've have your word descriptions

00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:58.770
of the pictured rocks that were in the newspapers
and so on.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:45:59.770
But it's kind of funny 'cause I-I-I first
when I saw the portrait I'm like, "Well, it's-it's

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:00.770
a great portrait of Houghton but it's not
a very good portrait of the pictured rocks."

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:01.770
But that full-sized portrait hangs at the
Capital Building in Lansing. And that's interesting

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:02.770
too because there's a twin of that portrait
at the Michigan Tech Mineral Museum. And there's

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:03.770
also two or three duplicates of the Houghton
portrait. There's one at the Detroit Historical

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:04.770
Museum, one at the Portage District Library,
and it looks like Alvah Bradish when he couldn't

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:05.770
get other people to agree to let him paint
their portrait he would then just start knocking

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:06.770
Houghton portraits

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:07.770
[laughter]

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:08.770
'cause he knew that he had a market for 'em.

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:09.770
[laughter]

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:10.770
So

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:11.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: I'm always amazed by
the preservation of the historical knowledge.

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:12.770
How, talk about how the research was for this
book or how challenging is it to put all of

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:13.770
these pieces back together again?

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:14.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Well this-this, see it's interesting
because for this book everybody in the book

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:15.770
has passed away. So I've got to go out and
find stuff they left behind. I've written

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:16.770
books where everything, every person I'm talking
about is still alive and I can track them

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:17.770
down and interview them and that's very, very
easy.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:18.770
Luckily, though a lot of the people in this
book kept journals. So Douglass Houghton's

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:19.770
field notebooks still exist and they're at
the Clarke Historical Library in Mt. Pleasant.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:20.770
A lot of his papers though wound up at the
Bentley Historical Library here in Ann Arbor.

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:21.770
And so I had to go to these different libraries
and dig through reams and reams of papers.

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:22.770
But like for instance to see, I have a photograph
here in the book of one right inside, that's

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:23.770
Douglass, one of Douglass Houghton's field
notebooks.

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:24.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Hum.

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:25.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: And he had about 20 of these
that survived and it's just a leather bound

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:26.770
book. It's like a size like a reporter's notebook.
It's got pencil marks where he's-he's written

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:27.770
in pencil and, "March 3rd 1841 here's what
I saw today" and just lists what he saw.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:28.770
And it's fascinating because a lot of it has
got water spots on it; it got splashed by

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:29.770
the paddle of the canoe or something. And
he wasn't writing it thinking someone else

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:30.770
is gonna come by later and deconstruct it.
These are notes that he was keeping for himself.

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:31.770
Some of the other stuff, the journals the
other guys were writing I'm sure a lot of

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:32.770
them were expecting to get read, but they-they
seem to be very honest.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:33.770
But that was a lot of fun, I mean some of
it's very mundane. I mean Douglass Houghton

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:34.770
four days in a row would say he saw rocks
and dirt

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:35.770
[laughter]

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:36.770
it wasn't, it wasn't real exciting stuff,
but it was, it was accurate. And so that was

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:37.770
a lot of fun. But that's-that's-that was the
neat part.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:38.770
One of the most interesting things I found
doing this research was that Douglass Houghton

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:39.770
had a brother named Jacob. And Jacob was Douglass'
younger brother. And when Douglass Houghton

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:40.770
was exploring up on the Upper Peninsula, Jacob
Houghton got hired by a local mine, mining

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:41.770
group to-to help them scout for mine opportunities.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:42.770
So the night that Houghton's boat capsized
Jacob Houghton was camping inland about two

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:43.770
miles. And someone in town actually ran into
the woods and found Jacob Houghton and said,

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:44.770
"Your brother's in a boat that just capsized."

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:45.770
Jacob Houghton came out and helped with the
search for his brother and I'd never heard

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:46.770
that before until I was going through the
papers at the Burton Historic Library in Detroit

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:47.770
and I was going through I think it's the Houghton
Family Papers they had, they had some-some

00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:48.770
correspondence there. And they have the letter
that Jacob wrote to his parents explaining

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:49.770
what happened that night.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:50.770
And previously the other historians who have
talked about Douglass Houghton had always

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:51.770
relied upon this report that was put together
by one of the guys who came down from Ft.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:52.770
Wilkins at Copper Harbor to help with the
search, it was an Army guy.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:53.770
And the Army guy came down a few days later,
he helped with the search, he interviewed

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:54.770
some people, he had to draft affidavits, and
he wrote a report and handed the report in.

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:55.770
And the report's fairly accurate but it lacks
the emotion of Jacob Houghton telling his

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:56.770
parents, "Here's how your son died." And he
explains the efforts they went to and what

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:57.770
he did to help them look and at one point
he got to the end of the beach and he climbed

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:58.770
a tree so he could look further down the beach;
little details like that that you don't get

00:46:58.770 --> 00:46:59.770
anywhere else.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:00.770
And I-I had the original letter in my hands,
it's in this beautiful, this scroll, the old

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:01.770
fountain pen. I mean it's amazing. So that's
a lot of the fun of doing this kind of research.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:02.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: That's great.

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:03.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Yeah.

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:04.770
[pause]

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:05.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: You talked a little
bit about before we were taping, but can you

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:06.770
talk a little bit about your next project
and what you're excited about with that? [laughs]

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:07.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: I am writing a book about,
I've written a book about the Chrysler Turbine

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:08.770
Car Project which was in 1963 Chrysler built
a fleet of jet powered cars. And it's interesting

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:09.770
they'd been working on jets since 1950. They
put a jet engine in a car in 1953 and they

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:10.770
finally decided that they had one that was
so practical that anybody could drive it.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:11.770
So they built a fleet of 50 cars and loaned
them out to the public as like a big publicity

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:12.770
stunt. And so you could actually send a postcard
to Chrysler and if they drew your name and

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:13.770
decided that, you'd-you'd get a car for three
months that was jet powered.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:14.770
And so housewives and accountants and just
average Joe Americans were getting these jet

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:15.770
cars and they all looked identical, they were
all painted this-this turbine bronze color.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:16.770
They were very, they were a specific built
car so it's very unusual looking and they

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:17.770
sounded really funky. And so for two years
these cars were all over the place. They had

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:18.770
them on display at the World's Fair.

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:19.770
I mean I-I-I was very young but I remember
seeing 'em in traffic. You couldn't miss 'em

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:20.770
'cause of the sound they made. At the end
of the program, Chrysler rounded them all

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:21.770
up and destroyed 'em all. And they saved a
couple, but they destroyed most of them. And

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.770
it's one of those stories that ever since
I was a little kid it's always bugged me what

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:23.770
happened to those cars and why.

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:24.770
[laughter]

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:25.770
And it's one of those things that I sort,
I've always been thinking and thinking and

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:26.770
thinking about it and I ran into somebody
who knew some of the people working in the

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:27.770
program and started interviewing these people
and I realized this is actually a really,

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:28.770
really interesting story there.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:29.770
So I wrote this whole story, finished the
manuscript, and couldn't get a publisher.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:30.770
And so I actually put it aside and I wrote
a couple other books. This book and my Death's

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:31.770
Door book.

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:32.770
And then this-this is kind of strange, but
my Death's Door book is called Death's Door:

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:33.770
Truth Behind Michigan's Largest Mass Murder.
A bookstore in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:34.770
ran an ad for that at Christmas and said,
"Makes a great Christmas gift," with a picture

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:35.770
of the cover of my book

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:36.770
[laughter]

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:37.770
and the cover of the book is dark and it's
got this shadow of a, of a, of a tombstone

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:38.770
on it

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:39.770
[laughter]

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:40.770
Somebody sent that ad into Jay Leno and he
ran that on his funny headlines segment

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:41.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Yeah.

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:42.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: So I'm sitting at home on a
Tuesday morning and

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:43.770
[laughter]

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:44.770
my phone starts ringing and people are going,
"Steve, you were on Jay Leno last night."

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:45.770
I'm like, "No, I was, I was

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:46.770
[laughter]

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:47.770
asleep last night."

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:48.770
So anyway I-I figured out what happened. So
I took a copy of Death's Door, I gift wrapped

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:49.770
it and I sent it to Jay Leno as a joke and
said, "Here, Merry Christmas."

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:50.770
[laughter]

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:51.770
But then on a whim I took the Turbine Car
manuscript and stuck it in there and said,

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:52.770
"I know you're a car guy, check this out."
And I stuck my business card in there and

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:53.770
like two weeks later he called me. And he
said, "Steven, this is great." He goes, "Why

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:54.770
don't you get it published?" And I said, "Because
it's a car book and for some odd reason people

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:55.770
pigeonhole car books as being, 'well it's
a car book.'" Go into Borders and the car

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:56.770
books are in the corner. Barnes and Noble
they're in the corner.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:57.770
And he's like, "Well, I'm gonna hang on to
your card, okay?" And I said, "Sure, hang

00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:58.770
on to my card, I don't care."

00:47:58.770 --> 00:47:59.770
[laughter]

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:00.770
Well he did those three shows in Michigan
last summer and after the shows were over,

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:01.770
he's at the Palace of Auburn Hills, Chrysler's
right there. He's got friends at Chrysler.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:02.770
He goes over to Chrysler and there's a big
test track and he's driving and they'll let

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:03.770
him drive cars from the museum and they let
him drive a turbine car. And he asked them,

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:04.770
"Could I buy one of your turbine cars?" And
apparently he got them to sell him one because

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:05.770
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Uh-huh.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:06.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: I'm at my office a week later
and my phone rings. It's Jay Leno again.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:07.770
[laughter]

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:08.770
And he starts asking me very specific questions
about the turbine car and I finally go, "Why

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:09.770
do you need to know this suddenly?" He goes,
"I can't tell ya." I said, "Well

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:10.770
[laughter]

00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:11.770
there's nine of 'em in the world, you're asking
me questions about how to keep one running

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:12.770
so I am assuming you got one of the one's
that runs.

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:13.770
[laughter]

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:14.770
You were in Michigan two weeks ago at Chrysler

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:15.770
[laughter]

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:16.770
any chance you bought one from Chrysler?"
He said, "You can't tell anybody, you can't

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:17.770
tell anybody."

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:18.770
[laughter]

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:19.770
Well I can tell people now.

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:20.770
But anyways I got him a bunch of information
about the car. The guy's who's the head mechanic

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:21.770
on the program is a friend of mine. I have
a technical service manual that would have

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:22.770
come out if the car had been put in production
which he didn't have. So I got him all this

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:23.770
information and so as he called me to thank
me he said, "If you're ever in California

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:24.770
I'll let you drive the car."

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:25.770
[laughter]

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:26.770
So I flew out to California as fast as I could
get there

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:27.770
[laughter]

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:28.770
and he let me drive the car. And so he gives
me a tour of his garage. He calls it his garage,

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:29.770
it's got 105 cars in it

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:30.770
[laughter]

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:31.770
he's got 95 motorcycles, he's got all this
crazy stuff. He's got, he's gotta staff of

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:32.770
like 12 guys who do nothing but help him keep
his cars running.

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:33.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Geez.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:34.770
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Um.

00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:35.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: And we're talking and he said,
he goes, "I don't understand why you can't

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:36.770
the book published." I said, "Because it's
a car book." And he goes, "Well if it'll help

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:37.770
you, I'll write a forward for you."

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:38.770
So when I got back to Michigan I started pitching
the idea at agents going, "I have the book

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:39.770
written and Jay Leno will write a forward
for me." And I got an agent who said he could

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:40.770
sell that and he did.

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:41.770
So Chicago Review Press is publishing the
book this October. The book is in gathering

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:42.770
stages right now. We have a very nice endorsement
from P.J. O'Rourke

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:43.770
[laughter]

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:44.770
and that will be out in October.

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:45.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Very exciting.

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:46.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Wonderful.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:47.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Yeah.

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:48.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Great story.

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:49.770
[laughter]

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:50.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: That's story's better than
the book.

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:51.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Yeah.

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:52.770
[laughter]

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:53.770
&gt;&gt;commentator: Well thank you so much for
coming. We really enjoyed

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:54.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Thank you.

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:55.770
&gt;&gt;commentator: having you.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:56.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: I wish I could have done the
slides for you.

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:57.770
&gt;&gt;commentator: I know. We'll have to

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:58.770
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Sorry. It was a pleasure
to have you.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:48:59.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: That's okay.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:00.770
&gt;&gt;commentator: It was a honor that you came
to see us.

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:01.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Well, thank you.

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:02.770
&gt;&gt;commentator: We really appreciate it.

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:03.770
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Thank you.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:04.770
&gt;&gt;commentator: Thank you. Alright.

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:04.771
[applause]
