00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.366
Voiceover:We have 4 graphs here

00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.233
and then 4 function definitions.

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:05.967
What I want you to do is pause this video

00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:07.766
and think about which of these graphs

00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:11.637
map up to which of these
function definitions.

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:13.367
I'm assuming you've given a go at it.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:14.500
Let's go through each of these

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.033
and think about what their
graphs would look like.

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:18.300
One thing that I like to do,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.166
because it's just a simple thing to do,

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.301
is just think about what
happens when x is equal to 0.

00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:24.500
Especially when x is
an exponent like this,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.366
you would have,

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.234
let me just write this down,

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:33.566
y of 0 is going to be equal
to 2 minus 1/3 to the 0 power.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.433
That's equal to 2 minus 1.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:38.701
1/3 to the 0 is 1, which is equal to 1.

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:41.833
In which of these graphs,
when x is equal to 0,

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.978
do we have y equaling 1?

00:00:43.978 --> 00:00:45.850
Here, x equals 0, y equals negative 1.

00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:48.433
Here, x equals 0, y equals negative 1,

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:49.433
or it looks like negative 1.

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.834
Here, x equals 0, y looks like
1, so this is a candidate.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:56.166
Here, x is equal to 0,
y also looks like 1,

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.100
so these last two seem like a candidate

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.033
for this function
definition right over here.

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:05.300
Now let's think about the
behavior of this function.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.566
Let's think about what happens

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:10.101
when x approaches a
very, very large number.

00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:12.568
When x approaches a very large number,

00:01:12.568 --> 00:01:18.133
let's just imagine y of 1,000,

00:01:18.608 --> 00:01:20.900
and 1,000 really isn't
that large of a number,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.833
but let's just ...

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:26.834
That's going to be 2 minus
1/3 to the 1,000th power.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.986
Well, 1/3 to the 1,000 power,

00:01:29.986 --> 00:01:31.968
that's going to be a very,
very, very small number.

00:01:31.968 --> 00:01:33.966
We're multiplying 1/3 times 1/3, 1/3.

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.300
You think of 1,000 1/3s and
multiplying them together,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.100
I'm sure you're going to get a number

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.634
very, very close to 0.

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:40.033
Let me write this down.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:44.700
This part right over here
is going to be close to 0,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.767
close to 0.

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:47.766
Another way to think about it is

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:53.367
as x increases, this part approaches 0.

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:55.233
This is very close to 0.

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.633
This thing, y of 1,000,

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:03.501
y of 1,000 will be close to 2.

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:05.233
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:07.900
as x gets larger and larger and larger,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.900
this part is going to get closer
and closer and closer to 0,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.433
so you're going to have 2 minus something

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.300
that's closer and closer and closer to 0,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.300
so as x gets larger, y
is going to approach 2.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.733
Which of these two have that behavior?

00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:23.434
It's clearly this one on the right.

00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:25.300
As x gets larger and larger and larger,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.634
we see that y is getting closer and closer

00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:31.034
and closer and closer to 2.

00:02:31.034 --> 00:02:33.766
This one right over here, we could say,

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:40.967
is y is equal to 2 minus
1/3 to the x power.

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:43.700
We could also think about its
behavior as x gets smaller,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.633
as x gets more and more and more negative.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:50.433
So 1/3 to a very negative
number right over here,

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:56.700
that's the same thing as 3
to a very positive value.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.433
As x gets more and more and more negative,

00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:04.170
this will be essentially 3 to
a more and more positive value

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.767
and you're subtracting it from 2,

00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:09.900
so y is going to become more
and more and more negative.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.100
We see that as x becomes
more and more negative,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.967
y becomes more and more negative.

00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:16.029
This, once again, is consistent.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.733
Now let's think about this
function right over here.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:26.000
Here, we see y is equal
to 1/2 to the x minus 2.

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:28.166
We could, first of all, just think about

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.966
what y of 0 is.

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:35.766
y of 0 is going to be 1/2
to the 0 power minus 2,

00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:38.233
which is equal to 1 minus 2,

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:40.233
which is equal to negative 1.

00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:42.766
Both of these would be candidates

00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:45.633
for this function right over here.

00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:48.167
When x is equal to 0, y is negative 1.

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:51.034
When x is equal to 0, y is negative 1.

00:03:51.034 --> 00:03:53.500
But now let's think about the
behavior of this function.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.967
As x becomes larger and
larger and larger values,

00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:59.667
what is y going to approach?

00:03:59.768 --> 00:04:01.966
Just like we saw over
here, you have a fraction.

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:04.167
You have 1/2 being raised
to larger and larger

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:05.833
and larger values.

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:07.033
Let's think about this.

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:10.233
As this gets raised to
larger and larger values,

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:12.367
this part is going to approach 0.

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:14.367
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2,

00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:17.890
that's going to approach 0 fairly quickly.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.100
As this approaches 0, y is
going to approach negative 2.

00:04:23.822 --> 00:04:26.033
As x gets larger and larger and larger,

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:27.967
1/2 to the x approaches 0,

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:34.466
and so y is going to approach
negative 2 from above.

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:36.100
Let's see where we see that.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.094
That looks like this one right over here.

00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:39.966
Once again, we said these
are our two candidates.

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:43.866
When x is 0, y is negative 1.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.435
Here, we see as x gets
larger and larger and larger,

00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:48.966
y is approaching negative
2 because this part

00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:52.966
is becoming smaller and
smaller and smaller values.

00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:57.467
This one is that one right over there.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.967
You could also think about its behavior

00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:01.566
as x becomes more and more negative.

00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:03.566
As x becomes more and more negative,

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:07.501
that's like raising 2 to a positive value,

00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:09.100
so 2 to a positive value,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.100
you see that as x becomes more negative,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.066
y becomes larger and larger and larger.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.766
All right, we got two left.

00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:17.233
y equals 2 to the x.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.102
This might be the simplest of all,

00:05:19.102 --> 00:05:22.834
y equaling 2 to the x power.

00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:25.767
When x is equal to 0,
y should be equal to 1,

00:05:25.767 --> 00:05:28.366
and we see that's this
graph right over here,

00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:32.700
and this is your most basic
type of exponential function.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.433
As x increases, y increases.

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:39.568
This is your classic
exponential graph shape.

00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:42.233
As x approaches more and
more negative values,

00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:45.982
as x approaches more and
more negative values,

00:05:46.273 --> 00:05:48.966
raising 2 to a very large negative value,

00:05:48.966 --> 00:05:50.700
so imagine when x is ...

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.700
imagine y of negative 10.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.233
This isn't even that negative.

00:05:56.233 --> 00:05:58.633
That's going to be 2 to
the negative 10 power,

00:05:58.633 --> 00:06:02.867
which is the same thing
as 1/2 to the 10th power.

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:06.300
As x becomes more and
more and more negative,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.433
this expression is going to get closer

00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:10.569
and closer and closer to 0.

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.869
This one is clearly that one.

00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:15.034
Then finally, just deductive reasoning,

00:06:15.034 --> 00:06:16.633
you could say that this function

00:06:16.633 --> 00:06:17.719
is represented by that graph,

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.667
but let's reason through a little bit.

00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:22.002
This is where order of
operations really matter.

00:06:22.002 --> 00:06:23.501
When you see negative 3 to the x,

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:24.434
it might be a little confusing.

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:25.433
You're, like, "Is it negative,

00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:28.033
"is it the whole negative
3 to the x power,

00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:31.433
"or is it negative 3 to the x?"

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.433
Here, we just have to remind ourselves

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.100
order of operations,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.300
exponentials are the top priority
right after a parentheses.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.033
You would actually do
your exponential first.

00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:42.900
You take 3 to the x,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.233
and it's going to be the negative of that.

00:06:45.233 --> 00:06:46.500
It's essentially going to be,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.235
it's going to be your
classic exponential function,

00:06:49.235 --> 00:06:50.300
but because of this negative,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.577
you're going to flip it over the x-axis,

00:06:52.577 --> 00:06:54.767
and that's what this has right over here.

00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:57.041
As x gets larger and larger and larger,

00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:59.833
3 to the x is going to become
a much larger and larger value

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:00.967
but then we're taking the negative of it,

00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:03.700
so y is going to become smaller
and smaller and smaller.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.634
Likewise, as x is more and
more and more negative,

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:09.501
3 to the x is going to approach 0.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.700
When x is equal to 0, 3 to the 0 is 1,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.100
but you have the negative out front,

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.633
we see y is negative 1.

00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:20.924
This is y is equal to
negative 3 to the x power.
