00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.470
- [Instructor] We're told
that Linde isn't sure

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.513
how to subtract 853.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.670
We are told Linde isn't sure

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.783
how to subtract 853

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.250
minus 283.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.300
Help Linde by choosing an expression

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.213
that is the same as 853

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.760
minus 283.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.820
So pause this video

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.190
and see if you can answer it on your own

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.940
before we work through it together.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.703
All right.

00:00:27.703 --> 00:00:28.750
Now when we look at all of the choices,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.087
they all start with 853.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.010
Now, this first choice,
they subtract out 200.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.680
That makes sense 'cause we
have 200s right over there.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.136
Then they subtract out 50 and
then they subtract out three.

00:00:43.136 --> 00:00:46.140
So the 200 and the three make sense.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.240
You can view 853 minus 283

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.360
as 853

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.080
minus 200s

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.870
minus 80,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.320
eight 10s right here, minus three.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.470
But that's not what they wrote in here.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.380
Instead of putting an
80 here, they put a 50,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.980
so we can rule that out.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.822
Here we have 253 minus
20 minus 800 minus three.

00:01:08.822 --> 00:01:10.710
Well, this is a little bit strange

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.800
because we don't have
two 10s, we have 200s,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.850
and we don't have 800s, we have eight 10s,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.110
so this is also incorrect.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.450
Now, it's probably going to be this one,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.210
but let's just make sure we
feel comfortable with this.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.360
So this one has 853

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.860
minus 200

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.030
minus 50

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.260
minus 30.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.306
Does that make sense?

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:35.350
Well, let's think about it.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.183
What they're doing

00:01:36.183 --> 00:01:38.550
is that they're subtracting
out first the 200,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.110
so that's this part right over here,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.943
so that makes sense,

00:01:40.943 --> 00:01:42.680
they're subtracting out first that.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.580
And then they're subtracting out 53

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.900
and then they're subtracting out 30.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.467
Well, that is the same
thing as subtracting out 83

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.570
'cause subtracting 83 is the same thing

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.880
as subtracting out 53,
and then subtracting 30.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.780
53 plus 30 is 83.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.613
Now, you might be wondering,

00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:00.620
why would they even do it this way?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.930
What's easier to do in your head?

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.110
853 minus 200

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.450
is 653.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.820
You take away 53 from that,
so you take away 53 from that,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.920
and you're going to be left with 600,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.880
and then 600 minus 30,
you might recognize that,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.120
you could use the 60 10s minus three 10s,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.820
this is gonna be 57 10s

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.160
or you might be able
to do it in your head,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.650
600 minus 30

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.500
is 570.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.476
So that's why they broke out,

00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:31.710
they broke up the 83.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.200
Instead of just breaking
it up into 80 and three,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.480
they broke it up into 53 and 30

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.450
to match this 53 over here,

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.910
and so it was easier
to work out the result.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.869
Let's do another example.

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.110
So here we're asked to fill in the blank.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.110
They say 143 minus 79 is
the same as blank minus 80.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.040
So pause this video and see
if you can figure this out.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.120
So the key here is to realize

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.720
is that when you have a difference here,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.110
as long as you add or subtract

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.990
the same amount to both of these,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.850
the difference will be the same.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.690
So it looks like they
tried to turn the 79 into,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.690
it looks like they turned the
79 into an 80 by adding one,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.690
and so if we want the
difference to be the same,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.560
we would add one to the 143 as well.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.690
So 143 plus one is 144.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.440
If we add one to both of these numbers,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.770
the difference would be the same.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.030
And we're done.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.293
So, it's 144 minus 80.
