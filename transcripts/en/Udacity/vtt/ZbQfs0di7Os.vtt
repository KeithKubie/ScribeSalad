00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.830
So let's see if we are able to

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.140
establish what's a fault, error, and failure, in an

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.669
example when a laptop falls down. So we had

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.355
a laptop and the first thing that happens, is

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:18.370
that it falls out of my bag and then what happens is that it hits the pavement.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.811
As a result of that, the pavement develops a

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:26.600
crack and then the crack expands during the winter.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.027
So the pavement breaks and needs to be replaced. So for this pavement

00:00:33.027 --> 00:00:39.305
failure is event, which of these six events. The fault is which

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:45.360
of these events? And the first error is which of these events?
