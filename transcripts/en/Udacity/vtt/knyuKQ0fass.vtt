00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.810
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Mario.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.600
&gt;&gt; And I'm Samantha.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.240
&gt;&gt; And my name's Andy, and we're going to be the instructors for this class.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.750
&gt;&gt; And you're a person looking for a job, or

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.820
maybe you have an idea that you want to turn into

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.130
an app, or maybe you just want to learn more about

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.210
what Salesforce is, what it can do, and how it works.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.990
&gt;&gt; You may never have heard of Salesforce before, or you might already

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.249
be a developer looking to brush up on your point and click skills.

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:22.940
&gt;&gt; Maybe you have zero programming

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.520
experience, or maybe you're an experienced programmer

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.480
just looking to brush up a bit on how to build some new apps.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.750
&gt;&gt; Regardless, by the end of this

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.080
class, you'll have built a fully functional,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.870
robust, web and mobile app, without writing

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.980
a single line of code. That's awesome.
