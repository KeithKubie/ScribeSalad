00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.769
Does mental illness and gun violence actually
have a scientific connection?

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:07.209
After every major mass shooting in the U.S.,
there is always a discussion about whether

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:09.560
or not the perpetrator's mental health was
to blame.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.700
A recent study even showed that news media
pairs mental illness with violence at a higher

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.310
rate than it actually occurs.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.940
Oh, and then, there’s this guy.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:29.760
And yea, the shooter he’s talking about
did have a history of mental illness, but

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.149
there is still a lack of scientific evidence
to support the idea that America’s gun problem

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.370
is rooted in mental health.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.449
In fact, there is actually data that shows
the opposite is true.

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.379
Several epidemiological studies have shown
that there is little to no correlation between

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.059
mental illness and violence towards others.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.499
This includes people who suffer from schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder, and severe depression.

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.739
The National Institute of Mental Health carried
out one of the first studies on the subject

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:54.739
in 1990.

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.760
They collected data from over 10,000 people
across three major U.S. cities.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.199
The study accounted for things like socioeconomic
status and substance abuse problems.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.360
The ultimate conclusion was that if we were
to somehow eliminate the risk of people with

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.060
mental illnesses carrying out violent crimes,
the amount of violent crimes in the U.S. would

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.759
only drop by 4%.

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.990
A few years later, the MacArthur Violence
Risk Assessment Study followed more than 1,000

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.920
psychiatric patients who had been discharged
from medical care.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.280
The study discovered that patients who suffered
only from a serious mental illness and had

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.310
no substance abuse problems had the same risk
in committing violent behavior as anyone else

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.350
in their communities.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.140
And according to more recent national data
from the U.S. Department of Health and Human

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.850
Services, only 3-5% of violent acts can be
attributed to people who have serious mental

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.850
illnesses.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.429
Now, the rate of violent crimes for this population
does goes up when you mix in substance abuse,

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.439
but that’s true for the general population
as well.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.799
On the flip side of this, people who suffer
from serious mental illnesses are 10 times

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.499
more likely to be the victims of violent crimes
than members of the general population.

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.170
They are also often the victims of self-inflicted
violence.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.590
Over half of gun fatalities in the U.S. are
from suicide.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.570
Experts believe that an emphasis on suicide
would be a better policy approach in preventing

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.820
gun violence, for which there is plenty of
evidence and data, as opposed to focusing

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.180
on mental illness’ connection to mass murders,
for which there is little data.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.130
Lastly, finding a scientific connection between
gun violence and anything can be difficult

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.130
nowadays.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.610
That’s because there was legislation passed
in the late 1990s that essentially pulls funding

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.840
away from any federal agency looking to study
gun violence as a public health issue.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.300
I mean, the CDC gets funding to study rare
diseases like cholera, diphtheria, polio,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.550
and rabies.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.660
Over the last 40 years those diseases have
only killed around 2,000 people in the U.S.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.560
In that same time frame, 1.4 million Americans
have died because of firearms.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.080
So let’s remember that, even when we see
headlines like this.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.230
And have a president who says things like
this.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.720
So, if science can’t solve the gun problem,
what can it do?

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720
Lots.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.000
Like, how about cleaning the air with bicycles?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.020
