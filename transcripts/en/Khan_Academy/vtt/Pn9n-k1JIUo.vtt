00:00:01.795 --> 00:00:03.220
- [Instructor] In previous videos,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.340
we've talked about some of
the major schools of thought

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.572
that emerged at the end
of the Zhou Dynasty,

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:12.390
especially as we start to enter
the warring states period,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.109
the famous hundred schools of thought.

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.251
And most prominent amongst
them is Confucianism,

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:23.458
started or based on the
teachings of Confucius,

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:26.208
who lived around 2,500 years ago,

00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:33.585
and it was all about how does
a society live in harmony.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:35.411
Confucianism is based
in a lot of teachings

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:38.156
that were already part of Chinese culture.

00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:41.577
And Confucius, one could
say, put them together,

00:00:41.577 --> 00:00:43.786
but put them together in a contextual way

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:45.722
and made them more relevant.

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:48.293
And you can see on this diagram,

00:00:48.293 --> 00:00:51.930
Confucianism was really
focused on the ethical,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.374
but Confucius himself tried
to apply some of his teachings

00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:57.983
into the more practical realm.

00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:00.790
Now, out of that hundred
schools of thought,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.572
you also have Taoism that we
talk about in other videos.

00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:08.525
Now, Taoism is really based on this idea

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.275
of the Tao or the way

00:01:12.232 --> 00:01:15.615
and we could do many videos on Taoism,

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:17.939
but it's this idea of letting go

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.081
and you could even think of
it as going with the flow

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:23.364
in a simplicity, a return to nature,

00:01:23.364 --> 00:01:25.870
freeing yourself from desires,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.923
and it was definitely more philosophical

00:01:27.923 --> 00:01:31.405
and more focused on the
spiritual than Confucianism.

00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:33.730
Now, in other videos,
we talk about Legalism,

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.352
which was a key part of the Chin Dynasty,

00:01:36.352 --> 00:01:39.289
which was the first real imperial dynasty.

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.477
China is named after the Chin Dynasty,

00:01:41.477 --> 00:01:42.568
but it was fairly harsh.

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:44.310
It was really this idea that hey,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.880
human beings really
need strong leadership,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.490
sometimes harsh leadership,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.105
in order for society to actually work.

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:55.066
Now, the school of thought
that we have here up the top,

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:58.275
Buddhism is interesting
because it did not emerge

00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:00.796
from that hundred
schools of thought period

00:02:00.796 --> 00:02:03.929
that we get at the end
of the Zhou Dynastic.

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.736
Buddhism emerges in India
at around the same time,

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:11.820
roughly 2,500 years ago with
the teachings of Buddha,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.361
a Hindu prince who lived in
Northeast India, Southern Nepal,

00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:18.609
and his teachings are, in some ways,

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:19.442
you can almost view

00:02:19.442 --> 00:02:22.476
as a reformation of Hinduism at the time,

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:26.088
a return to the idea that
someone through meditation,

00:02:26.088 --> 00:02:29.365
through realization, can become one with,

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:32.346
at least in Buddhism,
the emptiness, nirvana,

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:36.709
can escape from clinging to
desires of this non-reality

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.958
that we think we live in.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.603
Now, we've talked about in previous videos

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:43.100
how the Chin Dynasty was really based

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.498
on this Legalist philosophy,

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.748
but the Han Dynasty is considered
the Golden Age of China.

00:02:48.748 --> 00:02:50.709
Now, under the Han Dynasty,

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.599
Confucianism really took hold

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.074
and became the dominant
philosophical structure of China

00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:00.931
and to some degree would stay that way.

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.180
Now, at the end of the Han Dynasty,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.704
China goes into a chaotic
period for several hundred years

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:11.939
until we get to the Sixth
Century when the Sui Dynasty

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.072
is able to finally reunify
China for the most part.

00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:17.953
And in that interim,

00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:22.095
Confucianism starts to
give way, to some degree,

00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:25.047
to both Taoism and Buddhism,

00:03:25.047 --> 00:03:27.275
these things that are more
focused on the spiritual,

00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:31.456
areas where Confucianism
was not as interested.

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:32.911
And what's interesting about Buddhism,

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:34.531
even though it started in India,

00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:37.846
famously Ashoka in the Third Century BCE

00:03:37.846 --> 00:03:40.584
really becomes a patron of Buddhism

00:03:40.584 --> 00:03:43.193
and even sends missionaries
out to spread it

00:03:43.193 --> 00:03:47.066
and it comes to China via
Central Asia and Southeast Asia,

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:50.758
it really takes on a
uniquely Chinese nature

00:03:50.758 --> 00:03:51.989
as it enters China.

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.141
Really, it eventually evolves
into Mahayana Buddhism.

00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:57.857
And under the Tang Dynasty,

00:03:57.857 --> 00:03:59.366
which is considered one of the high points

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:01.041
of Chinese civilization,

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:03.659
Buddhism is really able to take hold,

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.360
especially in the early Tang Dynasty.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.687
However, as we get into
the late Tang Dynasty,

00:04:08.687 --> 00:04:10.731
Buddhism starts to get some push back

00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:13.047
and even gets persecuted to some degree.

00:04:13.047 --> 00:04:14.435
People arguing that hey,

00:04:14.435 --> 00:04:17.539
Buddhism is a foreign belief system.

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:18.378
In some ways,

00:04:18.378 --> 00:04:21.503
it's not concerned enough
with social cohesion.

00:04:21.503 --> 00:04:24.163
It's all about the
individual through meditation

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:26.849
trying to separate
themselves from reality,

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.212
becoming one with the emptiness.

00:04:29.212 --> 00:04:31.159
And so at around the same time,

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.999
someone argue in reaction
to the strength of Buddhism.

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:38.338
You have a movement known
as Neo-Confucianism,

00:04:38.338 --> 00:04:41.264
taking the central ideas of Confucius,

00:04:41.264 --> 00:04:44.397
but using some frameworks and terminology

00:04:44.397 --> 00:04:46.759
from Taoism and Buddhism,

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.843
and there were many
Neo-Confucian philosophers

00:04:49.843 --> 00:04:52.744
that began to emerge in
the late Tang Dynasty,

00:04:52.744 --> 00:04:54.651
but it's really considered
the Song Dynasty

00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:57.993
where Neo-Confucianism really takes hold.

00:04:57.993 --> 00:05:02.654
And the most famous of the
Neo-Confucian philosophers

00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:05.855
sometimes ranked second
to Confucius himself

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:10.022
in terms of influence on
Chinese philosophy is Zhu Xi.

00:05:11.665 --> 00:05:13.832
He lived from 1130 to 1200

00:05:14.868 --> 00:05:19.237
and he's most known
for his, one could say,

00:05:19.237 --> 00:05:21.570
curation of Confucian texts.

00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:24.586
He famously curated the Four Books,

00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:25.977
Analects of Confucius,

00:05:25.977 --> 00:05:29.060
Mencius or The Mencius, by Mencius,

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.823
Great Learning, Doctrine of the Mean,

00:05:30.823 --> 00:05:33.411
written by Confucian followers.

00:05:33.411 --> 00:05:36.724
This curation of Confucian thought

00:05:36.724 --> 00:05:39.471
shortly after Zhu Xi's life,

00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:43.744
it becomes the bedrock of
the Chinese education system

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:45.620
and the civil service examinations

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.604
as we go through the Yuan,
Ming, and Ching Dynasties,

00:05:49.604 --> 00:05:52.700
all the way to the early 20th Century.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.112
Now, he also wrote books
on tradition and rituals

00:05:56.112 --> 00:05:58.420
which are, in some ways, very Confucian

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.405
because they're focused on the practical,

00:06:00.405 --> 00:06:01.478
they're focused on the family,

00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:03.847
they're focused on social cohesion.

00:06:03.847 --> 00:06:07.727
But he also dabbled in the more spiritual,

00:06:07.727 --> 00:06:11.279
wrote extensively about notions of Taiji

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.243
which is really a Taoist
or even a pre-Taoist idea,

00:06:15.243 --> 00:06:18.784
thinking about what is
the fundamental nature

00:06:18.784 --> 00:06:23.220
of the universe and the Taiji
itself is the great ultimate,

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.265
sometimes represented
by the Yin Yang symbol.

00:06:26.265 --> 00:06:28.426
Really, this is showing Taiji

00:06:28.426 --> 00:06:33.280
divided into this dualistic
nature between Yin and Yang,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.974
how at the center of each
or the extreme of each,

00:06:35.974 --> 00:06:38.073
they become the other.

00:06:38.073 --> 00:06:41.906
He writes about Qi, this
life force or energy.

00:06:42.764 --> 00:06:47.095
And once again, these are
ideas he takes from Taoism.

00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:49.679
But in Neo-Confucian thought,

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:53.229
there's this idea of you
shouldn't just detach yourself

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:56.028
from physical reality,
you should study it.

00:06:56.028 --> 00:06:58.676
There's an order, there's
a logic to the universe

00:06:58.676 --> 00:07:00.083
that could be understood.

00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:02.766
And because of the influence
of the Neo-Confucians,

00:07:02.766 --> 00:07:04.565
especially their focus on belief

00:07:04.565 --> 00:07:06.697
in an order and logic of the universe,

00:07:06.697 --> 00:07:09.128
it's no coincidence that the Song Dynasty

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:11.481
saw some of the major
technological advancements

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:14.740
not just of China, but of the world,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.555
advancements that really put China

00:07:16.555 --> 00:07:18.054
at the technological forefront.

00:07:18.054 --> 00:07:21.537
Remember, Europe at this
time is in the Middle Ages.

00:07:21.537 --> 00:07:24.797
The Middle East is under
the Golden Age of Islam,

00:07:24.797 --> 00:07:26.511
but it's really the Chinese

00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:29.031
who are pushing the envelope here.

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:32.948
Let's get a flavor of
some of Zhu Xi's writing.

00:07:33.918 --> 00:07:38.352
Original mind is principle,
as derived from Tai Ji,

00:07:38.352 --> 00:07:42.100
in itself, unmoved, and perfectly good,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.594
while physical nature, on the other hand,

00:07:44.594 --> 00:07:48.048
is principle mixed with
material force, qi.

00:07:48.048 --> 00:07:51.611
It is the aroused state,
involving both good and evil.

00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:54.967
The two natures, however,
are always inter-fused,

00:07:54.967 --> 00:07:58.214
one the substance and the other, function.

00:07:58.214 --> 00:08:00.943
So once again, even
though he was Confucian,

00:08:00.943 --> 00:08:02.892
he was a Confucian philosopher,

00:08:02.892 --> 00:08:04.865
this is very Taoist in nature

00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:07.637
and even this notion of
talking about original mind

00:08:07.637 --> 00:08:11.520
is principle in itself,
unmoved, and perfectly good,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.270
this feels very Buddhist or
even Hindu in its thinking.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.423
Now, one could debate
whether it was to what degree

00:08:19.423 --> 00:08:21.343
it was influenced by Buddhism,

00:08:21.343 --> 00:08:24.927
it is a very central
idea that all of reality,

00:08:24.927 --> 00:08:29.495
all of sentience, is
emergent from this Atman,

00:08:29.495 --> 00:08:31.982
from this Brahman, from
this original mind,

00:08:31.982 --> 00:08:34.259
emerges from the emptiness.

00:08:34.259 --> 00:08:37.991
But what makes it Neo-Confucian
is beyond the metaphysical,

00:08:37.991 --> 00:08:41.214
beyond the philosophical,
they bring it down to reality.

00:08:41.214 --> 00:08:43.599
They bring it down to practical concerns.

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:45.549
How does this affect how one governs?

00:08:45.549 --> 00:08:48.057
How does this affect how one should learn?

00:08:48.057 --> 00:08:51.976
How does this affect how one
should be in social harmony

00:08:51.976 --> 00:08:53.893
with those around them?
