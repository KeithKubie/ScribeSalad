Congress in Washington DC.

[ How to Request Materials Online
at the Library of Congress ]

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:19.960 position:56%
Once you have your Library of
Congress reader identification card,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.700
you are ready to begin requesting
books and other materials,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.610
for use in the reading rooms.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.000
This video will walk you through
the request process, step by step.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.560
Let's get started by
looking at an example.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.280
From the Library of
Congress homepage,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.970
I will navigate to
the Library Catalog.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.480
You will notice there are a number
of available search options.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.370
Today, I will use the Quick Search,
located at the top of the page.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.370
After I type in a title,
author, or keyword,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.600
I will hit enter to continue.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.900
Looking through the results,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.740
I have found an item I
might want to request.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.350
So, I will click on the
title for more information.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.060
If I decide that I would
like to request this item,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.790
I will click on "Where to Request"

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.150
to determine the items
location and availability.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.470
The record indicates that I
should "Request In" the Jefferson

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.780
or Adams Building Reading Rooms.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.120
Since I will be working from
the Main Reading Room located

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.620
in the Jefferson Building,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.910
I know that I should be
eligible to request this item.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.230
Next, I will select "Request
this Item," to continue.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.320
I will enter my last name and
account number as they appear

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.710
on my reader identification card.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.520
Then, I will enter my
password and select "Login."

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.190
If this is your first online
request, you will need to set

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.070
up your account by logging
in with the default password

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.110
that the library provided to you.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.560
You will then be prompted
to create your own password

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.500
to use for future log-ins.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.000
If you did not receive
the default password

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.890
or you need help logging in,
click on "Forgot Your Password?"

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.560
Or, contact reader
registration for assistance.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.560
This is the request form.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.860
Under "delivery location", select
the reading room where you would

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.860
like your item delivered.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.490
Please note, not every reading
room uses the online request form.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.490
Only those reading
rooms listed under

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.020
"delivery locations" allow
items to be requested online.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.100
When you have finished
filling out the request form,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.400
select "Send request" to continue.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.300
If you properly submitted the form,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.790
you will receive the following
message: "request successful."

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.950
Once you submit the request,
you can expect to wait anywhere

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.410 position:56%
from 30-90 minutes for the material
to be delivered to the reading room.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.460
The amount of time for material
delivery will vary based

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.460
on the items format and location,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.560
and the access policies
of the reading room.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.640
Requests for materials that
are stored off-site can take

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.690
up to the next business day.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.150
To save time, you may wish

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.780
to request your items online
before you arrive at the library.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.980
Materials will be held for 48
hours at the Book Service desk.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.480 position:56%
If you wish to request items earlier
than 48 hours before your arrival,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.590
speak with a reference
librarian for assistance.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.170
And remember, the national
library is your library.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.900
We hope to see you soon.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.560

of the Library of Congress.
