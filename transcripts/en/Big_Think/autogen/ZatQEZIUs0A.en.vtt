okay they'll be from Atlanta Georgia and

I was wondering you can you believe in

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710
I was wondering you can you believe in

feels like the idea of choice is the
 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.299
feels like the idea of choice is the
biggest argument for free will but this

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309
biggest argument for free will but this
 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.420
biggest argument for free will but this

I'm here through a series of single

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880
I'm here through a series of single
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.480
I'm here through a series of single
decisions and it just kind of feels very

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490
decisions and it just kind of feels very
 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.450
decisions and it just kind of feels very
linear and kind of on a track but let's

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
linear and kind of on a track but let's
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.190
linear and kind of on a track but let's
say sure what do you think about it

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200
say sure what do you think about it
 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.099
say sure what do you think about it
Thanks so is there such a thing as free

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:34.109
Thanks so is there such a thing as free
 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.950
Thanks so is there such a thing as free
will the answer is clearly it depends

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
will the answer is clearly it depends

what you mean so I am so compelled by

what you mean so I am so compelled by

what you mean so I am so compelled by
these tests where they they have brain

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:44.249
these tests where they they have brain
 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:46.669
these tests where they they have brain
scans going on working real-time and

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679
scans going on working real-time and
 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.549
scans going on working real-time and
then the subject is asked to make a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
then the subject is asked to make a
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.729
then the subject is asked to make a
choice and they can see on the brain

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739
choice and they can see on the brain
 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.410
choice and they can see on the brain
skin that the choice has already been

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
skin that the choice has already been
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.599
skin that the choice has already been
made before the person is able to

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609
made before the person is able to
 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.430
made before the person is able to
articulate it or even watch the choice

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
articulate it or even watch the choice
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.049
articulate it or even watch the choice
have been made have it but a little

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
have been made have it but a little
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.530
have been made have it but a little
bounce back and forth and then settle on

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540
bounce back and forth and then settle on
 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.770
bounce back and forth and then settle on
another choice it's a this is a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
another choice it's a this is a
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.340
another choice it's a this is a
wonderful question but that there is no

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
wonderful question but that there is no
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.469
wonderful question but that there is no
free will that to me is an extraordinary

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479
free will that to me is an extraordinary
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.770
free will that to me is an extraordinary
claim because I feel that I have made

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
claim because I feel that I have made
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.300
claim because I feel that I have made
choices and this might be what you're

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
choices and this might be what you're
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.249
choices and this might be what you're
driving that I feel that I have made

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
driving that I feel that I have made
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.279
driving that I feel that I have made
choices freely based on things that have

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289
choices freely based on things that have
 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.560
choices freely based on things that have
happened around me based on the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
happened around me based on the
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.569
happened around me based on the
environment and my experiences and my

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
environment and my experiences and my
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.690
environment and my experiences and my
perception of the experiences of others

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700
perception of the experiences of others
 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.730
perception of the experiences of others
so in other words if there really were

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
so in other words if there really were
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.310
so in other words if there really were
absolutely no free will could you then

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320
absolutely no free will could you then
 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.349
absolutely no free will could you then
predict what every single person in the

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359
predict what every single person in the
 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.469
predict what every single person in the
universe or on earth is going to do and

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
universe or on earth is going to do and
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.319
universe or on earth is going to do and
where he or she will end up and then

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
where he or she will end up and then
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.749
where he or she will end up and then
furthermore can that not be influenced

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759
furthermore can that not be influenced
 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.779
furthermore can that not be influenced
by some cosmic force that were forces

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789
by some cosmic force that were forces
 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.200
by some cosmic force that were forces
that we can't assess could be it just

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
that we can't assess could be it just
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.639
that we can't assess could be it just
doesn't seem reasonable I think much

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
doesn't seem reasonable I think much
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.429
doesn't seem reasonable I think much
more reasonable is our brains are

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
more reasonable is our brains are
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.819
more reasonable is our brains are
complicated and they got this big or as

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
complicated and they got this big or as
 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.219
complicated and they got this big or as
big as they are organically through

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
big as they are organically through
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.680
big as they are organically through
evolution with layer being added upon

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
evolution with layer being added upon
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.890
evolution with layer being added upon
layer so our ability to choose is often

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
layer so our ability to choose is often
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670
layer so our ability to choose is often
confuse

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
confuse
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.850
confuse
our ability to make choices and is often

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
our ability to make choices and is often
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.119
our ability to make choices and is often
affected by the environment by our

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129
affected by the environment by our
 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.420
affected by the environment by our
experiences and by biochemistry the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430
experiences and by biochemistry the
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.030
experiences and by biochemistry the
shape of our brain so I think the answer

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040
shape of our brain so I think the answer
 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.170
shape of our brain so I think the answer
is clearly some of each

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180
is clearly some of each
 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.159
is clearly some of each
