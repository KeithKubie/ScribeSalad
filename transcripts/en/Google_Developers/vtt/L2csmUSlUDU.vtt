KIMBER LOCKHART:
Thank you, Rebecca.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.080
And thank you also to Reena.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.840
All your efforts
to drive engagement

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.160
with high school
students and younger

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.630
make a better pipeline for
me to hire from tomorrow.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.250
So thank you very much for that.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.720
About me, I'm at Box.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.290
If you're not
familiar with Box, we

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.619
make it very easy
for enterprises

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.540
to manage their content and
collaborate with each other.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.320
We're replacing a
lot of legacy tools

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.950
that these companies had
to use for security reasons

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.900
with a really high-security
model built in the cloud.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.720
I'm here to talk about a
near and dear topic to me,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.590
and that is moving into
engineering leadership.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.980
And why is this topic
so near and dear to me?

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.250
Well, I have to tell
you my story in order

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.880
to tell you that.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.950
So I ended up declaring
computer science

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.850
at Stanford a little
bit accidentally.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.390
If I didn't declare
accidentally,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.540
I definitely stayed in because
the chair of the department

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.740
wouldn't let me out.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.680
He's like, we've got one,
and she's going to stay here.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.850
So I got through
those early classes.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.220
Even though I wanted
to quit several times,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.170
there I was at the end-- a
computer science diploma.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.100
And I got swept up in the
Silicon Valley entrepreneurship

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.015
craze.

00:01:33.015 --> 00:01:37.210
So a couple of friends of
mine and I started a company.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.680
We ended up taking a seed
round of funding from DFJ

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.150
three months before I graduated.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.310
Now, talk about a stressful
final quarter at college.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.750
We're starting this company.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.240
We're sitting on, you
know, millions of dollars

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.794
in the bank-- never even
seen that much money--

00:01:54.794 --> 00:01:56.210
and trying to
figure out how we're

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.260
going to get the right
level of market traction

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.140
to make our company successful.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.320
We're also fighting the market.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.922
This was 2008, 2009.

00:02:04.922 --> 00:02:09.300
This was not a nice time to
be a startup, but we did it.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.850
We ran the company for
about a year and a half.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.160
We built technology
that allowed you

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.790
to see a document
in your browser--

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.680
so like a Word doc
or a PowerPoint.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.160
Now we can do that every
day, but at that time

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.865
it just was not available.

00:02:23.865 --> 00:02:28.120
Turns out, the
up-and-coming company Box

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.840
really needed that technology.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.340
So we got a call from Aaron and
Dylan, the founders, one day.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.990
And we came in and
we started talking,

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.330
and we decided that we were
going to have Box acquire us

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.991
so that we could power
their document viewing.

00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:45.490
All right.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.000
So I'm joining Box.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.380
I'm, like, seventh
engineer at Box.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.190
And I had to learn to go from
being an entrepreneur to being

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.110
an individual contributor
engineer at Box.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.100
What I did well was
lead groups of teams.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.060
So when we wanted a
JavaScript style guide,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.640
we had a JavaScript style guide
because I got all my buddies

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.339
together and we made one.

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.130
And so my boss corners
me one day and says,

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.700
Kimber, do you want to be
an engineering manager?

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.850
Our team is growing,
and we need one.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.160
I looked back at
him, and I said, no.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.030
That sounds a lot
like middle manager,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.830
and I hear that's really
a weird thing to be.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.577
Maybe you get stuck
there forever,

00:03:26.577 --> 00:03:28.910
and you don't actually get
to be a leader because you're

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.020
this manager person.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.610
Went home, thought about it,
changed my mind, came back.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.170
Said, I'm stuck here in my
golden handcuffs anyway,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.020
might as well give it a shot.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.480
And I make possibly the
best decision of my life,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.790
and I move into this
management spot.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.310
And what was so
cool about that is,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.980
this is the time Box's
engineering group

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.030
is growing and
growing aggressively.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.950
So I had four people on my team.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.940
And then I had 20
people on my team.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.870
And then I had 40
people on my team.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.510
And I was bringing
up new managers,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.730
and then I had 60
people on my team.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.735
And I had to learn to
scale incredibly quickly.

00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:07.360
And I had to learn
a lot of the lessons

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.850
that I want to share with
you guys the hard way.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.490
I also had the opportunity
to bring about eight people

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.810
from my team and other teams
at Box into engineering

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.704
leadership, both
managerial and technical.

00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:24.292
I'll get to the
distinction in a second.

00:04:24.292 --> 00:04:26.500
But I was able to bring
these people into engineering

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.730
leadership, and you
know the great part?

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.250
Three of those eight
people were women.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.810
And so now my
management team at Box

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.095
is actually half women,
which is pretty cool.

00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:38.085
All right.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.730
So what I'm going to share
today is some common themes

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.380
on the path to
engineering leadership.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.170
Things that if you
know them will help you

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.220
as you decide what
you're going to do.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.070
So the first is to aim clearly.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.160
There is the old
and kind of cliched

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.750
statement that if you don't
know what you're going for,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.650
how do you get there.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.370
It's true, but it's especially
true in the engineering world.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.220
And here's why.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.290
What I have up here is
not exactly what Box does,

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.260
but it's close.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.860
It's a pretty
general graph of how

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.970
people get promoted
through an engineering

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.770
organization of any size at all.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.090
And so what you can see at the
top is the management track.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.604
So you might start out
as a software engineer,

00:05:28.604 --> 00:05:31.020
do what I did-- say, hey maybe
this management thing would

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.441
be pretty cool, and move on
up, and all of a sudden you're

00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:35.190
VP of engineering.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.170
It doesn't quite work like that.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.380
There's a second row that's
same prestige-- in fact,

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.330
at Box it's actually probably
more prestigious than going up

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.030
the management track-- which
is the technical track.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.970
And so these are your elite
technical contributors.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.480
It turns out, the sort
of horizontal alignment

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.500
is on purpose.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.110
Roughly, if you are a
very high-level engineer,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.050
you are paid the
same, you're valued

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.540
the same as your very top
engineering leadership.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.170
This is pretty standard.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.870
At the bottom I just
have another track

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.570
that sometimes people
will use if you're

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.440
specializing in design
or architecture.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.050
To make this more
confusing, I have not even

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.910
included product or
program management.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:31.120
And those are often tracks that
engineers will go down as well.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.310
So when I say aim
clearly, I don't

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.370
mean that you have to
know what you want to do.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.100
But I'm saying that you should
probably pick one at a time.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.760
Pick one you want to go
to, decide what it is.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.500
If you want to change
your mind, fine.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.450
But at least you're doing
all the right things

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.180
to get you in that direction.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.550
Because what it takes to
become a VP of engineering

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.370
is different from what
it takes to become

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.800
a principal architect.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.550
And that's all very
different from what

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.021
it takes to move into
product management.

00:06:59.021 --> 00:06:59.520
All right.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.600
So you've got to figure
out what you want to do.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.900
Now, it's a really common thing
that my direct reports will

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.940
come to me and say, I don't
know what I want to do.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.930
I haven't decided yet.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.800
And that's fine.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.910
That's my job to have a
conversation with them

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.330
about what they want to
do with their future.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.530
The problem comes when they
don't follow up with me,

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.830
and say a couple
weeks later, actually

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.460
I decided I want to go
down the technical track.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.080
Can you help me find the
right opportunities to do so?

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.480
If they spend forever
sort of straddled

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.490
between the technical track
and the managerial track,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.730
not only can I not
help them-- if they

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.070
try to get promoted to
one of these two sides,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.440
they won't have been
doing the right thing.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.749
So the point of this is, pick
where you're going to go.

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:46.290
Change it when you
want to change it.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.445
But always have sort of
a singular destination.

00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:52.120
All right.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.190
Next, be at the right
place at the right time.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.840
I happen to use
a picture of Box.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.650
You could use a picture of
any of a handful of companies.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.520
What's important here is
not that Box was small

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.710
when I joined but
rather that Box

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.940
was growing extremely quickly.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.680
So what do you guys think is
the right profile to join?

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.670
Let's say you want to become
an engineering manager,

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.690
and you're exhibiting leadership
as a software engineer.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.560
What's kind of the
best company to go to?

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.518
Anybody have any ideas?

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.060
No ideas?

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.425
Something rapidly growing.

00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:29.300
More specifically, you're
going to be looking

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.490
for teams that are
hitting 8, 10 people, that

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.850
are hiring very aggressively.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.690
Because we all want to
promote from inside.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.870
And so if we can hire you
as a software engineer,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.549
and you start to show
great leadership,

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.390
we want to promote you-- not
only do we want to, we need to.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.446
We actually have this
desperate need for leaders.

00:08:48.446 --> 00:08:50.070
And that's a very
different environment

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.460
than being in a company
where the spot of manager

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.630
of your team is filled, and
you don't get to move up

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.850
until that person quits or
gets promoted or whatever else.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.760
You don't want to be
in that situation.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.900
So there's a little bit
of strategic alignment

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.390
with the company and the
phase of your career based

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.420
on what it is that
you're aiming for.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.030
Do the job before you have it.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.300
Our cute little doctor friend
here is a good example,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.900
but I want to tell you a story.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.330
When I was in high school, I
went out for the track team.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.830
I had been injured the year
before in eighth grade track,

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.390
so I didn't have a reputation
for being very fast

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.280
or for being a great
runner in high school.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.290
And when the coach
first came out

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.450
with the roster for the team,
I looked down the varsity side.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.805
I looked for my name.

00:09:47.805 --> 00:09:49.970
I kept looking for my name.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.140
I kept looking for my name.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.665
And my name was
not on that side.

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:57.640
And I looked over on the JV
side, and my heart sinks.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.720
And I'm a junior varsity runner
in the 100-meter dash, which

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.280
is code for, we don't
know what you do,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.365
but you're not very fast.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.210
I get to looking at the
varsity side again, though,

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.140
and there's an opening.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.240
And that opening is in
the 400-meter hurdles.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.420
Yeah, that is a great
face, right over there.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.920
400-meter hurdles has
the scariest reputation

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.800
of, I think, any
race in, at least,

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.915
Iowa high school girls track.

00:10:27.915 --> 00:10:31.020
It's killer-- you're sprinting
the whole time, jumping over

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.050
things, you turn
green at the end.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.630
It's awful.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.240
But I really wanted
to run varsity track.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.190
So I went to my coach,
and I said, hey Coach,

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.050
I noticed there's a spot here.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.590
Could I take it?

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.760
She's like, if you want to, OK.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.310
So I do it, and I run the
race, and I almost die.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.110
And I don't do
particularly well.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.790
But the next time
the roster comes out,

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.790
guess whose name is next
to 400-meter hurdles

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.570
in the varsity column?

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.010
Mine.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.390
Got progressively better over
the course of the season.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.660
And the most important
thing is that I lettered

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.660
in varsity high school
track my freshman year.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.400
I'm a little competitive, so
this was very important to me.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.420
And what was cool about that
was that what I had done

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.990
is found a way to do
the job before I had it.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.080
I did the job before
I was officially

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.100
a member of the high
school track team.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.625
So there's this
common misperception

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:35.630
that you can't do this
in leadership, especially

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.229
on the management track.

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:38.270
What are you going to do?

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.040
Take your peers, sit
across at a table,

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.050
and deliver an annual review?

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.680
I wouldn't recommend it.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.610
So you can't-- you can't
deliver an annual review.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.570
But if you aren't able to
enable people to do better work,

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.500
if you're not able to
solve problems that

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.060
affect the entire
team, and if you're not

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.140
able to get things done when
you promised to get them done

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.940
without authority,
you're never going

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.760
to be able to do those
things with authority.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.240
In fact, the best leaders
I've ever come upon rarely

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.250
touch their authority.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.170
They rely on the
influence that they

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.780
learned before they
officially had the role

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.270
to get the job done.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:21.990
So do that.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.680
Observe someone who's doing
the job that you want.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.520
See what they do.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.010
See what problems
they're trying to solve.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.750
Solve problems that
are "above your level."

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.716
Find your 400-meter hurdles,
and get yourself in the race.

00:12:36.716 --> 00:12:40.400
All right, you're doing
the job beforehand.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.370
What else is important?

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.430
Well, there's this
constant tension, I think,

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.370
with engineers.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.870
Does someone want
to raise your hand

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.710
and give me what I
mean by leverage?

00:12:51.235 --> 00:12:51.735
Anybody?

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.060
Over there.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.850
AUDIENCE: What you can
use to position yourself

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.207
in a situation to get a
more positive outcome.

00:13:01.207 --> 00:13:02.790
KIMBER LOCKHART:
More positive outcome

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.910
is the most important
part of that definition.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.040
So how to focus
on the things that

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.640
have the highest impact for
the littlest amount of work.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.580
And so when we're
talking to people

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.290
who are moving into leadership,
what we always ask them to do

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.060
is think about
focusing their time

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.590
on high-leverage activities.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.380
This is what you do if you
hire a housecleaner to clean

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.850
your house so that you can spend
more time working on your job

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.910
or taking care of your kids.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.960
So high-leverage
activities are very

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.950
important if you
want to move up.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.230
At the same time, there's
a trap on the other end

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.670
of the spectrum where
you get so focused

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.280
on high-leverage activities that
you forget that sometimes it's

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.730
the little things that makes
the company the most successful.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.680
So the phrase I like
to use to capture this

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.840
is think high leverage but be
willing to take out the trash.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.470
When I was at Increo,
we didn't have someone

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.580
to take out the
trash for a while.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.180
So, you know, the little
bitty Ikea trash cans

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.610
we had in our office
started to fill up quite far

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:14.216
with M&amp;M wrappers and
Diet Dr. Pepper bottles.

00:14:14.216 --> 00:14:16.190
And eventually I
took out the trash

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.820
because somebody had
to do it or nobody

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.680
would want to come
to work every day.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.180
And so that's really the kind
of thing you need to focus on.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.700
When you have an opportunity to
serve your team, you take it.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.930
Now what's probably
the most important here

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.360
is that your mantra
should be, what

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.966
is best for the business
over the long term?

00:14:34.966 --> 00:14:35.966
Did you have a question?

00:14:35.966 --> 00:14:38.406
AUDIENCE: Yes, could
you give us examples

00:14:38.406 --> 00:14:39.870
of high-leverage activities?

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.453
KIMBER LOCKHART:
It's a good question.

00:14:41.453 --> 00:14:46.600
So a high-leverage
activity might be something

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:53.500
like, instead of
personally deciding

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.980
that you like a new
JavaScript stockpile

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.360
and fixing a file to include
that JavaScript file,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.630
you might get a group
of people together

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.010
to think about what should
be the new JavaScript

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.020
style for everything
and enable all of them

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.430
to be working on the same
thing at the same time.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.190
It's the difference
between fixing a little bug

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.260
and introducing a
framework that removes

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.630
all instances of that bug.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.070
Sometimes fixing the
little bug is the choice.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.430
More often than not, removing
all future instances of the bug

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.740
is the right choice.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.240
So the way to really
think about it

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:31.450
is, what is going to be best for
your company in the long term.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.350
And if you can make
decisions according to that--

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.390
and sometimes those decisions
involve taking out the trash,

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.250
and sometimes those decisions
involve working on the sexiest,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.890
highest-leverage
architecture project

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.020
there is-- you're going
in the right direction.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.720
All right.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.812
Last but not least,
welcome feedback.

00:15:51.812 --> 00:15:54.580
So you know that
feeling when somebody

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:59.600
gets to the areas for
improvement section?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.510
Your heart sinks, starts beating
faster, you're really nervous.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.140
What are they going to say?

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.670
You go into fight
or flight mode.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.332
You even like the person sitting
across the table from you,

00:16:10.332 --> 00:16:12.340
and it's scary.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.270
Getting feedback at any
time is extremely scary.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.560
It's exposing our flaws
and our vulnerabilities.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.790
And it can be very easy
when you get feedback

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:27.210
to shut down, to agree with
it, to disagree with it,

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.180
to fight back about it.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.840
Turns out none of those are
the appropriate response

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.980
for getting more feedback.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.630
What feedback gives you
is the ability to improve.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.030
And the more you move
up in your career,

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.940
the more you rely upon feedback
to tell you how to improve,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.050
because there's
not a set of rules.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.700
In my job right now,
a measure of success

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.490
is how well is your team doing.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.350
Well, that's not like did I
write more code or less code.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.770
That's a really hard
thing to define.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.020
So the way that I improve
is by getting feedback.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.500
Now the way you
get more feedback

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.394
is to respond to
feedback as follows.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:07.849
Thank you.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.230
And that's it.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.000
So what you want
to do is you want

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.670
to be the person that no
matter what, when someone comes

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.625
to you with feedback,
you say thank you.

00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:22.270
You attempt to implement
it, and you move on.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.750
And that's the kind of thing
that has people come to you

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.619
and tell you about things that
might be your blind spots.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.430
It might be your limiting
factors in the future.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.580
So as much as your
heart starts to sink,

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.580
and as much as your
stomach gets tight,

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.980
just remember-- thank you.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.660
It's all you have to say.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.590
Now, the other side
of welcoming feedback

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.270
is putting that feedback to use.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.604
So obviously, if
you're defensive when

00:17:45.604 --> 00:17:47.020
you get feedback,
people are going

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.260
to stop coming to
you with feedback.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.270
But if you don't ever
implement any of the feedback

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:56.190
that you receive, people also
will be a little bit less

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.400
willing to come to you
with that feedback.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.280
So one of my favorite
strategies on implementing

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.620
the feedback you
receive, especially

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.380
with a group of people,
is called feedforward.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.030
And it's Marshall
Goldsmith's concept

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.770
from his book "What Got You
Here Won't Get You There."

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.850
And he spends a
lot of time talking

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.110
about saying thank you
when you get feedback.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.970
But taking the team of
people you work with,

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.320
including your boss,
and engaging them

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.220
in helping you get better.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.990
So what feedforward is is you
decide-- you get some feedback,

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.150
you decide about something
you want to work on.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.450
Let's say you want to
become a better listener.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.011
So you go to all of the
people that you work with

00:18:38.011 --> 00:18:40.010
and you say, I'm trying
to be a better listener.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:45.325
Do you have ideas for how I
might be a better listener?

00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:46.450
Then they give you an idea.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:47.700
And how do you respond?

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.610
KIMBER LOCKHART:
Thank you, excellent.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:51.920
You say thank you.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.520
Take it or leave it,
implement it or don't.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.880
But the benefit of this is
that your team, your boss,

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.910
the people you work
with, know that you're

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.130
aiming for improvement
in this way.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.640
OK?

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.170
So it can be really hard to
deal with feedback, especially

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.560
when it comes from your boss or
your peers and it's not fair.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.600
But it's so important that
you develop a reputation

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.170
as someone who welcomes
feedback in order

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.090
to continue to move
up in your career.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:28.670
Last but not least-- your
job's going to change.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.530
In the words of
the Red Queen, you

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.050
have to do more and more just
to stay in the same place.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.470
And this is true.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.460
When I went from being
an entrepreneur to being

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.650
an individual
contributor developer,

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.720
I suddenly had to
learn how to code

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.230
with a whole group of people.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.350
And then when I went from being
a developer to being a manager,

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.140
all of a sudden
my success was not

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.710
based on how well I did-- I
could do the coolest project

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.150
ever-- it was based on
how well my team did.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.030
And then when I moved
to managing managers,

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.510
all of a sudden
how my team did was

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.130
a given, that had
to be successful.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.420
My success was based
on the type of change

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.230
that I could bring to
the entire organization.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:17.200
In fact, my underlying
advice for all of this

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.780
is that at any given
time, consider yourself

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.465
your boss's secret partner.

00:20:21.465 --> 00:20:24.160
Like, right now I'm the co-VP of
engineering, but nobody knows.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.100
And then you're
solving the types

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.380
of problems that will get
you to the next level.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.820
So as you move up
in your career,

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.930
success will increasingly
be about your ability

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:41.450
to find the problems
and then solve it.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.190
All right.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.898
So we're going to move
to questions here.

00:20:43.898 --> 00:20:47.080
You've got my five
pieces of advice.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.570
If you'd like to connect
with me at any point--

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.029
@kimber_lockhart.

00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:54.070
Might take me a few days.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.380
I'm not really into Twitter.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.270
My co-founder now works at
Twitter, so he made me do it.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:04.210
In any case, please take
some time, ask me a question.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.510
I'm happy to share any more
about any of these things

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:11.180
or some examples of how I've
seen these topics be really

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.480
useful for the people
that are on my team.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.249
Thank you guys.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.660
Do we have a-- there it is.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
the great presentation.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.680
So you kind of
mentioned sometimes

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.370
we need to pick a route.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.980
What if there is
two routes to pick.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.750
How would we go--
let's say, manager,

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.020
like engineer manager,
and program manager,

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.350
or product management.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.160
So haven't done none of those.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.180
I'm kind of trying to decide
which one I'm better at.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.880
How would I pick it?

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.060
KIMBER LOCKHART:
Do you do-- yes.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.700
She would like to know if there
are two routes, say engineering

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.340
program manager and
what was the other one?

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.397
Engineering manager?

00:22:00.397 --> 00:22:01.480
AUDIENCE: Product manager.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.600
KIMBER LOCKHART:
Product manager.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.900
OK, so if there's several
different similar routes,

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.910
how do you pick?

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.990
I can't answer that
for you because that's

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.790
a very personal question.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:16.080
But do your due diligence
and settle on one for now.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.740
Set a calendar reminder
six months in the future

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.500
to see if you'd like
to change your mind.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.750
And then don't worry about it.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.290
And do everything
you possibly can

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.680
to hit the route that
you picked at this time.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.790
Because the people that
are most successful

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.410
are not really the ones who
are, from what I've seen,

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.040
are not really the ones
who are absolutely sure,

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.100
but they're the ones who
can pick enough so that they

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.000
do the right things
to get to the level

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.220
where they can decide
whether they like it.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.770
It's much easier to
move horizontally

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.030
than it is to move sort
of up in the world.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.420
AUDIENCE: My question
to you is what

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.560
personal obstacles or the
most important obstacle you

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.920
had to face to be
where you are now?

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.145
And how did you overcome it.

00:23:04.145 --> 00:23:05.520
KIMBER LOCKHART:
The question is,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.200
what are the most
important obstacles

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.500
I had to face to get where I am
now, and how did I overcome it?

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.170
Life is a series of
obstacles, right?

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.740
But one I will call
out is learning

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.460
how to manage
managers-- learning

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.020
how to promote
your first manager.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.930
That was actually
extremely difficult.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:27.390
There's not a rule book on how
to find your first manager.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:31.680
And so what I did at that
time is I went to my boss,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.610
I went to some industry
connections that I had,

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.600
and I said, I would
like to meet someone

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.610
who has been through
exactly the same thing I'm

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.380
going through--
company hypergrowth--

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.600
in a different company
about three years ago.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.796
Who do you know?

00:23:46.796 --> 00:23:48.670
Of course, they introduced
me to all women,

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.020
but these are fantastic women.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.580
And they took me through how
you hire your first manager.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.320
They took me through how
you evaluate whether or not

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.135
that's working.

00:23:58.135 --> 00:24:00.260
And they really helped me
to get to that next stage

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:00.940
of my career.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.960
So when you hit some
of these obstacles,

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.970
it's a good time to say, I
need to learn as much as I can.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:10.120
And you might learn from books,
you might learn from mentors,

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.015
but don't hesitate to reach out
for introductions to people who

00:24:13.015 --> 00:24:15.400
have done exactly what it
is that you want to do.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.020
So why be an engineering leader.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.460
KIMBER LOCKHART:
It's a good question.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.820
You don't have to be.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.010
But being in
engineering leader--

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:38.600
either a technical leader or
a management-style leader--

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.610
gives you more impact than
you can have as an individual.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:47.190
So there is nothing I like more
than seeing a team that I've

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.520
built, people that
I've put together,

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.450
that are more successful
than the sum of their parts.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.870
It fulfills me.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.620
And so if it's not the kind
of thing that you like doing,

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.070
give it a try, decide you
don't like it, that's great.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.300
But there's something
very special about having

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.600
more impact by
working with a team--

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.770
either giving them
people leadership

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.260
or giving them
technical direction--

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.065
that you just don't
get as an individual.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.160
AUDIENCE: So in terms of the
leadership and management,

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:23.130
do you see any advantages
that women have more than men,

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.057
and how can we leverage
that advantages?

00:25:25.057 --> 00:25:26.640
KIMBER LOCKHART:
It's a good question,

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.465
do women have more
advantages than men?

00:25:31.465 --> 00:25:35.640
You know, I think it's a wash.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.020
There are some things that have
been incredibly beneficial.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.860
People like to write about
women in computer science,

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.540
I've found.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.770
So I get way more PR than
my male counterparts--

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.660
kind of cool.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.820
But on the other hand,
I'll be in discussions

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.480
and you'll see
some of the things

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.310
that Sheryl Sandberg
shares in "Lean In"

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.254
where women are perceived
as more emotional or more

00:26:02.254 --> 00:26:03.670
aggressive than
they actually are.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.630
I've seen that in the workplace.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.040
And ultimately, you are an
individual, you are unique,

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.990
you have strengths,
you have weaknesses.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.770
Who you are, what
your gender is,

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:16.330
is just another
dimension of that.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:20.340
And I'd say, not worry about.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.310
And if you believe
that it will be a wash

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.810
and that you're
just as likely to be

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.510
as successful as
any other person,

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.794
I think you're more
likely to get there.

00:26:36.536 --> 00:26:37.410
AUDIENCE: Hi, Kimber.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.250
So my question is as
a junior developer

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.450
who just got out of
college, if I kind of want

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.220
to be a manager in
the future, what

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.530
are the specific steps
or advice I can use.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.890
Let's say I mean a relatively
big company where there

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.640
are managers, there
are a lot of managers.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.194
So what are the things I
can do to go to that point.

00:26:58.194 --> 00:26:59.360
KIMBER LOCKHART: Absolutely.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.920
So if you're a junior
developer, what kinds of things

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.650
can you do?

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.550
Well, one is to get
really good at your job.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.560
So a lot of moving
into leadership

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.220
is based on being good
at what you do now.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.370
It's a prerequisite,
it's not everything.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.470
Another thing that
you might do is really

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.950
observe the behavior of
the managers and leaders

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.550
that you look up to.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:25.330
Another thing you might do is
notice where there's problems.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.980
Engineers are problem solvers
by nature but so many of us

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.390
don't take the time to go
outside of the code, outside

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:36.760
of the project, and see that
this process is really broken.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.010
I can probably fix it.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.750
And it's that level
of considering

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:44.130
yourself empowered to solve
organizational problems that

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.410
will make you into a person
that people start to notice,

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.700
and will start to get you into
more and more leadership roles.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:56.355
Any other questions?

00:27:56.355 --> 00:27:57.260
There we go.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.950
AUDIENCE: In your
leadership journey,

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.040
what is it that you
know now that you

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.712
wish you had known
10 years back?

00:28:03.712 --> 00:28:05.170
KIMBER LOCKHART:
Most of the things

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.200
I just shared with
you, actually.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.700
When I was making
this presentation,

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.350
I said what do I wish I knew?

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.270
And it was a lot
of those things.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:17.752
The overarching thing I wish
I knew-- I was in college.

00:28:17.752 --> 00:28:19.460
And I was trying to
determine if I wanted

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.880
to be a product
manager or an engineer.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.940
Anybody ever wrestled with that?

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.580
Yeah, it tends to be a pretty
typical thing, especially

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.950
in the women in tech circles.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:36.530
And I wish I would have known
that engineering leadership,

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.850
engineering management, becoming
a director of engineering,

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:43.710
running whole engineering
teams, was a viable career path.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.380
Because it achieves
a lot of what

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.220
I like in terms of
interacting with people,

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.860
and marries it with still
being extremely technical.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.690
I may not write code every
day, but I'm sitting in there,

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.960
I'm making decisions, I'm
asking the hard questions.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.510
So I wish that I knew that this
career path existed, because I

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.090
would have saved a whole lot of
time wrestling with what else

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.940
I wanted to do.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:12.130
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.320
So for someone who is starting
out as a software engineer,

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.800
you tend to actually go
on the technical part

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.800
because you are shielded
off from so many things

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.030
if you just stay
this way, and you

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.410
get to do what
you like the most.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.560
But with someone with
that mindset, what

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.560
is the one thing
that you would say

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.030
is the brightest side
of just moving up

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.530
on to the management part.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.274
KIMBER LOCKHART: So if
you love what you do,

00:29:37.274 --> 00:29:39.690
I'm not sure I'd be overly
concerned about doing something

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:41.010
different.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.580
That's sort of my guide.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.200
At the same time, if you are
scared of doing something else,

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.250
that's your first red flag that
maybe you should consider it.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.140
And if you live your
life according to that,

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.182
you're probably going to
be in pretty good shape.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.430
AUDIENCE: So you talked a
little bit about how it's easier

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.050
to move horizontally
than vertically,

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.954
but as you climb up those levels
of leadership, if at some point

00:30:13.954 --> 00:30:15.370
you realize that
it's not what you

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.530
want to do but you know
that now, at this point,

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.520
you've got teams upon teams
resting upon your decision,

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.930
does it become more
difficult in any way

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:26.350
to shift and to change
entirely what you want to do,

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.580
if you take that leap and
you climb all the way up?

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.790
KIMBER LOCKHART: There's sort of
two answers that I'll give you.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.300
One is that if you
have the opportunity

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.340
to move into management, and
you want to give it a try,

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.900
and that's what you've set your
aim on, by all means do it.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.620
If your company knows
what they're doing,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.600
they will have a track back out.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.350
It's very typical that engineers
will think that this is

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.070
something they want to do and
then get into it and either

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.440
decide they love
it or really don't.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.450
I have two people
on my team actually

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.690
who have become managers
that I have transitioned

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.720
back out to individual
contributors.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.550
Not because they
were doing a bad job,

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.070
but because it was clear
in our conversations

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.840
that there just was not a fit.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.180
They didn't like it, and
they weren't as effective

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.950
as they could have been
if they did like it.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:17.280
Now to your question of
moving further up and what

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.710
you do when you move further up.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.235
I think what's really
nice about our industry is

00:31:21.235 --> 00:31:23.290
that opportunities are
so plentiful that you

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.690
can kind of do
whatever you want.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.120
But it does become
harder to make

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.840
a move when you
have a large team.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.250
So as you start to have
bigger and bigger teams,

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.840
you have to have more
specific plans for what

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.030
happens if you need to extract
yourself from that situation.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.340
So that might mean, you've
been there for 10 years,

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.798
you want to do
something else, it's

00:31:46.798 --> 00:31:49.260
time for you to move on
to your next opportunity.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.980
You are measured by how
you leave your team.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.420
And so leaving your
team in great shape

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.830
is something that follows
you as you move on.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.570
AUDIENCE: You've
talked a lot about sort

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:10.780
of moving through
your career and how

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.060
things change over time.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.100
And 10 years into my
career I'm realizing

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.160
that I evaluated whether I
was doing the right things

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.660
or whether I wanted
to change things

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.710
a lot more earlier in
my career than I do now.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:27.014
And so the question
I have is, how often

00:32:27.014 --> 00:32:28.680
do you think it's
healthy to really look

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.959
at what you're doing
and sort of reality

00:32:30.959 --> 00:32:32.750
check yourself in the
direction that you're

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.500
going as you progress
through your career,

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.962
and how do you change
that over time?

00:32:36.962 --> 00:32:38.670
KIMBER LOCKHART: So
most of these answers

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.040
have been solely my opinion.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.340
This one is perhaps
even more so.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.240
This is just what I do.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:50.900
I find that if I go
longer than six months,

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.680
I haven't thought
about it enough.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.750
If I go less long than six
months, I drive myself crazy.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.850
So I ended up at six months.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.800
You could try your birthday
every year, try New Year's.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.300
New Year's is great,
because you get

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.530
to set goals and think about
your life all at the same time.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:07.238
Favorite holiday.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.262
But I do recommend
having some frequency

00:33:13.262 --> 00:33:15.470
that you evaluate what it
is you're doing, especially

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:16.940
because you can
get in a situation

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.590
where you're not making a
move because you're scared

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.070
of the next move, as opposed
to because you're really

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.690
happy with what you're doing.

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.700
And really, that's the
time to be concerned.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.020
If you're happy doing what
you're doing, have at it.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.890
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.890
Have you ever in your
career have seen women

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:39.770
not moving up in the
hierarchy because people

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.650
in the management thinks
that they are-- because she

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:45.250
is a woman and she needs
time with her family,

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:48.100
and she may not be able to give
hundred percent to this job

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.100
profile?

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.100
Have you ever come
across this situation?

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.380
KIMBER LOCKHART: No.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.360
Not explicitly.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.640
Have I ever come across
women paying a penalty

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.940
in moving up in the ladder
because they might want

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.610
to spend more time with their
children and their family?

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.180
Usually I see it
more the other way

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:11.250
around, where women don't
approach the opportunity

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.750
or don't plan for
the opportunity

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.460
because they're
worried about it.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:16.699
And I'm lucky.

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:20.440
I work at an extremely
thoughtful company,

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.780
an extremely supportive
company of women.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:27.730
And I got to form that
from a very early stage.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:31.340
But if you look at-- my
leadership team is half women.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.389
In fact, the team that I'm
a part of, the team that

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:37.449
sort of reports to the head
of engineering is half women.

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.989
I honestly don't know
how that came to be,

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.909
but it's an extremely exciting
dynamic to be a part of.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:47.340
And actually what I
find is, of the women

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.500
that stay in technical
roles, many of them

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:56.370
have other sides to
their personality

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:59.380
that make them good leaders.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.810
So this is by all means not
a sweeping, generalization

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:03.660
statement.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.680
There are people of all
profiles of all genders,

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.060
but I keep accidentally
having women

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.620
move into leadership
roles on my team

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.203
because they keep
being the people who

00:35:12.203 --> 00:35:13.910
are good at organizing
other people.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.760
So actually, I had to
go in, and at one point

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.815
I had all women
as Scrum Masters,

00:35:21.815 --> 00:35:23.190
and somebody came
to me and said,

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.690
do you realize you have this?

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:28.520
And I said, no, I didn't
realize I had that.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.320
Maybe I should
encourage some guys.
