00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:11.106
[music] Researchers at the Arizona Health
Sciences Center are discovering that the root

00:00:11.106 --> 00:00:17.536
of the Turmeric plant used for centuries in
cooking and in ayurvedic medicine is effective

00:00:17.596 --> 00:00:19.816
against some inflammatory diseases.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:25.596
Turmeric is a spice that's used, it's
what causes curries to be orange,

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:31.176
and it's traditionally used a lot in Indian
cooking but it's also used traditionally

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:35.496
in Indian medical systems and it's used
specifically for inflammatory things

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:38.506
like colds, sore throats, and arthritis.

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:44.556
Dr. Janet Funk is a clinical endo-crinologist at
the University of Arizona College of Medicine.

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:49.926
With support from the national institutes
of health, she studied Turmeric to see

00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:52.216
if it is useful in treating arthritis.

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:55.426
In her lab, she found that
it prevented arthritis

00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:58.726
by blocking an inflammatory
response in the body.

00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:01.256
Turmeric attacks something early on.

00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:04.896
We know that same pathway is
important in a lot of other diseases.

00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:11.146
Dr. Funk recently teamed with Dr. Leslie
Ritter, coordinator for the Stroke Center

00:01:11.146 --> 00:01:15.766
at University Medical Center to see if
Turmeric might help stroke patients.

00:01:16.356 --> 00:01:20.206
Their research has shown that
Turmeric can reduce the inflammation

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:24.476
that complicates the effects of
stroke and may even be preventative.

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:26.836
Are more curries in order?

00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:28.786
or Turmeric supplements?

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:31.586
As we know in laboratory
models, it works very well.

00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:35.496
But still, there's no clinical
trials with people showing

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:37.516
that they work and that they're safe.

00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:42.366
Turmeric that we buy at the grocery store
and that we use in cooking is basically comes

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:48.316
from the Turmeric rhizome and they dry it
and grind it up and that's Turmeric powder

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.696
that you buy in the spice
section at the grocery store.

00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:55.866
When you go to the store to buy turmeric as
a dietary supplement, it comes in a pill form

00:01:55.916 --> 00:02:00.376
and it's not just the dried
rhizome put in a pill, rather,

00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:04.796
instead they take the dried rhizome,
they extract it with various chemicals

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:11.976
to get just a small part of it so that
one pill, one dietary supplement pill

00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:16.986
of turmeric is usually equal to
this much of the dried powder.

00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:22.166
So what you buy is very different
then what you use in cooking.

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:26.876
These are just different capsules that
we've opened up and we've looked at them

00:02:26.876 --> 00:02:29.836
to see what they're composed of and
just looking at their colors you can see

00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:34.876
that they're not all the same and when you go to
the health foods store, you can't really tell.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:39.966
There's not enough information given to
you to figure out what's in a given capsule

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:42.496
because that's just the way they're regulated.

00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:48.376
In their lab, Dr. Funk and Dr. Ritter
used turmeric extracts that are isolated

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:53.216
and prepared specifically for them so
they know exactly what they are testing,

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:55.046
what works, and how.

00:02:55.736 --> 00:02:59.426
Additional research and clinical
trials in the future may prove

00:02:59.426 --> 00:03:13.086
that turmeric is an effective
therapy for many of our ills.
