00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.320
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: It is my great
pleasure to give you Nathan Hill.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.940
[ Applause ]

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.240
&gt;&gt; Nathan Hill: Thank you.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.900
Wow. Thank you for coming.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.490
I wrote this book for a long time.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.310
It took me 10 years
to write this book,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.520 position:56%
and there were moments along the way

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.980
when I would kind of
daydream, you know.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.260
I would allow myself to
think, "What would it be

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.310
like to have a book
out in the world?"

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.510
What would it be like to
be a published author?

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.110
And I would entertain
all of these thoughts,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.730
but there are certain things
you can't prepare for.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.790
For example, last night I was
standing at the Library of Congress

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.330
at this festival's opening
gala which was lit up in purple

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.090
like a rave in Paisley Park,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270
and today I'm in front
of you good people.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.560
And this is just not something
I ever expected to do.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.530 position:56%
So thank you so much for coming out.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.130
I really, really appreciate it.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.390
One of the things I did
daydream about -- I'm sorry.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.720
I just have to tell this story.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.640
One of the things I did daydream

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.090 position:56%
about when I was writing this book
was like, "Well, wouldn't it be cool

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.110
if one day I saw my
book out in the wild?"

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.160
You know, like somebody
out there reading it.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.860
Like at a restaurant
or a cafe or an airport

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.880
or on the train or something.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.380
So chalk this story up to be
careful what you wish for.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.010
On the trip that I took just before
this one I was flying from Boston

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.000
to Seattle, and I sat down
in my seat on my plane next

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.170
to the two most talkative people
on the airplane, just super chatty.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.470
I don't know about you.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.770
I usually kind of put on
my headphones and just try

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.050
to like just ignore everything,
but that was impossible.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.810
And they were so friendly,
and you know they sussed

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.110
out very quickly who I was.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.410
"Oh, you're a writer.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.710
Oh, really.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.010
What are you doing in Seattle?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.310
You have a book out.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.610
What's the book called?"

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.910
Etcetera, etcetera.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.210
And the guy next to me was like,
"I'm going to buy it right now."

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.570
I'm like, "Okay."

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.670
So he pulls out his phone
and he gets in to the app

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.790 position:56%
and he buys the book, and then it
downloads right before we have to --

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.340
Like right before we have to put it
on airplane mode and we take off.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.440
And so he's reading the --
He's sitting right next to me.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.040
And he starts reading my book,
and he reads the prologue

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.420
which is just like
a page and a half.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.350
He reads the prologue,
and he turns to me.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.500
He's like, "All right.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.740
Not bad." And I'm like, "Thanks."

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.550
Thinking, okay, he'll put the book
away and he'll go on with his life.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.420
But no. Then he moves
on to chapter one,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.890
and he starts reading chapter one.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.570 position:56%
And it's clear that he is just going

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.590
to keep reading while I'm
sitting right next to him.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.130
And so I'm like, "This is awful."

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.610
Because like if he laughs of
course I'll look over and be like,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.910
"What is he laughing at?"

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.460
Or if he doesn't laugh, that
sends a completely different

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.910
signal altogether.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.220
And so I'm like, "I have to
signal to this guy that it's okay

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.520
for him to stop reading."

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.150
Because maybe he hates it,
but he then can't put it away

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.940
because I'm his neighbor now.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.050
So I act like I take a nap.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.240
Like for a half an hour
I act like I take a nap.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.510
And then I kind of open my
eyes and he's still reading.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.510
And so then I put on a movie,
and I watch the whole movie.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.890
And I look over, and
he's still reading.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.470
He's reading completely
expressionless the entire flight.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.570
And so we land and he looks
over at me for the first time.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.640
He speaks and he says, "Good job.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.880
Good job."

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.180
And I said thanks.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.790
And he said, "You know, a couple

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.230
of times there I almost
laughed out loud."

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.660
And his wife leans over
and she's like, "Oh,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.250
that's really a high compliment.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.410
He never laughs out loud."

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.200
And so I was like, "Maybe
this is a special occasion."

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.500
Like we should commemorate this.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.800
This is pretty weird, right?

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.610
So I'm like, "So do you want to
like take a selfie or something?"

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.910
And he's like, "No.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.490
Why would I do that?"

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.790
And he went "Bye."

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.170
And then he walks away, and that
was -- I never even got his name.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.430
So be careful what you wish for.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.550
Finally the only other
story I want to tell you

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.400
about before I start talking
about the book is something

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.170
that I never daydreamed about
that I discovered recently.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.520
There is right now for sale

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.800
on Amazon an ebook called
"Summary of the Nix."

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.100
I don't know if you know.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.100
Like when I was in high school
it was called Cliff's Notes.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.870
I think they're called Spark Notes
now, but I discovered this recently

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.780
that somebody had done
this to "The Nix."

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.150
Somebody had written a 44
page summary of "The Nix."

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.140
And I'm like, "It's not
like my book is being

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.170
like assigned to high schoolers."

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.120
Like why would anybody
buy a summary of the book?

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.400
And there are user reviews.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.700
There are comments.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.210
And I'm going to read you a couple.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.440
"This summary of the
Nix was well written.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.520
I could read the summary
again and again rather

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.820
than the whole novel itself."

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:24.120
"I sometimes have a difficult
time finishing a book

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.090
because I can't read
it all at one sitting.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.450
With this summary, I
don't have that problem."

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.600
"This summary makes it
possible for the reader

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.070
to have a cocktail
party talk recognition

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.050
of all the ideas presented
by a new author."

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.070
And that was the one when I
knew I'd made it, you know.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.700 position:56%
When like people, like strangers, at
cocktail parties feel like they need

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.920
to have read my book, but
don't actually want to read it.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.520
That made me feel really special.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.410
Anyway, thank you everybody
for coming.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.900
Thank you, Carlos, for the
really wonderful introduction.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.290
I always feel bad for people
who have to introduce me

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.390
because then they have the burden
of describing what the book is

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.220
about which it turns out
is kind of a challenge.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.160
I had to do this for the
first time last summer

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.000
at the BookExpo American
conference which was the beginning

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.210
of the whole kind of
run up to publication.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.760
I'd never really thought
about it before.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.170
You'd think that I wrote
the thing so I would be able

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.410
to describe it well, but that
is totally not true at all.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.860
I was actually scolded by
a member of the sales team

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.160
for being so bad at this.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.190
I was at a restaurant
and she said, "All right.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.490
Pitch me your book.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.790
What's your book about?

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.090
Pretend I'm a stranger.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.390
What's the book about?"

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.690
And I was like, "Oh, all right.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.280
Well, it's a -- It's sort of like
political protest and video games,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.890
but it's not really
about video games,

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.830
and it's also there's some
academic satire in there

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.880
and there's a mother son story.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.930
And the first half of the
book is sort of about the son,

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.960
but the second half of the
book is sort of about the mom.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.570
And if I guess I had to sum
it up, I'd guess it's kind

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.640
of just about life, you know."

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.820
And this woman whose job it is to
be good at this, she looks at me

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.440
with these like daggers of living
hatred and she's like, "No.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.740
Try again."

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.500
You know? This is not something
they teach you about in school.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.670
They teach you how to maybe write a
book, but they don't teach you how

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.220
to talk about the book
without being a total bore.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.040
So it's difficult describing
this book.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.250
My hometown newspaper
called it just, quote,

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.690
the "Book about everything."

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.440
And left it at that.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.690
My favorite quote came from
"Entertainment Weekly."

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.430
And this is how they put it.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.960
"If any novel defied an elevator
pitch in 2016, it was 'The Nix.'

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.660
As a critique of millennial
entitlement, video game addiction,

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.920
and clueless academia, tender
meditation on childhood friendship,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.800
first loves, and maternal
abandonment, handy tutorial

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.490
on '60s radicalism and
Norwegian ghost mythology,

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.810
Nathan Hill's overstuffed debut
contains multitudes and then some."

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.630
Which I'd say that
was pretty accurate.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.610
The truth is I didn't know I
was supposed to write a book

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.100 position:56%
that could be neatly summarized or
elevator pitched when I was writing.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.730
All I wanted to do was write
a book that felt to me true,

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.950
that felt like it accurately
represented what the world felt

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.150
like on my nerve endings.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.730
Now I'm not a writer who
creates an elaborate plot

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.830
or an outline and hammers
away at it.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.360
For me it's much more about
creating a certain feeling,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.790
a certain emotional timber.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.650
And the plot usually
comes as a result of that.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.950
When I sit down to write

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.800
in the morning I don't quite know
what's going to happen that day,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.190
but I know how I want it to feel.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.330
And that's a starting place.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.850
So I end up constructing my plots
just a little bit at a time,

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.330
going where the emotion
is and having no real idea

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.900
where I'm going to end up.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.820
There's this quote from
E.L. Doctorow that I love

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.460
about this kind of writing.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.010
He says that writing a novel
is like driving a car at night.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.220
You can only see as
far as your headlights,

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.820
but you can make the
whole trip that way.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.160
And that's what writing
"The Nix" felt like.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.080
That I can only see
so far in front of me,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.980
and a lot of times you're
kind of operating on your gut.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.590
You have an impulse to add
something, and then you try it out,

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.100
and then sometimes it
feels right and it stays.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.110
So I wanted to tell you a
few stories about how some

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.600 position:56%
of the major subjects covered in
the novel got there, and want to try

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.560
to answer a question that I've
been getting a lot in the last year

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.640
which is, "Why did you write
a book about so many things?"

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.040
So the primary topic
of the book is protest.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.750
The novel covers two or maybe even
three generations of protesters.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:44.390
You have the protest of the 2004
Republican National Convention

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.580
in Manhattan, the 1968 protest of
the Democratic National Convention

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.150
in Chicago, and there's a
little Occupy Wall Street

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.700
in there in one chapter.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.810
This all happened because I
started writing this book in 2006.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.860
I'd just finished school and
I was moving to New York City.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.160
And now this was something
I'd wanted to do

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.040
for a very, very long time.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.680
I was a kid who grew up in the
Midwest with like big dreams

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.890
of like going to New York city
and becoming like I don't know,

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.190
like Truman Capote or something.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.850
You know? Like I wanted
to get invited to the cool

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.890 position:56%
"Paris Review" parties and so forth.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.360
And so this was where I was going
to end up for most of my life.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.660
I kind of knew this.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.040 position:56%
I even -- I grew up in the Midwest,
and started rooting for the Yankees.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.610
Like that's how committed I was.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.200
Yeah. I know.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:36.150
I know. And so I finally
moved to New York in 2006.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.660
I was like 26 or so.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.180
And it felt like a kind of
dream come true, you know.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.600
It was what I'd been waiting to
do for a very, very long time.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.850
And my first month
in the city I lived

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.350
in a sublet while I was looking
for a more permanent apartment.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.450
I rented this one month
sublet in Queens.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.320
And it was -- I was like sharing
a house with 12 other guys

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.990
who all worked in the same
road construction crew.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.290
And they would come home at the
end of their shifts and like change

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.240
in to their underwear and eat hot
dogs and just play enormous amounts

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.790
of "Call of Duty" in the living
room like for the rest of the day.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.180
This was life, you know.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.420
The guy I was renting the room from
turns out was like this fanatic

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.750
for B horror movies, and so like
every square inch of the wall

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.740 position:56%
in his bedroom was covered with like
pictures of people like screaming

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.110
or bleeding or both, you know.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.440
So it was weird place to live
my first month in the city.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.330
And so I didn't spend
much time there.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.760
I was kind of out and about in the
city seeing what was happening.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.650 position:56%
And one of the things that
happened my first month in the city,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:41.800
this was August 2004,
sorry, August 2004,

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.270 position:56%
was that the republican presidential
nominated convention was being held

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.570
in Madison Square Garden.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.800
And this was of course
Bush/Cheney second term,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.450
and the war in Iraq was ongoing.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.780
And so a lot of people were
coming in to town to protest,

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.970
and so I thought this was going to
be a really uniquely New York thing

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.910
to watch so I will go see it.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.210
And I did.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.750
Anyway, fast forward to
the end of the month.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.860
I have found a new apartment,
but there's this awkward day

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.710
where I have to be out of my sublet
in the morning, but I can't move

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.240
in to my new apartment
until the evening.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.680
So I put everything in my car.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.980
I go to work.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.540 position:56%
I come back, ready to move in to my
new apartment, and the car is empty.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.840
Like everything's gone.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.550
So all of my books,
all of my clothes,

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.750
and most importantly the computer

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.640
on which I had stored everything I
had written in my graduate program.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.010
Like three years of
writing, a book in progress,

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.330
all of it was just
gone all of a sudden.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.680
And you ask me, "Did
you back it up?"

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.980
And I would say, "Yes.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.660
I back it up on CDs that were
stored stupidly right next

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.960
to the computer."

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.260
So they were stolen too.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.850
As a side note to this story, I
then sent out hundreds of fliers

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.150
to the area pawn shops saying like,
"If you see this computer, call me.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.540
I will buy it, no questions asked."

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.750 position:56%
And like a day later I got a phone
call from a guy who ran a pawn shop.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.650
He's like, "Are you the
guy with the computer?"

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.950
I said, "Yes."

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.250
My heart was singing, "Yes.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.550
I'm the guy with the computer."

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.850
He says, "Yeah.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.150
You're never going
to see that again."

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.860
I was like, "Why?"

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.160
He's like, "It's too old.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.460
Nobody would buy it.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.760
Check the dumpsters."

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.060
I'm like, "Oh, god."

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.860
You know? So it was like just
twisting it a little bit.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.040
And so I had no writing.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.390
I had nothing.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.040
So I had to start over.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.580
And so I kind of couldn't bear it.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.110
It was just too heartbreaking to
like continue working on the thing

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.410
that I'd already been working on.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.450
It was just too filled with
negative emotion for me

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.010
to like be -- to work on it.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.640
So I was like, "I'm just
going to start something new."

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.780
And so I decided to write about
the thing that was most interesting

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.820
that I'd seen recently
which was the protest

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.150
at the republican nominating
convention.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.620
And I didn't know it at
the time, but that ended

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.470
up being the first words
I wrote for "The Nix."

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.420
It was about these protests.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.720
And one of the things
that one of the --

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.710
Like the talking head cable news
type folks were saying at the time,

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:58.300
they were asking if the protests in
2004 were going to get as violent

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.540
as the protests in Chicago in 1968.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.130
And I was really dumb.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.740
I was like, "What happened
in Chicago in 1968?"

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.040
I had no idea.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.340
I'd lived in Chicago.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.410
I spent lots of time there.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.710
I had no idea what had happened.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.010
I was very naive.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.190
So I looked it up, and I saw that
there was this amazing history

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.080
that I was completely unaware of.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.170
And the more I looked in to it,
comparing these two protests,

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:27.750
'68 and 2004, the more it just
something about it hooked me.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.960
I realized that I was
looking at something

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.370
that felt sort of familiar.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:36.460
One journalist in 1968 in Chicago
described it as the tectonic plates

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.750
in American political life grinding

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.930
against each other
on Michigan Avenue.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.090
And in some ways that felt like
-- That felt very familiar.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:48.170
Even in 2004, it felt like the
world was getting much more --

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.480
The political life of the country
was getting much more polarized.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.130
I noticed that conversations
between people in different ends

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.900
of the political spectrum
were getting more strained

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.200
and more strained.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.580
And so it felt relevant.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.780
I didn't know quite what
I wanted to say about it.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.810
I didn't know quite how
it would turn into a plot,

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.450
but it felt like it burned
for me for some reason.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.820
And there -- Two studies
came out recently.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.770
I didn't know this at the
time, but two studies came

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.510
out recently about
this very subject.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.670
And in one there's a
survey done in 1960

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.850
that asked American adults
whether it would disturb them

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.060
if their child married a member
of the other political party,

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.350
if it would disturb them.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.490
And in 1960 no more than 5%
said yes in either party.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.290
In 2010 they asked that question.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:39.680
That question was asked again, and
this time 33% of democrats and 40%

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.440
of republicans said yes,
it would disturb them

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.130
if their child married someone
from the other political party.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.900
And that was a bigger
number than nationality,

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.230
than religion, than race.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:56.510
That partyism ended up being kind
of the line that people drew.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:01.710
And a more recent study showed
that they've been doing a survey

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.810
of college freshmen every
year for many, many years,

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.580
and one of the questions
they asked is about,

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.600
you know, their political views.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.700
And this year's incoming
freshman class is --

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.790
shows the fewest number
of political moderates

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.170
that we've seen since 1968.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.600
So every time I would kind
of look in to this more,

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.120
it just felt like there
were certain symmetries

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.140
between the political
moment I was living

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.230
through from 2004 to
the present and 1968.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.530
It just felt important to me.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:32.830
So I put it in to the book.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.570
I didn't know quite what
was going to happen with it,

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.170
but I put it in to the book.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.120
The other thing on a separate like
parallel track from all of this,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.470
I started playing video games.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.860
You would think that those
wouldn't relate at all,

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.580 position:56%
but after all of my stuff was stolen
in New York and I was quite sad,

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.070
and things weren't quite
going very well at the time,

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.450
I was doing very little writing.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.770
I was sort of broke.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.660
I was working at a
nonprofit poetry organization.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.550
So you can imagine what
my salary was, you know.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.360
And so a friend of
mine, he called me.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.550
He says, "I want you
to buy this video game.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:13.850
We're going to play it together."

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.150
And I said, "What's the game?"

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.180
He said, "It's called
'World of Warcraft.'"

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.480
And I was like, "What's that?"

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.780
I'd never heard of it.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.080
He's like, "Just trust me.

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.380
Just buy it."

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.680
So I'm like, "Okay."

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.980
So I bought it.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.280
And we played, and he has since
told me that the only reason he did

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.580 position:56%
that was because you can chat with
the other person that you're playing

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.880 position:56%
with other -- You know, on the game.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.180
And so he just wanted
to keep an eye on me.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.480
He's a very good friend.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.780
He's very sweet.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.080
He just wanted to make
sure I was okay.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.040
So we played the game every
night, and we would talk.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.760
And this went on for about six

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.350
to eight months before he
finally got sick of it.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.650
He's like, "No.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.950
I can't play this anymore."

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.680
And so he quit, but
I just kept going.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.340
Like I had never really been
a gamer before in my life.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.640
Like I donated one summer when
I was maybe in fourth grade

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.940
to beating "The Legend of Zelda."

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.870
And other than that I've
never really played.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.700
But I played just the crap
out of "World of Warcraft."

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.800 position:56%
And if you don't know anything about
it, it's really embarrassing for me

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.800
to talk about it now, but if you
don't know anything about it,

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.480
it's like imagine like "Lord of
the Rings," you know, like elves

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.540
and dragons and that kind of
stuff, but with like millions

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.000
of people playing simultaneously.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.270
And I played it so much that
even after I left New York

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.070 position:56%
after a couple years I kept playing,

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.490
and I would like cancel social
engagements because I had

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.470
to go raid with my guild, you know.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:30.850
And I got really good at
it, really good at it.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.020
And it's a complicated game,
and when you get really good

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.840
at it you feel good about that.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.590
And I don't think I would
describe it at the time this way,

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:44.510
but now I do which is that it was
in some ways emotionally analgesic.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.940
It was kind of it was
my painkiller, you know.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.320 position:56%
Like nothing else was going very
well, but at least I could come home

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.180
at the end of the day and fire
up this thing and get on board

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.620
with a bunch of other people
who we all respected each other

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.920
for being good at this thing.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.710
And it was really important
to be good at this thing

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.630
when everything else
was going poorly.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.310
And it was also an effective
distraction from kind

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.610
of the real world for
a little while.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.410
But then fast forward
three or four years

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.930
and I realized I absolutely
could not be distracted

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.050
from the real world anymore,
spending way too much time

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.100
in this digital world, and so I
had to abandon it and I quit kind

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.020
of cold turkey and
haven't played since.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.860
But there's something
about it, about that kind

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.160
of love/hate relationship
I had with the game.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.960
I appreciated how it helped me get
through a dark time in my life,

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.550
but at the same time I really like
resented that it took so much time.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.130
And also I had to like admit to
my friends I was doing something

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.680
that 12 year olds also do.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.680
You know? So -- And so this kind

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.590
of love/hate ambivalent thing,
I felt like it was good.

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.590
It was good fodder
to treat in fiction.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.990
I'd never seen fiction do
this to a video game before.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.500
So I'm like, "Well, why not try?"

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.320
So I threw it in to the book.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.590
I didn't know how it
would be relevant,

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.440
but I put it in to the
book and I was like, "Well,

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.390
let's see if I can
connect this in some way."

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.560
At the same time, I leave New York.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.860
I move to Florida.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.080
I live in Naples, Florida which is
this cozy little beach community

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.380
on the Gulf of Mexico.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.680
And I went there to teach.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.350
I got a job teaching at
Florida Gulf Coast University.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.240
And so for a long time -- I
did this for about 10 years.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.220
For a long time I thought of myself
more as a teacher than a writer.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.870
And I would -- You know, I kind
of threw myself in to teaching,

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.980
and I kept on having these
experiences with students

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.920
that were really shocking to me.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.020
A good -- I'll tell
you two quick stories.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.510
The first one was my
first semester teaching,

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.670
and I taught first year writing
classes, composition one.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.790
And I go in to my first class
to teach and there's 25 students

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.440
in the room, and I teach
my class and I go home.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.000
And I come back like two days
later for the second class

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.880
and of the 25 students,
21 still remain.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.180
And this happens.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.910
Like they shop around and
like take, you know --

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:52.930
drop and add and so forth.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.560
And so of the four people
who dropped the class,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.130
three of them eventually
their names fell off

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.890
of my online roll,
but one name stayed.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.150
And I kept on waiting
for this name to leave.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.410
I kept on waiting for her to drop
the class, and she just never did.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.480
Eventually I just kind
of forgot about it.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.550
And I taught my class, and
it's the end of the semester.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.530
It's the last class
before finals week.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.450
And I walk in to teach and
there's this new person

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:19.750
in the back of the room.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.050
I was like, "Hi.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.350
Who are you?"

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.650
And she says this name.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.150
It's the name from the roll.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:30.540
And she hasn't been there since day
one, and I'm like, "Welcome back."

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.520
You know? And I teach my class
and she comes up to me at the end

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:39.460
of class and she says, and this
is a quote, I swear to God.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.270
She says, "So I think I've fallen
a little behind in your class.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:51.230
What extra credit can I
do to get a good grade?"

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:55.030
Not to pass, but to
like get a good grade.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.050
I was like, "There's
not enough extra credit.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.300
Like you've missed
literally the entire semester.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.650
Like you've missed every
single assignment."

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.050
And she's like, "Seriously?"

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.350 position:56%
And she was really upset about this.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.650
She's like, "You're
going to fail me?"

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.750
And I'm like, "Well, it's
not -- It wasn't my choice.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.500
Like you just didn't
do any of the work."

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.200
And she's like, you know -- I
told her that the school had this

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.100
like really generous thing, policy,

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.510
like she just retakes
the class next semester

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:23.280
and whatever grade she
gets will replace the F.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.720
And so it will not even be
on her transcript or her GPA.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.020
No problem.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.320
She's like she wasn't
satisfied with that,

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.790
and kind of leaves really angry.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:36.580
And then like on a hunch like two
days later I check this website,

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.310
ratemyprofessors.com.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.860
I don't know if you
know this website.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.510
It's like Yelp for teachers.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.080
It's terrible.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.710
And sure enough there was a brand
new review of me posted anonymously

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.040
that said, "I asked this guy for
help and he refused to help me.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.340
He's a jackass."

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.640
Like, oh, okay.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.940
Welcome to teaching.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.630
And the other story that kind
of -- that was sort of typical.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.110
I had a student who
turned in a paper.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.470
I discovered very quickly
that it was plagiarized.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.660
It was like all copied and
pasted from this website.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.290
And so I asked her to come to my
office, and she came to my office.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.590
And I was like, "Listen.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.960 position:56%
Like this paper -- Here's your paper

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.260
and here's the website
where it came from.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.600
Can you please explain this?"

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.100
And she looked at me and
she's like, "I don't know.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.400
It's weird."

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:27.250
[ Laughter ]

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.660
I said, "What do you mean weird?"

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.300
She's like, "I don't know.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.900
It's just weird."

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.820
I'm like, "Is it like
-- Is it a coincidence?

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.410
Like did you accidentally type
exactly what was on this website?"

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.710
She's like, "I don't know.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:46.410
It's just weird, and
my dad's a lawyer."

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.710
Right. So yeah.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.770
I -- And so I kept on having
these kinds of experiences.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:52.150
I kept on -- And just
I couldn't figure

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.310
out like what is going
on with my students.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:57.160
And I should say like most college
students are, you know, wonderful,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.730 position:56%
hard working people, but I had
enough of these types of experiences

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.330 position:56%
and my colleagues in the
profession had enough of these types

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.380
of experiences that
it felt like a trend.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.040
It felt like something
weird was going on.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.460
And I couldn't quite figure it out.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.670
And so I started writing about
it because again I tend to like

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.030
to write about something
that I'm confused about.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:21.720
And so this character appeared in
the novel one day, Laura Pottsdam,

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.570
if you've read the book, and
she became the embodiment

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:25.870
of all of these students.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.500
And then like you do -- Almost
like you do in real life,

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.830
you know, you meet someone.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.130 position:56%
You have a first impression of them.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.320
And then you interrogate that
first impression over and over

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.000
and over again as you
get to know them.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.710 position:56%
And as I got to know Laura, as I got
to know my own real life students,

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.210
I began to realize what was maybe
going on which is that they --

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.460
They came to college in
a different environment

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.760
than I came to college in.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.890
You know, they grew
up during a recession.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.970
They grew up during
tight times, you know.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.670
And they had been given
advice by, you know,

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.500
people that were well
meaning and loved them,

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.350 position:56%
but maybe bad advice about, you
know, the purpose of college is just

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.650
to secure yourself a job.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:06.960
It's a tight, you know,
brutal economy.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.740
And so you don't have time for
things like writing and poetry.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.750 position:56%
Like go out and get something that's
just job training for something

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.330
that will pay you well
because it's a global economy

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.320
and you don't want
to be left behind.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.830
And so they kind of came
to college thinking, "Okay.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.110
I just need to get this slip
of paper and get out of here.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.410
I need to get that credential."

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:27.650 position:56%
And then they would meet people like
me who believe in like antique ideas

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.130
like a well rounded education.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:32.640
You know? And we're just like
two discursive ships passing

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.940
in the night.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.920
And so these kinds of interactions
seem sort of inevitable.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.760
I know that they felt enormous
pressure to do well in college.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.060
I know when I was in college
I just didn't work very hard

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.710
for a semester, and I
might get a C in a class.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.690
I would just kind of take
it on the chin and move on.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:48.990
You know, okay.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.290
No big deal.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.160
Pretty confident that I would
get a job when I graduated.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.330
My students had no
such feeling, you know.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.430
They could not get a C. Whether
it was between getting a C

00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.960
or getting an A and cheating,

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.300
getting an A and cheating
was better.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.750
You know? And they would
do it all the time.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.600
And they were not guaranteed
a job out of college.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.880 position:56%
Most of them were just hoping for an
unpaid internship for a couple years

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.000
to try to get the experience
to get an actual job.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.560 position:56%
So it's a very, very different time.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.110
And so my own, I don't
know -- It was --

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:22.750
Part of the problem was my own
kind of lack of empathy for them.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.790
And hopefully that
shows up in Laura too.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.190
So yeah. So I put it in the book.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.840
I didn't know how it
connected to everything else,

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.140
but I put it in the book.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.700
And the last thing I'll
talk about is the theme,

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.530
the kind of big primary theme of
the book, is maternal abandonment.

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.300
The main character, Faye, leaves
the other main character, Samuel,

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.260
her son, when he's 11 years old.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.930
And he doesn't see her
again for about 20 years.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.410
And this has led many, many people
to ask me about my own mother.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.290
Like imagine like explaining
to like a reporter from the

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.690
"New York Times" like, "No.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.040
My mom did not -- "
I've probably gone

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.610
on too long before mentioning this.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.830
My mom has almost contractually
made me

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.990
at every public event
tell everybody, "No.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.940
My mom has never abandoned
the family.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.320
She's never abandoned anyone.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.560
She's a very sweet,
loving, wonderful person

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.860
who likes the book a lot."

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:16.870
But she didn't know what I was
working on for the longest time.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:20.290
And finally when the book
was bought, she's like,

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.590
"So what's your book about?"

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:26.760
And I said, "Um, well,
it's about a bad mother."

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.510
And there's this like
long pause on the phone.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.870
She sighed.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:34.890
She's like, "You know what
people are going to think."

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.490
I'm like, "I'm sorry."

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:39.030
So yeah. No.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.330
My mom's wonderful.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:45.380 position:56%
But I was never abandoned, but
growing up we did move around a lot.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.590
My dad was in retail.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:52.970 position:56%
And he took every promotion that was
offered to him from the, you know,

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.550
sales floor in sporting
goods to the sales floor

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.270
in some other department to,
you know, then assistant manager

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.410
to manager to regional manager.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:04.390 position:56%
Every opportunity that came along,
he said yes to because he was trying

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:08.260
to build a career to send
three kids to college.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.540
But every one of these --
Every one of these moves --

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.540
Every one of these
promotions involved a move.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.600
And so we moved around in Iowa
several times, moved to Illinois,

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.930 position:56%
to Missouri, to Oklahoma, to Kansas,
and that was all before ninth grade.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.290
So every two years I would
be the new kid in school.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:26.110
And if you've ever been the new
kid in school you know how brutal

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.100
that can be, how kind of
isolating and lonely that can feel.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.520
So that's what I gave to
Samuel, the abandoned kid.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.620
Like this kind of sense of
isolation and loneliness, you know,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.800
that I felt in those moments.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.560
So then, you know, so you
have all these things in play.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.230
And you're like, "Well,
how do they all connect?"

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:44.470
And I realized maybe six or
seven years in to the process --

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:48.280
I realized that they all
connected because they're all ways

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.570
where first people have sort
of walled themselves off

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.670
in their own world, and second,

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.280
ways in which people have lost
the ability to communicate

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.730
with people outside of that world.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.790
So it's -- I think this is
true for people who are --

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:04.090
certain people who are totally
committed to political ideologies,

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:08.840
to gamers, to people obsessed
with their social image status,

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.160
to people obsessed with
their devices or even people

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.330
in relationships who for one
reason or another grow apart,

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.790
stop communicating, and suddenly
seem like strangers to each other.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.830
So I realized that this was a
novel actually about isolation,

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.360
about disconnection,
about living in a bubble

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.220
of your own mind's creation.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.340
So I realized this wasn't
actually a protest novel,

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.460
but rather the protest stuff
was just a kind of backdrop

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.820
for what was actually
happening with my characters.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.190
That it was more like a
baseline instead of the melody.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.720
And that's why revision is
so important because then

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.320
after nine years of doing this I
got to go back and make it seem

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.810
like I intended to
do that all along.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.480
And so the neat thing that
happens is about -- This --

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.340
You know, this far in to the
process suddenly you begin

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.640
to understand what you're doing.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.560
And you get to be intentional where
before you were maybe instinctive.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.530
So if this is a novel about our
inability to see each other,

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:05.930
listen to each other,
how do I capture

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:07.980
that on a smaller scale,
on a human scale?

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.080
It would be pretty boring if I
just wrote about kind of democrats

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.380
and republicans fighting.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.040
How can I make that personal?

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.550
So I wanted just to read you
the prologue from the novel.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:21.110
With these ideas in mind about
how people can kind of grow

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:24.370
to live inside their own heads,
their own private worlds,

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.320
and how even people who live
together can be total mysteries

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.850
to each other.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.820
"If Samuel had known
his mother was leaving,

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.700
he might have paid more attention.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.890
He might have listened
more carefully to her,

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:42.170
observed her more closely, written
certain crucial things down.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.920
Maybe he could have
acted differently,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.010
spoken differently,
been a different person.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.660
Maybe he could have been a
child worth sticking around for.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.000
But Samuel did not know
his mother was leaving.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.210
He did not know she had been
leaving for many months now,

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.800
in secret, and in pieces.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.390
She had been removing items
from the house one by one.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:04.500
A single dress from her closet.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.640
Then a lone photo from the album.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.800
A fork from the silverware drawer.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.810
A quilt from under the bed.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:14.010
Every week she took something new.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.310
A sweater.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.610
A pair of shoes.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:17.970
A Christmas ornament.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:22.390
A book. Slowly her presence
in the house grew thinner.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.000
She'd been at it almost a year
when Samuel and his father began

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.430
to sense something, a sort
of instability, a puzzling

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:32.660
and disturbing, and sometimes even
sinister feeling of depletion.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.100
It struck them at odd moments.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.580
They looked at the
bookshelf and thought,

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:38.640 position:56%
'Don't we own more books than that?'

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.940
They walked by the china cabinet

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.520
and felt sure something
was missing, but what?

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.370
They could not give it
a name, this impression

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.410
that life's details
were being reorganized.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.810
They didn't understand that the
reason they were no longer eating

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:53.160
Crock-Pot meals was that
the Crock-Pot was no longer

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.720
in the house.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.090
If the bookshelf seemed bare,

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.000
it was because she had
pruned it of its poetry.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.240 position:56%
If the china cabinet seemed a little
vacant, it was because two plates,

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.010
two bowls, and a teapot had
been lifted from the collection.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:10.700
They were being burglarized
at a very slow pace.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.590
'Didn't there used to be
more photos on that wall?'

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.850
Samuel's father said, standing at
the foot of the stairs, squinting.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.230
'Didn't we have that picture
from the Grand Canyon up there?'

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.620
'No,' Samuel's mother said.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.980
'We put that picture away.'

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.080
'We did? I don't remember that.'

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.700
'It was your decision.'

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.640
'It was?' he said, befuddled.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.690
He thought he was losing his mind.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:36.800
Years later in a high school
biology class Samuel heard a story

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.130
about a certain kind of African
turtle that swam across the ocean

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.970
to lay its eggs in South America.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:45.380
Scientists could find no
reason for the enormous trip.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.270
Why did the turtles do it?

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.990
The leading theory was that
they began doing it eons ago

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:53.720
when South America and Africa
were still locked together.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.120
Back then only a river might
have separated the continents,

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.540
and the turtles lay their
eggs on the river's far bank.

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.820
But then the continents
began drifting apart,

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.000
and the river widened by
about an inch per year

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.980
which would have been
invisible to the turtles.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.190
So they kept going to the same
spot, the far bank of the river,

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:13.210
each generation swimming a tiny
bit farther than the last one.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.550
And after 100 million years of
this the river had become an ocean,

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.960
and yet the turtles never noticed.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:24.050
This, Samuel decided, was the
manner of his mother's departure.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.950
This was how she moved away.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.250
Imperceptibly.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.320
Slowly. Bit by bit.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.600
She whittled down her life
until the only thing left

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.120
to remove was herself.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:39.200 position:56%
On the day she disappeared, she left
the house with a single suitcase."

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.500
Thank you so much.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:50.210
[ Applause ]

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.510
Thank you very much.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.640
I would be happy to answer any --

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.260
I think we might have
about 10 minutes to go.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.850
I would be happy to answer any
questions that anybody has.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.000
I think there are two mics,
one there and one there,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.180
if you have something
you want to talk about.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Hi.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.580
&gt;&gt; Nathan Hill: Hi there.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I loved your book.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.400
I think I read it in one night.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.700
&gt;&gt; Nathan Hill: Wow.

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It was that good.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.300
&gt;&gt; Nathan Hill: It's a long book.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I know.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.420
And I just want to ask if you
have any connection to Norway

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.160
and why the Norwegian folk stories.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.460
&gt;&gt; Nathan Hill: Yeah.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.760
Thank you.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.760
The nix of the title is a
story from Norwegian folklore.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.870
A nix also has many different
names, depending on where you are.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:37.270
It's called a nix or a [inaudible]
or a neck or [inaudible] but yeah.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:43.320
It comes from Norwegian folklore,
and my mother's family came here

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.580 position:56%
from Norway several generations ago.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.490
They moved first to a
small town in Minnesota,

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:54.820 position:56%
and then after a time moved to
eastern Iowa, to a town on the banks

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.120
of the Mississippi river.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.720
And that's where most of
my family still lives.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:04.140 position:56%
Farmers. And we didn't know anything
about the family back in Norway,

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.230
like it all got -- As soon
as I think it was my great,

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.770
great grandfather came
over, all ties were severed.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:16.330 position:56%
But my mom remembers her grandmother
saying that he came from Hammerfest

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.200
which didn't mean anything to
me until I finally Googled it

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.010
and found it was the
northernmost city in the world.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.890
I'm just like, "That's amazing."

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:31.090
You know? And no wonder he found
Minnesota familiar, you know.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:38.090
And so when I started writing in
"The Nix" I had this character,

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:41.600
Faye's father, who
immigrates from Norway.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.680
And it was sort of
an opportunity for me

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.760 position:56%
to give myself a family history that
I didn't know, that we don't know.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.260
To fill in some blanks,
I guess I should say.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.700
And so, you know, Hammerfest
has this extraordinary history.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.580
Especially what happened to it
after World War II is just amazing.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:02.080
And so I decided to kind of
use a lot of that information.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.040
And of course the folktales that
have always kind of stuck with me

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.930
because I know they're
part of my own history.

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:09.340
Thank you.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.640
Hi there.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Hi.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.240
I also really enjoyed your book.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.540
And one of the many
things that struck me

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.790
about it was you had this one
chapter where there's kind

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:18.530
of a regular sentence,
and then the rest

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.470
of the chapter is all one sentence.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.700
And, believe it or not, you know,
it really it works beautifully.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.000
But I'm curious about that.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.630
I'm curious like was it
always like that one sentence

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.140
or were you showing off or were you
ever accused of showing off or --

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.440
&gt;&gt; Nathan Hill: Oh, yeah.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's
an amazing sentence.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:36.190
&gt;&gt; Nathan Hill: Yeah.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.490
Look what I can do.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:38.790
Yeah. No. Thanks.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.710
I'm glad it worked.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.590
I -- So yeah.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:45.870
It's a chapter late in the book and
there's a character in the book.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.170
You never know his real name.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:52.050 position:56%
You only know his avatar's name, his
video game avatar, which is Pwnage.

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.080
And Pwnage is hopelessly recklessly
addicted to this video game called

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.650
"World of Elfscape" which is
really just "World of Warcraft,"

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.730
but I didn't want to be
beholden to Warcraft fans

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.900
who are very knowledgeable
on this subject.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.820
So I made up my own video game.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:10.730 position:56%
And for certain reasons he's decided
he needs to quit this video game,

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:15.340 position:56%
but like I was talking about
earlier, you know, like in some ways

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.430
when you're really in to these
games there's a sense of --

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:23.210
Your sense of, what, self esteem,
your sense of meaning in the world,

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:27.710
can be constructed or maybe I
should say fulfilled by a game.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:30.870
And so he's a guy whose
relationship is in shambles,

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.510
whose job is in shambles.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.540
Nothing is going right for him
except being an epic player

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.640
at this game, and then I'm
like, "What is going to happen

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.990
when he decides to
give up his one outlet

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.910
for like meaning and creativity?"

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:45.170
And so yeah.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:49.100
I was writing it and I
was writing in a notebook,

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.840
and the first sentence
for this chapter is,

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.640
"Today was the day he was
going to give up video games."

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.940
And then I started listing

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.240
when I was writing it,
like the first draft.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.540
I'd do everything handwritten.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.930
I was just doing a list,
like kind of bullets.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.040
And I just tried to think
of every excuse in the book

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.550
as to why he could not
possibly give up video games.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.520
Every excuse that he
would give himself,

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.650
every way to justify this behavior.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:13.100
And I was reading it to my wife,

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.870
and it was in no syntactic
order or anything.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.170
It was just a list.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:21.490
And eventually she was like,
"Is this all one sentence?"

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:22.790
I was like, "No.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.090
It's a list."

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.070
But that kind of stuck
with me, and I'm like,

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.960
"Maybe I could do it
as one sentence."

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.230
And I got to thinking
like, "Oh, my god.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.930
Like if there's a way
I could embody this --

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:36.900
his sense of the world coming --
kind of closing down around him,

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.870
his sense of claustrophobia,
his sense of terror at what he's

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:43.880
about to do, maybe if -- I
could do that syntactically."

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.430
And just make this huge
edifice of a sentence,

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:50.690
this 10 page sentence,
grammatically correct.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:52.260
This 10 page sentence.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.390
And maybe the reader would
feel the kind of anxiety

00:38:56.390 --> 00:39:00.690
that my character was feeling.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.160
So I thought there
was an emotional kind

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.760 position:56%
of character driven reason to do it.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.160
So I did it.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.880
And that's when I needed
for the first time ever

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.480
in my writing career a spreadsheet
because I had to like figure out --

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.290
Like I was nesting clauses within
clauses within clauses to try

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.700
to make all of this work out.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.420
And so yeah.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:22.840
It took a long time
to do it, but yeah.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.830
And I was certain that an editor or
publisher would want me to cut it.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:32.000
But then my editor said it was
actually his favorite chapter

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.300
in the book.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.920
He called it the guitar solo
from "Bohemian Rhapsody."

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.490
I was like, "Awesome.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.790
All right."

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.090
Thank you.

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.390
Thank you.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.880
I think we have time for one more.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Hi.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.530
So a lot of your characters seem to
have an undiagnosed social anxiety,

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.570
and I guess I don't
really have a question.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:52.870
What does that mean to you?

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.780
Why are so many of your
characters so anxious

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.080
about being around other people?

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nathan Hill: You don't know this.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.920
This is all terrifying
me right now [laughs].

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.730
No. Like I was talking about
earlier, like when you realize

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:08.800
that you're writing a book about
isolation, about disconnection,

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.290
you start looking for
ways to do that.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:15.950
And, you know, I don't have any
kind of social anxiety disorder,

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:17.250
but I'm nervous around new people.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.550
I want to make a good impression.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.070
And I'm an introvert, and so like
you kind of use those things.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:24.980 position:56%
You know? And kind of push them a
little bit, or a lot, in some cases.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.010
Right? So yeah.

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:31.740
I guess you take the parts of
yourself, especially the moments

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.840
when you felt this the
most, like when I'm trying

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.020
to impress someone who's
really important, you know.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.460
I don't know.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:41.360
A woman that I'm interested
in or a -- I don't know.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.620
A boss that I want a
job from or something.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.640
You know? You take how weird
you feel in those moments,

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.470
and then you just -- And
then you kind of wrap

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:50.770
that around the character.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.350
What if that character felt
that emotion all the time?

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:58.690
You know? I thought it was just
a way to kind of amp up the theme

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:01.000
of the book, this sense
of like growing isolation,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.300
this growing disconnection.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.720
And I was hoping that with the
video games and the social anxiety

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.200
and the cell phones
and the politics,

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.990
all of these things would kind of
[inaudible] together into a book

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.180
that hopefully kind of made sense.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.300
And even though these things aren't
kind of logically tied together,

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.650
they're emotionally tied together.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.550
And so you would feel
this thing coming at you

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.380
from various different vectors.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.680
Thank you.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.980
Thank you so much, everybody.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.380
It's been a pleasure.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.680
Thank you.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.510
Thank you so much.
