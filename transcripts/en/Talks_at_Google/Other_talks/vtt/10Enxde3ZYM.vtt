MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.640
And welcome to another
Filmmakers@Google talk.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.230
And today we're in

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.750
conversation with Bill Guttentag.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.560
And so he's here today talking
about his latest film, which

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.010
is "Knife Fight." It chronicles
the modern-day

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.350
realities of behind "Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington." So it's

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.505
really how the sausage is made
in the modern world.

00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:28.620
It stars Rob Lowe, Jamie Chung,
and Carrie-Anne Moss.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.260
And it tracks the complex
weavings and dealings of a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.210
political consultant in the
great American adventure, the

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.980
general election
from last year.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.530
Now, Bill Guttentag is the
Oscar winning feature

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.120
documentary and feature
filmmaker.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.090
He's written, produced, and
directed many films that made

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.320
their way up to Sundance,
as this one

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.630
has, if I'm not mistaken.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.240
BILL GUTTENTAG: This premiered
at Tribeca.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.600
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, Tribeca.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.430
So we balance out the coasts
this time around.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.370
So our program today follows a
screening of the film that we

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.340
had yesterday.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.600
And so now is the time to get
all the questions answered.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.900
And the film is out
in theaters now.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.900
And it's in partnership with
IFC, so will it be on the IFC

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.840
network eventually?

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.200
BILL GUTTENTAG: Yeah.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.190
I think right now it's playing
by video demand, and iTunes,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.150
and all over the place,
by download.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.480
And it's playing also
theatrically, as well.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.690
MALE SPEAKER: Well, please join
me in welcoming Professor

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.480
Guttentag to Google as we get
started on this interview.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.990
So thank you very much.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.640
So I really wanted to start by
walking me through the origins

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.740
of the film.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.130
The 2012 election was weighing
heavily on our minds.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.290
Was that your original focus?

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.300
BILL GUTTENTAG: When I started
wanting to do the film, I

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.640
wanted to do a film about
being inside a

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.810
real political race.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.080
I thought it would be
interesting to have the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.170
cameras where cameras
traditionally

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.100
aren't allowed to go.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.750
So I met with a number of
politicians, including a

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.640
couple people who were running
for president.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.070
And what I quickly learned is
that people really don't want

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.970
to allow the cameras in the
rooms where they think you

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.140
shouldn't be in there.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.470
So that seemed to be
going nowhere.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.360
At some point I contacted Chris
Lehane, who I knew.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.289
And Chris was on Al Gore's
spokesperson.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.690
He was an aide to Bill Clinton
for eight years.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.620
And I guess you would say he's
the leading Democratic

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.400
political consultant.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.510
And Chris was running a
presidential campaign, and he

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.400
liked the idea.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.540
But no one is really going
to let you into the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.840
room behind the room.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.730
And as far as I know, they're
doesn't exist such a film.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.660
There's, I guess, some
compelling reasons not to.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.700
In fact, one person I met who
was running for president said

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.770
to me, well, what if you were
filming a debate prep and an

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.040
aide gave me a suggestion?

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.320
Would you want to
include that?

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.400
I said, well, that sounds like
a pretty good scene to me.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.100
And he said, no, no,
that's a bad scene.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.060
Because that shows that I'm
taking suggestions from my

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.300
aides and don't have
the idea myself.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.230
So it occurred to me that that's
not such a good idea--

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.650
that there was a big zone
of disagreement.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.740
So what I thought was if you
can't do it as a documentary,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.370
maybe you can do it as
a fictional film.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.600
And that set us on the
journey of doing it

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.140
as a fictional film.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.710
But we tried to sort of
navigate the channel

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.850
verisimilitude the whole time,
so that the conversations

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.860
you're hearing are, I think,
real conversations.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.330
And people have said to us,
political consultants

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.370
especially who've seen the
film, that they get these

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.190
little PTSD flashbacks when
they watch the film.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.460
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.440
Well, that's one thing that
struck me when I saw it.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.900
Well, to a large extent, it's
the headlines you see and then

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.460
what could be happening behind
the scenes to get there.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.790
BILL GUTTENTAG: Right.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.890
I think the trick in politics is
that everything is kind of

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.580
manufactured.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.070
Very few things are completely
spontaneous.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.560
So it was one person who was
running for president that

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.100
told me is that the idea is that
you never, ever want to

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.510
say something spontaneous.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.910
But every time you speak, you
want it to sound spontaneous,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.030
like it's the very first time
that you have said it.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.480
And in some ways, acting is a
little bit of a similar thing,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.710
because acting--

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.620
What's wonderful about actors
is that every time they do a

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.140
take, every time they say a
line, you're supposed to

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.560
deliver this innocence, like
it's the first time

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.170
you said the line.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.280
It's one of things that goes
into good acting is selling

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.970
the innocence.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.540
In a funny sort of way, politics
is done that way.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:26.080
I guess the line which plenty
of people have said are that

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.800
politics is Hollywood for
less attractive people.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.560
MALE SPEAKER: And so I also
wanted to delve in a little

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.490
bit to Rob Lowe's character.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.950
And so could you tell me
the origins of that?

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.430
He seems to be almost
a hired gun.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.930
He has something going
on in Kentucky.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.000
He has something going on in
California in the film.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.800
How does he pick and choose?

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.450
BILL GUTTENTAG: I think Rob Lowe
is loosely based on my

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.410
partner in the film,
Chris Lehane.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.150
And these political consultants,
they go all over

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.720
the country.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.300
I mean, they tend to work for
issues they care about and

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.680
politicians they care about.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.810
But you are sort of parachuting

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.020
into various races.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.500
And they also do it
internationally, as well.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.150
So what's great about Rob
is Rob, he sort of

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.270
understood the music.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.920
We kind of knew the feeling
and the things

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.080
to say about it.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.210
He's someone who really
cares about politics.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.720
So he was sort of a
natural fit to it.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.400
And then we would hang out quite
a bit with Rob and Chris

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.160
Lehane and myself.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.820
And I think part of that is he
just wanted to get a sense of

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.520
who Chris is, the kind
of things you say.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.770
And you always want to, sort
of, again, stay within that

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.460
channel of what is real and what
feels like the sort of

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.860
thing people really would say.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.200
MALE SPEAKER: And of course,
most of the filling takes

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.190
place in California.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.030
California being its own center
of political intrigue

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.620
from referenda on forward.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.770
So was the setting important
to you to bring it here?

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.100
BILL GUTTENTAG: I think that's
a terrific question.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.740
I think California, people
naturally have a greater

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.470
interest in California than
they do elsewhere.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.090
Any film is this combination
of art and commerce.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.280
And on the art side, you can
kind of set it any place.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.990
But I think people just
naturally care more about what

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.980
happens in California.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.130
We tried to include a fair
amount of California things

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.850
that would appeal
to an audience.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.350
We also had at one point the
senator from California,

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.640
Barbara Boxer, stop by the
set, which was sort of

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.340
fascinating.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.310
You had this funny combination
of the actors playing

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.180
politicians.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.360
And you're sitting there with
a California senator, who's

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.650
commenting on what's going on.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.440
And in some ways, that's what
we tried to achieve in the

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.510
film, is to create this
kind of raking of the

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.160
fake and the real.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.560
MALE SPEAKER: And then similarly
in writing it, you

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.090
did most of the writing
yourself then?

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.440
BILL GUTTENTAG: Yeah.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.030
It was written with Chris
Lehane, and we tried to ask

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.030
ourselves are these the sort
of things that people would

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.570
really say?

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.610
And we had quite a bit
of help on it.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.930
We spoke with Chris, who
writes speeches for

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.380
politicians.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.700
For reporters, we worked with
reporters so the reporters

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.980
would seem real.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.170
And in fact, the film was filled
with, quote unquote,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.320
real people.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.530
We have some well-known San
Francisco news personalities

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.320
as reporters.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.200
We have the Harvard
professor Alan

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.360
Dershowitz playing a lawyer.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.100
We have Howie Kurtz, who has a
show on CNN, also playing a

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.330
journalist.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.490
My son who is a Teach for
America teacher, who's in

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.440
there playing a teacher.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.530
All along the way-- we have
a Heisman Trophy winning

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.390
football player playing
a football player.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.320
I think all along, we just try
to look for people who are

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.310
real, because I think they add
this sense of you're not just

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.550
looking at actors.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.140
But of course, any film
depends on the

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.170
talents of the actors.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.530
But this sort of rounds
out the cast.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.890
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.630
And to that end as well, like
I said, there's many threads

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.180
going on too.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.660
You have the drama in Kentucky,
into California.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.240
From a narrative perspective,
how do you weave them together

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.440
and make sure that the audience
follows along with

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.370
the day-to-day life?

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.510
BILL GUTTENTAG: That's a
really good question.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.810
I think that when you watch
a film, there's this--

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.420
I think audiences, to some
extent, don't need to have

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.580
everything filled in.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.780
On the other hand, they don't
want to be completely lost.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.390
So you'll sometimes see in a
movie where you'll open up

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.430
with several different
plot lines.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.850
And the audience has a sense
that they're all going to

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.440
weave together at some point.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.280
And they'll hang in
there for a while.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.030
But there has to be something
interesting enough within

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.120
those stories that they're
going to hang in.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.715
And there's a sense of
gratification when

00:08:31.715 --> 00:08:32.510
it does hang in.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.750
But when you're editing,
everything that you do in a

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.600
film is a choice.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.450
Are you going to do this or
are you going to do that?

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.650
And I think you have keep an eye
on the fact that you don't

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.440
want people to be too lost
with what's going on.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.900
And it's a little bit of a
tricky balance at times.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.060
MALE SPEAKER: In the end, it's
a film about an election.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.835
So the election happens
on one day nationwide.

00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:53.280
So that kind of draws--

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:53.770
BILL GUTTENTAG: Right.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.220
I think there's always a
question, inherent drama,

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.910
about what happens
in an election.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.200
I mean, I did a TV series
years ago called

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:01.810
"Law &amp; Order --

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.100
Crime &amp; Punishment." And it
was all about trials and

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.830
courtrooms.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.680
And one of the things
interesting about trials are

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.050
trials have inherent drama.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.160
You have a trial.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.270
There's a defendant.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.680
Is that defendant going to be
convicted and taken out the

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.750
back of the courtroom
in handcuffs and

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.450
go to jail for decades?

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.080
Or are they going to go out the
front door a free person?

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.540
And one thing that was
interesting, we were an NBC

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.110
show, and we were on at 10
o'clock at night-- which can

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.920
be a tough slot because
people go to bed.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.355
So there's a big deal on TV,
trying to cross the half hour

00:09:34.355 --> 00:09:36.160
and hold onto your ratings.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.920
And in our case, we increase our
ratings like 100% of the

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.830
shows over the half hour.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.890
And I think the reason
for it--

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.440
I like to think it's because
it was a decent show.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.980
But I think another part
of the reason is

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.840
people want to know--

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.230
did the person get found guilty
or did they [? get ?]

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.890
found innocent?

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.030
So there's inherent drama
within there.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.260
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.820
And then that drama continued
with the various screenings

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.840
you did last year.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.520
I believe it premiered
the DNC.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.990
Do you have any memories
of that screening?

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.170
BILL GUTTENTAG: We showed
it at the DNC.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.250
And there's obviously a lot of--
the Democratic National

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.030
Convention--

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.970
there are a lot of politicians,
who I think felt

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.390
like they were seeing their
lives in there.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.590
So that was a favorable crowd.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.910
We also had a screening at
Harvard, where it was sort or

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.190
fascinating that--

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.710
It was at the Harvard Kennedy
School, and we had a number of

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.940
politicians, democratic, people
who work for Democratic

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.210
presidential candidates,
couple people on the

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.700
Republican presidential
candidate side.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.480
And the debate all became about
whether the character in

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.840
the film played by Carrie-Anne
Moss could actually win the

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.710
governorship of California.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.690
And it's sort of interesting if
you make a film that people

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.150
are actually taking
it seriously

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.330
enough to debate this.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.470
And it's grounded in the fact
that the two most famous

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.230
governors of California in
recent memory were both

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.100
non-politicians, referring, of
course to Ronald Reagan and so

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.290
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.750
So this is a state which will
embrace someone who is not a

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.220
politician and put them in
the highest state office.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.560
MALE SPEAKER: And I'd like to
follow up a little bit more on

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.710
Carrie-Anne Moss's character.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.800
And I'm reminded of the film, of
course, "Mr. Smith Goes to

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.000
Washington," the idealism being
dragged down by the

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.730
realities of modern politics.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.640
So what inspired you as you
created that character?

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.070
Do you think that such a
character could succeed on the

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:27.640
national stage?

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.700
BILL GUTTENTAG: I think part of
the story involves a doctor

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.900
in the Mission District who
would like to be governor of

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.660
California, played by
Carrie-Anne Moss.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.440
And I think that the
character's an

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.470
aspirational character.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:44.460
I think the idea that if you
have a great sense of

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.110
intelligence and compassion
that this will somehow

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.760
connect, and you can get over
the fundraising issues, and

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.465
all the other key issues
that people encounter.

00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:57.680
And I think that, I hope that,
audiences will connect with

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.630
that character.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.775
A lot of TV, I think, is
sort of aspirational.

00:12:01.775 --> 00:12:04.270
A lot of movies are
aspirational, too.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.950
It's not the world
as it exists.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.370
It's the world as you kind
of want it to be.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.240
I mean, if you see certain shows
on television, hospitals

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.600
really aren't run that way.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.970
Or if you watch "The West Wing,"
the White House isn't

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.600
really run by a bunch of super
smart, completely ethical

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.750
people, who always do
the right thing.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.660
But we all hope it would be.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.820
And I think that that's what
you come to the table with,

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.420
that you hope that these
hospital shows or the medical

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.850
shows or the legal shows, that
this is a world that you want.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.720
And I think that's one the
reasons people will watch

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.290
television or movies.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.830
In part, they come to
be entertained.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.430
In part, there's an aspirational
quality to it.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.580
MALE SPEAKER: And also,
I was struck--

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.720
I don't have the quote memorized
with me, but the

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.690
main essence was the idea of
Machiavellianism in politics.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.710
And so some of the characters
that the consultants are

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.330
working with, they have great
ideas, but there is some

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.020
questionable paths
to those ideas.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:07.250
BILL GUTTENTAG: Right.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.430
People aren't running
for saint.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:14.700
If you look at modern
presidents, there's a high

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.420
percent of modern presidents
that have had

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.310
extramarital affairs.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.760
And in other countries, it
doesn't matter so much.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.820
But in this country, whether
it's John Kennedy or Lyndon

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.000
Johnson, or you can just keep
going down the list, Bill

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.660
Clinton, and this is something
that can be a severe blow to

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.680
you if you want to get ahead.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.310
But the reality is that they're

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.320
not running for saints.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.360
And sometimes in politics, the
lowest blows are used for the

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.880
noblest ends.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.920
And you have to use these sort
of tactics if you hope to win.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.160
Politics is a blood sport.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.700
And they always say that your
hardest day on the campaign

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.440
trail is going to be your
easiest day in office.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.760
And so in some ways, the system
prepares you for the

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.670
blood sport ahead, which is
also running a country or

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.890
running a state government.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.490
MALE SPEAKER: And the American
political scene is one thing--

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.740
I'm brought to memories of
life in Europe, as well.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.760
So has this film made its
way across the pond?

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.440
BILL GUTTENTAG: It's
interesting.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.490
We were screening recently
in Stockholm.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:35.265
And I thought it was fascinating
that the Swedes

00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:37.950
that I met we're saying that
they were inundated with

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.990
American politics.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.940
But I think it's important.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.810
So what happens in the White
House actually affects what

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.490
happens in Scandinavia.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:51.920
So I think they found
it interesting.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.360
But if you look, political
consultants work

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.220
all over the place.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.660
I mean, people like
Chris Lehane work

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.790
all over the world.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.590
There was a famous Republican
political consultant who went

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.720
to work for Boris Yeltsin.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.590
This is what happens.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:11.480
We're exporting our brand of
politics for better or worse.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.940
MALE SPEAKER: And the approach
is different, too.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:19.580
Europe, they may recognize more
the distinction between a

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.990
candidate's public life and
their personal life.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.690
BILL GUTTENTAG: Yeah.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:23.340
I think that's true.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.930
I think in general, people
are more forgiving of

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:27.920
extramarital affairs.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.700
I mean, look no farther than
the politics happening in

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.910
France right now.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.680
MALE SPEAKER: So were there
any questions from the

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.300
audience as well?

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.300
We do have a mic if you brought
some questions with

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.150
you from your screening
yesterday.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: One of the
things that I thought was

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.470
interesting was that kind of
cathartic moment for Rob

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:49.540
Lowe's character, where he was
very motivated by the suicide

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.905
attempt of the young woman.

00:15:51.905 --> 00:15:55.300
And I'd love to hear your
thoughts about how

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.930
plausible that was.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.360
Because I would've thought
that somebody like Chris

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.830
Lehane would have foreseen that
as a reasonably plausible

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.130
outcome, and wouldn't
necessarily have been

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:06.750
moved in that way.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.740
So I'd love to hear your
thoughts about how plausible

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.850
that is versus being a useful
plot device, of course, to

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.840
motivate the character.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.870
BILL GUTTENTAG: I think that's
really a terrific question.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.870
And I think when you're writing

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:25.120
something, it isn't spinach.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.280
You want it to be dessert.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.935
So you want it to have some
dramatic juice to it.

00:16:31.935 --> 00:16:34.730
But you also want to make it
feel like it's plausible.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.510
And I think that in the heated
campaigns, people do a lot of

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.800
really nasty stuff.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.260
So is it plausible that people
do nasty stuff without

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:44.920
thinking about it?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.700
I think it happens
all the time.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.650
The question is, what happens in
the end of having done the

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.400
nasty stuff.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.760
And as you know, if you've
seen people in the news,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.240
people just descend on their
driveways, or they come onto

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:01.790
their house.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:07.000
I was just watching something
as simple as-- it was a shot

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.069
at the Newtown tragedy that
was written up yesterday.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.339
There was a photograph
of a woman praying.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:14.720
And suddenly, as she's praying,
she was descended

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.220
upon by photographers.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.250
And it was sort of a private
moment in her life, but she

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.369
became instantly a
public figure.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.919
So in terms of plausibility,
I hope it's plausible.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:28.580
And part of what makes things
plausible are that you're

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.030
looking for the right actors
who can pull it off.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:37.460
In this particular case, it's an
intern, who's in the center

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.540
of this, who's played
by Amanda Crew.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.410
And I think she did a really
wonderful job delivering this

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:47.300
kind of naive innocence
and confusion.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.930
And you hope, again, it
stays within that

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.390
believable realm of people.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:58.251
And I hope the whole thing
feels believable.

00:17:58.251 --> 00:17:59.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: This
is to follow up.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.630
The question was not actually
about the plausibility of her

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.750
actions-- because
I totally agree.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.910
That seemed completely
plausible--

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:10.230
but about somebody in Chris
Lehane's position.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.260
How did he feel about that?

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.880
Did he feel like, oh, that would
actually change him?

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.380
BILL GUTTENTAG: I think that
it's still a movie.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.630
I can't really speak
to how political

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.120
consultants will be affected.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.300
I think political consultants
can be affected by events in

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:26.740
their lives.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.370
But I also think in the heat
of a campaign, you do all

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.620
sorts of stuff that you
might regret later.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:38.610
And sometimes, it has powerful
consequences.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.070
People are really hounded
out of office.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.930
I mean, there's a line
the film which I

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.050
think reflects politics.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.210
One of the cardinal sin of
politics is when you have

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.130
someone down, you better
put the shiv

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.910
in, or it's a mistake.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.850
And if you look, that's
what happens.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:00.310
People go down and they get
kicked in the shins.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:04.160
I think this is the election
cycle that we're in.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.175
I mean if you look, people get
built up and then they get

00:19:07.175 --> 00:19:07.600
crushed down.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.700
If you looked at the Republican
crowd that was

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.650
running basically to have Mitt
Romney's job, basically, to

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.600
me, it was a little like a
clown car at a circus.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.950
Someone got out and they went
running around the track,

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.890
waving their hands, and
then they left.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:26.530
But I think also, if you watch
that, people were built up

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.580
tremendously.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.420
Rick Perry is going to become
the presidential nominee.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.220
And isn't Rick Perry great?

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.340
OK, well, whatever.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:37.250
A week later, he's saying, oops
and can't name the number

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.470
of agencies--

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.100
couldn't name the agencies
that he's going to cut.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.520
But I think you saw that with
some of the others.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.650
There's Michele Bachmann.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.060
She was going to be,
and then she made

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.720
all sorts of mistakes.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.330
And I think people saw how
shallow she was, and so on.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:57.440
So I think this is the real
world, where you're constantly

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.810
trying to adjust.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.000
There was a time when there
were like three

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.130
news cycles a day.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.180
And you had to adjust with
all those news cycles.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.380
Now the news cycles
are continuous.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:17.480
And you have to respond with
overwhelming force when things

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.110
are coming.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.320
And if you don't respond with
overwhelming force, stories

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.980
start taking on a solidity.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.300
And people think that this
is the way things are.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.215
So you have to come back and
you have to hit hard.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.900
And I think there's also rules,
and people sometimes

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.680
make mistakes.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.940
And I think one of the things
that we saw on this last

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:45.290
election cycle and beyond is
when Rush Limbaugh took on the

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.650
Georgetown Law student, because
she had spoke in favor

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.940
of contraceptives paid for
by the government.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.150
He called her a slut and lots
of other terrible things.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.322
I think that people were really
offended because she

00:20:57.322 --> 00:21:00.470
was considered, quote
unquote, a civilian.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.670
And you don't attack
civilians.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.190
And people had a visceral
reaction against it.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.310
He's been on the air forever
attacking everyone under the

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.140
sun and didn't get the
same response.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.830
But after that, there was all
sorts of threats to pull their

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.670
advertising.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.550
People felt like he
crossed the line.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.360
So I think this is something
that is often respected in

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.590
politics, that you stay
away from civilians.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:27.770
It's something that you see,
that generally politicians'

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.660
kids are off limits.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.010
People do not attack
politicians' kids, because

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.830
they are considered
non-combatants.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.980
And in the case of the movie,
I think what they ended up

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.580
doing is they ended up attacking
a non-combatant.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.850
And when you attack a
non-combatant, it creates all

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.840
sorts of issues that you have
to deal with later on.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.250
And hopefully, we can take those
issues and turn it into

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.860
some drama which people
care about.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.660
And then this is sort
of the big picture.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.120
But in the small picture, what
you're trying to do is write a

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.150
scene that an actor can play,
and hopefully they play

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:03.770
convincing.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:08.000
And you as an audience member
will identify with, in this

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.740
case it was Amanda Crew,
and feel for her and

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.730
identify with her.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.110
MALE SPEAKER: And then what
happens when the citizen wants

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:20.520
to enter the realm willingly,
become a player in the game?

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.390
BILL GUTTENTAG: In
what kind of--

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:26.240
MALE SPEAKER: Well, as you were
saying, the citizens are

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.230
the non-combatants.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.260
And then what happens when they
willingly choose to enter

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.700
that, to run for the office?

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:31.970
BILL GUTTENTAG: Right.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.850
Well, I think once you get on
the playing field, you have to

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.040
be prepared for just
about anything.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.210
And this is something we
referred to in the movie, that

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.290
there's this idea of opposition
research.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.190
And the first thing that people
do when they run for

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:49.520
office is they do opposition
research on themselves.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.090
They sort of want to find out
what is out there about them

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.220
that is likely to come out.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.000
I think one of the rules about
politics are everything can

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.560
and will come out.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:05.020
So you really can't contain
your secrets.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.400
And I don't know that everyone's
necessarily clean,

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.480
but there are also ways of
releasing information.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.120
Some of the things we touch on
in the film are the Friday

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.460
night document dump.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.100
And that's traditionally on a
Friday night, often before a

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.060
holiday weekend, you release
all sorts of information.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.270
The theory being that many
reporters are off on their

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.630
vacations, and they're not
particularly eager to come

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.190
back to the news room
to report on it.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.850
And by Monday morning, reporters
will be chasing

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.790
newer, shinier things.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.010
So that's a way that you
release information.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.630
There's ways of getting the
information out in the least

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:43.900
damaging way.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.630
But you want to put the
information out.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:49.130
It's one thing that people who
are very knowledge about

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.440
this-- a lot more knowledge than
me-- talked about that

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.310
one the big mistakes that Romney
did was on his tax

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:59.050
returns, that the tax returns
became a continuing issue for

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.220
Romney in the last election.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.270
But if Romney had, in the early
days of campaigning in

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:08.900
Iowa, put out his tax returns,
then it was the dead of

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.480
summer, people really weren't
paying that much attention.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.150
He should have just gotten it
out there in that way, and

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.200
then it wouldn't become
an issue.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.320
But because he gave so many
different answers to the

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.135
questions and seemed to be
evading all the time, it

00:24:23.135 --> 00:24:24.385
became an issue that dodged--

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.590
To correct that, it became an
issue that just followed him

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.140
throughout the campaign.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.230
MALE SPEAKER: Well, and to a
large extent now, the American

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.490
election is never over.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.160
It keeps going.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.510
BILL GUTTENTAG: Right.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.270
I think that's absolutely
right, Cliff.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:47.070
I think we're sitting here now
in February of 2013, and

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.960
there's all sorts of speculation
about who's going

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.970
to be the presidential
candidates in 2016.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.710
So it is a never-ending
campaign.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:55.960
You're absolutely right.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.280
MALE SPEAKER: And I guess to
close, looking towards future

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.080
campaigns, we had the bloody
sport, the knife fight in

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.380
2012, what sort of lessons
from this film the

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.200
viewers to take away?

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.220
And how do you see this applying
in future campaigns?

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.480
BILL GUTTENTAG: It's
a great question.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.860
And I think I'd just like people
to watch the film and

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.280
feel like they're getting
a peek inside the

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.500
room behind the room.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.060
When you watch the scenes,
you'll have a sense of this is

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.950
the way real people truly
talk while the

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.620
cameras are not around.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.330
And it's not always pretty, but
I think it is accurate.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:36.160
And in some ways, I'd like to
think that we made a film that

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.662
ultimately is kind of a
patriotic film that's sort of

00:25:39.662 --> 00:25:42.210
an endorsement of the system.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:47.610
I mean, there's a line that this
is a terrible system, but

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.390
it's the best we have.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.860
So there isn't a better system,
but this is not

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.120
flawless system.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.650
I think the more people
are aware, the better.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.170
There's a famous line,
"Sunshine is the best

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.940
disinfectant." Well, I
hope a film like this

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.810
will show some sunshine.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:07.130
But also, it is a film that
takes a bunch of stories, most

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.160
of them are based on real
stories, and tries to present

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.920
them in such a way that it's
sort of both entertaining and

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.510
informative.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.830
MALE SPEAKER: Well, Bill,
thank you very much for

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:17.840
stopping by.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.270
The film is out right now.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.860
I definitely encourage you all
to check it out, amazing film.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:26.380
And like you mentioned, it's a
moment of light in something

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.520
that folks don't normally see or
don't normally think about.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.940
It's almost how the
sausage gets made.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.340
So thank you very much
for stopping by.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.340
BILL GUTTENTAG: Thank you
very much, Cliff.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.590
I really appreciate it.
