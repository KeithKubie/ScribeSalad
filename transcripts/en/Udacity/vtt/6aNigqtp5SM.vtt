Thanks Greg! The three stages are what Selye referred to as the General

00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:09.902
Adaptation Syndrome. To recap, General Adaptation Syndrome consists of three

00:00:09.902 --> 00:00:14.659
stages. First is the alarm stage. This is when your body first reacts to the

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:20.085
stressful or threatening situation. With activation of the sympathetic nervous

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:25.665
system and the HPA Axis. The second stage is the resistance stage. This is when

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:30.471
your body tries to adapt to the stress. Here, we have sustained release of

00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:34.247
cortisol, as our body attempts to maintain our level of arousal to combat the

00:00:34.247 --> 00:00:41.480
threat or the stressful situation. And finally we have the exhaustion stage.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.323
This is when our body resources have been depleted in an attempt to deal with

00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:49.992
the threat or stressful situation. As a result of this depletion, our immune

00:00:49.992 --> 00:00:52.920
system is weakened, making it more likely that we experience illness and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.576
infection. It's important to note however that this model doesn't account for

00:00:57.576 --> 00:01:02.706
all stress responses. In fact, new research has shown that different emotions

00:01:02.706 --> 00:01:06.418
can actually produce different activation patterns in a autonomic nervous

00:01:06.418 --> 00:01:11.286
system. Which call for some question of the validity of the general adoption

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:14.998
syndrome never the less this model does serve as an overview of how are bodies

00:01:14.998 --> 00:01:18.550
might react with stressful event.
