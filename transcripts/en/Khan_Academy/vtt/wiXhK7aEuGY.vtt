00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:00.956
- [David] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:00.956 --> 00:00:01.789
Hello, Paige.

00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:02.622
- [Paige] Hi, David.

00:00:02.622 --> 00:00:03.455
- [David] So, today we're gonna be

00:00:03.455 --> 00:00:05.065
talking about quotation marks.

00:00:05.065 --> 00:00:06.942
What are they and what do they do?

00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:07.825
Paige Finch.

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:09.688
- [Paige] We use quotation
marks to indicate

00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:12.360
when someone is speaking, right?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.724
So, if we're writing dialogue, we can say,

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.937
"I like strawberry jam,"
said Lady Boffington.

00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:20.604
- [David] So, that's one
use of quotation marks,

00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:23.082
which is to quote direct dialogue

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:26.451
or to quote from a broader work.

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:30.507
We can also use quotation
marks for the titles of things.

00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:32.767
So, Paige, if you remember,
you can use underlines

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:36.280
or italics to indicate
the title of something big

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.780
like a book of poetry or an album of songs

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:43.016
or a movie or a television show.

00:00:43.016 --> 00:00:43.849
- [Paige] Yep.

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:45.648
- [David] So, Paige, for instance,
one of my favorite albums

00:00:45.648 --> 00:00:49.660
is Gentle Giant's 1975 album Free Hand.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.717
- [Paige] Okay, but that's
with italics or an underline.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.837
- [David] It's with italics,
or an underline in this case

00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:55.027
since I'm writing it by hand.

00:00:55.027 --> 00:00:59.194
But track two on that record
is called "On Reflection."

00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:02.564
- [Paige] Okay, so we put quotes

00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:05.166
around each individual song on the album.

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.166
- [David] Right.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.999
So, this is the album,

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:12.034
and this is a single song on it.

00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:15.100
Paige, let's say you and Jake
wrote a book of bread poetry.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.191
- [Paige] Okay, yes.
- [David] Right?

00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:17.264
- [Paige] That is something I would do.

00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:20.330
- [David] And you called
it The Yeast I Can Do.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.384
- [Paige] That is a great title. (laughs)

00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:24.051
- [David] Thank you.

00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:27.556
- Right, so underline it

00:01:29.768 --> 00:01:31.156
to indicate that that's the full title.

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:32.906
So, this is the book.

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.230
And then, this book is made
up of individual poems,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.226
so let's say you wrote a poem in the book

00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:41.559
called "Rye Do You Love Me?"

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:50.044
Sure, why not?

00:01:50.044 --> 00:01:51.677
So that's in quotes and that indicates

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:54.109
that this is a single
work or a single poem.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:55.327
- [Paige] Okay.

00:01:55.327 --> 00:01:57.090
- [David] Also, let me know
when that book is coming out

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.631
'cause I'll buy your book of poetry.

00:01:58.631 --> 00:01:59.464
(Paige laughs)

00:01:59.464 --> 00:02:02.881
So, it's not just songs and poems, right?

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:10.288
But it's also magazine
and newspaper articles,

00:02:13.194 --> 00:02:14.194
TV episodes.

00:02:17.748 --> 00:02:21.915
Really, it's anything that is
smaller than a larger work.

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:26.950
- [Paige] Right, it's something
inside of a larger thing

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.049
like a collection or--

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:28.882
- [David] Right.

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:29.716
- [Paige] Yeah, an album.

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:32.984
- [David] So, if you were
writing for a magazine

00:02:32.984 --> 00:02:36.520
or a newspaper, that newspaper's title,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.808
the Khan Academy Times,

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:42.225
would be either italicized or underlined.

00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:47.801
But an article that you wrote
for it would be in quotes.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.625
I think that about does it
for quotation marks, Paige.

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:52.474
- [Paige] Yeah, David?

00:02:52.474 --> 00:02:53.307
- [David] Yeah.

00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:55.607
- [Paige] I think I thought
of a bread poetry book name.

00:02:55.607 --> 00:02:56.815
- [David] Okay, what is it?

00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:58.825
- [Paige] Loaves of Grass?

00:02:58.825 --> 00:02:59.778
- [David] Yep.
- [Paige] Yep.

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:00.814
- [David] Yep, that's pretty good!

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:02.142
- [Paige] Okay.
- [David] All right.

00:03:02.142 --> 00:03:05.582
Putting it in there.
(Paige laughs)

00:03:05.582 --> 00:03:07.388
That's quotation marks.

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:09.275
You can learn anything.

00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:10.108
David out.

00:03:10.108 --> 00:03:11.111
- [Paige] Paige out.

00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:12.559
- [David] Loaves of Grass.
(Paige laughs)
