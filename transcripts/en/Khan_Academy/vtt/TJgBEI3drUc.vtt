00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.090
Now that you've had a little
bit of exposure to what a

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.650
convolution is, I can
introduce you to the

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:14.900
convolution theorem, or at
least in the context of--

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.470
there may be other convolution
theorems-- but we're talking

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.050
about differential equations
and Laplace transforms. So

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.440
this is the convolution theorem
as applies to Laplace

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.400
transforms. And it tells us that
if I have a function f of

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.259
t-- and I can define its Laplace
transform as, let's

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.130
see, the Laplace transform of
f of t is capital F of s.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.660
We've done that before.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.580
And if I have another function,
g of t, and I take

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.010
its Laplace transform, that of
course is capital G of s.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.220
Then if we were to convolute
these two functions, so if I

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.670
were to take f and I were to
convolute it with g, which is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.990
going to be another function
of t-- and

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.040
we already saw this.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.970
We saw that in the last video.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.860
I convoluted sine and cosine.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.460
So this is going to be
a function of t.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.350
That the Laplace transform of
this thing, and this the crux

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.770
of the theorem, the Laplace
transform of the convolution

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.860
of these two functions is equal
to the products of their

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.030
Laplace transforms. It equals
F of s, big capital F of s,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.970
times big capital G of s.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.050
Now, this might seem very
abstract and very, you know,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.170
hard to kind of handle
for you right now.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.830
So let's do an actual example.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.260
And actually, even better, let's
do an inverse Laplace

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.870
transform with an example.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.040
And actually, let me write
one more thing.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.950
If this is true, then we could
also do it the other way.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.580
We could also say that f-- and
I'll just do it all in yellow;

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.200
it takes me too much time to
keep switching colors-- that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.800
the convolution of f and g, this
is just a function of t,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.790
I can just say it's the inverse
Laplace transform.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.480
It's just the inverse Laplace
transform of F of

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.540
s times G of s.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.680
Although I couldn't resist it.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.930
Let me switch colors.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.420
There you go.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.570
Now, what good does
all of this do?

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.510
Well, we can take inverse
Laplace transforms. Let's just

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.760
say that I had-- let me write
it down here-- let's say I

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.080
told you that the following
expression or function, let's

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.430
say H of s-- let me write it
this way-- H of s is equal to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.510
2s over s squared plus 1.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.880
Now, we did this long
differential equations at the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.880
end, we end up with this thing
and we have to take the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.170
inverse Laplace transform
of it.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.580
So we want to figure out the
inverse Laplace transform of H

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.960
of s, or the inverse Laplace
transform of

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.830
this thing right there.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.090
So we want to figure out the
inverse Laplace transform of

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.285
this expression right here, 2s
over s squared plus 1 squared.

00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:11.040
I don't want to lose that.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.170
Right there.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.760
Now, can we write this as the
product of two Laplace

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.000
transforms that we do know?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.510
Let's try to do it.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.790
So we can rewrite this.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.965
And so this is the inverse
Laplace transform.

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:26.880
So let me rewrite this
expression down here.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.920
So I can rewrite 2s over s
squared plus 1 squared.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.180
This is the same thing as-- let
me write it this way-- 2

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:51.420
times 1 over s squared plus 1,
times s over s squared plus 1.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.490
I just kind of broke it up.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.590
If you multiply the numerators
here, you get 2 times

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.580
1, times s, or 2s.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.200
If you multiply the denominators
here, s squared

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.920
plus 1, times s squared plus 1,
well, that's just s squared

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.130
plus 1 squared.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.360
So this is the same thing.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.640
So if we want to take the
inverse Laplace transform of

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.530
this, it's the same thing as
taking the inverse Laplace

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.650
transform of this right here.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.649
Now, something should
hopefully start

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:18.870
popping out at you.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.360
If these were separate
transforms, if they were on

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.470
their own, we know
what this is.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.380
If we call this F of s, if we
said this is the Laplace

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.230
transform of some function, we
know what that function is.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.980
This is this piece right here.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.020
I'm just doing a little
dotted line around it.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.810
This is the Laplace transform
of sine of t.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.890
And then if we draw a little
box around this one right

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.560
here, this is the Laplace
transform of

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.480
cosine of t, G of s.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.110
So this is the Laplace transform
of sine of t, or we

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.510
could write that this implies
that f of t is

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.170
equal to sine of t.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.600
You should recognize
that one by now.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.650
And this implies that g of t,
if we define this as the

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.650
Laplace transform of g, this
means that g of t is equal to

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.770
cosine of t.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.170
And, of course, when you take
the inverse Laplace

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.150
transforms, you could
take the 2's out.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.440
So now what can we say?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.170
We can now say that the-- let
me write it this way-- the

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.110
inverse-- so actually, let
me write it this way.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.890
Or, actually, a better thing to
do, instead of taking the 2

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.990
out, so I can leave it nice
and clean, we could, if we

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.220
were to draw a box around this
whole thing, and define this

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.470
whole thing as F of s, then F of
s is the Laplace transform

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.130
of 2 sine of t.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.500
I just wanted to
include that 2.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.620
I didn't want to leave that
out and confuse the issue.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.150
I wanted a very pure F
of s times G of s.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.430
So this expression right here is
the product of the Laplace

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.200
transform of 2 sine of t, and
the Laplace transform of

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.610
cosine of t.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.400
Now, our convolution theorem
told us this right here.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.510
That if we want to take the
inverse Laplace transform of

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.470
the Laplace transforms of two
functions-- I know that sounds

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.530
very confusing --but you just
kind of pattern match.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.920
You say, OK look, this thing
that I had here, I could

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.690
rewrite it as a product
of two Laplace

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.460
transforms I can recognize.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.670
This right here is the Laplace
transform of 2 sine of t.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.050
This is the Laplace transform
of cosine of t.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.180
And we just wrote that as
G of s, and F of s.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.040
So if I have an expression
written like this, I can take

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.440
the inverse Laplace transform
and it'll be equal to the

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.220
convolution of the original
functions.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.830
It'll be equal to the
convolution of the inverse of

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.630
g or the inverse of f.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.750
Let me write it this way.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.810
I could write it like this.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:03.410
We know that f of t is equal
to the inverse Laplace

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.080
transform of F of s.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.830
And we know that g-- I should
have done it in a different

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.520
color, but I'll do g in green--
we know that g of t is

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:21.190
equal to the inverse Laplace
transform of G of s.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.450
So we can rewrite the
convolution theorem as the

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.960
inverse-- and this might maybe
confuse you more than help,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.060
but I'll give my best shot.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.550
The inverse Laplace transform
of-- and I'll try to stay true

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:43.480
to the colors-- of F of s times
G of s is equal to-- I'm

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.220
just restating this convolution

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:45.690
theorem right here.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.910
This is equal to the convolution
of the inverse

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.340
Laplace transform of F of s.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.680
So it's equal to the convolution
of the inverse

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:04.620
Laplace transform of F of s
with the inverse Laplace

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.480
transform of G of s.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.380
With the inverse Laplace
transform of

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.410
capital G, of G of s.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.740
I'm not sure if that helps you
or not, but if you go back to

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.160
this example it might.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.260
This is F of s, this is
F of s right here.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:28.130
2 times-- I'll do it in the
light blue-- this is 2 over s

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.320
squared plus 1.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.460
That's F of s in our example.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:39.820
And the G of s was s over
s squared plus 1.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.590
And all I got that from is I
just broke this up into two

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.570
things that I recognize.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.980
If I multiply this together, I
get back to my original thing

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.540
that I was trying to take the
inverse Laplace transform of.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.930
And so the convolution theorem
just says that, OK, well, the

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.170
inverse Laplace transform of
this is equal to the inverse

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:05.090
Laplace transform of 2 over s
squared plus 1, convoluted

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:14.960
with the inverse Laplace
transform of our G of s, of s

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.430
over s squared plus 1.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.430
And we know what these
things are.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.900
I already told them to you, but
they should be somewhat

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:23.700
second nature now.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.650
This is 2 times sine of t.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.110
You take the Laplace transform
of sine of t, you get 1 over s

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.190
squared plus 1, and then you
multiply it by 2, you get the

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.260
2 up there.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.870
And you're going to have to
convolute that with the

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.660
inverse Laplace transform
of this thing here.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.580
And we already went over this.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.900
This is cosine of t.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.480
So our result so far--
let me be very clear.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.130
It's always good to take a step
back and just think about

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.270
what we're doing, much less
why we're doing it.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:10:00.960
But let's see, the inverse
Laplace transform of this

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.650
thing up in this top left
corner, 2s over s squared plus

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:11.220
1 squared, which before we did
what we're doing now was very

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.740
hard to figure out-- actually,
this would be a curly bracket

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.620
right here, but you get the
idea-- is equal to this.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:30.710
It's equal to 2 sine of t,
convoluted with cosine of t.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.830
And you're like, Sal, throughout
this whole process

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.990
I've already forgotten what
it means to convolute two

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.330
functions, so let's
convolute them.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.570
And I'll just write the
definition, or the definition

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.310
we're using of the
convolution.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.370
That f convoluted with
g-- it's going to be

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.040
a function of g.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.350
I'll just write this
short-hand-- is equal to the

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:51.570
integral from 0 to t,
of f of t minus tau,

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.910
times g of tau, dtau.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:11:03.280
So 2 sine of t convoluted with
cosine of t is equal to-- let

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:09.575
me do a neutral color-- the
integral from 0 to t, of 2

00:11:09.575 --> 00:11:22.290
sine of t, minus tau, times
the cosine of tau, dtau.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.800
Now if you watched the very last
video I made, I actually

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.515
solved this, or I solved a very
similar thing to this.

00:11:29.515 --> 00:11:34.400
If we take the 2 out we get 2,
times the integral from 0 to

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:43.090
t, of sine of t minus tau,
times the cosine of tau.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.950
I actually solved this in
the previous video.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.490
This right here, this is the
convolution of sine of t and

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.170
cosine of t.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:54.000
It's sine of t convoluted
with cosine of t.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.870
And I show you in the previous
video, just watch that video,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.490
where I introduce a convolution,
that this thing

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:05.870
right here is equal
to 1/2t sine of t.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.460
Now, if this thing is equal to
1/2 t sine of t, and I have to

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:14.750
multiply it by 2, then we get,
our big result, that the

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:21.550
inverse Laplace transform of
2s over s squared plus 1

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:26.170
squared is equal to the
convolution of 2 sine of t

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.480
with cosine of t.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.550
Which is just 2 times this thing
here, which is 2 times

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:37.650
1/2-- those cancel out-- so
it equals t sine of t.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.470
And once you get the hang of
it, you won't have to go

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.820
through all of these steps.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.760
But the key is to recognize that
this could be broken down

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.800
as the products of two Laplace
transforms that you recognize.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.160
This could be broken down as
the product of two Laplace

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.840
transforms we recognized.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.630
This is the Laplace transform
of 2 sine of t.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.010
This was the Laplace transform
of cosine of t.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.320
So the inverse Laplace transform
of our original

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.460
thing, or original expression,
is just the convolution of

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.760
that with that.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.190
And if you watched the previous
video, you'd realize

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.160
that actually calculating that
convolution was no simple

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.890
task, but it can be done.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.840
So you actually can get
an integral form.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.200
Even if it can't be done, you
can get your answer, at least,

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.510
in terms of some integral.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.920
So I haven't proven
the convolution

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.730
theorem to you just yet.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.260
I'll do that in a
future video.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.540
But hopefully, this gave you a
little bit of a sense of how

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.040
you can use it to actually
take inverse Laplace

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.840
transforms. And remember, the
reason why we're learning to

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.040
take inverse Laplace transforms,
and we have all of

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.280
these tools to do it, is because
that's always that

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.950
last step when you're solving
these differential equations,

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.490
using your Laplace transforms.
