00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.580
- Hi, I'm Ella Morton, I'm a
senior editor at Atlas Obscura,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.750
and there's nothing I like
more on an autumnal afternoon

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.820
than hanging out in a graveyard.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.840
I will gladly do so alone, if I must,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.310
but today I am very lucky
to be joined by someone

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.270
of like mind, Caitlin Doughty.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.173
- You're not alone today, Ella.

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:23.740
- Yes, I have friends it's wonderful.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.530
Caitlin is a mortician
and a funeral expert

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.630
and we are just going to discuss

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.530
the special nature of
this particular cemetery.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.190
We are in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.210
This is the Most Holy Trinity Cemetery.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.150
It was founded in 1851 as
a German Catholic graveyard

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.190
at a time when bodies were being dug up

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.830
out of Manhattan burial
grounds and (whooshing noise)

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.790
shifted over to Brooklyn

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.330
because it was getting too overcrowded.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.880
But the main special
thing about this cemetery

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.690
is that the gravestones
are not made of stone.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.770
They're made of metal.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.859
- Bum bum ba.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:56.810
- And that's really cool.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.700
And we're going to talk
about how that came to be

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.580
and what the consequences have been.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.740
So first obvious question,
why are the headstones metal?

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.860
- Why metal?

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.250
Originally the idea was
really quite lovely.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.390
The idea was that everyone

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.440
whether you were rich or you were poor,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.300
you would get the same style

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.840
and material for your
headstones, either wood or metal.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.830
And while this was a lovely idea,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.750
what's happened over the last 165 years

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.269
is that they have crumbled,
they have oxidized

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:29.430
and it doesn't look quite
the same as it once did.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.220
- [Ella] As we've been
walking around we've seen

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.450
headstones in various states of disarray.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.530
Some have crumbled and rusted

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.550
and sort of crumpled in on themselves

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.820
but they weren't always like that.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.190
- You'll notice right now,
there are these big empty spaces

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.210
in the cemetery like where we're sitting.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.500
They didn't used to be empty.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.490
This cemetery used to
be packed to the gills

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.810
with wooden headstones, metal headstones

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.670
that over time and in the elements

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.420
have largely rotted away.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.020
- And all of these wooden
and metal headstones and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.350
monuments, they all looked
brand spanking new at one point?

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.240
- Well, not only did the
headstones, the metal ones,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.830
look new, they looked like stone.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.150
They were deceptive headstones

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.980
because they painted them this gray color

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.200
which ended up looking like
they were made of granite.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200
- [Ella] Deceptive.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.179
- Yeah, sneaky, sneaky German Catholics.

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.012
(laughter)

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.290
- So if you came to this cemetery,

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.040
if you saw it from a
distance it would just look

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.053
like any other cemetery of the time?

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.800
- Well, they would look normal-ish.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.340
So again, these were German
Catholics and at the time

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.890
they had different iconography

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.270
than was popular in Protestant cemeteries.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.330
So Protestant cemeteries you
had a much tamer view of death

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.300
we're talking urns and obelisks,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.970
where the German Catholics
were still going all out

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.140
with sparkly crucifixes
and cherubs and lambs.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.000
So you would come into
a cemetery like this,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.299
there was a reporter who did
in the late 19th century,

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.760
and was horrified by all
of the three-foot-tall

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.260
crucified, tortured
Christs in the cemetery

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.460
and he said that this
was an aesthetic failure

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.650
of the cemetery.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.510
So it was just a very different vibe

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.030
at a Catholic cemetery than
it would be somewhere else.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.260
- If you're used to urns,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.080
then a giant tortured Christ
is a bit of a departure.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.630
- ...is maybe not, wouldn't
be your first choice.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.660
- Wow, so it's German Catholic

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.680
that was a little bit
different, what about customs?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.590
- So since it was German
they would have German verses

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.420
that were spelled out on the monuments.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.760
My understanding is
that when children died,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.819
the parents would come
and leave playthings

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.850
and leave toys at the graves,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.180
which is something that
parents still do today

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.980
in cemeteries if they allow it.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.300
And it's a custom that I
was really fascinated by.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.120
Apparently the gravedigger
would go into the grave

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.370
and fill the grave with the family there

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.270
and there would be a
call-and-response prayer

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.760
not with the priest in the family,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.770
but the gravedigger in the family.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.603
- I love that.

00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:57.960
I feel like gravediggers
get overlooked in general.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.680
- And I like it because
it's like a visceral...

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.992
- Yeah, audience participation.

00:04:00.992 --> 00:04:02.760
- Audience participation,
call-and-response,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.331
when I say "Dead" you say "My mom."

00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:06.811
Yeah, me someday.

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:09.950
- I like it, yeah, nice memento mori.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.260
What about the more dark side?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.240
What about the depravity?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.760
Was there crime here?

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.129
- There certainly was crime.

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.520
You can notice that even
now there's an isolation

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.640
to the cemetery, you have
the subway running overhead,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.320
it feels isolated even in
this growing neighborhood.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.480
The idea of the metal
monuments is supposed to be

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.500
this egalitarian idea and
it's supposed to be lovely

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.650
and all that but it
actually led to problems

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.110
because metal is so
easy to come in, steal,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.773
and then sell for scrap.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.180
- [Ella] So we talked
about how it causes decay

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.050
and there's a lot of
headstones around the place

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.050
that are crumbling,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.680
but I actually like the
way that that looks.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.430
It creates these new sculptural objects

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.490
that are beautiful in their own way.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.260
- [Caitlin] There's so
many older cemeteries

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.700
with granite headstones
and granite monuments

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.970
that look pretty similar

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.330
no matter where you go, no
matter what you're looking at

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.760
and each sculptural object, like you said,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.610
here at Most Holy Trinity
is unique in a way

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.490
and I think it's beautiful.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.680
- Me too.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.030
There's beauty in the decay.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.109
- Oh, you're after my own heart.

00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:16.942
(laughter)

00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:18.030
- So thank you for spending time with us

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.330
in the graveyard today.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.250
If you're interested in even more details

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.500
on these gravestones,
what they're made of,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.219
how they weathered and crumbled,

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:27.620
Caitlin made another video on her channel,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.651
Ask a Mortician, so head there to see it.

00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:32.180
What do I say now?

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.530
- You say thank-

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.720
I think you're just too
classy a person, Ella,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.400
to do a proper YouTube outro

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.660
you have to like look at the camera

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.000
and be like all right Obscurians,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.060
I need you to smash that
like and subscribe button,

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.160
I'll see you next week.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.730
Tweet, retweet, Facebook, Instagram, uh...

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:50.563
- Socials.

00:05:50.563 --> 00:05:52.490
- We're out, all the socials.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.690
Atlas out.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.080
There we go, we learned a lot today.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.913
- Well.

00:05:55.913 --> 00:05:58.996
- Your training is complete, padawan.
