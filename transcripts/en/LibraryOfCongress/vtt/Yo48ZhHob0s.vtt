00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.150
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Sima Wali,
I thank you for being with us.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.440
I had the opportunity of
listening to you yesterday.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.140
And I thought that you made
a wonderful presentation

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.900
for the case of Afghani women.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.750 position:56%
You are yourself an Afghani woman
who has battled a number of battles,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.320
who has received awards
from numerous institutions,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.440
including Amnesty International
with the work you have done.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.600
Tell me a little bit about you.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.450
Where were you born?

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.370
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: I was born
in Kandahar in Afghanistan.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.130
And I was raised in Cabo.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.580
And I continued to live in Cabo

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.430
until the time of the
Soviet invasion.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.340
The actual invasion
came after I left.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.490
I left three months
before the Soviet invasion.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.760
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And where
did you go when you left?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.350
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: I fled Afghanistan
to come to the United States

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.970
and seek refuge in asylum
in the United States.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.830
And since then, I have been
living and working in the U.S.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.500
and have focused my work primarily
on Afghan women, and, of course,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.750
on women who have been affected
by wars throughout the world.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.970
And since well before the Taliban,
I spent a lot of time working

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.850
on the Afghan situation and
exclusively focused our programs

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.410
to promote the empowerment and to
raise awareness about the situation

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.930
of Afghan refugees
internally displaced people

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.810
and the Afghan people in general.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.920
The focus of my work is on
Afghan civil society institutions

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.550
and on the people of Afghanistan

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.500
who are running their own
community-based organizations

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.860
and they have done so in the
past 23 years of conflict.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.960
And my work focuses on
promoting the empowerment

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.220
of these grassroots organizers
and civil rights institutions.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.640
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Both men and women.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.500
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: We focus on
both men and women because--

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.800
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And children.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.100
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: And of course,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.320
because these grassroots
community organizers focus

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.800
on the entire community.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.830
They provide the basic
human services

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.140
and the critically-needed
services to their communities

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.490
because we have not had a
government that has focused

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.860
on the Afghan people for 23 years.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.480
And the women have
suffered immensely.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.170
It's the women who have
suffered disproportionately

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.650
from the conflict in Afghanistan.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.740
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Is it
primarily in education

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.800
or economically or socially?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.070
What has been taken
away and away from them?

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.050
Because I know that there were
women, members of parliament,

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.560
you had women teachers,
doctors and so on.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.790
Is that primarily in education?

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.170 position:56%
Was that the first impact and then--

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: It's been all sectors.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.610
It's been in the education sector.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.870
And the fact that the lives of
the Afghans have been disrupted.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.770
And it's the women who have
bore the brunt of the war,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.960
and they have suffered
untold misery.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.240
And it's the women who
have lost their husbands

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.540
and they have become widows.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.430
And they themselves are
so heavily traumatized

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.150
and they are undernourished.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.670
So they've suffered in all
sectors; the health sector,

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.270
the education sector,
the human rights sectors.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.360
And when the Taliban came
into power, the very rights

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.360 position:56%
of Afghan women, that was guaranteed
and then tried in our constitution

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.050
that was taken away from them.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.350
So progressively over
the years of the war,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.640
Afghan women's rights
were taken away from them.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.540
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: One by one.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.840
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: Yes.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.140
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Have
you been traveling?

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.180
Have you been going back
and forth to Afghanistan?

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.500
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: I have been
going because my work focuses

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.490
on human rights, and it focuses
on promoting the empowerment

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.710
of the grassroots community
organizers and the leaders

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.440 position:56%
who provide the human rights
advocacy and services and education.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.970
And especially those
that provide it now,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.260
the clandestine education is really

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.230
for girls during the
time of the Taliban.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.550
Because I write about
the situation and I write

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.850
and critique the human rights
conditions throughout the war

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.670
in Afghanistan.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.850 position:56%
And because I've been known for my
work, so my own security is at risk.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.870
And I've taken that calculated
risk to portray the voices

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.190
of the Afghan women who don't
have a voice in the west,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.390
and this is my major concern
because there are many women

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.360 position:56%
who do remarkable work, and many men

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.070
who support them at
the community level.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.160
However, they're so isolated.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.800
So they're constantly, when I
go back to the border to work

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.790 position:56%
with them, they tell me to please go
to the west and take our voices out

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.370
and serve as a witness
to our suffering.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.380
So I have not been able
to go inside Afghanistan

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.360
because of the various regimes,
and also because of the Taliban.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.380
But I am very pleased
that I am going now.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.170
In about two weeks, I am going

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.930
to establish our programs
in Afghanistan.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.570
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So in a
way, you have been the voice

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.860
of the Afghans outside Afghanistan.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.810
And in many ways, in the
meetings that you have attended

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.110
and with the people you have met.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.420
Tell us, who are some of the people
you've been meeting and talking to,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:45.420
and how is your organization
affecting changes in Afghanistan?

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.560
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: I try to serve as
a witness to the Afghan people

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.230
because they have actually
requested of me

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.360
at several different visitations

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.720
that I've had with
them at the border.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.050 position:56%
And these are women and men who have
crossed the border from Afghanistan

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.800
to specifically talk with me and my
group, and also with my colleagues

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.390
and those that are living
as refugees in Pakistan.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.480
So I have tried to portray
the reality and the needs

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.970
of the Afghan people,
particularly the women.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.930
I've done so by writing,
attending conferences.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.570
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: You worked
with the United Nations, isn't it?

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.530
Or through the United
Nations you were given awards

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.090 position:56%
and you've been chosen as a speaker?

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: Yes, so international,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.850
I was pleased to give
the keynote speech.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.730
And, of course, I focused
on Afghan women

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.490
on International Women's
Day this past year.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.970
So I'm happy that I get invited
to opportunities such as Fulbright

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.850
and other situations, so where I'm
able to portray the true realities

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:57.170
and the aspirations
of the Afghan people.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.040
And my main struggle is
for the rest and for women

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.850
and human rights institutions
and policymakers

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.610
to understand what the
realities of the Afghan situation

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.970
and what the needs of
the Afghan women are.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.430
It's not really the dress code.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.950
It's the-- I'm concerned that
we're focusing too much in the west

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.880
on the symptoms of the war, and the
dress code is one of the symptoms,

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.890
rather than looking at the

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.190
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: The basic.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.620
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: The origins of
the conflict and to provide--

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.170
you have to understand the
true origins and the history

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.050
of what caused the war and
what the origins of the war is.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.530
In order to devise solutions
that are sustainable,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.830
you have to address the causes
that keep women impoverished

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:47.750
and keep them from having
access to society's resources.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:55.070
And being at grave risk and being
the targets of human rights abuses.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.370
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Of course.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.220
Tell me, did you have support from
your family, from your parents,

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.510
from family members who
helped you and supported you?

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.270
Or was it difficult?

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.410
Did you find obstacles?

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.760
Family, cultural obstacles
that stood in your way

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.770
as you were trying to push forward?

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.070
Because it is difficult.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.520
It is difficult for a woman to be
doing the things you are doing.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.820
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: I lived
through the war

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.530
in Afghanistan a very
sheltered life.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:29.130
And when the war broke
out, this was in 1979,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.090
I had a passport and
I was able to leave.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.750
And this is when we
were under house arrest.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.650
And I actually worked with the
Americans, the Police Corps.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.440
And prior to that,
the American Embassy.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:51.200
And this was [inaudible] a
risk in itself for that time.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.090
I immediately had to stop working,

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.940
so we were being watched
very closely.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.540
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Because your parents?

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.290
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: It was my
parents basically who said

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:06.200
that they would not survive,
that I should take opportunity,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.420
the opportunity to
leave Afghanistan.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.720
And this is when I left.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.760
In a matter of 24 hours,
I managed to get my Visa.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.700
But then when I was in the
process of acquiring the documents

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.740 position:56%
to leave Afghanistan, I was arrested
at gunpoint and interrogated.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:27.160 position:56%
And it was very difficult for
several hours because they suspected

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.670
that I was from the
family, that I was supposed

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.770
to be under surveillance.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.070
But I managed.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.510
I mean, there was-- after
several hours, they got tired

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:43.040
of questioning me and
investigating my background.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.710
One of the soldiers then said
that, "well, she's a woman,

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.200
what kind of a threat can she be?

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.500
Let her leave."

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.320
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And they
didn't understand what kind

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.620
of a threat you were,

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.260
and how powerful a woman's
voice can be, isn't it?

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.510
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: And I was leaving
under the pretense that I was going

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.140
to visit my brother who was
then studying in Germany,

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.770
and I would actually go for
a short trip and come back,

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.640 position:56%
and I had my return tickets with me,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.350
and I had taken all
of those precautions.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.650
So it was very difficult.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:12.950
And I left--

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.580
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: You left alone?

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.030
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: I left alone,
and I left reluctantly.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.120
And I was actually the first
Afghan refugee who arrived

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:27.340
after the communist takeover
of Afghanistan in 1979.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.900 position:56%
I arrived in the United States, and
since then I've been living in exile

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.950
in the U.S. And that's been

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.610
when I started feeling
the impact of the war.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.590
And I realized, and I had
also experienced as a product

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:45.070
of the war the atrocities
that many of my friends

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.460
and extended family
members had survived.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.070
And that's when I made
the vow that I would serve

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.470
as a voice and a witness.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:56.090 position:56%
And I was sent by my family that if,
God forbid, they did not survive,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.410
this is my immediate
family, that I would take--

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:05.300
be a representative of my family
outside and take the voice

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.160
of the Afghan people
outside of the United States.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.980
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And
your family was fine?

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.700
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: My family
was still in Afghanistan.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.520
They left during subsequent
[inaudible]

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.660
under very difficult
and risky conditions.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.890
But I am very lucky because my
immediate family members are all

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.260
alive, and they managed
to escape with them.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.510
But many of my extended
family and my friends

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.150
and relatives did not survive.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.680
They were subjected to
torture and many were killed.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.980
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: By the Taliban?

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.720
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: Prior to the Taliban.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.020
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: When
the Soviets were there?

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.160
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: When the
Soviets invaded Afghanistan.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.780
So I decided then that I would
serve as a witness and try

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.040
to take the voice of the Afghan
people outside of the United States

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.330
because we are so isolated
from the world community.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.550
But over time, it is very
emotionally draining work,

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.490
but it's extremely
rewarding when I work

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.710 position:56%
with people at the grassroots level.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:07.870
These are remarkable men and women
who do the work on the grave risk,

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.990
at grave risk to themselves
and their families.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.160
So I realized that their
only hope was in me,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:21.370 position:56%
and I had to actually serve as a
voice to them and the outside world.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.510
And, of course, it did become very
risky, in which time I would go

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:29.640
to Pakistan, my mother is very
concerned because I am known

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.980
and I have been on death
threats-- I've had death threats.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.610 position:56%
And this last time when I was at
the border working with Afghan women

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.830
and men who had crossed the border
during the time of the Taliban

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.080 position:56%
to tell me their stories and to work
with us and we provided training

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:51.330
to the groups in Pakistan and
outside, in the region and also

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.660
from inside Afghanistan, I was--
my family was very concerned,

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.250
and my colleagues locally know
that it is threatening for me to be

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:06.620
in the field because I try
to write on the situation

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:13.940
and to actually bring awareness
and raise awareness in the west

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.650
and at international conferences.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.840
So they were giving
me enough protection.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:26.790
And when I returned, I got a very
threatening letter threatening my

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.660
life, that they're
watching me closely.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:33.290
If I come back and provide the
services and that I provide,

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:38.140
it would be very threatening
and very dangerous for me.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.720
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Sima, you
are leading a life which is full

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.160
of meaning, which is meaningful to
you and meaningful to many others.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.300
And it is, in a way,
you're a mother for many,

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:57.260
and the light leading others
out of a period of darkness.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:03.010
And I want to thank you for being
with us and for sharing something

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:07.530
that is so close to your heart
and which inspires us all.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.220
Thank you very much, Sima.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.160
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: Thank you very
much, and I hope that we

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.250
in the west will understand its
true reality of the Afghan people,

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.340
that they're very dignified,
they're tolerant,

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:23.980 position:56%
and the Afghan people are tired of
war and their wish is to have a free

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.890
and democratic Afghanistan.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:30.060
And I hope that the Afghan people,
who are very dignified people,

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.360
will have the opportunity.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.660
And so far, we have heard too
much about the extreme voices

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.210
and about the militants
in Afghanistan.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:45.540
We have yet to hear about the needs
and aspirations and the voices

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.770
of the Afghan people, and
I'm hoping that I'll be able

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.710
to portray that in the west.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.160
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: You're
a wonderful representative

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.460
of your people.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.760
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: Thank you.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.060
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
For their courage,

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.470
for their honor and
for their dignity.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:59.770
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: Thank you very much.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.070
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank
you for being with us.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.370
&gt;&gt; Sima Wali: Thank you.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.670
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thanks.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.830

of the Library of Congress.
