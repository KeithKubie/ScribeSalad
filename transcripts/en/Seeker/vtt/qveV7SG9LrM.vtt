00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.090
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.390
Bald eagles were honored as the national bird
of the United States in 1782, suggested by

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.280
William Barton, a Philadelphia artist.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.360
but benjamin franklin or B Frank as I like
to call him, HATED the bird.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.150
He called it “a bird of bad moral character”
because they’re “too lazy to fish for

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.150
himself.”

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.100
So our national bird was almost a turkey.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.010
A freaking turkey, which B Frank liked.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.579
He said they are a little vain and silly but
are a real "bird of courage.”

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.829
While B Frank is kind of right, bald eagles
do eat carrion, or dead meat, and might steal

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.240
food from other animals, he’s also wrong!

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.930
They aren’t too lazy to fish.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.450
Sometimes they will even put their life on
the line for a tasty meal.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.890
bald eagles can kind of swim. according to
the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.530
well it’s more like they can sit on the
water and use their wings as oars.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.860
This can come in handy if they catch a fish
that’s too large for them to fly with.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.119
So they’ll row to shore with the fish in
tow. (in toe, get it? cause the fish is in

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.119
their talons on their toes?

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.560
oh never mind) And apparently there are cases
of some birds drowning because their meal

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.560
is too big.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.650
But it’s not just big fish that put the
bird in danger.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.250
Unfortunately America almost lost one of her
treasured national symbols.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.580
In 1967 they were designated Endangered, for
a few reasons, like habitat loss, over hunting,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.250
and possibly pesticide exposure.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.290
They became one of the first animals to be
put on the Endangered Species List.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.560
Since then bald eagles made a huge come back.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.650
Their protection programs were considered
a huge success, and the species was taken

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.520
off the Endangered Species List in 2007.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.340
And today, according to the US Fish and Wildlife
Service, there are 9,789 nesting pairs of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.440
bald eagles in the contiguous United States.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.201
And that doesn’t even count what’s in
Alaska.

00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:51.850
If you’ve ever seen one in the wild you
know how huge they are.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.390
Female bald eagles can weigh up to 14 pounds
and have a wingspan of 8 feet.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.300
And for a big bird, they need a big nest.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.799
They build huge nests.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:00.799
LIKE HUGE.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.409
Like the largest of any North American bird.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.070
The largest bald eagle nest on record was
9.5 ft (3 m) wide and 20 ft (6 m) high.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.070
It weighed more than two tons.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.259
And they live a long time too!

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.780
Bald eagles can live up to 28 years in the
wild and 36 years in captivity.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.900
So if you’re in America this fourth of July
weekend Happy Fourth!

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.730
If you’re not in America… well hope you
learned a little bit about our majestic mascot.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.880
On the topic of Independence Day, have you
ever wondered how fireworks work?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.050
Anthony’s got the scoop in this video right
here:

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.360

more about?
