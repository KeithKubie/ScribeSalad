00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.850
Oolitic limestone blocks used to build the
Pentagon and Empire State Building were made

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.390
by microbes that lived up to 340 million years
ago.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.170
So thanks for the building materials, microbes.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.109
And a study of ethnic groups on the Malay
Peninsula found that hunter-gatherers are

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.230
far more adept at identifying smells than
farmers.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.150
The Semaq Beri were able to name specific
smells as easily we name colors, which suggests

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.220
that how we live affects how we smell.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.220
Vsauce!

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.250
Kevin here.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.170
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.040
NASA is working to ensure that planes avoid
one another’s wake -- and even figure out

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.080
how to surf them.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.210
With about 100,000 flights per day worldwide,
sophisticated air traffic control systems

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.430
make sure planes don’t collide, but a wake
encounter can be just as dangerous.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.310
The Automated Cooperative Trajectories project
at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.990
are using technology to track invisible, spinning
wakes described as “horizontal tornadoes”

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.640
-- and they’re inspired by concepts in nature
such as when geese fly in a V-formation.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.420
Planes that fly on top of rising air from
wakes will be able to conserve fuel and reduce

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.100
emissions.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.149
Which is good.

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.229
It turns out babbling babies manipulate adults
-- and it helps them further their own education.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.029
Researchers at Cornell’s Behavioral Analysis
of Beginning Years Laboratory or BABY LAB

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:37.670
-- found that babies organize their mothers’
verbal responses and use more mature babbling

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.140
to draw out more interaction.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.010
That results in a greater number of learning
opportunities for babies and encourages simpler

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.679
responses and learnable information.

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.529
So blahblahblah actually means... teach me
more.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.820
Speaking of babies, dolphins recognize themselves
in a mirror, and they can do it many months

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999
sooner than human babies.

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:04.219
A psychologist at Hunter College spent years
working with two dolphins, Bayley and Foster,

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.060
observing their behavior in a mirror.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.160
She found that by 7 months, dolphins engaged
in self-directed behavior, including wagging

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.330
their tongues and swirling their bodies.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.510
In contrast, human babies can take 12-15 months
to reach this developmental milestone.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.610
So score one for dolphins.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.790
Electronic skin that lets you manipulate virtual
objects is poised to replace bulky VR wearables.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.790
Researchers from Germany have combined two
existing technologies to develop a barely-perceptible

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.450
electronic skin that uses magnetic fields
to track movement.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.450
And the next step is to ditch permanent magnets
and incorporate the use of geomagnetic fields

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.110
for positioning the way that sharks can.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.640
Which sounds amazing.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.590
And now a word from Ansco!

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.920
When the neighbors drop by for a slideshow,
it's fun for everyone.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.760
But what's the answer when you want to runoff
both regular-sized slides and over-sized slides?

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.940
The answer is the new Anscomatic, the A+ slide
projector from Ansco.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.820
It's the world's only fully-automatic projector
to take all popular slides.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.850
Cardboard, glass, metal and plastic.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.790
And when it's time for those big two and a
quarter slides, no problem.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.620
Anscomatic projects 'em.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.970
Clear and sharp.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.420
And Anscomatic runs itself, or with the remote
control, you can control your slides from

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.670
anywhere in the room at any speed you choose.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.260
At the end of the show, Anscomatic even turns
on the lights.The new Anscomatic is available

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.370
at most dealers for just $11.95 down.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.690
Photographs projected in your living room?

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.690
Awesome..

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.110
Let’s do a blowback.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.890
Mind Blow #99 in November, 2015, featured
the Scan Pyramids Project and they just recently

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.370
discovered two mysterious voids.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.569
The voids in the Great Pyramid of Giza will
be inspected by a mix of subatomic particle

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.760
detection and tiny robots.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.870
Built over 4,500 years ago, the Great Pyramid
is the oldest Wonder of the World but it’s

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.150
difficult to study without damaging.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.010
Small particles called muons form when cosmic
rays interact with the Earth’s atmosphere,

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.220
and they lose speed when they travel through
dense objects.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.100
By measuring muon velocity, they identified
two secret chambers that could be corridors,

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.530
serve structural functions, or… who knows.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.780
A team from the French National Institute
for Computer Science and Applied Mathematics

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.850
is also constructing two very small robots
that will be able to explore the voids by

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.950
entering through a tiny drilled hole.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.280
A team of Canadian paleontologists have shed
light on why few modern animals have the tail

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.000
weaponry that made some dinosaurs so destructive.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.570
They concluded that animals with tail weapons
like the ankylosaurus were generally large,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.130
herbivorous, and had armored bodies.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.810
As skin armor evolved from bone, tail weapons
evolved to be softer, too.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.800
Modern animals like porcupines tend to have
tail weapons made of the softer keratin -- except

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.210
for Smaug, a small lizard named after the
dragon in The Hobbit that retains a bony,

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.880
spiked tail.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.250
Presumably to guard treasure.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.090
The Coyote III, initially designed for space
exploration, is now being used for search

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.400
and rescue and to identify gas leaks in buildings.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.750
The German Research Center for Artificial
Intelligence developed the Coyote and proved

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.060
that it was capable of handling any kind of
terrain.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.680
Its on-board computer allows autonomous exploration
and responding to data from sensors for practical

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.680
purposes here on Earth -- yet another trickle-down
benefit from space research.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.670
Roosters are really loud why don’t they
go deaf?

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.150
Roosters have evolved to protect themselves
from their own deafening crows.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.790
Researchers at the University of Antwerp and
University of Ghent found that the internal

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.790
sound pressure of a rooster’s crow can reach
a whopping 140 decibels, which is 50 decibels

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.669
more than a lawn mower and 20 more than a
loud concert.

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.330
Micro-CT scans of roosters’ heads showed
that their auditory canal closes when their

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.480
beak opens, which essentially plugs their
own ears and insulates them from damage.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.650
Now you know that.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.140
The brains of musicians may be as different
as the music they play.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.200
Researchers from the Max Planck Institute
for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.169
Liepzig found that different processes occur
in the brains of classical and jazz musicians

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.889
even when they played the exact same piece.

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.900
The study of professional pianists showed
that jazz musicians were more flexible and

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.250
able to “re-plan” harmonies more easily
than classical pianists, suggesting that evaluating

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.020
the effects of music on the brain might be
most accurate when done across the global

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.280
musical spectrum.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.870
The European Union’s SecondHands project
is supporting the development of robots with

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.669
predictive action to help humans.

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.880
ARMAR-6 is a human-like robot that can aid
maintenance technicians by recognizing what

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.570
they’re doing and offer help at the perfect
time.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.770
One of the things we're working on is a project
called SecondHands.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.440
This is developing a robot to assist our maintenance
technicians.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.540
It's called SecondHands because it's literally
meant to be a second pair of hands for the

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.949
technician to get their work done.

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:14.360
Having now received a SecondHands robot in
our lab we're working together with all our

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.940
partners to integrate different functionalities
in order to demonstrate a real-world maintenance

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.940
task.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.030

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:18.930
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:29.639
The domestication of the computer already
has begun.

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:35.060
In Phoenix, Arizona the Charles Crawshaw family
has learned to live with a computer terminal

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.930
in their kitchen.

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:40.570
This teletypewriter is connected by ordinary
telephone lines to a

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:46.100
computer complex in New York City 2,400 miles
away.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.410
Charles Crawshaw, a General Electric engineer
works on technical problems.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.740
His wife, Barbara, uses the computer for various
household chores.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:00.270
Here, the computer has expanded the proportions
of a recipe for six into a recipe for fourteen.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.720
By the 21st century, home computers may be
as common as today's telephone.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.820
Hey, what are you doing?

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.820
Having fun!

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.450
The children of the 21st century, might be
educated by a computer at home.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.000
The Crawshaw daughters do some of their homework
this way today.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.240
Tomorrow's home computer won't simply do old
jobs in new ways.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:27.020
By the time the Crawshaw daughters have families
of their own, we may created jobs for computers

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.290
that we haven't even dreamed of today.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:34.820
Even with a computer in her kitchen, Mrs.
Crawshaw still cooks her family's meals.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.779
Cooking might be different in the 21st century.

00:09:36.779 --> 00:09:38.279
Industrial designer, Henry Dreyfuss.

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:42.962
I like to think that the art of baking a homemade
pie won't be lost.

00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:49.899
But maybe the one that comes out of the supermarket's
gonna be better than the one that you can

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:52.770
make at home because we've lost the art.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.680
I think that packages for quick food and this
doesn't just have to be in the kitchen.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:03.710
The package might very well have a disposable
electric plug as part of it.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:09.940
And you just plug this in, the package would
heat, you'd eat the food, and you might even

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.940
eat the package.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.600
All the wasted paper in the world, it's conceivable
that when the package is heated, it would

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:27.010
turn into part of the food.
