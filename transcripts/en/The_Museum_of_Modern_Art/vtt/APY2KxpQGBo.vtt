00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:10.178
Dance is very different
from other practices

00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:11.511
in that it disappears

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:15.433
the instant that you see
a given movement, it’s gone.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.310
And so it exists in the memory.

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:21.605
I came to New York
to study acting

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.983
and I was no good at that.

00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:27.445
They said, “We don’t believe you.”

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:31.365
And my first dance class,
it took.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.661
I didn’t know how limited

00:00:35.828 --> 00:00:37.705
my physical resources were.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:41.125
I didn’t have
a conventional dancer’s body.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.878
If I had known, or recognized that
I might not have gone on.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.466
But the pleasure of moving
was so great

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:53.721
that it overcame any reservations
I might have had.

00:00:55.098 --> 00:00:58.643
That title of the piece
is “The Concept of Dust,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.521
or How Do You Look When
There’s Nothing Left To Move?”

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:07.401
It was performed
at the Getty in LA a year ago.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:10.613
And it was called “A Work in Progress”.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.408
I didn’t feel it had coalesced

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:16.243
and there was still material
I was working on.

00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:23.041
But I feel it’s ready to go now.
