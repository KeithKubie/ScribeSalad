00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.570
Let's start with a warm
up ratio problem.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.280
Then we can tackle some harder
word problems. So I have the

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:15.750
ratio 13/6 is equal to 5/x.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.740
I don't like having this x in
the denominator, so let's

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.420
multiply both sides of
this equation by x.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.150
So if I multiply both sides by
x, what's going to happen?

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.810
On the right hand side, this
x cancels out with that x.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.300
And then the left hand side
going to become 13 over 6x is

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.910
equal to-- you're just going
to have a 5 there.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.650
And then to solve for x, you
just multiply both sides by

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.010
the inverse of 13/6.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.670
6/13.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.320
These, obviously, cancel out.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.940
That's why I multiplied
it by the inverse.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.320
And you get x is equal to 5
times 6, which is 30/13.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.220
Now one way that you might see
this done-- it's kind of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.470
skipping a step-- is called
cross multiplying.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.150
You look at a ratio like this,
and you immediately say the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.430
numerator on this side times the
denominator on that side

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.690
is equal to the numerator
on this side times the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.520
denominator on that side.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.710
Let me write that out.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.380
So you might sometimes see
people immediately go to-- let

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.680
me just rewrite the problem
actually-- So that original

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.750
problem was 13/6 is
equal to 5/x.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.700
You might sometimes immediately
see someone go to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.950
13 times x is equal
to 5 times 6.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.550
And it might look like magic.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.470
How does that work out?

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.520
Why does that make sense?

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.610
And really, all they're doing
to get to this point is they

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.430
are simultaneously multiplying
both sides of the equation by

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.620
both denominators.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.550
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.150
If I multiply both sides of this
equation by 6 and an x,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.245
what's going to happen?

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:52.490
If I multiply it by 6x times
both sides of this equation--

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.700
And where did I get the 6?

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.190
From here.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.030
Where did I get the x?

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.460
From there.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.850
Both denominators.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.040
What's going to happen?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.470
On this side of the equation,
the 6 is going to cancel out

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.890
with this denominator.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.580
And on the right hand side of
the equation, the x is going

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.600
to cancel with this
denominator.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.870
So you're going to be left
with 13 times x is

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.210
equal to 5 times 6.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.290
So nothing fancy there.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.570
You're just multiplying by the
denominators of both sides of

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.000
the equation.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.060
And it looks like you're
cross multiplying.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.090
13x is equal to 5 times 6.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.600
And then from here, of course,
you divide both sides by 13.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.950
You get x is equal to 30/13.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.910
Now that we're all warmed up,
let's tackle some actual word

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.740
problems.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.990
So we have the highest
mountain in

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.800
Canada is Mount Yukon.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.990
It is 298/67 the size
of then Ben Nevis.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:55.470
Let's Y for Yukon is equal to
298/67 the size of-- let's say

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.630
N for Nevis.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.990
That's what this in
green tells us.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.800
The highest peak in Scotland.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.840
Mount Elbert in Colorado
is the highest peak

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.680
in the Rocky Mountains.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.790
Mount Elbert-- so we have this
other information here-- Mount

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.450
Elbert is 220/67 the height
of Ben Nevis.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.850
So let's say, E for Elbert.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.720
E is equal to 22/67
times Nevis.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.290
Times the same Ben Nevis,
right there.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.420
And they're telling us more.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.230
And, it is 44/48 the
size of Mont Blanc.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.950
So Elbert is equal to 44/48
the size of Mont Blanc.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.890
Let's write B for Mount Blanc.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.300
They also tell us Mont Blanc
is 4,800 meters high.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.090
Mont Blanc is 4,800.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.700
meters high.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.860
So B is equal to 4,800.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.120
And they ask us, how high
is Mount Yukon?

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.900
So we have to figure out Y.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.190
So let's see if we can work
backwards, and figure out all

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.230
the variables in between.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.810
So let's start with this
information here.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.560
B is equal to 4,800.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.140
E is equal to 44/48 times B.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:14.490
So E-- so Elbert-- is equal to
44/48 times Mont Blanc, which

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.279
is 4,800 meters.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:23.690
Now if you divide that by 48--
4,800 divided by 48 is 100.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.210
So Elbert is 44 times
100 meters high.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.870
So it's equal to 4,400 meters.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.730
Fair enough.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.960
Now we can use this
information and

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.650
substitute it over here.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.360
We get Elbert, which is 4,400
meters high, is equal to

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.510
220/67 times Ben Nevis.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.850
N for Nevis.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.340
To solve for Nevis, we multiply
both sides by the

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.440
inverse of this coefficient
right here.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.740
So we multiply both
sides by 67/220.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:05.750
So times 67/220.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.810
The 67 cancels with that 67.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.920
That 220 cancels
with that 220.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.870
And then you get-- let's see,
if I take 4,400 divided by

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.480
220-- 440 divided by 220 is 2.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.350
So this is going to be 20.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.640
So 4,400 divided by
220 is just 20.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.360
So you get Nevis is equal
to-- I'll swap sides.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.770
So Ben Nevis is equal to
67 times 20 meters.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.930
And now that's what?

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.420
1,340 meters.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.620
Is that is right?

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.250
Well, lets just leave it like
that, because we could--

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.570
actually it looks like that's
67-- I'm going to leave Nevis

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.530
as 67 times 20 meters.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.800
And substitute it right there.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.940
So Yukon-- I'll just go down
here, because I have more real

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.050
estate there-- Yukon is equal
to 298 over 67 times the

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.280
height of Nevis.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.120
Nevis is 67 times 20.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.340
So times 67 times 20.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.180
Well I can divide 67 by
67, and I get Yukon is

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.430
298 times 20 meters.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.380
So Yukon is equal
to 298 times 20.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.430
And what is that equal to?

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.580
That is equal to-- Let's
see that's 2 times 298

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.510
is going to be 396.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.380
Oh sorry, it's going
to be 596.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.290
This is almost 300, so it
should be close to 600.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.820
This is 2 less than 300,
so this should

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.730
be 4 less than 300.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.340
And then, I have a 0 here.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.200
So it's going to be
5,960 meters.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.650
And we are done.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.920
Let's do one more of these
word problems. All right.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.390
At a large high school, it is
estimated that 2 out of every

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.630
3 students have a cell phone.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:05.790
And 1 in 5 of all students have
a cellphone that is one

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.140
year old or less.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.550
All right.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.940
So let's think about it.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:16.915
Let's say that x is equal to the
total number of students.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.670
This first line, 2 out of 3
students have a cell phone, so

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:30.640
we could say that 2/3
x have cell phone.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.630
That's what that green
statement tells us.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.810
And then that purple statement--
1 in 5 of all

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.080
students have a cellphone that
is one year old or less.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:48.136
So 1/5 x have less than
1/5 year cell phone.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.720
So they want to know, out of
the students who own a cell

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.950
phone-- so it's out of this--
that's our denominator.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.340
So let me write that down.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.440
That is our denominator.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.420
So out of the students who
have a cellphone-- that's

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.770
right there-- they want to know
what proportion owns a

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.160
phone that is more than
one year old.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.280
So how many students have a cell
phone that is more than

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.540
one year old?

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.090
Well, we could take the total
number that have a cellphone,

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.500
which is 2/3 x.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.620
2/3 of all the students
have a cell phone.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.430
We can subtract out all of the
students that have a new

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.560
cellphone-- a cell phone that
is less than one year.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.420
Remember they're saying more
than one year here.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.630
So we want to subtract out all
the students with the new

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.919
cellphone, minus 1/5x, and you
will then have the proportion

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.700
of students who have
this right here.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.590
This is right here.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:49.600
This is, have greater than
1/5 year cell phone.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.470
They have a phone, but it's
more than 1/5 years old.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.230
This is all of them that
have a cellphone.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.780
We subtract out the new ones.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.470
So this is, essentially, all
of the people who have an

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.510
older than one-year
old cell phone.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.300
So to solve this, we just
subtract the fractions.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.140
So this is just going to be,
let's see, 2/3 is the same

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.080
thing as 10/15.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.170
That's 2/3 minus 1/5.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.960
The same thing as 3/15 x.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.900
Which is equal to 10
minus 3 is 7/15 x.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.830
Is the total proportion of
students-- that's this

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.450
orange-- what proportion owns
a phone that is more

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.160
than one year old?

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.590
It's 7/15 x.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.090
That's an actual number.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.810
So if you want to know, out of
the students who own a cell

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.230
phone-- so out of the students
who own a cell phone, right

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.560
there-- 2/3x, what proportion
owns a phone that it is more

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.800
than one year old?

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.870
This is the number that own a
cellphone that is more than

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.700
one year old.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.820
And this whole value is the
proportion out of the students

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.330
who have a cell phone.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.270
Lucky for us, the
x's cancel out.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:56.300
And we are left with this is
equal to 7/15 times the

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.950
inverse of the denominator.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:58.980
You divide by 2/3.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.000
That's the same thing as
multiplying by 3/2.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.940
And what does this equal to?

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.250
Divide by 3.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.740
We are left with 7/10.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.840
So of the students who own a
cell phone, 7 out of 10 of the

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.080
students who own a cell phone,
own a cell phone that is more

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.730
than one year old.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.110
And we are done.
