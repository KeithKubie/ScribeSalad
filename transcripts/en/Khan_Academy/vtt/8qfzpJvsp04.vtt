00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.420
Throughout our journey through
chemistry so far, we've

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.810
touched on the interactions
between molecules, metal

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.290
molecules, how they attract each
other because of the sea

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.665
of electrons and water
molecules.

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:16.545
But I think it's good to have a
general discussion about all

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:19.100
of the different types of
molecular interactions and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.860
what it means for the boiling
points or the melting points

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.890
of a substance.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.870
So I'll start with the weakest.
Let's say I had a

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.120
bunch of helium.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.100
Helium, you know, I'll just draw
it as helium atoms. We'll

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.150
look in the Periodic Table, and
what I'm going to do now

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.360
with helium I could do with
any of the noble gases.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.860
Because the point is that
noble gases are happy.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.275
Their outer orbital is filled.

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:41.590
Let's say, neon or helium--
let me do neon, actually,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.210
because neon has a full eight
in its orbital so we could

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.750
write neon like neon and
it's completely happy.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.600
It's completely satisfied
with itself.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.950
And so in a world where it's
completely satisfied, there's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.630
no obvious reason just yet-- I'm
going to touch on a reason

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.850
why it should be-- if these
electrons are evenly

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.920
distributed around these
atoms, then these are

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.040
completely neutral atoms. They
don't want to bond with each

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.080
other or do anything else, so
they should just float around

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.310
and there's no reason for them
to be attracted to each other

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.100
or not attracted
to each other.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.370
But it turns out that neon does
have a liquid state, if

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.230
you get cold enough, and so the
fact that it has a liquid

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.820
state means that there must be
some force that's making the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.060
neon atoms attracted to each
other, some force out there.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.260
Because it's in a very cold
state, because for the most

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.430
part, there is not a lot of
force that attracts them so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.210
it'll be a gas at most
temperatures.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.570
But if you get really cold, you
can get a very weak force

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.130
that starts to connect or makes
the neon molecules want

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.240
to get towards each other.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.160
And that force comes out of
the reality that we talked

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.950
about early on that electrons
are not in a fixed, uniform

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.990
orbit around things.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.240
They're probablistic.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.420
And if we imagine, let me say
neon now, instead of drawing

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.090
these nice and neat valence
dot electrons like that,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.760
instead, I can kind of draw
its electrons as-- it's a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.060
probability cloud and it's
what neon's atomic

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.420
configuration is.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.630
1s2 and it's outer orbital
is 2s2 2p6, right?

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.547
So it's highest energy electron,
so, you know, it'll

00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:21.580
look-- I don't know.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.560
It has the 2s shell.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.110
The 1s shell is inside of that
and it has the p-orbitals.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.160
The p-orbitals look like that
in different dimensions.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.130
That's not the point.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.680
And then you have another neon
atom and these are-- and I'm

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.550
just drawing the probability
distribution.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.350
I'm not trying to
draw a rabbit.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.250
But I think you get the point.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.620
Watch the electron configuration
videos if you

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.440
want more on this, but the idea
behind these probability

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.390
distributions is that the
electrons could be anywhere.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.960
There could be a moment in time
when all the electrons

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.940
are out over here.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.330
There could be a moment in time
where all the electrons

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.810
are over here.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.510
Same thing for this neon atom.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.590
If you think about it, out
of all of the possible

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.690
configurations, let's say we
have these two neon atoms,

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.290
there's actually a very low
likelihood that they're going

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.065
to be completely evenly
distributed.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.770
There's many more scenarios
where the electron

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.560
distribution is a little
uneven in one

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.530
neon atom or another.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.080
So if in this neon atom,
temporarily its eight valence

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.230
electrons just happen to be
like, you know, one, two,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.710
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, then what does this

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.540
neon atom look like?

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.240
It temporarily has a
slight charge in

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.120
this direction, right?

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.770
It'll feel like this side is
more negative than this side

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.170
or this side is more positive
than that side.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.000
Similarly, if at that very same
moment I had another neon

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.710
that had one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.940
that had a similar-- actually,
let me do that differently.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.650
Let's say that this neon atom is
like this: one, two, three,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.930
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.620
So here, and I'll do it in a
dark color because it's a very

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.330
faint force.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.500
So this would be a
little negative.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.055
Temporarly, just for that single
moment in time, this

00:04:10.055 --> 00:04:11.130
will be kind of negative.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.400
That'll be positive.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.530
This side will be negative.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.019
This side will be positive.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.399
So you're going to have a little
bit of an attraction

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.910
for that very small moment of
time between this neon and

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.340
this neon, and then it'll
disappear, because the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.160
electrons will reconfigure.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.150
But the important thing to
realize is that almost at no

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.580
point is neon's electrons
going to be completely

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.140
distributed.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.460
So as long as there's always
going to be this haphazard

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.760
distribution, there's always
going to be a little bit of

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.910
a-- I don't want to say polar
behavior, because that's

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.285
almost too strong of a word.

00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:45.360
But there will always be a
little bit of an extra charge

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.850
on one side or the other side
of an atom, which will allow

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.750
it to attract it to the opposite
side charges of other

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.040
similarly imbalanced
molecules.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.510
And this is a very, very,
very weak force.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.040
It's called the London
dispersion force.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.500
I think the guy who came up with
this, Fritz London, who

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.120
was neither-- well, he
was not British.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.470
I think he was German-American.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.925
London dispersion force, and
it's the weakest of the van

00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:14.175
der Waals forces.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.810
I'm sure I'm not pronouncing
it correctly.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.890
And the van der Waals forces
are the class of all of the

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.490
intermolecular, and in
this case, neon-- the

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.670
molecule, is an atom .

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.040
It's just a one-atom molecule,
I guess you could say.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.760
The van der Waals forces are
the class of all of the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.010
intermolecular forces that are
not covalent bonds and that

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.647
aren't ionic bonds like we have
in salts, and we'll touch

00:05:38.647 --> 00:05:39.230
on those in a second.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.260
And the weakest of them are the
London dispersion forces.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.290
So neon, these noble gases,
actually, all of these noble

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.800
gases right here, the only thing
that they experience are

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.940
London dispersion forces, which
are the weakest of all

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.920
of the intermolecular forces.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.190
And because of that, it takes
very little energy to get them

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.460
into a gaseous state.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.520
So at a very, very low
temperature, the noble gases

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.140
will turn into the
gaseous state.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.670
That's why they're called noble
gases, first of all.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.920
And they're the most likely
to behave like ideal gases

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.820
because they have
very, very small

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.550
attraction to each other.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.500
Fair enough.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.880
Now, what happens when we go
to situations when we go to

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.230
molecules that have better
attractions or that are a

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.290
little bit more polar?

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.670
Let's say I had hydrogen
chloride, right?

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.480
Hydrogen, it's a little bit
ambivalent about whether or

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.660
not it keeps its electrons.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.180
Chloride wants to keep
the electrons.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.250
Chloride's quite
electronegative.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.590
It's less electronegative than
these guys right here.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.710
These are kind of the
super-duper electron hogs,

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.340
nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine,
but chlorine is

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.650
pretty electronegative.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.940
So if I have hydrogen chloride,
so I have the

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:57.200
chlorine atom right here, it has
seven electrons and then

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.210
it shares an electron
with the hydrogen.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.076
It shares an electron with
the hydrogen, and I'll

00:07:02.076 --> 00:07:03.410
just do it like that.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.710
Because this is a good bit
more electronegative than

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.320
hydrogen, the electrons spend
a lot of time out here.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.950
So what you end up having is a
partial negative charge on the

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.740
side, where the electron
hog is, and a

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.270
partial positive side.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.860
And this is actually
very analogous to

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.870
the hydrogen bonds.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.710
Hydrogen bonds are actually a
class of this type of bond,

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.945
which is called a dipole bond,
or dipole-dipole interaction.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.670
So if I have one chlorine atom
like that and if I have

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.700
another chlorine atom,
the other chlorine

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.732
atoms looks like this.

00:07:33.732 --> 00:07:37.480
If I have the other chlorine
atom-- let me copy and paste

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.650
it-- right there, then
you'll have this

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.320
attraction between them.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.440
You'll have this attraction
between these two chlorine

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.490
atoms-- oh, sorry,
between these two

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.930
hydrogen chloride molecules.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.120
And the positive side, the
positive pole of this dipole

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.410
is the hydrogen side, because
the electrons have kind of

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.600
left it, will be attracted
to the chlorine side

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.030
of the other molecules.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.590
And because this van der Waals
force, this dipole-dipole

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.790
interaction is stronger than
a London dispersion force.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.540
And just to be clear, London
dispersion forces occur in all

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.960
molecular interactions.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.630
It's just that it's very weak
when you compare it to pretty

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:19.570
much anything else.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.810
It only becomes relevant when
you talk about things with

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.810
noble gases.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.960
Even here, they're also London
dispersion forces when the

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.360
electron distribution just
happens to go one way or the

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.390
other for a single
instant of time.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.190
But this dipole-dipole
interaction is much stronger.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.130
And because it's much stronger,
hydrogen chloride is

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.700
going to take more energy to,
one, get into the liquid

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.450
state, or even more, get into
the gaseous state than, say,

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.530
just a sample of helium gas.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.700
Now, when you get even more
electronegative, when this

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.220
guy's even more electronegative
when you're

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.920
dealing with nitrogen, oxygen
or fluorine, you get into a

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.720
special case of dipole-dipole
interactions, and that's the

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.590
hydrogen bond.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:06.480
So it's really the same thing if
you have hydrogen fluoride,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.140
a bunch of hydrogen fluorides
around the place.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.180
Maybe I could write fluoride,
and I'll write hydrogen

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.100
fluoride here.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.030
Fluoride its
ultra-electronegative.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.220
It's one of the three most
electronegative atoms on the

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.950
Periodic Table, and
so it pretty much

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.290
hogs all of the electrons.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:35.080
So this is a super-strong case
of the dipole-dipole

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.920
interaction, where here, all of
the electrons are going to

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.110
be hogged around the
fluorine side.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.180
So you're going to have a
partial positive charge,

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.270
partial negative side, partial
positive, partial negative,

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.105
partial positive, partial
negative and so on.

00:09:49.105 --> 00:09:52.830
So you're going to have this,
which is really a dipole

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.430
interaction.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.990
But it's a very strong dipole
interaction, so people call it

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.470
a hydrogen bond because it's
dealing with hydrogen and a

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.640
very electronegative atom, where
the electronegative atom

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.690
is pretty much hogging all of
hydrogen's one electron.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.720
So hydrogen is sitting out here
with just a proton, so

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.560
it's going to be pretty
positive, and it's really

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.660
attracted to the negative
side of these molecules.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.530
But hydrogen, all of these
are van der Waals.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.700
So van der Waals, the weakest
is London dispersion.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:24.610
Then if you have a molecule with
a more electronegative

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.900
atom, then you start having a
dipole, where you have one

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.330
side where molecule becomes
polar and you have the

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.290
interaction between the positive
and the negative side

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.670
of the pole.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.020
It gets a dipole-dipole
interaction.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.390
And then an even stronger type
of bond is a hydrogen bond

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.780
because the
super-electronegative atom is

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.670
essentially stripping off the
electron of the hydrogen, or

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.060
almost stripping it off.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.250
It's still shared,
but it's all on

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.420
that side of the molecule.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.940
Since this is even a stronger
bond between molecules, it

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.660
will have even a higher
boiling point.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:11:01.380
So London dispersion, and you
have dipole or polar bonds,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:06.370
and then you have
hydrogen bonds.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.310
All of these are van der
Waals, but because the

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.360
strength of the intermolecular
bond gets stronger, boiling

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.300
point goes up because it takes
more and more energy to

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.390
separate these from
each other.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.190
In the next video-- I realize
I'm out of time.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.040
So this is a good survey, I
think, of just the different

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.370
types of intermolecular
interactions that aren't

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.950
necessarily covalent or ionic.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.360
In the next video, I'll talk
about some of the covalent and

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.900
ionic types of structures that
can be formed and how that

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.900
might affect the different
boiling points.
