00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.222
You may know this feeling:

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.547
you wake up to multiple unread
notifications on your mobile phone.

00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:21.714
Your calendar is already
packed with meetings,

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:24.187
sometimes double- or triple-booked.

00:00:24.822 --> 00:00:26.818
You feel engaged, you feel busy.

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:29.328
In fact, you feel productive.

00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:34.966
But at the end of it all,
something still feels missing.

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:38.203
You try to figure out what it is.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.506
But before you do,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.288
the next day starts all over again.

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:46.780
That was how I felt two years ago.

00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:50.452
I felt stressed; I felt anxious.

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.473
I felt a bit trapped.

00:00:53.457 --> 00:00:56.457
The world around me
was moving very quickly.

00:00:57.431 --> 00:00:59.365
And I didn't know what to do.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.656
I started wondering to myself:

00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:03.776
How do I keep up with all this?

00:01:04.257 --> 00:01:06.815
How do we find fulfillment

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:10.973
in a world that's literally changing
as fast as we can think,

00:01:11.627 --> 00:01:13.603
or maybe even faster?

00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:17.167
I started looking for answers.

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:20.397
I spoke to many people,
I spoke to my friends,

00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:21.895
I spoke to my family.

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:24.288
I even read many self-help books.

00:01:25.615 --> 00:01:28.005
But I couldn't find anything satisfactory.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.950
In fact, the more self-help books I read,

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:33.479
the more stressed and anxious I became.

00:01:33.503 --> 00:01:34.649
(Laughter)

00:01:34.673 --> 00:01:37.974
It was like I was feeding
my mind with junk food,

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:40.763
and I was becoming mentally obese.

00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:42.823
(Laughter)

00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:44.069
I was about to give up,

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.528
until one day, I found this.

00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:52.846
"The Tao Te Ching:
The Book of the Way and Its Virtue."

00:01:54.028 --> 00:01:57.172
This is an ancient Chinese
philosophy classic

00:01:57.196 --> 00:01:59.940
that was written
more than 2,600 years ago.

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:05.334
And it was by far the thinnest
and the smallest book on the bookshelf.

00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:07.859
It only had 81 pages.

00:02:08.488 --> 00:02:10.555
And each page had a short poem.

00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:14.520
I remember I flipped
to one particular poem.

00:02:15.206 --> 00:02:16.358
Here it is.

00:02:16.382 --> 00:02:17.634
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:19.109
(Laughter)

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:20.412
Let me read it out to you.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.548
"The supreme goodness is like water.

00:02:25.473 --> 00:02:28.245
It benefits all things without contention.

00:02:29.038 --> 00:02:31.564
In dwelling, it stays grounded.

00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:34.688
In being, it flows to depths.

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:37.603
In expression, it is honest.

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:41.497
In confrontation, it stays gentle.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.758
In governance, it does not control.

00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:47.324
In action, it aligns to timing.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.965
It is content with its nature

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.606
and therefore cannot be faulted."

00:02:54.998 --> 00:02:57.887
Wow! I remember
when I first read this passage.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:01.048
I felt the biggest chills down my spine.

00:03:01.553 --> 00:03:03.949
I still feel that today,
reading it to you guys.

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:08.300
My anxiety and stress
just suddenly disappeared.

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.874
Ever since that day,

00:03:10.898 --> 00:03:15.955
I've been trying to apply the concepts
in this passage to my day-to-day life.

00:03:16.406 --> 00:03:19.707
And today, I'd like to share with you
three lessons I learned so far

00:03:19.731 --> 00:03:21.580
from this philosophy of water --

00:03:21.604 --> 00:03:25.962
three lessons that I believe
have helped me find greater fulfillment

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:27.627
in almost everything that I do.

00:03:29.023 --> 00:03:31.540
The first lesson is about humility.

00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:34.785
If we think about water
flowing in a river,

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:36.804
it is always staying low.

00:03:37.847 --> 00:03:40.910
It helps all the plants grow
and keeps all the animals alive.

00:03:41.427 --> 00:03:43.997
It doesn't actually draw
any attention to itself,

00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:46.356
nor does it need
any reward or recognition.

00:03:47.442 --> 00:03:48.710
It is humble.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:52.291
But without water's humble contribution,

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.848
life as we know it may not exist.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.692
Water's humility taught me
a few important things.

00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:04.000
It taught me that instead of acting
like I know what I'm doing

00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:05.720
or I have all the answers,

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:07.799
it's perfectly OK to say,

00:04:07.823 --> 00:04:09.188
"I don't know.

00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:10.609
I want to learn more,

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:11.885
and I need your help."

00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:17.004
It also taught me that, instead
of promoting my glory and success,

00:04:17.028 --> 00:04:20.886
it is so much more satisfying to promote
the success and glory of others.

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:25.783
It taught me that, instead of doing things
where I can get ahead,

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.879
it so much more fulfilling and meaningful

00:04:27.903 --> 00:04:31.433
to help other people overcome
their challenges so they can succeed.

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:34.625
With a humble mindset,

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:38.484
I was able to form a lot richer
connections with the people around me.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.775
I became genuinely interested
in the stories and experiences

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.751
that make them unique and magical.

00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:46.530
Life became a lot more fun,

00:04:46.554 --> 00:04:49.601
because every day I'd discover
new quirks, new ideas

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:52.029
and new solutions to problems
I didn't know before,

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.460
all thanks to the ideas
and help from others.

00:04:57.093 --> 00:04:59.926
All streams eventually flow to the ocean

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.658
because it is lower than them.

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:05.913
Humility gives water its power.

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:11.053
But I think it gives us the capacity
to remain grounded,

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:12.435
to be present,

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:17.006
to learn from and be transformed by
the stories of the people around us.

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:21.357
The second lesson I learned
is about harmony.

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.291
If we think about
water flowing towards a rock,

00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:25.678
it will just flow around it.

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:28.704
It doesn't get upset,
it doesn't get angry,

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.252
it doesn't get agitated.

00:05:30.276 --> 00:05:32.157
In fact, it doesn't feel much at all.

00:05:32.687 --> 00:05:37.156
When faced with an obstacle,
somehow water finds a solution,

00:05:37.662 --> 00:05:39.995
without force, without conflict.

00:05:41.955 --> 00:05:44.583
When I was thinking through this,
I began to understand

00:05:44.607 --> 00:05:47.082
why I was feeling stressed out
in the first place.

00:05:47.506 --> 00:05:50.022
Instead of working in harmony
with my environment,

00:05:50.046 --> 00:05:51.712
I was working against it.

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:53.867
I was forcing things to change

00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:57.915
because I was consumed
by the need to succeed or to prove myself.

00:05:58.616 --> 00:06:00.251
In the end, nothing did.

00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:02.322
And I got more frustrated.

00:06:03.211 --> 00:06:06.656
By simply shifting my focus
from trying to achieve more success

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.426
to trying to achieve more harmony,

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.920
I was immediately able
to feel calm and focused again.

00:06:13.796 --> 00:06:15.653
I started asking questions like:

00:06:15.677 --> 00:06:18.399
Will this action bring me greater harmony

00:06:18.423 --> 00:06:20.755
and bring more harmony to my environment?

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.119
Does this align with my nature?

00:06:24.388 --> 00:06:27.261
I became more comfortable
simply being who I am,

00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:30.197
rather than who I'm supposed to be
or expected to be.

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:33.768
Work actually became easier,

00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:36.522
because I stopped focusing
on things that I cannot control

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:38.403
and only on the things that I can.

00:06:38.427 --> 00:06:41.220
I stopped fighting with myself,

00:06:41.244 --> 00:06:44.928
and I learned to work
with my environment to solve its problems.

00:06:46.267 --> 00:06:48.274
Nature does not hurry.

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:50.737
Yet, everything is accomplished.

00:06:51.704 --> 00:06:55.252
That's Tao Te Ching's way
of describing the power of harmony.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.346
Just as water is able to find a solution
without force or conflict,

00:07:01.006 --> 00:07:05.149
I believe we can find a greater
sense of fulfillment in our endeavors

00:07:05.173 --> 00:07:08.474
by shifting focus
from achieving more success

00:07:08.498 --> 00:07:09.958
to achieving more harmony.

00:07:11.228 --> 00:07:15.387
The third lesson I learned
from the philosophy of water

00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:16.849
is about openness.

00:07:17.744 --> 00:07:19.863
Water is open to change.

00:07:20.395 --> 00:07:24.318
Depending on the temperature,
it can be a liquid, solid or gas.

00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:26.497
Depending on the medium it's in,

00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:29.772
it can be a teapot, a cup
or a flower vase.

00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:34.876
In fact, it's water's ability to adapt
and change and remain flexible

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.265
that made it so enduring through the ages,

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.530
despite all the changes
in the environment.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:44.356
We also live in a world today
of constant change.

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:48.185
We can no longer expect to work
to a static job description

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:50.174
or follow a single career path.

00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:54.625
We, too, are expected to constantly
reinvent and refresh our skills

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:55.799
to stay relevant.

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:00.213
In our organization,
we host a lot of hackathons,

00:08:00.237 --> 00:08:02.493
where small groups
or individuals come together

00:08:02.517 --> 00:08:05.259
to solve a business problem
in a compressed time frame.

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.878
And what's interesting to me
is that the teams that usually win

00:08:08.902 --> 00:08:12.244
are not the ones with the most
experienced team members,

00:08:12.268 --> 00:08:15.053
but the ones with members
who are open to learn,

00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:16.677
who are open to unlearn

00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:19.117
and who are open to helping each other

00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:21.601
navigate through
the changing circumstances.

00:08:23.244 --> 00:08:25.176
Life is like a hackathon in some way.

00:08:26.014 --> 00:08:30.358
It's calling to each and every one of us
to step up, to open up

00:08:30.382 --> 00:08:31.851
and cause a ripple effect.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.967
Now, we can stay behind closed doors
and continue to be paralyzed

00:08:36.991 --> 00:08:39.799
by our self-limiting beliefs, such as:

00:08:39.823 --> 00:08:42.356
"I will never be able to talk
about Chinese philosophy

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.784
in front of a huge audience."

00:08:43.808 --> 00:08:44.856
(Laughter)

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.355
Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride.

00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:50.099
It can only be an amazing experience.

00:08:51.077 --> 00:08:54.119
So humility, harmony and openness.

00:08:54.703 --> 00:08:58.308
Those are the three lessons I learned
from the philosophy of water so far.

00:08:58.752 --> 00:09:01.324
They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O,

00:09:01.348 --> 00:09:02.518
or H2O.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:03.605
(Laughter)

00:09:03.629 --> 00:09:06.876
And they have become
my guiding principles in life.

00:09:07.885 --> 00:09:10.505
So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed,

00:09:10.529 --> 00:09:14.001
unfulfilled, anxious
or just not sure what to do,

00:09:14.025 --> 00:09:15.538
I simply ask the question:

00:09:16.247 --> 00:09:17.700
What would water do?

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:18.946
(Laughter)

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.526
This simple and powerful question
inspired by a book

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:27.306
written long before the days
of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.045
has changed my life for the better.

00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:32.140
Try it, and let me know
how it works for you.

00:09:32.164 --> 00:09:33.680
I would love to hear from you.

00:09:33.704 --> 00:09:34.855
Thank you.

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:40.968
(Applause)
