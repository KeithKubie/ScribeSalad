00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.360
 
a major scientific question is to be

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370
a major scientific question is to be
 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.510
a major scientific question is to be
able to predict what shape and RNA will

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520
able to predict what shape and RNA will
 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.660
able to predict what shape and RNA will
fold into in practice and we know that

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
fold into in practice and we know that
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.510
fold into in practice and we know that
our models aren't good enough to do this

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520
our models aren't good enough to do this
 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.550
our models aren't good enough to do this
so we have computer models but they

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560
so we have computer models but they
 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.200
so we have computer models but they
don't explain how RNA is fold in

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210
don't explain how RNA is fold in
 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.900
don't explain how RNA is fold in
practice and what a scientist would

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
practice and what a scientist would
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.049
practice and what a scientist would
really do is perform experiments and see

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:27.059
really do is perform experiments and see
 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.549
really do is perform experiments and see
how those experiments work and then

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:28.559
how those experiments work and then
 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:31.729
how those experiments work and then
repeat and so on and so forth and what

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739
repeat and so on and so forth and what
 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.910
repeat and so on and so forth and what
eterna does is open up this whole

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
eterna does is open up this whole
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.090
eterna does is open up this whole
scientific cycle to the public and allow

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
scientific cycle to the public and allow
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.310
scientific cycle to the public and allow
them to propose experiments see the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
them to propose experiments see the
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.990
them to propose experiments see the
results and then propose more

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
results and then propose more
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.959
results and then propose more
experiments and ultimately we hope help

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
experiments and ultimately we hope help
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.660
experiments and ultimately we hope help
us generate hypotheses about Wynn RNAs

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
us generate hypotheses about Wynn RNAs
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.410
us generate hypotheses about Wynn RNAs
fold the way they do and why they do so

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
fold the way they do and why they do so
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.689
fold the way they do and why they do so
just like basketball where you score by

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
just like basketball where you score by
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.149
just like basketball where you score by
throwing a ball through a hoop in Eterna

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159
throwing a ball through a hoop in Eterna
 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.569
throwing a ball through a hoop in Eterna
you score if the RNA you design folds

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
you score if the RNA you design folds
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.680
you score if the RNA you design folds
properly in the lab so it's a completely

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690
properly in the lab so it's a completely
 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.620
properly in the lab so it's a completely
new kind of scoring mechanism and we're

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
new kind of scoring mechanism and we're
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.980
new kind of scoring mechanism and we're
really excited about what this means as

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
really excited about what this means as
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.900
really excited about what this means as
a new kind of game and a new kind of way

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910
a new kind of game and a new kind of way
 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.510
a new kind of game and a new kind of way
to make scientific progress there's no

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
to make scientific progress there's no
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.130
to make scientific progress there's no
questions of referees or whether the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
questions of referees or whether the
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.140
questions of referees or whether the
balls in or out because you're scored

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
balls in or out because you're scored
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.200
balls in or out because you're scored
based on the laws of nature
