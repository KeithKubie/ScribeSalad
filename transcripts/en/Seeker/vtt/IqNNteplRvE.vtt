00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.149
Why does my bottled water have an expiration
date?

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.120
Does this stuff actually go bad?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.660
Hi everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.570
Have you ever left a glass of water out overnight,
and the next day taken a drink and noticed

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.650
it tasted funny?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.230
Does that mean the water is going bad, what’s
happening here?

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.090
Well the water itself doesn’t have any sugars
or proteins like food so microbes aren’t

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.420
consuming it and rotting it.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.720
However, that’s not to say the chemistry
of the water hasn’t changed.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.910
By being exposed to air, the water absorbs
some CO2 and a tiny portion of that, about

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.069
0.13%, is converted into carbonic acid.

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:38.800
Some carbonic acid will then lose a proton
or two, forming bicarbonate and carbonate

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.800
respectively.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.739
This lowers the pH of water, making it slightly
acidic, and changing the taste.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.600
So does that mean it’s unsafe?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.690
Probably not, no.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.339
Unless you were a shellfish.

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.749
Carbonic acid forms about 4 million times
more bicarbonate than carbonate, and shellfish

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.710
need carbonate to build their shells.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.199
The bias towards bicarbonate production means
they have less to build their shells from.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.469
Not only that, but the higher acidity can
actually dissolve shells.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.940
Since the industrial revolution, the ocean
surface has become slightly more acidic.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.189
So if you love oysters, there’s another
reason to care about CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.090
Anyway if you’re a human, the small shift
in pH isn’t going to be what hurts you.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.850
The problem is water in an unsealed container
has been exposed to bacteria.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.400
Most tap and bottled water has chlorine additives,
which will keep the microbes from multiplying

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.500
for a day or two.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.960
But after that they can go crazy.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.830
Water left outside can also start to grow
algae and host mosquito larvae, which will

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.490
make you sick and is gross to think about,
but not as gross as thinking about the dust

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.750
inside your house landing in your water!

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.060
It can be purified with chemicals, like iodine
or chlorine, or it can be filtered and boiled

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.090
and it’ll be good as new.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.469
Again, it’s not the H2O breaking down and
going bad, it’s just hosting other nastiness

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:44.850
that spoils the taste.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.619
Our ancestors didn’t have the benefit of
germ theory or chemical purification, so when

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.060
their water became unsanitary, they had to
come up with a different solution.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.080
When they set out for long voyages, europeans
sailors had stores of water in wooden barrels.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.439
After a few weeks though, it would start to
grow algae, so to get around this, sailors

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.079
also brought along beer.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.030
And when the beer ran out, they switched to
that old pirate favorite, rum.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.980
The alcohol in the beer and rum killed off
bacteria, but the side effect was drunken

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.420
sailors early in the morning.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.890
In fact, British sailors actually got a daily
rum ration until 1970.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.040
Now though we can store water indefinitely
without having to worry about its safety,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.610
provided it’s stored correctly.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.190
The CDC says commercially bottled water is
the safest, but it should still be stored

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.530
out of direct sunlight.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.050
Some plastics release a hormone disruptor
called bisphenol-A, or BPA, into the water

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.100
when heated.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.220
Plastic bottles are also permeable so water
should be stored away from pesticides and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.220
gasoline.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.520
Aside from that though, you don’t have to
worry about the expiration date on bottled

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.520
water.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.720
That’s a holdover from an old New Jersey
law that has since been repealed because there’s

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.640
no scientific evidence to support it.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.540
Gotta love it when science informs lawmaking.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.110
So now the question is, how much water do
you actually need to drink?

00:02:49.110 --> 00:03:00.500
Trace covers that here.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.180
Have you gotten sick from drinking water?

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.230
Did you switch to rum?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.300
Or do you have any other questions you want
us to field?
