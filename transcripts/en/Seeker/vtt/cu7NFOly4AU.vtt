00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.590
As an almost adult, man I gotta say, I would
do anything to get nap time back.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:11.080
But are there some ways acting like a child,
can make life better as an adult.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.769
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.820
Well I now have to cut the crusts off my own
pb&amp;js but life is going pretty okay as adult.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.670
I do miss some things, like recess and naps,
but lately research is showing that bringing

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.720
back certain kid’s games can do grown ups
some good.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.180
Because researchers can never take things
too seriously, two researchers defined adult

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.340
playfulness as “a predisposition to define
and engage in activities in a non-serious

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.610
or fanciful manner to increase enjoyment.”

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.110
Very… playful, guys.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.580
And grown ups do this all the time.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.480
We go out for karaoke, we ski, we improv,
whatever.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.220
So why do we keep up the games?

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.730
Well some research suggests it could help
us find a mate.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.710
One study published in the American Journal
of Play found that playfulness was important

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.710
in partner selection.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.460
Participants filled out a survey of desired
traits in a partner, and traits like 'sense

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.530
of humor,' 'fun loving' and 'playful' topped
both men and women’s lists.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.430
The researchers suggested this means these
traits arose from sexual selection.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.090
And that maybe playfulness in men suggested
to women that they were less aggressive and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.940
playfulness in women suggested to men that
they were healthy, youthful and maybe fertile.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.260
So what kind of activities do adults “play”?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.610
Well skiing was researched in a study published
in the journal Applied Research in Quality

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.610
of Life.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.780
The researchers found that skiing had high
rates of engagement and involvement.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.250
Engagement in this case meaning, you get so
into doing a thing, you lose sense of everything

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.250
else around you.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920
You get lost in it.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.800
Involvement in this case
is how much that activity gives you a sense

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.750
of meaning and a sense of being a part of
something greater than yourself.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.060
The researchers suggest that like participating
in fun activities like skiing with high engagement

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.659
and involvement helps people grow emotionally
and socially.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.420
One of the researchers said that "Adult playfulness
can influence people's happiness...and contribute

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.330
to overall well-being,” Which can buffer
us from life’s stresses.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.560
But if you want to find some peace and don’t
have any ski slopes near you, maybe you should

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.640
pick up a coloring book.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.130
One of the most popular adult play activities
lately is coloring.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.500
Not your typical, princess style book either.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.500
Oh no, these coloring books are complex and
intricate.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.370
These patterns repeat and weave across the
page.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.340
These kind of books are helping tons of people
de-stress and relax.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.480
Research like one study published in the journal
Palliative &amp; Supportive Care shows that making

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.630
art can often help those who deal with stress
and anxiety and improves coping resources.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.780
Yet facing a blank page can be daunting.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.310
Where do you even start?

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.440
But coloring books give us a way into our
creativity without seeming overwhelming.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.800
The lines guide us and all we have to choose
is what color the next flower will be.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.720
It’s definitely an engaging task that helps
us leave our stress behind.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.630
Psychologists say that coloring has a calming
effect.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.370
Psychologist Gloria Martinez Ayala told the
Huffington Post that “The relaxation that

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.280
it provides lowers the activity of the amygdala,
a basic part of our brain involved in controlling

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.340
emotion that is affected by stress.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.050
So play does all sorts of things for us as
adults!

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.460
It helps us focus, helps us destress, and
of course it could even help us land the one.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.349
So go outside and play!

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.400
After a ten-year wait, the all-new Tacoma
is finally here.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.459
It’s been fully redesigned to play whenever
and wherever you want.The new Toyota Tacoma

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:52.879
encourages you 
to break the rules, and PLAY NOW.
