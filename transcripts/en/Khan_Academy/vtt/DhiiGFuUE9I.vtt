00:00:00.665 --> 00:00:02.859
- [Voiceover] Diana the dog receives five

00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.582
dog biscuits for fetching each frisbee,

00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:08.264
and three dog biscuits
for fetching each ball.

00:00:08.264 --> 00:00:10.072
Sounds like a pretty good deal.

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:12.144
She plans to receive at most D

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.765
dog biscuits before chasing her tail.

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:16.248
Well, that's sounds reasonable.

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:18.544
The inequality graph
below represents the set

00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:22.323
of all combinations where
Diana fetches F frisbees

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:25.022
and fetches B balls in order to receive

00:00:25.022 --> 00:00:27.772
at most, at most, D dog biscuits

00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:30.148
'cause at that point she
reasonably starts chasing her tail.

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:31.876
According to the graph, we're gonna take

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:33.359
a look at the graph in a second,

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.854
according to the graph, what
is the most number of dog

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:40.714
biscuits Diana wants to receive
before chasing her tail?

00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:43.254
In other words, what is D?

00:00:43.254 --> 00:00:46.117
So let's look at, let's
interpret this graph properly.

00:00:46.832 --> 00:00:49.412
So if we look at the horizontal
axis right over here,

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:52.199
that's F, that's the number of frisbees,

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.177
the number of frisbees
she catches, frisbees

00:00:57.177 --> 00:01:00.671
and this vertical axis,
this is the number of balls,

00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:05.671
number of, number of balls that she gets

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:07.863
and we know what the total number

00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:09.773
of biscuits are going to be.

00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:13.329
The total from catching frisbees,
if she catches F frisbees,

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.767
she gets five biscuits per frisbee

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:18.875
so the total from catching frisbees is 5F

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:22.025
and if she catches, if she catches B balls

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:26.575
or retrieves B balls so
if she gets those B balls,

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:28.628
if she gets, what was it? Three?

00:01:28.628 --> 00:01:30.273
Three biscuits per ball? Yep!

00:01:30.273 --> 00:01:32.793
Three dog biscuits for fetching each ball,

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:34.804
the total number of dog biscuits she gets

00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:39.804
for catching B balls is
3B and so the total number

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:45.259
of biscuits she fetches is 5F plus 3B.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.925
This is the number of
biscuits from frisbees.

00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:49.444
This is the number of biscuits from balls.

00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:51.821
Now we can see all of the
allowable combinations

00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:54.950
of number of frisbees
and number of balls here.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.002
And so for example, if she catches

00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:58.383
that point right over there, eight

00:01:58.383 --> 00:02:00.943
or retrieves eight balls and catches,

00:02:00.943 --> 00:02:02.569
well, that would be half of a frisbee,

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.108
so that doesn't, that
doesn't seem to make sense

00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:10.108
but if she retrieves eight
balls and catches one frisbee

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.807
well, then, that's still
ok, she still hasn't met her

00:02:13.807 --> 00:02:16.500
maximum number of biscuits yet.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.675
So how do we think about the
maximum number of biscuits?

00:02:18.675 --> 00:02:20.827
Well, the maximum number of biscuits

00:02:20.827 --> 00:02:22.596
are any of these points when she,

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:25.500
that are sitting on this line
and notice, the solutions

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.533
that where all the points
it satisfies this inequality

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:30.479
are all below this line
so she's hitting a maximum

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:32.511
when she's on the line and an easy one

00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:36.798
might be this point right
over here where we see that,

00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:41.288
where we see that frisbees,
zero frisbees and 10

00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:45.818
and 10 balls pretty much
maximizes her number of biscuits.

00:02:45.818 --> 00:02:48.846
So if she catches 10 balls,
so let me write this down,

00:02:48.846 --> 00:02:51.934
so if B is equal to 10, B is equal to 10,

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:56.126
F is zero, if F is equal to zero

00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:59.458
and B is equal to 10, well,
how many is she going to catch?

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:02.201
Or how many biscuits is she going to get?

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.562
Well, she's going to get,
this is gonna be zero

00:03:04.562 --> 00:03:07.182
and then three times 10 is 30,

00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:11.185
so that's gonna be 30
biscuits, 30 biscuits.

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:13.764
So this point right over
here, this corresponds

00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:18.032
with 30 biscuits, 30 biscuits

00:03:19.693 --> 00:03:21.500
and you can see that any of these points

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.828
along this blue line, actually
correspond to 30 biscuits.

00:03:24.828 --> 00:03:27.683
If you go over here, where F is six,

00:03:27.683 --> 00:03:30.507
let me write it here, F is equal to six

00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:33.940
and B is equal to zero so
spends all of her time,

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.444
she's earns her biscuits purely

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:38.268
through frisbee catching,
so this is a situation

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:41.072
where F is equal to six
and B is equal to zero,

00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:42.819
you still have the same scenario,

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.292
you still have, if F is
six, five times six is 30

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.386
plus three times zero,
we'll that's just gonna be

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:52.652
once again, 30 biscuits, 30 biscuits.

00:03:52.652 --> 00:03:55.111
So her maximum, or the number of biscuits

00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:58.482
she needs before starts
chasing her tail is 30.

00:03:58.482 --> 00:04:02.262
So D is going to be 30 and
in fact, we can express

00:04:02.262 --> 00:04:05.720
this inequality as a 5F plus 3B has

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.581
to be less than or equal to 30.

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:11.835
Alright, then they ask
us another question.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.070
Can Diana fulfill her plan by fetching,

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.537
can Diana fulfill her plan by fetching

00:04:17.537 --> 00:04:20.069
four frisbees and two balls?

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:23.056
So let's see, four frisbees and two balls,

00:04:23.558 --> 00:04:28.558
this is right over here,
four frisbees and two balls.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.000
So it's not, we're not saying that she

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.803
has to maximize, that she
has to get the 30 biscuits,

00:04:32.803 --> 00:04:36.054
she just cannot eat any
more than 30 biscuits.

00:04:36.054 --> 00:04:41.054
So it seems like she can
fulfill her plan, let me see.

00:04:41.065 --> 00:04:43.400
The inequality graphed below
represents all the combinations

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.677
where Diana fetches F frisbees and B balls

00:04:45.677 --> 00:04:48.480
in order to receive at
most D dog biscuits.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.480
So let's see, is she fulfilling
her plan by fetching,

00:04:54.164 --> 00:04:57.949
well, yeah, I would say, yes.
