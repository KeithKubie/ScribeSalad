00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.840
As humans, we have a strong need to feel like the masters of our own fate.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.720
And when your freedom of choice is threatened,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.300
it creates an arousal in the body and brain, and the motivation to react,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.040
ultimately compelling you to do things you're told not to do.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.500
Like watching this video.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.440
Let's try a little thought experiment.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.880
Please don't think about a white bear right now.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.360
Oops, you're probably thinking about one.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.760
Studies that give participants the same instructions

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.320
and have them think out loud for five minutes find that

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.820
on average, the white bear appears in their thoughts

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.200
not only at the onset of the experiment, but once every minute.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.920
This automatic compulsion manifests in more concrete ways as well.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.200
Like the literary world, where the attempted banning of books

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.760
has often led to them being more successful.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.840
Seriously. Books like The Great Gatsby,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.200
Catcher in The Rye, and To Kill A Mockingbird

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.020
are some of the most frequently banned books in the world

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.980
yet some of the most successful.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.500
So why can't we help ourselves?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.260
The impulse comes from the perception that we're losing our freedom

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.120
and is a psychological behaviour called reactance.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.960
Have you ever been told you couldn't have something

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.320
only to realise you that it made you want it more,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.120
when in the first place you never even really wanted it?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.480
A classic example is the limitation of alcohol consumption.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.160
In the late 80s, when the U.S. increased the legal drinking age to 21,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.460
a study of thousands of people found that those affected by the new law

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.060
had higher than expected alcohol consumption

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.020
compared to their legal age counterparts.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.160
Studies have even found that there's an increased interest in entertainment programming

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.560
when it begins with a warning.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.540
Viewer discretion is advised.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.760
Our curiosity is a powerful force

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.780
which has lead to the successful rise of clickbait on the internet.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.480
Titles like, "A wealthy person lost all their money!"

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.280
"You won't believe what happened next!"

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.700
gives you essential information that leaves a gap in the knowledge that you must fulfil.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.960
Known as the information gap theory, we're primed to want to fill in the blanks.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.460
This taps into our psychological and physiological response.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.880
In fact, studies measuring pupil arousal

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.840
showed that if you were more emotionally aroused from a headline

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.220
you're more likely to click it.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.580
And we put up with clickbait because, well, sometimes it works.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.060
Sometimes we get the satisfaction and release of dopamine we wanted

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.980
by satiating our desire to fill in the information gap.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.980
Which makes your desire to click next time even stronger.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.160
In the same way, when we disobey rules,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.720
we can also find pleasure in a surge of dopamine which creates positive reinforcement.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.080
You may also be a genetically predisposed rule-breaker.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.471
Studies on twins and adopted children have shown

00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:24.360
how your genes play a large role in how impulsive you are.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.980
In general, people with lower levels of baseline seratonin

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.560
were seen to have increased impulsive behaviour

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.020
which led to breaking the rules.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.660
With all that said, don't you dare go watching more AsapSCIENCE videos.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.600
You're simply not allowed.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.300
I'm putting this playlist right here, but its not for you.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.140
And you better not subscribe for more weekly videos every Thursday.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.100
We won't see you back here then.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.080
Bye.
