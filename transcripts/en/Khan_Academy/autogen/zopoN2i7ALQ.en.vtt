00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
 . 

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.370
 What I would like to do in this presentation is to try to understand how 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.960
 The protein component has to interact with each other in association with 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.210
 ATP even produce mechanical movement 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.320
 The reason I want to do this - First, it happens 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.570
 Extra muscle cells, however 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.025
 It will be the first presentation on how muscles work 

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:23.310
 Then we will talk about nerve stimulation 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.080
 Muscles until you do their job 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.580
 That's all I'll do in this show 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.000
 What I did here is that I copied and pasted two pictures 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.480
 For the protein from Wikipedia 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.470
 This is myosin 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.110
 It's already myosin 2 because it contains 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.410
 Myosin protein 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.150
 They are tangled around each other and you can see that 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.040
 A complex view of protein or enzyme, however you wish 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.696
 To say 

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:48.430
 I will tell you what the enzyme is called - because it is 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.030
 Helps in the interaction of ATP with ADP and phosphate groups 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.460
 This is why ATPase is called 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.150
 It is a subcategory of ATPase enzymes 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.530
 The one here is actin 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.850
 What we will see in this presentation is how the Mosin 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.920
 ATP is used to extend 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.830
 You can also see it as a laxative and this is what 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.790
 Creates mechanical energy 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.490
 Let us draw it then 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.240
 I will draw him on these two acts here 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.280
 Let's assume that we have one of these meosin heads 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.740
 When I tell the head of the mosquito, this one of the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.140
 The heads of the moss are here and then linked, or intertwined 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.060
 And loves you around some of it 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.630
 This one else wraps around 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.900
 Now let's say we are dealing with one 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.730
 From the heads of myosin 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.050
 Let's just say it's on this site 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.450
 Let me check the quality of my drawing 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.370
 Let's assume that if you start from a site it looks like this 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.650
 Then this is the tail which is linked 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.480
 In another building we will talk about this 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.580
 More specifically, but now this is the head of myosin and this 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.490
 The starting site, does nothing 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.990
 Now, ATP can extend and bind to this Miocene head, this 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.940
 Enzyme, this protein, this enzyme is ATPase 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.210
 Let me paint some of the ATP 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.820
 If ATP extends and is associated with this here 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.850
 Let's say that - and will not be 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.940
 The bond is strong with this protein, but this is so 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.240
 Gives you the decency 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.120
 And soon ATP will link to the appropriate location of this 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.400
 The enzyme or protein, the enzyme, is separated from actin 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.520
 Let me write this down 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:44.560
 If first, ATP binds to the head of myosin as soon as 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:58.390
 This occurs, causing the myosin release of actin 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.720
 This is the first step 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.050
 I started with this one that touches Actin 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.570
 The ATP comes and then is released 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.570
 If in the next step - after that step, it will appear 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.815
 So - and I want to draw it 

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:11.990
 In the same place 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.300
 After that step, it will seem 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.810
 So 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.060
 Will be liberated 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.910
 Will be liberated 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.160
 If it looks like this now we have ATP 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.870
 Associated with it 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.970
 I know that this is a bit complicated when it continues 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.450
 Writing on the same thing, but we have 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.610
 ATP is associated with it 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.320
 Now the next step - ATP hydrolysis, phosphate 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.430
 It will be uprooted 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.330
 This enzyme is ATPase 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.320
 That's what he does 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.570
 Let me write this down 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:54.250
 . 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.670
 And what he does, he frees energy to lift 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.030
 This myosin protein has a high degree of energy 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.370
 Let me take the second step 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.310
 This - it decomposes 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.250
 It frees energy 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.500
 We know that ATP is a spread of energy 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.290
 Biological systems. If it frees energy 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.579
 I paint it with a spark or an explosion, but 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.010
 You can imagine it changing the assertion - 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.540
 It beats this protein here until it moves 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.750
 To a position where it is able to crawl along the meosin 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.500
 If in the second step - + energy, energy then this - can 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:44.500
 To say that it raises protein or myosin 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.410
 To higher energy 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.940
 You can imagine it pulsing with a pulsating load 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.650
 For higher energy 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.820
 And the emphasis on protein to be shaped 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.970
 If the second step - what happens is that the phosphate group - 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.830
 They are still linked, but separate from 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.950
 Rest of the ATP 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.770
 If ADP and that energy change 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.420
 The installation if this protein now moves to 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.230
 The site looks like this 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.545
 Here we finish the second step 

00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:27.490
 Let me make sure it is correct 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.130
 At the end of the second step, it will appear 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.380
 So 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.860
 So 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.930
 At the end of the second step, the protein will look 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:40.560
 So 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.260
 It's in its highest position 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.670
 He has some energy now 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.620
 And ends on this site 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.500
 We still have the ADP 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.810
 We still have - this is the adenosine and let's assume 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.780
 We have two phosphate groups on ADP and 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.560
 We still have one phosphate group there 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.490
 Now, when the phosphate group is released - let me write 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.040
 This is the third step 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.380
 And remember, when we started, we were here 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.190
 In the first step the ATP binds - in fact, it does 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.440
 Connects, at the end of the first step, this causes in 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.880
 Edit myosin protein 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.060
 Then after the first step, we will take the second step 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.470
 ATP will be converted into ADP phosphate 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.850
 It frees energy and allows for myocene 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.230
 It rises to this degree of high energy as a kind of 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.620
 Link, you can think of, to the next degree 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.480
 Of the Actin line 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.965
 Now we smoke in a high degree of energy 

00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:47.160
 The third step 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.700
 In the third step, phosphate is released 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:57.750
 . 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.980
 Phosphate is released from myosin in step 3 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.170
 That is the third step 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.260
 As the phosphate group is released 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.320
 And what you do, is to free energy from 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.150
 The upper grade causes the payment of myosin protein 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.290
 On the actin 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.730
 This is called the energy strike, if you imagine it as a motor 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.070
 This is what causes mechanical movement 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.390
 So when the phosphate group is already released - remember 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.470
 The original liberation is when you take 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.430
 ATP to ADP in phosphate 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.030
 And put it in this site of spring 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.925
 When the phosphate releases it, this frees the spring 

00:07:32.925 --> 00:07:41.090
 This frees the spring 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.430
 What he is doing is pushing the string of actin 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:49.930
 He drives the string of actin 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.720
 You can consider this as a blow energy 

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.750
 We are creating mechanical energy 

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.130
 Click on any one you want to see attached - if 

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.930
 Actin is considered to be impregnated, and it does not matter what actin binds 

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.360
 It will move to the left 

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.530
 If you imagine that the myosin is clogged, the actin and 

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.190
 Anything associated with it will move to the right 

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:07.900
 in both cases 

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.540
 But here 

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.950
 We get muscle performance 

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:16.295
 Then step four - we have the ADP editor 

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:21.170
 ADP Editor 

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.960
 Then where were we before we took the step 

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.260
 First, add one extra degree to the left 

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.890
 Actin molecule 

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.530
 For me, this is very amazing 

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.000
 We already see how ATP energy can be used - we 

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:47.570
 We move from chemical energy energy bond in ATP to 

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.820
 Mechanical energy 

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.060
 Mechanical energy 

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.080
 With me, this is amazing because when I first learned about 

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.640
 ATP - People say, ATP was used to do anything in cells 

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.650
 The muscles are shrinking 

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.350
 Well, how do you move from a power connector to 

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.850
 Stuff shrinking, so you do what you see in 

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.010
 Our daily life which is mechanical energy? 

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.390
 This is what happens here 

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.140
 This is the fundamental issue here 

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.110
 You have to say, well, how this changes 

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.290
 Shape and all these things? 

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.320
 You should remember, that these proteins, depending on the 

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.240
 What is associated with it and what is linked 

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.260
 In them, they change shape 

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.810
 Some of these forms acquire more energy, and 

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.610
 If you do the right things, you will be able to power 

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.440
 Release and push another protein 

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.920
 But I find this missed 

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.100
 And now through the interaction of acetin and meosin 

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.930
 You can understand how muscles work
