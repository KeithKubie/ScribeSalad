00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.400
- [Instructor] In this
video, we're gonna discuss

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.620
different types of forces,

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.950
but we're gonna do it in the context

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.380
of free body diagrams.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.640
So let's say I have a table here,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.640
and I have a block that is
sitting stationary on that table.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.530
What are all of the forces

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.640
that are going to act on this blocK?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.320
Well, to do that, to think about that,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.880
I can draw a free body diagram

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.760
where I am only going to draw the block.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.630
Remember, in free body diagrams,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.900
you only care about the
forces acting on one

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.060
of the the objects in your system.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.330
So, if we're looking at only the block,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.163
what's going on?

00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:35.860
We're going to assume that
the block is on earth,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.940
we're assuming that it's stationary.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.010
Well, if it's on earth,
the block has some weight.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.300
You have the force of
gravity acting on the block.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.390
And so let me draw that
in my free body diagram.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.290
So you're gonna have a downward force,

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.090
and it's magnitude is gonna be F sub g.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.040
We could also call that or w.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.890
And even though this block
had contact with a table

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.090
which maybe has contact with the earth,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.560
weight, or the force of
gravity is a long-range force.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.570
Even if this block was in orbit,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.950
even if it wasn't in
orbit, it would still have

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.000
gravitational interactions with the earth.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.650
The earth would still be pulling on it.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.050
But going back to this free body diagram,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.050
if this was the only
force acting on the block,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.410
the block would accelerate downwards.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.190
But we're assuming that it's stationary.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.640
So there must be another
force that is netting out

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.313
against the force of gravity.

00:01:26.313 --> 00:01:28.010
Now, what would that be?

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.350
Well, that would be the force

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.030
of the table pushing on the block.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.900
And this force of pushing in a direction

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.720
that is perpendicular to
the surface of an object,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.050
that's known as normal force.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.450
And its magnitude you could
denote as capital F sub N.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.810
Let's do another example, but this time,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.070
instead of having the block on a table,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.720
let's say it is hanging from a string

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.660
which is attached to the ceiling.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.320
But once again, everything is stationary.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.491
Draw a free body diagram for that.

00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:05.346
Well, once again, I am only
concerned with the block.

00:02:05.346 --> 00:02:07.630
It's still on earth, we're assuming.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.050
So you're going to have
the force of gravity

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.810
acting downwards on the block.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.410
But what's keeping it from
accelerating downwards?

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.060
Well, you might say,
well, you got the string

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.850
that's holding it up,
that is pulling on it.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.820
And that pulling force
is known as tension.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.110
So what you would have
here is an upward force

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.500
that nets out against
the force of gravity.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.950
And sometimes its magnitude
is denoted by capital T

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.950
or it might be a F sub T.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.690
Now, let's make things a
little bit interesting.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.430
Let's try to kind of combine these things,

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.950
and we'll actually introduce a new force.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.830
So let's say that we, this is
the ground right over here.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.973
I have a block on the ground.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.070
And I have a situation where I am pulling

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.080
on this block using a rope

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.810
with a force of magnitude,
let's just call this

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.630
the force of tension.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.410
I am pulling on that block.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.810
But the block is not moving.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.963
What would be the free body
diagram for this block?

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.740
Well, I'll do the same thing again.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.490
I will draw the block.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.410
Now, in the vertical direction,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.530
you have the same thing that
you saw in that first scenario.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.840
You're going to have the force of gravity

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.920
or the weight of the block
pulling downward on the block.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.940
And that's going to be
counteracted by the normal force

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.430
of the ground on the block.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.820
The ground is holding up the block

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.950
is one way to think about it,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.200
keeping it from accelerating downwards.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.133
So the normal force is acting upwards.

00:03:43.214 --> 00:03:45.900
But what about the horizontal direction?

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.800
I already said that I'm
pulling to the right

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.410
with a force of magnitude F sub T.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.143
So let me do that on my free body diagram.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.870
So this would be F sub T.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.530
But I said it's stationary.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.820
So there must be something
that is counteracting that,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.760
that is netting against that,
going in that direction.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.430
What force would that be?

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.160
Well, that would be the force of friction.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.070
We've all experienced
trying to pull on something,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.900
trying to drag something across the ground

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.260
and it doesn't move, and
that's because there's friction

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.220
between the object and the ground.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.800
And friction, fundamentally, it could be

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.760
because the surfaces of
the two objects are rough

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.050
and you kind of have to
grind them pass each other.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.760
Or sometimes it can even be
due to molecular interactions

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.940
where they're kind of sticky,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.090
where the objects are
attracted to each other

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.320
and you gotta pull passed that.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.490
And so in this situation, you
have the force of friction

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.270
counteracting this pulling
force, the force of tension,

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.570
the force of friction.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.670
And the force of friction
is really interesting,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.930
because it always goes against
the direction of sliding,

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.265
it always goes against motion.

00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:50.840
Now, with all of these
examples out of the way,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.980
let's try to do a more complex scenario.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.363
Let's say that I have a shelf,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.990
and it has a weight of

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.570
10 newtons.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.920
Sitting on that shelf I have an object

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.820
that has a weight of five newtons.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.420
And let's say I have two wires

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.820
and everything is symmetric,

00:05:15.677 --> 00:05:17.030
but this weight is right on the middle,

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.000
and these wires are at both
of the ends of the shelf,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.800
and this is wire one and this is wire two

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.990
and they are attached to the ceiling.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.900
And for the sake of simplicity,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.790
we're gonna assume that
the wires have no weight.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:29.850
In actuality they would,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.330
but for the sake of this argument,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.360
let's assume that they are weightless.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.150
What would be a free body diagram

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.323
for this five newton block
that sits on the shelf?

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.160
Well, that one is actually
pretty straightforward,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.130
and it's analogous to this
first scenario that we saw.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.860
You have your block, you
have the force of gravity

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.500
pulling down with a force
of magnitude, five newtons,

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.270
and that's gonna be
counteracted by a normal force

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.570
of the same magnitude but going upwards.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.630
So make sure I have enough space.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.210
So that's gonna be counteracted
with the normal force

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.330
which is going to be equal
to five newtons upwards.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.290
And to be clear, this five newtons,

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.210
this is equal to the weight, the magnitude

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.070
of the weight of the object.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.200
So that was pretty straightforward,

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.660
the free body diagram for just the block.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.870
And it's really important to see that,

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.620
because notice, in the free body diagram,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.160
all you see is the block.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.977
But now let's draw the free
body diagram for the shelf.

00:06:22.977 --> 00:06:26.543
So if I have a shelf right over here.

00:06:26.543 --> 00:06:28.257
Pause this video and try to do that.

00:06:28.257 --> 00:06:31.410
Well, we know its weight, it's 10 newtons.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.290
So we can do that first.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.660
So,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.130
it has a weight of 10 newtons,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.370
so the force, the magnitude of the force

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.383
of gravity downwards is 10 newtons.

00:06:42.383 --> 00:06:44.343
Is that the only downward force?

00:06:44.343 --> 00:06:48.534
Well no, you have this
object that's sitting on it,

00:06:48.534 --> 00:06:50.890
and gravity is pulling down on that object

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.420
with a force of five newtons,

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.830
and that causes that object
to push on our shelf.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.740
So that pushing force is
actually a normal force.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.680
It's due to the gravity on
that five newton object,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.820
but the end result of
the five newton object

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.540
is pushing down on our shelf.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.537
So what you have is another
force that is pushing down.

00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:15.070
And it is going to be a five newton force.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.760
And really, we should view
that as a normal force.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.100
It's a contact force, it's a pushing force

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.730
of the five newton object
on the 10 newton shelf.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.480
So this is going to have a
magnitude of five newtons.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.740
Assuming that it's completely stationary,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.600
there must be some
counteracting forces here.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.310
Where is that gonna come from?

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.143
Well, that's gonna come

00:07:32.143 --> 00:07:35.620
from the pulling forces of these wires.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.040
So you're going to have
the tension from rope one,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.430
we could call that T sub one,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.010
and you're gonna have the tension

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.140
from wire or rope two, T sub two.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.040
And because this thing is stationary,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.690
T sub one plus T sub two should be equal

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.430
to 10 newtons plus five newtons.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.380
So I'll leave you there.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.870
We've done a nice survey of various forces

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.650
you might see in a first
year physics class.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.880
And we've been able to think about them

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.193
in the context of free body diagrams.
