00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.669
Hey everyone, I’m Emily here for a DNews
short.

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:13.240
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
just released the first images from GOES-16,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.820
their newest weather satellite orbiting the
planet, and they are GORGEOUS.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.670
The Advanced Baseline Imager instrument, a
specialized camera onboard GOES-16, captured

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.880
this picture of the Americas and the surrounding
oceans.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.560
Look at this beautiful planet we live on!

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.251
The GOES-16, which orbits 22,300 miles above
Earth, helps NOAA observe global weather and

00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:39.350
will lead to better solar and space weather
models, and more accurate, life-saving forecasts

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.650
here on Earth.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.750
Here you can see South America on the left
and off to the right is Africa.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.630
The Saharan Dust Layer is pretty visible over
Africa, which is more important than you may

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.630
think.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.579
Saharan dust in the atmosphere helps reduce
the intensity of tropical storms when it makes

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.649
its way over to the tropics.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.170
And with clearer, more accurate images, scientists
can better predict the severity of those storms!

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.180
You can see here what makes this satellite
so special.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.100
The GOES-16 can take color images at four
times the resolution of the existing GOES

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.100
satellites.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.890
It also has 16 spectral channels — three-times
the amount of previous GOES satellites — which

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.910
show different wavelengths of light.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.820
Some of these channels were combined to get
color images like the one you just saw.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.729
The satellite can help forecasters differentiate
clouds from smoke and volcanic ash.

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.250
This image shows part of Mexico and Central
America.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.649
Most of the area is pretty free of cloud coverage
but zoom in and you can see smoke from a massive

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.229
fire near the coast in southern Mexico.

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.369
The GOES-16 is also faster, providing an image
of an area the size of the United States every

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.939
five minutes!

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.020
NOAA is pretty excited, calling it “the
most sophisticated technology ever flown in

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.439
space to predict severe weather on Earth.”

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.660
So hopefully now I’ll be able to actually
trust the weather forecast on my phone!

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.439
Satellites like GOES-16 are awesome, but space
weather can interfere with them.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.439
Did you know that?

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.189

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.450
Do you have any other weather-related questions?
