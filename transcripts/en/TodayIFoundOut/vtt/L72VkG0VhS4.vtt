00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.350
Given the well-documented benefits of breastfeeding
to the long- and short- term health of children,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.360
the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends
exclusively breastfeeding infants for at least

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.400
the first six months, and continuing to nurse,
along with giving supplemental foods, throughout

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.730
the first year of life.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.090
In fact, if one so chooses, babies can get
everything they need nutritionally from the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.360
mother’s milk up until about a year old,
at which point their diet must be supplemented

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.650
with solid foods.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.820
However, many women who have had breast implants
fear that they may not be able to breastfeed

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.110
their children, assuming that their implants
will impair their ability to nurse, or at

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.760
least do so effectively; luckily, this is
mostly a myth, and, in fact, most women with

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.140
implants who wish to do so are able to successfully
breastfeed their babies.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.150
The primary determinant in whether or not
a woman with implants will be able to successfully

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.500
nurse is not whether the device consists of
silicone or saline, but where and how it was

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.500
placed.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.280
Specifically, according to pediatrician and
author of Great Expectations: The Essential

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.030
Guide to Breastfeeding, Dr. Marianne Neifert,
nipple incisions should be avoided, as “all

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.579
the milk ducts that drain the different lobes
. . . convene there;” rather, they recommend

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.789
making an inframammary incision (under the
breast crease) or implanting the device under

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.179
the chest wall muscle to maximize the probability
that one would be able to later successfully

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.210
breastfeed.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.780
Pressure can also potentially be an issue.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.729
Essentially, the less pressure an implant
puts on the mammary gland, the better.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.590
As Dr. Miriam Labbok of the Carolina Global
Breastfeeding Institute notes, “The mammary

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.340
gland, like any other gland, performs normally
when it has blood… and space to grow.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.999
But when you put pressure on any gland in
the body, you risk it malfunctioning and compromising

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.999
lactation.”

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:56.249
Many women are also concerned that somehow
an implant may leak or otherwise contaminate

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.549
the baby’s milk, but in truth the risks
of leakage with modern implants (in the past

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.439
decade or two) is negligible.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.420
Moreover, contrary to popular belief, women
with implants who breastfeed are no more likely

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.429
to experience post-pregnancy sagging than
those without.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.450
In fact, for both it isn’t the breastfeeding
that causes the droop, it’s the swelling

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.000
of the breasts caused by the hormones that
enlarged them during pregnancy, and the subsequent

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.260
reduction in breast size when they are absent.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.500
So, in the end, while there is some chance
that getting breast implants will result in

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.140
an inability to breastfeed a baby, for the
vast majority who choose to have this surgery

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.690
(nearly a third of a million women in the
U.S. per year), they’ll have no (extra)

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.230
trouble with breastfeeding when the time comes.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.360
The word “booby,” in English, first popped
up in the sense of “fool” or “dummy”

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.010
around the late sixteenth century and was
within decades applied to birds of the Sula

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.010
genus.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.909
These birds have very large feet that make
them look clumsy and foolish when they walk

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.160
or run, instead of fly.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.970
In addition, they would often land on ships
and were exceptionally easy to catch, making

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.340
them popular fair for sailors, who began calling
these birds “boobies” for their perceived

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.340
stupidity.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:20.959
All that said, this etymology is not

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:47.920
thought to be where the “boobs” moniker

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920
for breasts came from.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:04:01.689
More on this

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:15.519
in an upcoming article.
