00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.510
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, good afternoon,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.390
and welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.690
I'm John Cole.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.390
I'm the Director of the Center for
the Book in the Library of Congress

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.440
which is the reading and literacy
promotion arm of the Library.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.550
Our Center was created in 1977

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.820
when Daniel Boorstin was
the Librarian of Congress.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.460
And Dan Boorstin felt the Library
of Congress should do more to reach

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.140
out to the general public to
promote books and reading.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.850
So the Center for the
Book was his baby.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.890
We are also a public/private
partnership.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.880
We raise private money for our
programming even though we are,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.030
of course, all Library
of Congress employees.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.120
We've expanded through the years

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.120
to not only include the Library's
first Young Reader Center

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.910
which is a programming place
for kids 16 and under as long

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.310
as they are accompanied by an adult
which is in the Jefferson Building.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.650
And the Library of Congress Poetry

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.650
and Literature Program is now also
part of the Center for the Book.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.730
I was just talking with our
guest today a little bit

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.670
about the National Book
Festival in which the Center

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.300
for the Book also plays
a major role.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.130
This year the Book Festival will
be in the old time, late September,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.910
which is how we started
15 years ago.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.550
This year's festival is
going to be September 24th.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.510
And it is in the Washington
Convention Center

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.020
which is a change for us.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.200
It originated under Laura
Bush's auspices on the Mall,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.960
but now we're inside where
we have air conditioning

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.670
and comfortable bathrooms and
a lot more programming space.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.240
And so we after some initial
reluctance are happy to be

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.100
in the Convention Center.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.440
The way this Books and
Beyond program is our way

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.630
of really pointing out that
authors do research in libraries,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.880
and library places like
the Library of Congress

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.080
and other institutions are
really important resources today

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.690
for books and for new books.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.970 position:56%
And so we always celebrate new books
that have grown at least in part

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.280
out of the collections of
the Library of Congress,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.170
and such is the case today.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.670
Our speaker, Doug Waller, will
speak for 30 minutes or so.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.380
We'll have a chance for questions.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.300
And we'll have a book
signing outside that we need

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.130
to start no later than one o'clock.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.620
All of these noontime author
programs are filmed for the Library

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.940
of Congress's and Center
for the Book's website,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.260
as are the author programs for
the National Book Festival.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.480 position:56%
And we have several hundred of these
broadcasts for the Book Festival,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.320
and more than 300 talks from
the Center for the Book.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.390
So I often mention that
website as a wonderful resource

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.350
for people interested in
contemporary reading and literature

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.150
and to catch a snapshot of what's
happening in the world of books

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.220
and writing in America
really since 2001,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.360 position:56%
the year of the first Book Festival.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.300
Because we're filmed and we'll
have a question and answer period,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.350
I've asked you to turn
off all things electronic,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.480
and we look forward to a lively
question and answer period.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.850
The way that the rules work

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.800
if you ask a question you
are giving us permission

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.720
to we hope use your image and
your comments later in the website

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.390
that will be on our website.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.380
Our speaker today, Doug Waller,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.050
I think you probably know
a little bit about him.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.830
He is really a wonderfully
prolific writer and author.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.630
He is a former correspondent
for Newsweek and Time Magazines

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.140
where he covered the CIA, the
Pentagon, the State Department,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.490
the White House and the Congress.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.970
But he very early on, we were
chatting about this a bit,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.100
got interested in some of the
subjects in which he was covering

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.020
and tried his hand at writing, and
has been a successful historian

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.810
and author for a number of years.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.810
And he has several
different fields of expertise.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.710
We were talking a little
bit about his biography

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.660
of General Billy Mitchell, World
War I, where he used the resources

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.510
of the Library of Congress
quite a bit.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.970
He's, of course, best known
for I think Wild Bill Donovan,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.310
the biography of the creator
of the OSS and that, in turn,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.030 position:56%
has led him to the current book that
he's going to be explaining to us.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:33.230
He also has worked on a variety of
contemporary topics and did tell me

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.920
that the next book is
going to be [inaudible],

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.750
and I'll let you tell you more
about it about the Civil War

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.540
and intelligence during
the American Civil War.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.980
So he's going to be back
doing a lot of research

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.400
at the Library of Congress.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.230
So I'm very pleased to
present Doug Waller.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.540
Please help me welcome him
for his talk about Disciples.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.340
Thank you.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:08.060
[ Applause ]

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.360
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller:
Thanks a lot, John.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.810
As he mentioned I'm a
regular customer here

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.480
of the Library of Congress.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.060
I've camped out here for
the last two books, well,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.440
actually the last three books
now, so I've accumulated a lot

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.300
of frequent flyer miles
with this organization.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.980
After I published my biography

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.710
of General William Wild
Bill Donovan four years ago,

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.820
I really had a tough time
figuring out what to do next.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.130
Because Donovan was
really larger than life.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.330
A World War I hero who had been
awarded the Medal of Honor,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.180 position:56%
a Wall Street lawyer often mentioned
as a Presidential candidate,

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.480
and a man Franklin Roosevelt picked
to be his World War II spy master.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.710 position:56%
In July 1941 by way of background
Donovan began what eventually became

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.760
known as the Office of
Strategic Services, the OSS.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.490
He really started out
this organization

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.690
with just one guy,
and that was himself.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.860
But over the course of the war
he assembled a force of more

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.560
than 10,000 spies, saboteurs,
commandos, propagandists,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.970
research analysts, many of them who
came from the Library of Congress,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.550
and support personnel operating
in stations all over the world.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.420
Wild Bill, he got that nickname
leading troops in World War I,

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.800
also was a controversial character.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.700
His agents revered him.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.110
His political enemies, and he
had a lot of them in Washington,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.330
thought he was as big a threat to
the United States as Adolph Hitler.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.400
So Donovan was going to
be a hard act to follow.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.450
I finally settled on four
subjects for my next book.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.380
These four were among the most
controversial directors the CIA has

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.140
ever had.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.250
Allen Dulles who is down here
at the bottom, bottom left;

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:02.980
Richard Helms who is over on the
other -- I mean this bottom right,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:09.380
bottom left there in the Navy
uniform; Bill Colby up here

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.880
in the corner; and Bill Casey.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.710
Allen Dulles, who was America's
spy chief from 1953 to 61,

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.790
launched the calamitous operation
to land CIA trained gorillas,

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.300
anti-Castro gorillas,
in Cuba's Bay of Pigs.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:31.620
Richard Helms, who was CIA
Director from 1966 to 73,

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.910
was convicted of lying to
Congress over the CIA's effort

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:39.090
to oust President Salvador
Allende in Chile.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.810
Bill Colby, who was CIA
Director from 1973 to 76,

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.980
would become a pariah among
Langley's old hands for releasing

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.350
to Congress what eventually
became as the Family Jewels Report

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.810
on agency misdeeds in the
1950s, 60s and early 70s.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:02.360
Bill Casey, who was CIA Director
from 1981 to 87, would nearly bring

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.990
down the agency and Ronald
Regan's Presidency from a scheme

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.500
that secretly supplied Nicaragua's
Contras with money racked off

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.160
from the sale of arms to
Iran for hostages in Beirut.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.590
This was the Iran Contra scandal.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.170
But before these four men became
their nation's spy master,

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.770
they served under Donovan
as operatives.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.560
Disciples is about the secret
war they fought in the Office

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.820
of Strategic Service which became
the precursor to today's CIA.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.770
These four men I quickly found out
were characters as rich and complex

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.490
and multifaceted as Donovan was.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.470
Allen Dulles looked
like the head master

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.950
of an upper class English
boarding school.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.660
He was usually dressed in a
bow tie and tweed sport coat.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.980
His wiry gray hair
was slightly mussed,

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.350
his mustache always
carefully trimmed,

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.320
a pipe almost always
clenched between his teeth.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.470
He has sparkling gray-blue eyes and
a soft voice that invited people

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.520
to pour their hearts out to him.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.950
Dulles's secret of nature, however,
could be absolutely maddening.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.110
One of his agents once
joked that if you asked him

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.970 position:56%
if it was raining outside he'd laugh
at you and he wouldn't tell you.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.940
Occasionally it was a hearty laugh

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.870
when he was truly amused
at something.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.060
But more than not it was kind of a
mirthless ho-ho-ho that he turned

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.320
on when he was trying to ingratiate
himself with a stranger or trying

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.090
to deflect a question he
didn't want to answer.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:35.910
That country gentleman routine
also masked a fierce competitor not

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.660
willing to give up a single
point on the tennis court,

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.640
a back alley fighter as one
of his agents said of him,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.730
and a devious man who sized
up people based solely

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.330
on whether they were useful to him.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.490
Richard Helms was a consummate spy.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.570
He had a Mona Lisa-like smile.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.350
His hair was always
slicked back neatly,

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.580
and he had a cold personality.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.130
He didn't make friends easily,

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.820
and even with the close friends
he had he rarely let his guard

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.610
down with him.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.320
You can find plenty
of stories in the CIA

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.240
about his colorful characters, and
he certainly had a lot of them.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.860
But no one could think of
an anecdote about Helms.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.880
The consummate intelligence
officer he left no trail behind.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.050
People had to really think hard
to come up with something to say

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.450
about him because he made so
little impression on them.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:32.010
At parties he was a good dancer
and a charming conversationalist,

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.360
but he rarely drank more than one
martini so his head remained clear,

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.620
and he was always the first one to
leave the party so he's be fresh

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.740
at the office the next day.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.900
Or, if the gathering
was at his house,

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.420
he's shoo out his guests
when his bedtime neared.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.500 position:56%
He smoked two packs of Chesterfields
a day for most of his life.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.660 position:56%
He was always immaculately tailored.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.670
His shoes were especially made
for his small high arch feet

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.090
at $700 a pair from Peal
&amp; Company in London.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:07.620 position:56%
And he wore his belt with the buckle
on the side instead of the front

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.920
which I thought was kind of odd.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.220
I don't know why.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.730
Bill Colby was once asked his
definition of the perfect spy.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.470
He gave a pretty obvious
answer, the one you don't see.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.980
Colby looked like a man
who could be overlooked.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:25.250 position:56%
He was slightly built, he had pale,
dull eyes behind horned rim glasses.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.060
And his hair was always
parted neatly on the side.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:33.520
A private man he was unfailingly
polite with refined manners.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.520
He paid no attention
to what he wore.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.180
He repaired plumbing
and performed carpentry

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.010
around the house on the weekends.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.020
But he had his guilty pleasures.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.730
He enjoyed a good bottle
of Sauvignon Blanc.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.320
And on weekends he liked to
drive his red Fiat sports car.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.630
And he appreciate beautiful women,
although I could find no evidence

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.260
that he ever acted
on what he noticed.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.700
Classical Greek and Roman
heroes intrigued Colby.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.860
One of his favorite characters was
Lawrence of Arabia and the movie

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.200
where Peter O'Toole
played T.H. Lawrence.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.780
Colby once told a family member
that he'd never had a nightmare

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.650
and never even dreamed
for that matter

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.790
which I thought was kind of odd.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.580
In the OSS and later the CIA
colleagues recalled Bill Colby

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.910
as a dedicated soldier [inaudible]
but someone they really never knew.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:30.760 position:56%
An informal poll was once circulated
amongst nearly 60 CIA officers

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.360
with two questions.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.790
Question number one, if you were
shipwrecked on a deserted island,

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.830
a pleasant deserted island
with plenty of food and liquor,

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.150
and every hope that a ship
would come by to rescue you,

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.200
who would you choose to be with?

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.620
Allen Dulles won handily over Colby

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.660
because he would be far better
company while they were stranded.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.510
Second question, if you were stuck
on a miserable deserted island

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.260
with little food or hope of
survival, and you badly wanted

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.390
to escape, who would
you choose to be with?

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.550
Colby easily led Dulles because,
as one of the respondents said,

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.950
he would know how to build a
boat to get him off the island,

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:16.070
and he would build the
boat big enough for two.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.180
Bill Casey always made a bad
and first impression on others,

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.490
even more so when he
became middle aged.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.720
He was tall and lumpy.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.830
He had a jolly face, thick
lips, eyes bulging and wisps

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.170
of white hair on his bald head.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.130
He wore expensive suits
that were always rumpled,

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.590
his tie often stained with
what he'd eaten for lunch,

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.040
and he frequently mumbled
when he spoke

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.740
as if he had marbles
stuffed in his mouth.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.470
His acquaintances usually ended
up being either lifelong friends

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.640
who worshiped him or skeptics

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.630
who just couldn't escape
the uneasy feeling

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.300
that he was some kind
of devious operator.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.850
With Casey looks were deceiving.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.970
That slovenly appearance masked a
body that was constantly on the go.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.340
He once wrote a lengthy
article on how

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.410
to quickly consume
a nonfiction book.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:09.380
Casey would read back to
front starting with the index

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.130
and the source notes to pick out
what he thought he needed to know,

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.090
and then he'd bypass the rest.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.860
I would have hated to have him
read one of my books that way.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.800
He had a photographic memory.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.420
He could retain passages
almost verbatim from reports

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.360
and journal articles that he
seemed to be just flipping through.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.110
He had an insatiably curious mind.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.520
On family vacations in Europe
Casey's idea of fun was scooping

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.700
up the timetable brochures
at train stations,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.680
studying them in his hotel room
overnight so he could recite

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.970
from memory the itinerary
for the next morning.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.320
For all the differences among these
four guys, I found a common thread

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.820
that ran through Allen
Dulles, Richard Helms,

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.980
William Casey and William Colby.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.280
They were all smart.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.950
And, in fact, I think you
could call the intellectuals

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.120
because they were voracious
readers, they were thoughtful

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.560
and they were creatures of reason.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.590
But these weren't the ivory tower
types who'd sit around for hours

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.570
in doubtful introspection.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:14.280
These were strong, decisive and
supremely confident men of action.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.740
They were doers who believed that
they could shape history rather

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.860
than letting it control them.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.790 position:56%
So what did they do in World War II?

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.710
Let's start with Dulles.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.880
He was born in 1893
with a club foot.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.350
Surgeons repaired it, but the
family always treated this

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.410
as some kind of deep, dark secret.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.150
His father was a liberal
Presbyterian minister.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.850
His mother came from
diplomatic nobility.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.540
Allen's grandfather and an uncle

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.100
on his mother's side were
Secretaries of State.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.220
Dulles was a precocious child.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.660 position:56%
When he was eight years old he wrote
a book on the Second World War.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.630
It was only 31 pages long, it
had a lot of spelling mistakes,

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.770
but his grandfather, the Secretary
of State, published 700 copies

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.320
of it, and he got a good
review in the Washington Post.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.420
He went to Princeton,
played around as much

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.370 position:56%
as he studied until his senior year.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.250
Then he finally buckled down.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.940
In 1916 he joined the
State Department,

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.330
and during World War
II he was stationed

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.310
at the American Legation
in Bern, Switzerland.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.660
By default he became the station's

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.710
or the legation's intelligence
officer.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.980
There just wasn't anybody
else around for the job.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.450
And neutral Switzerland was
really a spy haven at that time

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.490
for all the warring powers.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.780
Dulles basically taught
himself how to be a spy,

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.490
and he learned some hard
lessons along the way.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.100
Late one afternoon a man

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.910 position:56%
with a thick Russian accent phoned
the legation and insisted on talking

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.240
with an American diplomat.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.860
Dulles was late to a tennis
date, so he told the man

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.650
to come back the next morning when
the legation opened and he hung up.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:54.090
Turned out he later found out that
the Russian was Vladimir Lenin

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.930
who was on his way to
Russia, and headed back

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.110
to his homeland the next morning.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.580
Dulles would tell that
anecdote time and again

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.080
to new CIA recruits
who came to Langley.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.780
Never turn down a meeting even
with the shadiest of characters.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.900
He earned a law degree, left
the State Department in 1926

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.720
and joined Sullivan &amp; Cromwell,
one of the most powerful law firms

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.710
in the world at that time.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.110
And by 1930 Allen was having
numerous extramarital affairs

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.630
which is why Clover, of
course, didn't much appreciate.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.390
In the months before Pearl Harbor
Dulles had picked up rumors

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:36.220
that Roosevelt had made Donovan
chief of some nefarious spy group

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.480
with secret funds that the
White House controlled.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.020
Dulles knew Donovan.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.900
He enjoyed beating him on the
tennis court, but he decided

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.750 position:56%
to keep his distance from Donovan's
group to see what else might be open

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.160
to him if the United
States joined the war.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.630
After Pearl Harbor, Dulles
decided to join the OSS.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.110
Already wealthy from
his law practice,

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.550
he took the job at no salary.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.330
His first job was organizing
a major intelligence outpost

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.310
in New York City to hatch covert
operations against Germany.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.750
Turns out that New York was a good
spot for recruiting foreign spies.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:18.780 position:56%
The city was filled with immigrants,
deposed royalty, European expats,

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.600
many of them shady characters
dreaming up all kinds of schemes

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.910
in their Manhattan salons

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:28.610
for infiltrating gorillas
into Nazi Germany.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.950
Dulles and Donovan weren't
particularly bothered that most

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.430
of these would be emigrated
spies turned

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.660
out to be a waste of their time.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.000
New York became a laboratory
for Dulles's experiments

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.710
in intelligence gathering.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.850
So, for example, he
organized a project

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.130 position:56%
to counterfeit enemy currency there.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.630
He bought clothes from European
refugees his men interviewed

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.080
so the OSS agents infiltrating

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.320
into enemy territory could
wear the garments to blend in.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.980
He even started a secret
unit to tap into the records

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.640
that American insurance
companies held

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.750
on their access business
clients before the war.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:09.580
Now, why would he be interested
in insurance files for the OSS?

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.240
Well, those files often
contained the blueprints

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.590
of buildings being insured.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.950
Allied air force has found those
blueprints particularly helpful

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.680
when they were trying to decide
how the building should be bombed.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.460
In November 1942, just after
the allies' Torch invasion

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.810 position:56%
of North Africa, Dulles slipped into
Switzerland with orders from Donovan

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.960
to penetrate Nazi Germany.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.060
In Bern he set up what amounted

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:41.030 position:56%
to a mini CIA running espionage
operations, funding gorilla missions

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.480
in occupied France and Italy,
and inundating Washington

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.400
with foreign policy advice
on how to deal with the axis.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.690
Most of it Washington ignored.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.360
For his staff Dulles
recruited a handful

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.590
of Americans living in Switzerland.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:58.150
One of them was Mary Bancroft,
an American socialite there,

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.050
who ended up being
Dulles's mistress.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.980
He had scores of informants
on his payroll.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.980
Many of them turned out to
be professional snitches

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:11.080
who often passed the same secrets
to the Germans in the morning,

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.770
to the British in the afternoon
and to Dulles in the evening.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.170
Dulles met them all.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:20.010
He didn't want to repeat
the same mistake he'd made

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.520
with Vladimir Lenin.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.220
And he had some prize sources.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.170
He recruited, for example,
Fritz Kolbe, a short,

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:33.370
bald German foreign office diplomat
with beady eyes and big ears

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:39.410
who delivered to him some 1,600
classified Nazi political,

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.450
military and intelligence cables.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.690
Kolbe first had the
documents strapped

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.640
around his leg when
he came to Berlin.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.890
Then Dulles gave him a miniature
camera to photograph them

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.270
and bring them to him
in a watch case.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.370
Another valuable source
was Hans Bernd Gisevius

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.840
who was a stern [inaudible] major

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.590
who had come to detest
Adolph Hitler.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:06.280
On his visits to Bern,
Gisevius would brief Dulles

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.900
on the dissidents remaining in
Nazi Germany who were laying plans

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.060 position:56%
to assassinate Adolph Hitler in what
became known as the Valkyrie Plot

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.460
which failed on July 20, 1944.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.350
You remember Tom Cruise
did a movie on Valkyrie.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:23.440 position:56%
Dulles gave Gisevius who was a hulk
of a man, he was over six feet tall,

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.950
just huge, the code name Tiny.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:30.010
Now, let's turn to Bill Casey.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.190
His birth in 1913 set a family
record his mother could have

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.540
done without.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.170
He arrived weighing a
staggering 14 pounds.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.780
Yeah, I know, everybody
always groans when I say that.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.450
The son of New York
Tammany Hall bureaucrat,

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.700
Casey was a bright child,
but he drove the nuns

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.820
at the Catholic school nuts
because he seemed intent

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.570
on educating himself
the way he saw fit.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.390
He went to Fordham University,

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.520
the first in his family
to go to college.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.250
Then he went to Catholic
University of America here

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.050 position:56%
in Washington to be a social worker.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.220
But he quickly became
disenchanted with that calling

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.580
after several months as
a New York social worker.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.140
He thought welfare
money was being wasted

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.040
and FDR was a bleeding
heart liberal.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.680
Casey earned a law degree
going to night school,

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.750 position:56%
and by the time Hitler invaded
Poland he was working has an analyst

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.090
for the Research Institute
of America,

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.080
a think tank that advised
businessmen on how

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.020 position:56%
to land contracts with the New Deal.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.740
After the United States entered
the war, Casey who soon was married

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.030
with a baby girl, wanted
in on the action.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:41.310
He talked the navy into making
him a lieutenant junior grade.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.640
It took some talking
and convincing, however.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.650 position:56%
The Navy at first didn't think he
was officer material, but they ended

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:51.660
up finding a place for him
in a ship buying program.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.500
Bored with pushing paper for the
Navy, Casey noticed that a number

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.430
of wealthy young men had found
jobs in a secret organization

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.200
that Donovan was running.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.310
He managed to wrangle an interview
with Donovan's recruiters,

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.720
but they also weren't particularly
impressed with this officer

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.990
who didn't seem to have
much military bearing.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.950
But they hired him.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.810
And they quickly realized that
Casey was a whiz at administration,

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.280
and from his Research Institute

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.040
of America days he could
analyze big chunks of information

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.360
and write clear intelligence
reports.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.800
So they packed him off to the
OSS's very important station

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.170
at Grosvenor's Square in London.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.160
This was to manage the
flow of paperwork there.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.230
In short order Casey had his hand

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.580
in every major operation
the station was running.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.900
He was kind of like a
human tornado there.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.850
As one of the officers
there said of him,

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.130
you could not not pay
attention to Bill Casey.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.700
Donovan soon was impressed with
this 31 year old Navy lieutenant,

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.340
and in December 1944 he made Casey
his chief of secret intelligence

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.170
for Europe and ordered him

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:59.180
to infiltrate the OSS
agents into the Third Reich.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.430
That was a daunting mission.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.480
Even though it was losing
the war at this time,

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.040
Nazi Germany was still one

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.720
of the world's most
tightly run police states.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.540
The average German citizen had

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.090
up to 18 different basic
identity documents on him

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:18.120
that an OSS unit code named
Bach after the composer had

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.860
to figure out how to forge.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.040
So Casey, who eventually
had 330 people working

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.160
for him, really had to scramble.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.530
In the last five months of the war
he managed to parachute in more

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.540
than 150 agents into Germany
to radio back intelligence

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.050
for the advancing allied armies.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.740
His spies often had to
improvise on the fly.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:43.130
For example, one two-man team code
named Chauffeur enlisted the help

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.570
of two French women forced to
work in a Bavarian brothel.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.140
The women would entice
military secrets

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.500
from their [inaudible] customers
between the sheets while one

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.280
of the OSS agents hid in the closet
with a flashlight taking notes.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.860
Now, I'm not making this up, folks.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.710
This really happened.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.290
Bill Colby, our next subject.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.750
He was born in 1920.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.730
He was an Army brat.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.690
His father who rose to the
rank of Colonel was something

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:13.000
of a curmudgeon, not a particularly
pleasant fellow to be around.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.590
Colby spent his early years moving
from duty station to the next

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.880
which was an education in itself.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.700
He wanted to follow his father's
footsteps and be an Army officer,

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.110
but he graduated from high school
ahead of schedule at the age of 16

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.830
as the yearbook nicknamed
him the brain,

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.930
and he was too young
to enter West Point.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.730
So he went to Princeton
like Dulles did,

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.030
and was eventually commissioned
an ROTC second lieutenant

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:41.090
in August 1941 when he turned 21.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:45.810 position:56%
Bill Colby liked to quote
Napoleon's standing order to his men

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.480
which was march to
the sound of the guns.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.610
But after Pearl Harbor it seemed
to Colby that he was marching

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:56.780
in the opposite direction farther
and farther away from that sound.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:00.010
He was put in the artillery branch
and stuck in desolate Fort Sill,

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.540
Oklahoma teaching students
how to fire Howitzers.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.530
One day he spotted a
notice on a bulletin board

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.640 position:56%
that said the Army wanted volunteers

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:14.890
for an airborne artillery
unit, and he could sign up.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.250
Colby applied, but he worried
that his poor eyesight,

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.980
he wore glasses, might
disqualify him.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.060
So he memorized the eye chart when
the doctor wasn't in the room.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.670
Of course the doctor caught him,

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.460
but he figured Colby's eyes
were probably good enough

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.450
to see the ground when he
parachuted to it so he passed him.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.730
Bad luck then struck once more.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:41.310 position:56%
On a second jump at Fort Benning,
Georgia Colby broke his right ankle.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:46.110
By the time it healed and
he finished what remained

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:50.160
of his airborne training, he
was stuck at a replacement pool

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.280
at Camp McCall, North
Carolina desperate to get

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.500
to the sound of those guns.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.740
In mid October 1943 he
spotted another note tacked

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.270
on a bulletin board.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:02.990
This one from some strange
organization he'd never heard

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.500
of called the OSS which said
if you were a paratrooper

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.820
and you spoke French, and Colby
spoke French, and you were looking

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.430
for adventure overseas
call this number.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.470
So Colby called that number.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.280
And by the end of the number he was

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.070
at the Congressional Country Club
just outside of Washington here

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:24.420
which the OSS had taken over
to train spies and saboteurs.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.480
The secret organization
he was training

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.850 position:56%
for which was code named Jedburgh
had been put together by the British

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:35.480
to drop three man commando teams
into France just after D-Day

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.600
to organize the French Resistance.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.680
From the Congressional
Country Club Colby

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.190 position:56%
and the other OSS recruits were
packed off for more gorilla training

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:48.850
to a remote camp at Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains near FDR's

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:53.000
Presidential Retreat which, of
course, today is called Camp David.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.210
The next stop was Peterborough
just north of London

00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:00.430
at a country estate called Milton
Hall where the British continued

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:03.670 position:56%
to train what became a multinational
force of mainly British,

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:06.240
French and American commandos.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.970
This was even more rigorous gorilla
training, and there was somewhat

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.790
of a culture clash between the
British and the American commandos.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.420
For example, Colby and
the other Americans had

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.180
to learn the British
way of parachuting.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.210
British commandos jumped
out of planes

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.420
at altitudes as low as 500 feet.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.540
That's pretty low.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.790
And their parachutes
didn't come with a spare.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:36.040
At that low altitude you didn't
have time to deploy a spare anyway.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.740
The instructors told
the American students

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.820
that if their chute didn't
open to bring it back

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.120
and we'll give you a new one.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.270
The Americans, of course, didn't
find that joke particularly funny.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:49.890
Finally, in August 1944
Colby's three man team dropped

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.120
into the Burgundy region
southeast of Paris

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.460
to organize French
resistance attacks

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.050 position:56%
as Patton's third army came through.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:02.970
The secret war they fought turned
out to be pretty complicated.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.700
Colby's team had to deal with an
assortment of resistance factions

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.130
that were poorly trained and
equipped where each faction seemed

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.370
to have a private political
agenda, and they seemed

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.810
to be fighting among themselves
as much as they did the Germans.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.910
And Colby didn't know
it at the time,

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.610
but one of the resistance
leaders he was working with,

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.360
a man named Roger Bardet
[phonetic], was a traitor.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.400
He was secretly collaborating
with the Germans.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:34.580
The [inaudible] top spy catcher in
France, a guy named Hugo Bleicher,

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.510
had recruited Bardet
to betray his country.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.550
After the third army
passed through Burgundy

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.030
and Colby's Jedburgh
assignment ended,

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.500
he next led a Norwegian-American
commando team that parachuted

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.870
into frigid Norway in March, 1945.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.290
Their mission which was code named
Repay [phonetic] after a local bird

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.870
that changed colors
with the season was

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:01.410
to help keep some 300,000 German
occupiers bottled up in Norway

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.380
so they couldn't be
transferred back to Germany

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.330
to fight the allied advance.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.130
This was a tough mission.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:11.860
Colby's men ended up fighting
Norway's brutal winter weather

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.100
as much as they did the Germans.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:18.500
Half of his 32 man force
never made it to Norway

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.050
because the planes carrying
them couldn't find the drop zone

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:25.820
in the snow or they crashed
killing everyone onboard.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.530 position:56%
Colby's commandos did manage to blow
up a bridge and destroy a section

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:33.420
of railroad track in central
Norway on the Nordland Rail Line

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.440
which carried German
troops north to south.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:40.880
But the raids were risky, and the
skiing was absolutely exhausting.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.950 position:56%
Colby's team, for example, nicknamed
one mountain they had to ski

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:47.280
over to escape a Nazi
patrol benzedrine hill

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.440
because practically all of them
had to gulp down stimulant pills

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.960
for the artificial
energy to get to the top.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.000
Finally, Richard Helms.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.590
He was born barely two weeks after
Casey in 1913, but any similarity

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.960
between the boys that [inaudible].

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:10.740
Helm's grandfather, Gates McGarrah,
was a famous international banker.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.910
His father was an Alcoa executive
who, along with his mother,

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.030
suffered bouts of depression.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.620
The family lived abroad where Helms
attended the pricey Le Rosey School

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:25.610
in Switzerland, and later the
[inaudible] in Freiburg, Germany.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.200
It was a cosmopolitan education

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.040
that Helms later thought
was ideal for a spy.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.080
Back home he became a big man
on campus at Williams College,

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.850
one of the little Ivy's
with a Phi Beta Kappa key,

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:42.190
and Harvard Law School opened
to him if he wanted it.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.440
But Helms instead chose journalism.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.900
He hoped to publish
a newspaper one day.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.800
He signed on with the United
Press, and in 1935 became

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.980
of the news agency's
correspondent in Berlin

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.730
where Adolph Hitler
was wildly popular.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:00.760
His prized assignment
came in September 1936

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.890
when he covered the annual Nazi
Party Congress in Nuremberg.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:08.520
After the rally Hitler invited
Helms and a half dozen other

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.710
of the foreign correspondents
to a, quote,

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.690
light lunch, in Nuremberg's Castle.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:17.150
Helms was surprised actually how
unremarkable the Fuhrer looked

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:18.450
to him.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:22.560 position:56%
The eyes that everybody claimed were
hypnotic were actually a dull slate

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.590
blue protruding from his eyes,

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.990
and Helms thought they
were quite ordinary.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:32.410
His pasty white face was
tinged slightly pink.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:36.630
Gold filled many of his teeth, and
his knees rocked back and forth

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:40.210 position:56%
when he talked to the reporters
which Helms thought was kind of odd.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:44.190
But it was clear to Helms after
his lunch with the dictator

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.960
that Hitler was intent
on going to war.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:52.330
After Pearl Harbor Helms joined
the Navy and was perfectly happy

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:55.030
in the services of the New York
office plotting merchant ship

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.600
movements to avoid German
U-boat packs when out

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:04.860 position:56%
of the blue the OSS summoned him to
its Washington headquarters in 1943.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:09.040 position:56%
Turns out Donovan's agency had sent
a request to the Navy for an officer

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.370
who spoke French and German
who had lived overseas

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.720
and who had worked as a reporter.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:19.510
And IBM computer in the Navy's
personnel office immediately spit

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:21.170
out Helms's name.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:25.380 position:56%
The next thing Helms knew he was in
a farmhouse in the countryside north

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.580
of Baltimore for two
week's of spy training.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.640
He learned how to build a cover
story to hide his identity,

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.940
how to pick locks, how
to burglarize offices,

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:37.150
how to blackmail foreign
officials, how to evade a shadowing

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:41.270
by Gestapo agents, how to fight
dirty with knives or pistols

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:44.290
or the jagged edge of a
whiskey bottle in a bar.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:48.310
Toward the end of his second week
as a field exercise Helms was sent

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:52.100
out with just $18 in his
pocket to try to talk his way

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.940
into a Pittsburgh steel plant and
abscond with documents on the types

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.260
of war goods it manufactured.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.940
The OSS called these
training exercises schemes.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.180
His palms sweating, his stomach all
knotted up, Helms managed to get

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:11.190 position:56%
into the plant, scoop up handfuls of
paper on an unattended desk and slip

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.790
out past inattentive guards.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:17.620
Now, two weeks wasn't enough
to make Helms a proficient spy.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.220
He'd need a lot more
training if he was going

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.380
to be going out to the field.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:25.700 position:56%
But it was enough for a staff job
at the OSS's Washington headquarters

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.360
on Navy Hill, which is right
next to the State Department now,

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.840
where he first served with
a planning group dreaming

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.900
up operations for overseas
stations and then work in a bureau

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.300
that coordinated intelligence
gathering on Germany.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.970
He had other odd jobs as well.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:46.530
Donovan one time brought Charles
de Gaulle's intelligence chief

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.950
who was this unsavory French
colonel to the United States

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.910
for what amounted to a
junket to butter him up.

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:57.340 position:56%
Because he spoke French and had been
a newspaperman, Helms was assigned

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.090
to the escort team for
the colonel and his aids

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.410
with the very important mission
of keeping the Frenchman's visit

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.310
out of American newspapers.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:09.490
So for three weeks a military
plane flew the Frenchman,

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:12.860
Helms and the other escorts around
the country to see the sights.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.960
So they had an expensive night
out at Antoine's Restaurant

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.560
in New Orleans, and Hollywood
studio executives arranged

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.860
for high price call girls
to entertain the colonel

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.110
and his aids in their hotel room.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:28.000
Helms was relieved that the
visit never got into the papers.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.170
He finally made it to
London in January 1945.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:34.510
He roomed with Casey
who lived like a slob,

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:38.050
and he worked with him keeping
an eye on the joe handlers.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:42.230
The spies the OSS sent
out were called joes.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.460
And an OSS handler was
assigned to watch over them

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.500
until they boarded the plane
that took them to the drop zone.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.310
Helms would drive out to
Harrington Field north of London

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.450
with the handlers and their
joes, watch the planes take off

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.380
with the spies, then
he'd wait at the airport

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.900
until the aircraft returned
and the pilot reported

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.990
that the parachute drop
had been successful.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:09.320
After Germany surrendered Helms and
Dulles moved into war torn Berlin

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.390
to set up a spy station there.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:16.470
It's hard for us to imagine today
just out devastated, how chaotic

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.480
and how still violent
the European Theater was

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.340
after Germany's surrender.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:25.860
The killing didn't
stop after May 8, 1945.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.460
Berlin was like the wild
west when Helms arrived.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.930
Millions of homeless and
starving souls filled the city.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.300
Billions of flies buzzed
over thousands

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.440
of rotting corpses in the rubble.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.470
Criminal gangs roamed the
streets, many of them made

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:44.450
up of tiny young orphans
shaking down American GIs.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:48.920
And Soviet spies infested the
western sectors the Americans,

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.260
British and French occupied.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:54.350
Helms and the station's other
officers hunted for war criminals,

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:56.860
tracked down artwork
the Nazis had stolen,

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:00.960 position:56%
helped round up German scientists in
an operation code names Paperclip.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.540
And even located the nurse from the
Fuhrer bunker near the [inaudible]

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:10.350
who detailed for them Hitler's
final days in the bunker.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:13.840
The target of Helms's spying
soon shifted from the remnants

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.370
of Nazi Germany to the Soviets
who occupied East Berlin.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:22.160
And under highly classified
orders from Donovan Helms

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.460
and the other operatives in
the Berlin station also spied

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.230
on the British and the
French in their sectors.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.630
Donovan assumed that the British
and the French were spying

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:33.780
on the Americans so he
wanted to return the favor.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.160
Helms, Dulles, Colby and
Casey all returned home

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:41.070
from the World War II not
emotionally scarred or drained

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.370
by what they had experienced.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.120
You don't find any
PTSD among these guys.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.750
Instead, they came back rather
invigorated from their fight

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.920
against Nazism, and eager
and ready for the next battle

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.040
which was against communism.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.120
World War II had a huge
impact on their lives.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:03.590
Dulles ran the CIA much as he
did the OSS station in Bern.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.340
The OSS taught Helms
how to be a spy,

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.710
and after the war he decided
intelligence collection

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.690
and not the newspaper
business was his calling.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:16.060
Bill Colby who wore his floppy
fatigue cap from the war

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.850
when he tended his garden got
a law degree when he returned.

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:24.240
But he quickly grew bored
with being a lawyer.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.510
He joined the CIA to fight
Communists had he had the Nazis

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.850
for the OSS.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:33.750
When Bill Casey became CIA
Director he hung two pictures

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:37.860
in his Langley office, one of
Ronald Regan and the other a photo

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.450
of his mentor, Wild Bill Donovan.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:42.040
So I'll end it with that.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:46.510
Any questions or comments or
anything else on your mind?

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:53.280
[ Applause ]

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.080
Yeah?

00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:02.040
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.900
&gt;&gt; OSS was really like an old
boys' network, an old boys' club.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.760
But I know that there was
some woman in Florida,

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.060
especially one famous woman

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.410
who became famous later,
Julie Child, of course.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.710
[inaudible].

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.010
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Right.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:16.310
&gt;&gt; How common was it for
women to work in OSS?

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.480
I mean she's unusual anyway.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.670
She met her husband [inaudible].

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.220
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller:
Right, Paul Child.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:29.250
&gt;&gt; And how did the few women
who worked there relate

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:32.260
to this [inaudible] guys' network.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.560
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Right.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:38.120
Yeah, it was a question
about women in the OSS.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:43.610
You mentioned Julia Child is one
of the most noteworthy examples,

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:47.850
and how did they work and
relate to the guys on the OSS?

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:51.000
Actually it wasn't a small number
of women who were in the OSS.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.850
Donovan hired about
4,000 women for the OSS.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.750
It's interesting.

00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:01.240
Even though Donovan actually had a
number of affairs over the years,

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.490
he had a number of mistresses,
he was still somewhat

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.560
of a feminist in other respects.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:12.880
He paid the women at the OSS higher
salaries than they could earn

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.460
in any other federal agency.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.760
So they liked working there.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:20.400
Still there was a glass
ceiling in the organization.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.720
A few of them rose up past the
ranks of the secretarial pool,

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:30.420
or like Julia Child who
was in morale operations,

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.390
eventually stationed in Salon.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:38.180
Some of them became
a research analyst.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.990
Although when they went over to
the Pentagon they were required

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:45.480
to walk behind the director
of research so as not

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:51.030
to appear equals to the guys there.

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:55.370
Donovan himself used women an
awful lot in the organization

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.830
as spies and propagandists.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:03.310 position:56%
Although he was a tyrant to work
for, at least among his secretaries.

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:07.620 position:56%
In fact his secretaries -- Donovan's
code number in the OSS was 109

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.120 position:56%
which just happened to be his room
number in the headquarters building.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.650
The secretaries also gave
him another code name.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.860
They called him Seabiscuit
because he was like the racehorse,

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.380
he always seemed to be
running around and demanding.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:24.590
But he was really overly
demanding with his operatives.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.560
But they had women working
not only in research

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.630
but also as spies, saboteurs.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:33.060
Some of them worked with
the French Resistance,

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.710
and they had casualties
among the women, too.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.010
Yeah?

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.130
&gt;&gt; I don't have a question,
but the question

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.320
that was just asked
makes me make a comment.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.600
My mother was one of those women.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.900
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Oh, really?

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.200
What's her name.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.500
&gt;&gt; Marian Freaswick [phonetic].

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.800
And she and my father
both worked in OSS.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.100
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Really?

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.400
&gt;&gt; They both stayed at the CIA.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.490
My father retired from the
CIA after 40 some years.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:54.910
But she was a research analyst.

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:57.550
They were both cartographers
in training and were brought

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.230 position:56%
in to build the map division in OSS.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.530
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Right.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.020
Yeah, the map division was actually
very, very important for the OSS.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.620
Because a lot of places they
were dropping, particular allies,

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.710
they didn't have valuable
maps on it.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:13.070
I mean they used Michelin
guides for the Torch invasion.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:17.630
So that was actually a
very important division.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:22.780
But, yeah, as I say, actually there
were a lot of couples in the OSS.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.220
&gt;&gt; They met there and married.

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.500
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: And who
went on to work in the CIA.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:32.360
How about that?

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.540
Yeah?

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:40.510
&gt;&gt; Briefly [inaudible] positions
these [inaudible] how did they get

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:44.780
to be [inaudible],
what was their path?

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.080
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Oh, okay.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.740
Yeah, how did my four
characters become CIA directors?

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.440
How did they raise up?

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.720
As I say, we'll start
with Allen Dulles.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:59.090
He came back to the United
States after the war had ended

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.430
after a short time in
the Berlin station.

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:06.290
Went back to Sullivan &amp;
Cromwell to the law firm.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:07.970
Was bored silly with it.

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:16.140
Eventually joined what became
the CIA as a Deputy Director

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.910
under Bedell Smith who had been
Eisenhower's Chief of Staff

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.880
and was the first CIA Director.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.550
Then he rose up from there

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:30.910
and became CIA Director
under Dwight Eisenhower.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:34.260
Donovan actually, incidentally,
thought it was a --

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.050
Donovan was lobbying for CIA
Director under Eisenhower himself

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:41.840
and thought Dulles would
be a lousy administrator

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.600
and would screw up the agency.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.390
Ironically Dulles also thought
he could have run the OSS better

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:50.500
than Donovan did.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.440
Let's see, Richard Helms came next.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:59.800 position:56%
He came back from Berlin, the
Berlin station, and went immediately

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.040
into what were the successor
organizations to the CIA,

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:08.950
the Central Intelligence
Division at one point.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:17.410
And at a very young age became the
manager of clandestine operations

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:20.990
for Europe and then really
for the entire world.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:22.940
Rose up through the ranks quickly.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:27.110
Worked for Dulles when
Dulles was CIA Director,

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:30.640
although Dulles always thought
Helms was a good administrator

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.140
but not a swashbuckler
like Dulles wanted.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:36.360
In fact, a lot of people say
that if Helms had been in charge

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:42.430
of the covert branch that at the
time of the CIA Bay of Pigs fiasco

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:43.730
that it would have never occurred.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:47.670
Helms would have limited
it in scope.

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:52.430
Bill Colby came back, as
I say, became a lawyer.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:55.540
Worked in Donovan's
law firm for a while.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.470
Then came to Washington, worked

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.180
at the National Labor Relations
Board for a little bit.

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:06.250
Was bored silly with it, and
eventually drifted into the CIA.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:11.230
In fact, his wife Barbara found out
about that he had moved to the CIA

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:15.240
when one of the I guess
people in the car pool noticed

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.350
that Colby was always walking
in the opposite director

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:24.470
of the National Labor Relations
Board to where the CIA was located.

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:29.610
He rose up in the ranks, became
really a star for the agency,

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:33.370
particularly in the
East Asia division.

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.590
Went to Vietnam two times.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:38.360
Was fairly controversial then.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:44.330
Became linked or tarred by some
of the CIA operations in Vietnam,

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.140
particularly the Phoenix program.

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:54.410
And eventually when
Nixon fired Helms,

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.210
this is during the
Watergate scandal,

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.800
Helms actually drew the line at
one point on things he would not do

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.760 position:56%
for Nixon and the Watergate scandal.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.110
Nixon appointed Colby
as CIA director

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:08.660
because he thought he
could manage him better.

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:12.220
And then it turned out
that Colby later on really

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:17.460 position:56%
to save the agency opened up what
were called the Family Jewels Report

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.910
on the agency misdeeds to Congress.

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:26.190
Bill Casey when he came back from
World War II he really wanted

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:30.660
to follow the same path that
Donovan had which was he wanted

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:35.570
to make his millions in New York
on Wall Street and then come back

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:38.090
to Washington to get
into national security

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.150 position:56%
which is what basically Donovan did.

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:43.390
So after he did make his
millions he first worked

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:47.880
in Richard Nixon's campaign,
ghost wrote a book for Nixon,

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:53.180
and was noticed there, and
then became Ronald Regan's

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.480
campaign manager.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:59.530 position:56%
And Regan credited him with being I
guess what you'd call his Karl Rove,

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:02.500 position:56%
the architect, to save his campaign.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:08.340
Colby expected to be made Secretary
of State of Secretary of Defense

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:11.260
for getting Ronald Regan elected.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:15.050
But Nancy Regan was horrified
at the notion of Colby

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:19.540
who was a real sloppy eater
being at diplomatic dinners.

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:25.160
And Caspar Weinberger who was a
member of the California Mafia,

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.620
the inner circle, had the
Defense Department locked up.

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.780
So Regan offered Casey the CIA.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.830
And at first Casey told him,
well, I have to think about it.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:39.480
He was kind of insulted which
kind of surprised Regan.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.420 position:56%
He thought it was a pretty good job.

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:46.610
Finally some of the OSS
veterans convinced Casey

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:51.090
that it was a perfect job for
him, particularly for, you know,

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:55.730
the hardline foreign
policy that he believed in

00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:00.020
and that Regan was ushering in,
you know, the whole strategy

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.820
of rolling back Communism
instead of containing it.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.970
So that real quick history
is how those four guys got

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:10.360
to where they did.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.160
Yeah?

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:27.040
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:31.900
Right. The question is
Colby's mysterious death.

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.200
Let's talk about that,

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:38.100
and the different theories
about what happened.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:45.530
Colby, this was in Maryland at
his lakeside country home there,

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:50.680
went out in a boat and drowned.

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.760
His body was found later.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.540
This was after he left the CIA.

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:58.950
And there have been all
kinds of conspiracy theories

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:06.450
that have been battered around that
maybe the KGB hit team got Colby

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:12.810
and killed him, or
that angry CIA officers

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:17.040
who still hated Colby
bumped him off.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:26.500
Carl Colby who is one of
Colby's sons, did a documentary

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:32.320 position:56%
where his theory was that Colby was
distraught over his role in Vietnam,

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:38.110 position:56%
the Phoenix program, distraught over
the death of his daughter who died

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:41.200
of anorexia, a very tragic case.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.720
I looked into all the
investigative files

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.040 position:56%
and the autopsy and everything else.

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.730
And what you find a lot of
times in the spy business

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:52.830
and everything is the most
mundane explanation turns

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:54.210
out to be the true one.

00:50:54.210 --> 00:51:00.290
In Colby's case after a nice clam
dinner and a bottle of wine he went

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:05.870
out and decided to take a row
in his rowboat out in the lake.

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:10.550
Suffered a massive heart attack
and a stroke, fell out of the boat

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:12.720
and drowned and that was it.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.020
He was never distraught
over Vietnam.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:16.630
He slept like a baby over Vietnam.

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:18.710
He was proud of what he did there.

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:23.970
And although he was sad
about his daughter's death,

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:31.270
he was not distraught
enough to take his life.

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:36.840
Even so I mean the conspiracy
theories have lasted to this day.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:42.240
And I guess the most
prominent one is

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.540
that disgruntled CIA
officers bumped him off.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:49.460
Actually interestingly
enough Sally Shelton-Colby,

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:55.670
who was Bill Colby's second wife,
told me she got I think phone calls

00:51:55.670 --> 00:52:00.460
from ten people who said they
were CIA officers after Colby died

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:04.850
who said they thought
he got it coming to him,

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:07.880
the accident and everything.

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.800
Anything else?

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.510
Thank you very -- I'm sorry,
one more question, sorry.

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:20.130
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:21.760
Yeah, that was Colby.

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.710
The Church Committee
and the Pike Committee

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.380
on the House side were
the two committees set

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:31.730
up to investigate the CIA
abuses in the 50s, 60s and 70s.

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:34.500
Colby was CIA Director then.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:42.160
He faced really a critical choice
and decided to release a huge batch

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:46.990
of material and particularly
the Family Jewels Report

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:50.720
which is something like 700
pages long of CIA missives

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.660
in the 50s, 60s and early 70s.

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.050
There have been a lot of
theories on why he did it.

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:57.770
Some people thought he
was an overgrown Boy Scout

00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:02.320
or a Jesuit going haywire
and confessing too much.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:08.980
Or that he had other lofty
-- other motives behind it.

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:13.100
When I talked to Colby's
son, one of them is a lawyer,

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.780
he confided to him
exactly why he did it,

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.750
and it was because he was a lawyer.

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:21.330
And because in any court
case in a discovery case,

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:26.310
I don't know if we have any
lawyers in the group here,

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:29.340
if a judge demands discovery

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:32.850
and you don't produce everything
that's demanded by the court

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:37.770
for a particular trial or case, the
judge will just order the marshals

00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:40.080
in to clear everything
out of your organization.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.980
Well, Colby realized that in the
case of Congress if he didn't turn

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.500 position:56%
over material to Congress they would
come in and just tear everything

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.380
out of the agency and
really disable it.

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:55.010 position:56%
And so this way he managed to really
control what went to Capitol Hill

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:58.940
and ended up saving
the agency in the end.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:02.580
It could have been broken
apart at that point.

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.620
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Doug, I
get the final question.

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:09.140
Would you say word about the role
that the Library of Congress played

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:10.920
in the creation of the CIA?

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.760
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Oh, yes,
I'm glad you asked that.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.530
Actually it played a
very prominent role.

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:21.190
When Donovan first formed the
agency, he said he actually started

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:23.220
from minus zero which was the case.

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.510
He only had one guy
and that was himself.

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:29.430
He had to set up -- he knew he
wanted to set up a research outfit

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:33.960
that eventually became the Research
and Analysis Branch of this agency.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:39.070
But initially he set it up
here in the Library of Congress

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:44.240
and used academics here that
were associated with the Library

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.790
of Congress, the most notable

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:48.560
of which was Archibald
MacLeish who was the --

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Librarian at the time.

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.500
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: --
Librarian at the time, right.

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.600
&gt;&gt; John Cole: From 1939 to 44.

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.990
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Who
helped Donovan set it

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:57.290
up for him here in the Library.

00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.000
And, in fact, if you go
through the Manuscript Division,

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.630
and I went through
Archibald MacLeish's papers,

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:05.120
you can see all the memos
and letters that he wrote

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.120
to Donovan in that early period.

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.280
Eventually then they
moved the Research Branch

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.720
to navy Hill next to
the State Department.

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.570
But its start was here
in the Library.

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:19.410
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you.

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:21.090
We'll take one more question.

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:24.250
&gt;&gt; Just a quick comment on
that with family relationships.

00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:27.200
My great aunt's stepson was a guy
named George Kackley [phonetic],

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.690
he worked for the Legislative
Reference Service.

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:30.990
&gt;&gt; What's the last name?

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:33.840
&gt;&gt; George Kackley, grew up
in Berryville, Virginia.

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.140
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Yeah.

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.460
&gt;&gt; And he worked for the
Legislative Reference Service.

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:39.220
And he worked for Bill Donovan

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:42.570
and later James Jesus
Angleton at the CIA.

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:47.400
And to take the ironies even
further, he was caretaker

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.720
of Oakhill Cemetery for a
while which is the same job

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.260
as David Baldacci's
protagonist [inaudible].

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:57.770
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Oh, that
makes a great conspiracy.

00:55:57.770 --> 00:56:01.030
I don't know what, but it
makes a great conspiracy.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:04.110
&gt;&gt; George Kackley was also, this
was news to me, I learned this

00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:06.940
in his obituary, he was a
paratrooper during World War II,

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:09.450
and he worked at the Library
prior to World War II.

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:11.980
So there might be some
OSS connection there.

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:13.280
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Could be.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.580
Oh, that's fascinating.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.130
&gt;&gt; John Cole: We're
a shady agency here.

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:18.690
Join me in thanking Doug
Waller for a wonderful talk.

00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:20.490
&gt;&gt; Douglas Waller: Thank you.

00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:23.060
[ Applause ]

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:24.980
&gt;&gt; John Cole: We're going to
have a book signing out back.

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.890
You can buy a copy of
the book at the Library

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.230 position:56%
of Congress discount, get it signed.

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.790
And I just want to comment I
can see the reporter in you

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:34.090
and the journalist in you.

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:35.470
You really did a terrific job

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:39.400
in presenting everybody's
story and kept it moving.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.780
It was great fun.

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:44.100 position:56%
One more round of applause for Doug.

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.400
[Applause]

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.670
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
