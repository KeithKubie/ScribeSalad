00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:02.460
- I'm sure you noticed

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.422
conspicuously absent any steel.

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:07.632
That's because in the
first round of competition

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:08.800
we're giving you this.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:20.520
A huge pile of 5160 spring
steel that you gotta figure

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.480
out how to forge
into a signature

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.692
blade in your signature style.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:29.028
The length of your blades must
be between 10 and 13 inches.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.405
The overall length
of your weapon

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.532
must not exceed 22 inches.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:36.411
You must include a through
tang in your blade's design.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.581
You have three hours
to forge your blades.

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:40.832
Good luck.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.709
Your 10 minute design
window starts--

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.043
now.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.962
I'm going to make
a recurve camp knife.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.381
I know they can stab with
the drop point on them.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.050
I want something with nice
curves that's good for slicing

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.344
and something that
I know will satisfy

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.472
the obstacles that they're
going to be put through.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.932
Bladesmiths, your 10 minute
design window has closed.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.769
Your three hour
forge time starts--

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.104
now.

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:05.190
I'm going to give
canister Damascus a shot.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.902
But I've never done one before,
so it's a little intimidating.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.111
Ooh!

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:11.488
When I think
these guys are going

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.948
for is if they stretch
out the springs it's

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:15.366
easier to get powder around--

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.535
Powder all the way
around that material.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:20.246
If I don't put space
between each coil,

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:24.876
then I could end up with
delamination or cold shut.

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:28.671
I've never welded
before, so this is fun.

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.549
OK, so we have a smith here
that does not know how to weld.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.967
- Come on, Andrew.
- Uh-oh.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:33.802
Yeah, turn it on first.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:34.636
[laughing]

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:35.845
Turning it on helps.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.264
Let's see if he
gets the hang of it.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.682
[bleep]

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:40.642
I mean, it's-- shoot.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.564
I can't see through the visor.

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:49.651
And I'm trying to hook
the welder up to the steel

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.654
and then quickly
pull down my mask,

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.322
'cause I can't see anything.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:58.701
Mother-- It's ugly.

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.161
[bleep]

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:01.746
Just dumped his
canister and spilled

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.623
about half his powder out.
- Ah jeez.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:04.999
Oh man.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.376
I'm pretty bummed.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:08.044
But there's no way this
is going to happen.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:09.462
I'm not going to
even waste time to do

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.381
something that I don't know.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:17.053
I gotta do a 180 and try to make
up for all this lost time now.

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:18.638
I don't have time for
any more mess ups.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.431
I've already messed up once.

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.809
Plan B is to get these
coil springs welded up.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.144
And I'm going to get
a piece of mild steel,

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:27.897
wrap it around that, weld it
together for some [inaudible]..

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:32.861
He's got one long wire,
but so little metal.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.280
I've got my springs
welded up, so now I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.700
start getting my mild steel
into a sandwich shape.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.451
I need to get it nice
and tight to where

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:43.872
it's not going to fall out
when I go to set my first weld.

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:44.747
[bleep]

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:50.086
Andrew's moving some steel.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.838
The problem with
Andrew moving some steel

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.214
is he doesn't have
enough steel to even

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:56.968
create an edge for that thing.

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.511
I know what I'm
going to end up with,

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.763
and it's not going to
be my style or pretty,

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:03.182
but I just want to get a
knife done at this point.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:13.151
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.404
Bladesmiths, shut down your
machines and drop your tools!

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:19.198
This forging round is over.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.034
[applause]

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:24.537
I hope the judges
can appreciate

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.206
that I did everything
the old-fashioned way.

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:29.417
I don't really
appreciate welding.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:30.460
I like to do rivets.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.545
I think welds are kind of ugly.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.589
For the most part,
[bleep] welder.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.427
Bladesmiths, this
was a very difficult

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.679
round one, really
challenging your problem

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:43.681
solving capabilities.

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:45.099
Now it's time for
the judges to take

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.517
a closer look at your work.

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:50.313
Mike, you're up.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.106
One thing that I
like about this blade

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:54.943
is it's designed
for a stabbing test.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.570
So you have that spear-like
shape over there.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.238
I like that you have
a false edge on one

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:01.407
side that'll support the stab.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:04.786
Andrew, you know what to do.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.454
I'm gonna be
totally honest, MIG

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.748
welding is about the easiest
welding there is out there.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.500
I really would
have liked to have

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.128
seen you maybe spend about 10
minutes and just figure it out.

00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:17.882
That could definitely help
you beef this blade up, OK.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:20.718
This is very lean.

00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:21.469
Bill, you're up.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.227
You got wires
that are sticking

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.020
up on the ends that are loose.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.399
I can wiggle the
wires inside the taco,

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.484
so it's definitely
not welded up 100%.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:37.193
[clattering]

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:39.320
Especially that piece.

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:45.785
Bill, your blade
did not make the cut.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.537
Jay will explain.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.247
Bill, we all really
appreciate the work

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:52.208
you put into that challenge,
but not having your high carbon

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.877
steel forge welded together,
it's the least developed blade

00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:56.671
we have presented to us today.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.548
So that's why we're
going to let you go.
