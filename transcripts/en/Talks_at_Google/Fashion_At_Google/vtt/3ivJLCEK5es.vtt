MARTHA HUNT: So hi, guys.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.920
I'm really excited
to be here today.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.320
This is my first Google Talk.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.630
And I'm very excited to
be talking about fashion

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.310
with my friend Jason Wu.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.180
He's a very creative
and talented designer,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.860
one of the best in the world.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.726
So let's get started.

00:00:16.726 --> 00:00:17.350
JASON WU: Sure.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.400
MARTHA HUNT: We've known each
other for about five years now,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.900
right?

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.830
JASON WU: Yeah.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.737
It seems like forever ago.

00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:23.570
MARTHA HUNT: I know.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.610
It's crazy.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.630
JASON WU: Next year is
my 10th anniversary, so--

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.670
MARTHA HUNT: And you
definitely didn't even

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.057
have three lines when I met you.

00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:29.598
JASON WU: No.

00:00:29.598 --> 00:00:30.554
MARTHA HUNT: So much
has changed since then.

00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:32.180
JASON WU: Now I have
a thousand jobs.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.310
It was a much more
innocent time.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.342
MARTHA HUNT: So the most--

00:00:37.342 --> 00:00:38.550
JASON WU: I love this camera.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.195
I can see which
angle I look better.

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:45.790
This is better, less fat.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.840
MARTHA HUNT: He's
not vain, I promise.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.660
So the most recent
time that we hung out

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.992
was for the launch for
your "Grey" Jason Wu line.

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:55.200
That was a really fun dinner.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.158
I had such a good time.

00:00:56.158 --> 00:00:58.430
JASON WU: Cool.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.240
MARTHA HUNT: Let's
talk first about how

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.560
you started your career in
fashion and what inspired you.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.660
JASON WU: Yeah, I mean, I
started around 10 years ago

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.010
when I was 23.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.550
And I left school, which
means I did not graduate.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.230
That was a nice
way of saying it.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.850
And I just really wanted to get
my hands dirty and really work.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.700
I was always just been
really curious about how

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.370
everything worked.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.060
I'm not the kind that likes to
read instruction manuals very

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.620
much.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.250
I just want to do
things and try it out.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.820
So that's kind of what I did.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.535
I went into the industry.

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:39.160
I didn't even really
know that much.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.280
I mean, I had interned
before, but I didn't really

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.530
know so much about the
ins and outs of fashion

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.370
and how complicated
everything was.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.150
So it definitely was trial by
fire going into the industry.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.870
But I would say
the one great thing

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.810
about it is that I
think I can say now

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.430
I've done every job that
exists in my company, which

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.190
is really nice because
to be able to really have

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.620
that understanding, even if
I'm not doing everything.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.300
MARTHA HUNT: That's impressive.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.230
You had to learn
everything on your own.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.410
JASON WU: Yeah, I remember
carrying big paper patterns

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.180
down Seventh Avenue.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.510
And then getting them graded.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.216
And then we were like, oh.

00:02:21.216 --> 00:02:23.487
In school, you only
have to make one sample.

00:02:23.487 --> 00:02:24.950
And we're like,
oh, we didn't know

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.274
we have to do different
sizes, different things--

00:02:28.274 --> 00:02:29.190
like all those things.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.270
MARTHA HUNT: A big
learning curve.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.000
JASON WU: Yeah, a big
learning curve, yeah.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.541
MARTHA HUNT: Well,
it's really sounds

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:37.410
like the classic American
story-- immigrant family,

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.770
your family really
believed in you,

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.690
and you're really self-made,
which I think is amazing.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.800
What have been some challenges
throughout the fashion industry

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.010
that you've encountered
throughout the way?

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.690
JASON WU: Well, I think,
in general, I definitely

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.650
don't come from a
background of fashion.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.110
My dad is in the
agriculture industry.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.330
So it's very, very far.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.496
MARTHA HUNT: Very different.

00:03:01.496 --> 00:03:02.537
JASON WU: Very different.

00:03:02.537 --> 00:03:05.140
He specializes in animal feed.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.820
So that's the whole opposite.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.770
So everyone's like, is
your family in fashion?

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.604
I was like, really very,
very far from that.

00:03:13.604 --> 00:03:16.186
MARTHA HUNT: He probably still
doesn't understand what you do.

00:03:16.186 --> 00:03:17.664
JASON WU: No, not really.

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:19.660
No.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.473
You walk into--

00:03:20.473 --> 00:03:21.380
MARTHA HUNT: Just vogue.com.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.838
JASON WU: You walk
into his office,

00:03:22.838 --> 00:03:27.190
and there's a big marble
sculpture of a pig.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.982
He's obsessed with pigs.

00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:29.690
MARTHA HUNT: Wow.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.926
JASON WU: Literally.

00:03:30.926 --> 00:03:37.930
And the irony is I'm allergic
to pork, so very sad.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.180
MARTHA HUNT: No bacon for you.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.259
JASON WU: True story, though.

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.550
No, but I think, definitely,
some of the challenges are

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.310
I came up.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.428
I didn't really know that much.

00:03:50.956 --> 00:03:52.330
And I didn't have
a lot of money.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.380
MARTHA HUNT: Wow.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.540
JASON WU: So I started
using the seed money that I

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.720
got from working in toys.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.680
When I was in high
school, I double-dutied

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.790
as a toy designer.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.310
MARTHA HUNT: Oh, really?

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.670
JASON WU: Yeah, it's a whole--

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.600
MARTHA HUNT: Like
what kind of toys?

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.905
JASON WU: Dolls.

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:05.210
MARTHA HUNT: Oh.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.050
JASON WU: I used to play with
dolls when I was growing up.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.520
MARTHA HUNT: Ah, that doesn't
surprise me for some reason.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.910
JASON WU: I know.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.270
And so that was how
it all happened.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.295
But I would say I was way
more adventurous back then

00:04:17.295 --> 00:04:18.560
than I am now.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.430
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah,
had to conform.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.690
JASON WU: A little bit.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.620
MARTHA HUNT: So let's talk
about technology and fashion,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.930
and how that's changed the
industry perspective for you.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.430
I'm sure you have to incorporate
a lot of social media

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.010
and technology
with your business.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.440
JASON WU: Yeah, I mean, I
think it's all changing.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.610
I think one of the things that
may seem like the tech world

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.880
and what I do is very far apart.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.570
But, in fact, so much
of what we do now

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.120
is reliant on technology,
like the way we weave fabric,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.410
the way we work with synthetics.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.230
When fabric used to be woven,
they were all done by hand.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.520
So you think how
many fibers goes

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.385
into the little thread that goes
into the making of a fabric.

00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:06.260
MARTHA HUNT: Wow.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.051
JASON WU: That was all
done by hand before,

00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:10.190
so obviously the
productivity level,

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.640
and also the ability to do
things on a more advanced way

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.550
is interesting.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.630
Like the garment
you're wearing today

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.280
from my collection "Grey,"
it's all laser-cut.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.380
There's no traditional
hand-finishing on any of it.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.370
Super light, it doesn't
wrinkle so much.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.200
It's all just like
synthetics that we're

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.730
able to play with nowadays, play
with different modern finishes.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.820
And that's what technology
has done for us.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.960
As an industry, we can
get more innovative

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.700
in terms of on how
we make clothes.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.060
Less literal like light-up
clothes, but more like,

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.020
how do you make clothes lighter?

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.090
How do you make them in
a more efficient way?

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.190
And how do you--

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.670
MARTHA HUNT: Quicker
and more efficient.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.570
JASON WU: Quicker and more
efficient, but also just more

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.070
precise.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.510
MARTHA HUNT: Well, what
about social media?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.885
JASON WU: Yeah,
I mean, it's fun.

00:06:01.885 --> 00:06:03.950
I mean, I just recently
took up Snapchat.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.200
MARTHA HUNT: You got to do it.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.580
All the kids are Snapchatting.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.788
JASON WU: Follow me @jasonwu.

00:06:06.788 --> 00:06:07.761
She's very good.

00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:08.552
I'm still learning.

00:06:08.552 --> 00:06:09.376
MARTHA HUNT: Oh, yeah?

00:06:09.376 --> 00:06:11.370
JASON WU: Yeah, I Snapchat
a bunch last night,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.340
but I was drunk.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.880
And I woke.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.670
I was doing a "W
Magazine" takeover.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.342
And I was like,
shit, this morning?

00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:18.050
I was like, whoa.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.330
And all that.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.830
MARTHA HUNT: No, those
make the best Snapchats.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.935
JASON WU: I know.

00:06:19.935 --> 00:06:20.851
They're kind of funny.

00:06:20.851 --> 00:06:22.960
MARTHA HUNT: It
shows the real you.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.582
The fun Jason.

00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:24.290
JASON WU: I know.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.330
Because everyone always
think I'm very serious.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.262
MARTHA HUNT: Oh, he's not
serious, not serious at all.

00:06:29.262 --> 00:06:30.720
JASON WU: Well,
that's why I wanted

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.230
to just talk with you because
we're actually friends.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.380
MARTHA HUNT: Yes.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.830
JASON WU: So it
doesn't feel so forced.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.538
MARTHA HUNT: Yes.

00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:36.477
JASON WU: I can put on
my Oprah hat for you.

00:06:36.477 --> 00:06:37.595
The Oprah, the serious--

00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:39.720
MARTHA HUNT: It'd be fun
playing Oprah for the day.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.722
JASON WU: Plus, I don't think
you're very interested in that.

00:06:42.722 --> 00:06:45.180
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah, social media
takes some getting used to.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.440
JASON WU: Yeah.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.580
MARTHA HUNT: I finally
just got a Facebook.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.410
I've been Snapchatting,
Instagramming.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.400
But now, I feel like
more than ever it's

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.090
about creating a brand.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.090
You notice that as well.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.370
You're--

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.369
JASON WU: Well, I think
that's very interesting.

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:57.590
I mean, I think
maybe when I met you,

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.120
in just such a-- in
five short years,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.537
I feel like modeling
has changed--

00:07:01.537 --> 00:07:02.870
MARTHA HUNT: It's changed a lot.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.469
JASON WU: --so much
for you, right?

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:05.010
I feel like--

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.676
MARTHA HUNT: Well,
when I first met you,

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:08.630
I had been known more
for my catalog work.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.130
So I was really, really excited
that you took a chance on me

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.210
because there were many of
years I was modeling before I

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.450
branched into high fashion.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.640
And I had to really persevere
and take risks and management

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.710
switch to find an agency
that truly believed in me.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.079
And then one season,
I went out for shows.

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:26.370
And Jason was one of the
first to believe me and put me

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.460
in his show.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.940
And since then, it's all
snowballed from there.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.400
And I feel like we
have similar stories

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.752
that we believed in ourself.

00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:36.070
And we persevered.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.444
JASON WU: Well, I think it's
important with modeling now,

00:07:38.444 --> 00:07:38.944
too.

00:07:38.944 --> 00:07:42.990
It's like you used to
be-- when I started out,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.330
high fashion was one thing.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:50.799
You had to be super skinny
and almost no personality,

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:51.840
like robots a little bit.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.160
And I think--

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.035
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah, it
was always hard for me.

00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:56.420
I always felt like I had to
be so serious all the time.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.465
My agents would tell
me, don't be so bubbly.

00:07:58.465 --> 00:08:01.412
And I'm like, well-- and
then people would say, oh,

00:08:01.412 --> 00:08:02.370
she looks like a bitch.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.460
I'm like, well, how
am I supposed to act?

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.784
There's no right way to do it.

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:07.450
JASON WU: I thought
that when I met you.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:08.408
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah, see?

00:08:08.408 --> 00:08:11.480
There we go.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.980
Here I am trying
to not seem bubbly.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.300
JASON WU: I'm giving
you a great opportunity.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.561
Stop being such a bitch.

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.060
You know?

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.540
No, but it was really
very interesting

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.800
because I've always loved women.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.670
And I love women
with personality

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.474
and a point of view.

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:28.890
When I met you,
it was just really

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.470
all about the
girls of the moment

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.110
were all girls that looked
the same, mostly European,

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.672
all speaking English, 16.

00:08:36.672 --> 00:08:37.380
MARTHA HUNT: Mhm.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.169
I lived in model apartments
with them throughout the world.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.270
JASON WU: Yeah,
and I just thought,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.159
I want to dress girls
that inspire me.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.200
I want to dress girls
that are interesting

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.020
and I can have a real
conversation with.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.510
And that's what makes
my job interesting

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.660
because I envision
everything I do,

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.940
every outfit I
design for a girl.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.440
So if something
comes in, I was like,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.914
well-- like today, I gave you
one option to wear, this dress.

00:09:03.914 --> 00:09:06.580
No, seriously, because I knew it
was going to look great on her.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.050
We're going to do a red lip.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.966
And we're going to do
the hair back like that,

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.920
but very, very specific
because it looks great on her.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.162
Fashion should be curated
to everyone's personality.

00:09:18.162 --> 00:09:19.120
MARTHA HUNT: Thank you.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.280
JASON WU: It's not one
size fits all, right?

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.488
And I just felt like what
was wrong with the industry

00:09:23.488 --> 00:09:26.400
a lot of time was that
these girls were thrust

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.890
into these crazy
fashion environments

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.110
where they couldn't
possibly have a personality.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.840
MARTHA HUNT: No, of course.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.510
And then people
always wonder why

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.530
we don't show our
personality in a casting.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.154
And it's like you
can't even really get

00:09:39.154 --> 00:09:41.390
to know somebody within five
seconds of meeting them.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.740
That takes a while after
you've been working together

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.740
to build a relationship.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.179
JASON WU: Yeah, but I feel
like you came a super long way

00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:49.720
since we met.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.060
MARTHA HUNT: Thank you.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.519
JASON WU: I mean, I think
now it's almost essential.

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:54.560
There's no such thing as
being a commercial model

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.510
or a high-fashion model.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.517
In fact, it's all about creating
a brand and being more--

00:09:59.517 --> 00:10:01.100
MARTHA HUNT: Well,
it's about treating

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.300
the job like a business.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.635
In the beginning, it's funny.

00:10:03.635 --> 00:10:05.010
When I first
started modeling, it

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.301
was like you're supposed to
take modeling so seriously.

00:10:07.301 --> 00:10:09.700
You're not supposed to express
interest in other fields.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.070
But now it's encouraged to
want to do other things,

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.262
to start a business, or
act, to do all these things.

00:10:14.262 --> 00:10:15.720
And that's because
of social media.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.180
And because they want
you to become a brand,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.680
which I'm actually really
enjoying that part.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.290
Technology is really helping
shape the arc of my career

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.540
because social media
is giving me a platform

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.350
to show my personality
and hopefully give fans

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.480
something to be inspired by.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.220
JASON WU: I don't know if
everyone's saw "Zoolander 2"?

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.426
Did anyone see it?

00:10:37.426 --> 00:10:39.620
Or else it won't
make-- no one saw it?

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.000
OK, it wouldn't make sense.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.865
But it was a funny line
when Penelope Cruz was

00:10:43.865 --> 00:10:46.156
like, you know, I used to be
a model, but I have boobs.

00:10:46.156 --> 00:10:48.220
And this is why I
couldn't do high fashion.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.492
MARTHA HUNT: I feel like
that line resonated so well

00:10:50.492 --> 00:10:51.700
within the fashion industry--

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.450
JASON WU: Yeah, I know.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:52.690
We loved it.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.523
MARTHA HUNT: --because
we know that so well.

00:10:54.523 --> 00:10:57.600
It used to be a swimsuit model
couldn't be doing high fashion.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.360
But now you see the
"Sports Illustrated"

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.070
models are on the
cover of "Vogue."

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.880
And it's all mixed,
which I love that.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.137
I love that we are
all about empowering

00:11:05.137 --> 00:11:06.345
different types of women now.

00:11:06.345 --> 00:11:09.690
It doesn't have to be this
mannequin stick figure anymore.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.610
It's really exciting.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.736
JASON WU: Speaking with a
bunch of mannequins behind us.

00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:16.134
They're all in
this awkward pose.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.675
MARTHA HUNT: Back
to Jason Wu's line.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.460
Cool.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.902
So what about some other
big changes in the industry?

00:11:23.902 --> 00:11:24.860
JASON WU: I don't know.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.630
I think it's all changing.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.080
Everyone says faster is better.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.520
I don't really believe that.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.580
I believe that on my phone.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.250
I mean, I'm guilty of that.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.650
If my email doesn't come
through for like five seconds,

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.279
I get really upset.

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.820
But I think we're
all guilty of that.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:46.959
And we all are enslaved
to our phones nowadays.

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:48.000
MARTHA HUNT: That's true.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.079
We're all so ADD now.

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:50.120
JASON WU: I know, so ADD.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.286
So I can't really sit still.

00:11:51.286 --> 00:11:53.240
I mean, I never could,
but now I really can't.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.420
MARTHA HUNT: Do you
ever imagine just

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.067
taking a day not
looking at your phone?

00:11:56.067 --> 00:11:56.900
Do you ever do that?

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.030
JASON WU: No, I can't.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.760
Like, it's like [GASP].

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.426
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah,
that would be horrid.

00:12:01.426 --> 00:12:02.900
JASON WU: I can't breathe.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.670
I'm sure everyone
can relate to that.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:08.070
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah, everyone here
probably can relate to that.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.340
JASON WU: Yeah, but, I mean,
so things are going faster.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.680
There's this conversation
about the clothes

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.960
you see on the runway
being available right away,

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.050
things like that.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.370
But one thing I would
say, for me, personally,

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:24.360
from my point of view, is that
I don't think everything has

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.400
to go the speed of lightning.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:34.430
I do think there's going to be a
new focus on things of quality,

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.880
things that last a long time,
and things that don't go out

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.500
of style so quickly.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.710
I never considered
myself a designer

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.860
that designed for the season,
the trend of the season.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.330
Of course, sometimes
we hit trends,

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.370
as we all do, because
we are inspired

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.910
by the world around us.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.596
And so that's how trends emerge.

00:12:54.596 --> 00:12:57.200
We don't all meet
in a room and decide

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.070
if yellow is in this season.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.930
What's going on in
the world very much

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.180
affects what we do as a whole.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.680
MARTHA HUNT: It
happens organically.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.790
JASON WU: Exactly.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.540
But what's become more important
to me now I'm in my 30s

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.180
and I've been doing this a while
is that even though technology

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.349
is bringing us to the next level
in terms of being very fast,

00:13:19.349 --> 00:13:21.640
being aware of everything
that's going on all the time,

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.670
being stimulated all the time,
I do think I appreciate things

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.220
of quality even more now.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.550
I think about when I'm
buying something for home

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:37.720
or buying something to wear, I
do think about buying something

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.470
that I can have for
a long time, not

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.240
something I can just throw
away and buy a new one.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.380
And so I do think there
is going to be a renewed

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.847
focus on that, especially when
it comes to luxury fashion.

00:13:47.847 --> 00:13:49.680
MARTHA HUNT: I've got
more in that direction

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.540
with my own style.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.500
I look at really classic pieces.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.710
I used to waste so much
money on trendy things.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.680
And now I just want pieces that
will stand the test of time

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.024
and that will always look nice.

00:13:59.024 --> 00:14:01.440
JASON WU: And I always think
the world is like a pendulum.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.660
It goes back and forth.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.650
And so if it goes
really fast, it

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.450
can go the other
way just as fast.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.610
MARTHA HUNT: Absolutely.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.540
I have a personal question.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.090
Do you think runway
shows will continue?

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.510
JASON WU: Yeah.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.720
MARTHA HUNT: There's been a lot
of talk like, oh, it's 2016.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.221
There's got to be a new way to
present a fashion collection.

00:14:16.221 --> 00:14:17.761
And I think there
have been attempts.

00:14:17.761 --> 00:14:20.110
But what do you think will
be the best way to showcase

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.235
new collections in fashion?

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.720
JASON WU: I mean, I
think it's different.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.420
For the Jason Wu
collection, I think

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.070
we will go to a more
intimate format.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.160
For a while, a few
years ago, it was

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.320
essential to be a live
feed, essential to react.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.290
And the truth is
the clothes aren't

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.500
really available until
six months later.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.970
So for us, it's
more about curating

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:51.750
a more intimate environment
and cut out all the noise.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.120
For me, it's about that.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.190
MARTHA HUNT: Can
I say, as a model,

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.470
we're always annoyed because
when we're walking the show,

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.790
all we see are phones like this.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.230
And we're like, is
anybody actually

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.230
appreciating the moment?

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.310
JASON WU: No,
everyone sees things

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.180
to through phones nowadays.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.460
MARTHA HUNT: Front row is
just this the whole time.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.870
JASON WU: I know.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:05.320
MARTHA HUNT: I'm
like, are you evening

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:05.830
noticing what I'm wearing?

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.204
JASON WU: That's
actually quite--

00:15:07.204 --> 00:15:08.451
MARTHA HUNT: Or my walk?

00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:09.950
JASON WU: One season,
I walked down.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:10.510
I was like, oh, my god.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.426
People hated the show.

00:15:11.426 --> 00:15:12.420
No one clapped.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.820
Because everyone was on
their phone, no one could.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.530
MARTHA HUNT: No one had the
time to even pay attention.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.520
It was, oh wait,
did I catch that?

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.380
JASON WU: And then
I read reviews.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.495
Oh, I guess people did
like it in the end.

00:15:19.495 --> 00:15:22.310
But you would never know.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.270
So I thought bringing them
back to a smaller, more

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.050
intimate environment
where it feels more

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.130
like the way they do
it in the '50s where

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.410
they have models with cars.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.790
I'm not saying to do that.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.650
But I do think doing
things that are

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.880
a little bit more special and
intimate and curated will have

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.000
new meaning, especially
in the next couple years--

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.840
not just in fashion,
I think in everything.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.339
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah,
I think it's been

00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:46.350
very innovative
and natural the way

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.104
you've presented the
"Grey" collection.

00:15:48.104 --> 00:15:50.520
Because "Grey" for Jason Wu,
you launched that at a dinner

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.224
with friends.

00:15:51.224 --> 00:15:52.640
And I thought that
that was really

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.870
special and unique
that you showed it

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.310
in an intimate setting rather
than blasting it online

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.076
or in a big print campaign.

00:16:00.076 --> 00:16:02.450
JASON WU: I mean, the reason
why I started the collection

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.900
"Grey"-- it's my Sister
and Sister collection--

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.460
I realized a lot of
my friends were--

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.165
they can't afford my clothes.

00:16:13.165 --> 00:16:15.604
It retails for $1,500 a pop.

00:16:15.604 --> 00:16:17.020
MARTHA HUNT: At
least he's honest.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.436
JASON WU: I'm not even sure I
could afford my own clothes,

00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:20.500
if I were a girl.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.380
I mean, that's expensive.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.554
You know?

00:16:25.554 --> 00:16:27.720
MARTHA HUNT: It took me a
lot of years to even think

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.930
about affording your clothes.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.596
JASON WU: Yeah, it's
frickin' expensive.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:34.970
So I thought--

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:35.780
MARTHA HUNT: It's art, though.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.030
I mean--

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.350
JASON WU: No, I mean--

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.640
MARTHA HUNT: It's making art.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.710
JASON WU: I always said,
that's my obsession.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.760
If any of you've been
to the Met recently,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.280
you can see the craftsmanship.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.380
That was a technology-themed
exhibit, but what you see

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.220
was a lot of hand work.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.872
So it really goes hand in hand.

00:16:57.034 --> 00:16:59.200
That's what I do a lot with
the Jason Wu collection.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.755
I explore techniques, things
inspired from au couture

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:05.034
techniques, things
are done by hand.

00:17:05.034 --> 00:17:07.480
It's like creating art.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.625
But for "Grey," I
really wanted to come up

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:11.000
with a collection
that was really

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.869
inspired by my friends,
people around me.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:16.880
Most of my friends
are not in fashion.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.210
I'm still best friends with
my high school friends.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:19.680
MARTHA HUNT: Oh, really?

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.020
JASON WU: Yeah.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:20.650
MARTHA HUNT: Oh, wow.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:21.275
That's awesome.

00:17:21.275 --> 00:17:23.260
JASON WU: And they're
not in fashion at all.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.206
Or like you, or like
Diane, or people

00:17:27.206 --> 00:17:29.760
I'm around with, women that--

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.010
MARTHA HUNT: That we can wear.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.051
JASON WU: --care about
clothes, care about style,

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:35.740
but want something a
little more casual,

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.410
but also want something
that is not disposable,

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.655
but for a reasonable price.

00:17:40.655 --> 00:17:44.390
And I think, women, a lot of my
friends are in their early 30s,

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.230
late 20s.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.580
And that's when you're
really starting to look

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.590
for things to invest in.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:52.657
So that's what I did "Grey" for,
almost everything under $1,000.

00:17:52.657 --> 00:17:54.740
MARTHA HUNT: I love that
they're very comfortable,

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.970
but effortless and chic.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.640
I could travel in
this on the plane

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.098
and still look nice
at the airport,

00:18:00.098 --> 00:18:01.224
but be very comfortable.

00:18:01.224 --> 00:18:02.390
It's always an issue for me.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.460
I'm always traveling
all the time.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.120
And I don't want to look sloppy
while I'm at the airport.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.330
JASON WU: And sometimes I was
actually-- a few years ago,

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.920
I had to do a project
for "Teen Vogue"

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.330
where I had to take a dress and
have to customize it to make

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.872
it look like something else.

00:18:16.872 --> 00:18:19.720
And I just wanted a really,
really simple dress.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.230
But I only had a $30
budget to buy the dress.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.282
That was the whole project,
that you can elevate something.

00:18:25.282 --> 00:18:25.990
MARTHA HUNT: Wow.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.170
JASON WU: So I had a $30 budget.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.530
MARTHA HUNT: Is that what
started "Inspiration" long ago,

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:28.900
or no?

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.399
JASON WU: No, no,
it was just-- it's

00:18:30.399 --> 00:18:31.970
an interesting example, right?

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.960
I was looking for $30 dresses.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.480
But every $30 dress I could
find had tons of stuff on it.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.850
I just really wanted a
white simple something.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:40.610
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah, not
some crazy paisley print.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.790
JASON WU: Those were all
in the $80 to $100 range.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.170
So it's like
sometimes the simpler

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:49.530
things, things that are more
timeless, are harder to find.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.330
And so I was, like,
oh, maybe there

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:57.480
is some sort of a balance
to buy something that's

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.800
affordable, but also has the
appeal of something that's

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.227
more classic.

00:19:02.227 --> 00:19:04.310
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah, I think
that's really important

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.480
for our culture right
now where we are.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.689
When did the development
start for this collection?

00:19:09.689 --> 00:19:11.230
JASON WU: I started
about a year ago.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.250
I mean, I think, when launching
a new brand takes a long time.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.150
We had to talk about
branding, thinking about how

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:21.020
to-- the woven label,
what we're going to,

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.120
what is the name
of the collection.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.410
We have to go through,
who's the girl,

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.880
make tons of inspiration
boards, go back and forth,

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.060
lots of fittings,
fittings all the time.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.010
And, yeah, it's
definitely a labor a love.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.260
MARTHA HUNT: How did you
come up with the name "Grey"?

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.010
JASON WU: Well, grey
is my favorite color.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.250
I think, my whole
entire apartment's grey.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.412
So my cats are grey,
my curtains grey.

00:19:49.412 --> 00:19:50.620
MARTHA HUNT: Your cat's grey.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.786
JASON WU: Everything's grey.

00:19:51.786 --> 00:19:54.170
Everything matches.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.780
The point was to
get furniture that

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.612
matched the cat so you don't
see the cat hair everywhere.

00:19:59.612 --> 00:20:00.800
That was actually how--

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.216
MARTHA HUNT: Is there a bigger
meaning with all this grey?

00:20:03.216 --> 00:20:04.425
Like it's not black or white?

00:20:04.425 --> 00:20:06.091
JASON WU: Yeah, I
mean, I do think that.

00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:06.620
I think--

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.410
MARTHA HUNT: More subtle?

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.590
JASON WU: Yeah, I mean,
I do think especially now

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.246
we're living in a world of
this grey zone right now.

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:15.870
And I don't think
it's black and white.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.730
And I think it's good.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.460
For you, when
you're modeling, it

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.859
used to be commercial
board and runway board.

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:24.150
But now, there's no such thing.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.316
Everyone's doing everything.

00:20:25.316 --> 00:20:26.860
And it's better.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.860
So I do think we're
living in that world

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:37.120
right now where those kind of
labels don't exist as much.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.580
When I was starting
out, also it was

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.460
very clear things are
for runway and things

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.184
are for commercial purposes.

00:20:44.184 --> 00:20:45.850
Well, it's not really
like that anymore.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.460
I think, especially
for me, it was never

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.360
about creating clothes that
looked impossible to wear

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.600
and then doing something really
dumbed down for the customers.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.180
I think the customers
very much want

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.220
to see what's on the runway.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.030
But she also wants to imagine
herself in the clothes.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:09.260
So she doesn't really want
to carry wheels on the back.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.415
She doesn't really want
to look like a clown.

00:21:13.415 --> 00:21:15.040
MARTHA HUNT: So have
you always treated

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.650
the street as your runway?

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.130
JASON WU: Well, I like reality.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.110
I mean, call me
boring, but I always

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.330
thought it was really
nice to be able to see

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.410
people wear my clothes.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.710
That's always been the most
interesting thing to me.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.260
I remember when I-- about
eight years ago, when I first

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.950
got into Bergdorf Goodman,
I was walking around

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.640
on the Upper East Side.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:42.290
And I saw a girl walk down
the street in a full look.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.170
MARTHA HUNT: Wow, a
full Jason Wu look?

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.560
JASON WU: A full Jason Wu look.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.320
And it was the first time
I'd ever seen somebody wear--

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.110
MARTHA HUNT: And by
full look, that means?

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.680
JASON WU: The top--

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.260
MARTHA HUNT: The top.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.300
JASON WU: --and the skirt and
everything that goes with it.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:52.560
MARTHA HUNT: All Jason Wu.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.851
JASON WU: I was very impressed.

00:21:53.851 --> 00:21:57.450
And she was like this
pretty young thing.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.830
She was just walking down.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:59.890
And I was like, [GASP].

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:00.950
And I just stopped her.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.158
I was like, you look amazing.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.210
And she thought I was so freaky.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:10.590
MARTHA HUNT: You should
be like, I made that.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.400
JASON WU: I know,
but I was young.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.692
It was like I didn't know
what to do, but, ahh.

00:22:14.692 --> 00:22:15.400
MARTHA HUNT: Wow.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.590
That must have been a
surreal moment for you.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.100
JASON WU: Yeah, it was great.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:18.483
MARTHA HUNT: I always
thought that would

00:22:18.483 --> 00:22:21.360
be the fun part for designers,
to actually see people wearing

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.526
their clothes on the street.

00:22:22.526 --> 00:22:25.040
JASON WU: Well, she spent
money that she could spend

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.210
on somebody else on my work.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.400
And she chose to wear it.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.400
It makes her feel great.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.677
And that is the biggest
compliment I could get.

00:22:31.677 --> 00:22:33.260
MARTHA HUNT: It's
what it's all about.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.030
JASON WU: And I think
that's very important.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.030
MARTHA HUNT: It's good
that you appreciate that.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.164
JASON WU: Yeah.

00:22:38.164 --> 00:22:41.450
MARTHA HUNT: So you've been
using the hashtag #greylavie.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.680
What does that mean to you?

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.480
JASON WU: Well, it's because the
collection's about what I like,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.160
my friends.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.970
And I like to entertain.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:53.894
I prefer to be home with
five, six people than go out

00:22:53.894 --> 00:22:54.560
to a restaurant.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.524
MARTHA HUNT: You prefer to be
home rather than going out?

00:22:56.524 --> 00:22:56.928
JASON WU: Yeah.

00:22:56.928 --> 00:22:57.594
MARTHA HUNT: OK.

00:22:57.594 --> 00:22:59.190
JASON WU: I love
hosting at home.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.700
Tonight, I'm doing
a barbecue just

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.220
for people that
work at my company.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.260
And I think those
things are really fun.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.310
And, again, I think in this
crazy fast-paced world where

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:14.690
everything goes in warp speed
and things are becoming more

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:15.680
and more impersonal--

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.680
MARTHA HUNT: Absolutely.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.530
JASON WU: --I think I'm
starting-- I appreciate

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.110
the times where I can
get to know people,

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.950
I can get to talk to people.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:28.130
I mean, how many times have we
been together to big dinners

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:34.070
in those crazy ballrooms in
hotel rooms or those fancy

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.620
dinners where the meat is
stale, the fish is over-cooked--

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.120
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah, it's true.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.512
JASON WU: --and everyone leaves
before dessert is even served?

00:23:43.512 --> 00:23:44.720
MARTHA HUNT: It's so true.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.600
JASON WU: And it's like,
what's the point of all that?

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.563
MARTHA HUNT: Like everyone's
going there just for press,

00:23:47.563 --> 00:23:47.870
show face.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.578
JASON WU: Yeah, and
it just like I prefer

00:23:49.578 --> 00:23:51.070
to have dinner with six people.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.540
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah, I've
always loved that about you.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.584
It's always been about
forming a real connection.

00:23:54.584 --> 00:23:56.250
And that's hard to
find in the industry.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:57.610
It's also hard to find loyalty.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.989
So it's so great that
you've been so loyal to me.

00:23:59.989 --> 00:24:02.030
JASON WU: You know what
I'm going to be loyal at?

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.967
This cafeteria in this building.

00:24:03.967 --> 00:24:04.800
MARTHA HUNT: I know.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.227
JASON WU: That's amazing.

00:24:06.227 --> 00:24:06.810
I was hoping--

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:07.640
MARTHA HUNT: It
smelled like Pizza Hut

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.020
when I walked on this floor.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:08.728
JASON WU: I know.

00:24:08.728 --> 00:24:10.710
So I heard there's
also a sushi place.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.857
And isn't there a Thai-type
place also, like with pizza?

00:24:13.857 --> 00:24:15.190
MARTHA HUNT: No Chinese, though.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.481
JASON WU: So we're going to
go around afterwards and go

00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:19.900
to all the cafeteria.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.807
MARTHA HUNT: I'm so
hungry right now.

00:24:21.807 --> 00:24:22.682
JASON WU: So jealous.

00:24:25.215 --> 00:24:26.840
MARTHA HUNT: So I
think it's about time

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.210
that we take some questions
from the audience.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.030
Is that right?

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:31.760
JASON WU: Any questions?

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.093
MARTHA HUNT: Questions, anybody?

00:24:35.105 --> 00:24:35.980
AUDIENCE: Hey, Jason.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.663
JASON WU: Hi.

00:24:36.663 --> 00:24:37.490
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:38.280
My name is Vivian.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.955
I'm an MBA intern
here this summer.

00:24:39.955 --> 00:24:40.940
JASON WU: Hi.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.290
AUDIENCE: I was kind of curious.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.150
So over the last
two years, there's

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.660
been a greater emergence
of Asian-American voices,

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.010
especially in media
and entertainment,

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.240
which is not really the case
for when I was growing up.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.670
Given that fashion has been such
a great enabler in promoting

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.860
social change and innovation
and new ideas out there,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.350
what do you think your
role is in enabling

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.640
more Asian-American, but
also under-represented voices

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.960
out there in the media?

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.350
JASON WU: I mean,
the truth is-- and we

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.920
didn't talk a lot about
that, but I moved to Canada

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.030
when I was nine.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.039
And not because I wanted
to because I didn't

00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:18.080
want to leave my friends.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.540
I grew up in Taiwan.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.510
And I always liked
to play with dolls.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.520
And my brother was
very macho, played

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.780
with Nintendo and trucks.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.440
I played with Barbies.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.869
That's what I preferred.

00:25:30.869 --> 00:25:32.910
MARTHA HUNT: I can't see
you with building blocks

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:33.540
and a truck.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.850
JASON WU: No, I preferred
like braid hair.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.650
That was more fun.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:44.060
And it's funny to talk
about it nowadays.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.080
But in the '80s in Taiwan, it
was really not very acceptable.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.509
People thought it
was very, very weird.

00:25:49.509 --> 00:25:52.050
And people thought it was really
quite socially unacceptable.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.650
And I got made fun of a lot.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.290
And even people in
my own family, people

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.930
thought it was
really inappropriate.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.710
My parents were
really cool about it.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.540
They just bought me whatever
I wanted to play with.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.040
MARTHA HUNT: Wow,
that's impressive.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.380
JASON WU: So the reason my
mom decided to send myself

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.260
and my brother to
Canada was that it

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.850
would give us a much more
open-minded environment

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:15.930
to grow.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:22.650
And growing up in Asia-- I mean,
you mentioned Asian-American--

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:24.810
I think in the
'80s, early '90s, we

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:26.660
were all expected
to go into business,

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.400
some sort of a business role.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.390
And creativity wasn't really
appreciated or embraced.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:36.060
So through amazing
parents and amazing people

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.990
I met throughout
my life, I've been

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.514
able to succeed doing
exactly what I wanted to do.

00:26:41.514 --> 00:26:42.222
MARTHA HUNT: Wow.

00:26:42.222 --> 00:26:43.635
Amazing.

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:46.404
JASON WU: So what
I do now, I think

00:26:46.404 --> 00:26:47.820
the world is much
different place.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.217
Taiwan is a very
different place.

00:26:49.217 --> 00:26:50.300
Asia is a different place.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:56.500
But I do a mentorship program
with a Taiwanese fashion

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.495
college.

00:26:57.495 --> 00:27:01.360
So I host six kids a season
where they come here.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.730
They get to work with me
for the entire season.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.084
And they have a great resume.

00:27:05.084 --> 00:27:06.250
And they get to learn a lot.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:12.650
And I can help
change the perception

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:16.817
that creative industries
aren't to be taken seriously.

00:27:16.817 --> 00:27:17.900
MARTHA HUNT: All changing.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.810
JASON WU: But, again, the
world is a much better place

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:20.309
right now.

00:27:20.309 --> 00:27:21.560
It's a much different place.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.740
And I think I'm happy
things have changed.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.550
MARTHA HUNT: Absolutely.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.561
See, it all starts
with the parents.

00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:29.810
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.210
Thank you for being here today.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:32.079
JASON WU: Thank you.

00:27:32.079 --> 00:27:34.370
AUDIENCE: 10 years ago doesn't
seem like that long ago.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.200
And I'm just curious when
you were first starting out,

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.510
who was influential
in your career?

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.670
And what advice did they give
you that really stuck with you?

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:45.000
JASON WU: I think my mom
was really very, very, very

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.860
influential to me.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.500
I remember when we
were younger, I always

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.025
thought I knew everything.

00:27:54.025 --> 00:27:57.070
Then she'd smack
me across the head.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.035
She was like, you know nothing.

00:27:59.035 --> 00:28:00.646
You know nothing.

00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:02.160
And, true.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.350
And that's the best advice
I've been ever given,

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.980
is like, OK, actually,
you always go

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.490
to an environment,
a new situation,

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:11.944
thinking that you know nothing.

00:28:11.944 --> 00:28:13.360
Because the kind
of things you can

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.410
learn if you just get rid of
that mental block is amazing.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:21.050
I learn from the kids that
work for me, the interns.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:25.060
I learn from my
friends, like you,

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:29.940
what you do on a daily basis,
what's important to you.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.630
You have a foundation, that
you work with the foundation.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.700
And so just learning different
things is really good.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.620
And to not-- don't
be an asshole.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.870
MARTHA HUNT: Be a good person.

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.640
JASON WU: Don't think
you know it all.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.230
No, no, like--

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.310
MARTHA HUNT: And don't
always believe social media

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.090
because everything--

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.610
JASON WU: No, just--

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:48.870
MARTHA HUNT: --is deceivingly
perfect all the time.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.828
JASON WU: --be a little
bit more down to earth.

00:28:50.828 --> 00:28:53.039
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah, be grounded.

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:53.580
JASON WU: Hi.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:54.413
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jason.

00:28:54.413 --> 00:28:55.040
I'm Desmonique.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.100
I work on one of the
advertising sales teams here.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.890
Some of the clients I work
with are in the retail space.

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:02.780
And as you know,
retail is seeing

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.960
a decline in foot traffic.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.400
And there's a lot of talk about
rethinking the retail space

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.990
for different kinds of
shopping environments

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.010
to bring people in.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.060
I'm curious, since
you've probably

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.970
shopped around the
world, have you

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:21.510
been in a place recently that
has been indicative of how you

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.740
think the shopping experience
should be redefined for today's

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.470
consumer in fashion?

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.330
And what are your thoughts about
how you would like your clothes

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.700
experienced at point of sale?

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.630
JASON WU: Well, I think it's
very interesting because this

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:39.840
is where me-- I shop online.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.570
I shop online.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.030
AUDIENCE: We'll tell them that.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.530
JASON WU: No, I
love to shop online.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.010
It's easy.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:47.160
It's easy.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.160
It's convenient.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.890
But I love going
to stores, but now

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:52.220
for a whole different reason.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.850
I'm not going to go to a
store to buy something just

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:57.970
to buy something.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:01.479
When I go into a retail space,
I want to have an experience.

00:30:01.479 --> 00:30:03.020
And I think what
you're going to see,

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.660
like what I said about clothing,
is that the retail experience

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.890
has to be special.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.000
The customer experience
has to be special.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.360
And I would say some of the
best stores I've ever been to,

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.480
when you go in, you don't
feel like you're in a store.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.310
You're going into the
home or living room.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:23.230
And I think that's
going to be very, very

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.950
important because you're
getting out of your house.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.190
When you want to
go somewhere, you

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:30.940
want to make sure that
it's an experience.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.330
You want to make sure it's
enjoyable and special.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:38.215
And I think that's what you
can't get on the internet.

00:30:38.215 --> 00:30:39.173
That can't be replaced.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.300
I'm opening my first shop
within the Saks Fifth Avenue

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.130
this August.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:47.970
MARTHA HUNT: Oh,
congratulations.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:48.803
JASON WU: Thank you.

00:30:48.803 --> 00:30:52.290
And when people
buy a dress, it's

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.330
personalized, engraved their
name in it, things like that,

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.070
little gestures like that,
that make it very special.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.850
Like when I do dinners, I
always have place settings

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:04.950
with calligraphy name of every
guest or something like that.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:08.480
Those little gestures just make
things so much more personal.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.000
Because we don't need to go
anywhere if we don't want to.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.280
MARTHA HUNT: No, we're all busy.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.650
Everyone here is busy.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:18.040
JASON WU: Yeah, I mean,
between all my apps,

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.330
I can get whatever I want in the
city whenever I want at home.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:21.831
You can.

00:31:21.831 --> 00:31:22.913
MARTHA HUNT: It's so true.

00:31:22.913 --> 00:31:25.360
JASON WU: I could order ice
cream one day from Postmates,

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.350
because [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.030
MARTHA HUNT:
Postmates is my life.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.154
JASON WU: Yeah, it's great.

00:31:28.154 --> 00:31:31.490
And so you don't
need to do anything.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:35.010
So I think retailers have to
think about things differently.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.510
MARTHA HUNT: Also,
going to a store,

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.880
you can go with
friends and family.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.840
And that makes it
more of an experience.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.400
JASON WU: It has to
be an experience.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.608
MARTHA HUNT: You want to
shop with friends, something

00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:42.840
you don't really do online.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.256
JASON WU: And it
has nothing to do

00:31:44.256 --> 00:31:46.830
with price point or any
specific type of things.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.960
But I think when you
go into a store where

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.240
it feels warm,
cozy, and welcoming,

00:31:51.240 --> 00:32:00.390
and interesting and curated
versus this idea of supermarket

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.950
idea, it's different.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.597
MARTHA HUNT: Absolutely.

00:32:04.597 --> 00:32:05.430
Any other questions?

00:32:11.489 --> 00:32:12.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:12.423
JASON WU: Hi.

00:32:12.423 --> 00:32:13.506
AUDIENCE: I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:13.506 --> 00:32:14.882
I'm an engineering intern.

00:32:14.882 --> 00:32:17.090
I had a question-- you
touched upon it a little bit--

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:23.260
but how fashion is moving
towards more of for all women

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.740
and not just size zero.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.420
And just it seems like from
an outside perspective,

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:33.330
it's still not really for
a woman of every size,

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.470
a woman of every color.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.690
I mean, these
mannequins don't really

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.840
have attainable proportions.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.170
And so can you talk
more about just

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:48.170
how some tangible things where
fashion is moving towards being

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.310
inclusive of everyone?

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.219
JASON WU: Well, I think, yeah,
I mean, yes, these girls are not

00:32:53.219 --> 00:32:54.260
the best representations.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.890
I agree.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.680
They were just what's
available for today.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.890
But no, I think it's
interesting, right?

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:06.670
I think standards of beauty
have changed significantly.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.420
And I think we are
seeing a shift of that,

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.010
not everyone looks the same.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.610
And as I said,
people are embracing

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:15.000
women of different
personalities,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.290
different ethnic backgrounds,
and different sizes.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.090
I think that's very important.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:29.800
Whereas I think before, it
was a very closely guarded--

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.720
I wouldn't even
just say fashion is,

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.890
I would say everything was a
closely guarded-- thing where

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:38.750
things are selected for
you by a small group

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.750
of influential people.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.970
But now with social
media, you get

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:47.960
people that are more unlikely
able to be in the public eye

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.510
that are in the public eye.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:50.300
I don't know if that
makes any sense?

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.966
MARTHA HUNT: So you're
having to broaden

00:33:51.966 --> 00:33:54.325
your sizes for all types.

00:33:54.325 --> 00:33:56.460
JASON WU: So you see
a very wide range

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.130
of different girls
in fashion magazines

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.630
now whereas you wouldn't have
before because these girls are

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.270
powerful and people relate
to them on their own.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:08.530
So the magazines don't
have to feature them now.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:13.250
They're not selected in a room
by a group of people anymore.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.555
In fact, people are
selecting for the magazines.

00:34:15.555 --> 00:34:17.055
And I think that's
a big difference.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:22.999
I think it's the one thing
that's changing everything.

00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:24.540
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah,
and there's plenty

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.239
of empowered, curvy
women out there

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:28.139
that are helping shape fashion.

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:31.337
Also, the runways always, to
me, seemed like a fantasy.

00:34:31.337 --> 00:34:32.920
And what you see in
fashion campaigns,

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.530
it's more like it's artistic.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:35.280
It's a fantasy.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.730
It's not necessarily
something you

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.730
aspire to as your body type.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:42.317
You have to embrace
where you have.

00:34:42.317 --> 00:34:43.150
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:43.983
JASON WU: Thank you.

00:34:48.022 --> 00:34:48.855
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jason.

00:34:48.855 --> 00:34:49.110
JASON WU: Hi.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.739
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming today.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:50.940
JASON WU: Sure.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.219
AUDIENCE: And Martha, too.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:55.630
I love your collaboration
with Melissa's Shoes.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.812
I'm actually wearing
one pair today.

00:34:57.812 --> 00:34:58.770
JASON WU: I love those.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.160
AUDIENCE: I have three pairs.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:00.820
I love them.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:04.710
And I really was excited when
I discovered these shoes,

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.250
actually, when I
was in Australia.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:07.700
I love what Melissa does.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.050
And all her shoes
are recyclable.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:15.880
And I was wondering if you could
talk a bit about your views

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.990
and your thoughts on
sustainability in fashion

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:21.507
and collaborating with
a group like Melissa.

00:35:21.507 --> 00:35:23.340
JASON WU: Well, I think
it's a fine balance.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.670
I think it's really not
black and white, right?

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.750
I use a lot of natural
materials, a lot of wools.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:32.020
I was actually just
in Sydney last week

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.370
where I went to the wool farms.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.750
I got to shear a sheep.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:40.232
It was much more fun
in my imagination.

00:35:40.232 --> 00:35:41.190
I was like, oh, my god.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.620
They move.

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:42.703
And they're really strong.

00:35:42.703 --> 00:35:43.900
And they're aggressive.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.480
MARTHA HUNT: I don't
even see you on a farm.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.150
JASON WU: I don't either.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:48.191
MARTHA HUNT: How did you
survive on a sheep farm?

00:35:48.191 --> 00:35:51.775
JASON WU: First of all,
never go with shoes you like.

00:35:51.775 --> 00:35:52.650
Destroyed afterwards.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.067
AUDIENCE: Did your dad give
you some tips before you went?

00:35:55.067 --> 00:35:56.149
MARTHA HUNT: There you go.

00:35:56.149 --> 00:35:57.650
JASON WU: No, I
mean, I was going,

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.790
and I was going to
visit the wool farms.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.510
I was doing a project
with Woolmark.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:03.850
And so we went to see it.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:08.610
So you can see that
there's something that's

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.220
so beautiful about
natural materials

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.820
that I don't think
can ever be replaced.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:18.620
And so I think there is
very ethical ways to source

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:19.740
these materials.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.910
I think that's very important,
to always know your sources,

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:27.580
whether you are on the vegan
side or not on the vegan side,

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:32.760
there are proper channels
to source all materials.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.520
And same thing with synthetics.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.100
It's about making things
that are like the Melissa

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.870
shoes, that can last a long
time, that are produced

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:47.090
in factories that are very,
very well equipped to deal

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:50.686
with plastics and very ethical.

00:36:50.686 --> 00:36:51.810
MARTHA HUNT: Ethical, yeah.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.640
JASON WU: Meanwhile,
there's a lot of things

00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:00.425
out there that just because
it's vegan, just because it's

00:37:00.425 --> 00:37:02.050
sustainable, doesn't
mean it's actually

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:05.090
good for the
environment, either.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.590
I don't know if I'm answering
it correctly, but I think--

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:07.870
AUDIENCE: No, that makes sense.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.120
JASON WU: It's all contextual.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.130
I think we always
have to be very

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:15.240
aware of where our sources are
and what their effects are,

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.397
and to make sure that you're
using the best version of that.

00:37:18.397 --> 00:37:19.230
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:19.906
JASON WU: Thank you.

00:37:19.906 --> 00:37:20.900
Did I answer that right?

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:21.608
MARTHA HUNT: Yes.

00:37:21.608 --> 00:37:22.248
JASON WU: OK.

00:37:22.248 --> 00:37:23.748
AUDIENCE: That's
the correct answer.

00:37:23.748 --> 00:37:24.706
JASON WU: I don't know.

00:37:24.706 --> 00:37:25.371
I don't know.

00:37:25.371 --> 00:37:26.662
MARTHA HUNT: It's all relative.

00:37:26.662 --> 00:37:29.427
AUDIENCE: Your perspective.

00:37:29.427 --> 00:37:30.260
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jason.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.100
Thank you for coming.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:31.570
JASON WU: Thanks.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.640
AUDIENCE: Likewise, I wanted
to wear something today that's

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.140
made by you.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.550
But I have one thing.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.616
It's a leather dress.

00:37:36.616 --> 00:37:38.240
And I figure, you
know, for a Thursday,

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.146
it might be a little
bit of an overkill here.

00:37:41.146 --> 00:37:42.010
JASON WU: That's OK.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.444
MARTHA HUNT: Never, ever.

00:37:43.444 --> 00:37:44.625
AUDIENCE: Well, you know.

00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:46.083
JASON WU: Look, I
dressed up today.

00:37:46.083 --> 00:37:46.426
I'm kidding.

00:37:46.426 --> 00:37:48.259
AUDIENCE: Well, that's
actually my question.

00:37:48.259 --> 00:37:50.300
You talked about your
interviewer's dress,

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.580
hair, makeup even, how
you selected everything.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.640
Can you talk about your
style, what you do?

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.067
JASON WU: My style is this.

00:37:56.067 --> 00:37:56.900
AUDIENCE: Well, why?

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:57.649
How do you select?

00:37:57.649 --> 00:38:01.440
JASON WU: It's black, navy,
grey-- three colors, no hair--

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.730
because I really
don't have time.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:04.480
This is my job.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.230
My job is to make other
people look great.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.200
I'm a much better
behind-the-scene person

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.620
than in front.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.170
And so I really have a uniform.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.740
And I'm very uninteresting
in terms of my style.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:21.030
White sneakers, black sneakers,
black T-shirt, navy T-shirt--

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.590
or maybe its a grey one.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.439
Those are very big decisions
I have to make every day.

00:38:27.439 --> 00:38:29.230
MARTHA HUNT: Always a
T-shirt, that's true.

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:30.180
JASON WU: Or a
sweater in the winter.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.401
MARTHA HUNT: But I find
this is very common--

00:38:32.401 --> 00:38:33.520
JASON WU: I do that.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.890
MARTHA HUNT: --in the industry.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:37.990
Oftentimes you see
stylists dress down--

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:40.630
sneakers, T-shirts, jeans.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.150
And I think it's
because they treat

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.882
their work like their art.

00:38:43.882 --> 00:38:46.090
And that's what they're
passionate about, but at home

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.048
they don't really care.

00:38:47.048 --> 00:38:49.489
JASON WU: I just care about
making her look great.

00:38:49.489 --> 00:38:50.405
MARTHA HUNT: Lucky me.

00:38:50.405 --> 00:38:52.510
JASON WU: I don't
really care how I look.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.850
I just want to be presentable.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:57.812
But I keep it really simple.

00:38:57.812 --> 00:38:59.288
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah,
simple's good.

00:38:59.288 --> 00:39:00.764
JASON WU: It's not about me.

00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:06.000
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Emily.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.730
I actually have a question
more specified towards Martha.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:14.880
With your social media, you
have a couple million followers,

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.570
which is extremely impressive.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:21.990
But I've always wondered what
that decision-making process is

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:27.280
like in terms of what
you post professionally

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.750
and exposing yourself
to so many followers,

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.612
and what you keep
private for yourself.

00:39:32.612 --> 00:39:34.320
MARTHA HUNT: It's an
interesting question

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.150
because sometimes I do wonder,
should this be private?

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:41.350
But I do notice that the
viewers want to see as much

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:42.750
of your personality as possible.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.830
So I do try to share certain
private moments because that

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.310
is relatable and that is me.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:50.480
Like I try to share my dog or my
boyfriend once in a while or me

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.290
cooking because that's
really who I am.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.360
And it looks like I'm made up in
all these fabulous destinations

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.250
all the time, but
people should take it

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.240
all with a grain of salt
because it is curated.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.320
And Instagram is
like the final image.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.566
That's how you want to
present yourself to the world.

00:40:03.566 --> 00:40:04.940
But you don't see
a lot of what's

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.148
really going on all the time.

00:40:06.148 --> 00:40:08.650
And I'm not going to
bash a job if it's not

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.300
going well on Instagram.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.120
So you're just going to
see me looking great.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.810
But I do think it is a little
bit deceiving that things

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.730
look so great all the time.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:21.270
I mean, I'm very appreciative
of my life and all that.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:23.394
But there's this
thing in culture

00:40:23.394 --> 00:40:25.060
now where I feel like
everyone's feeling

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.670
this fear of missing out.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:31.230
And I just want to remind
people that it's all a fantasy.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:35.927
JASON WU: Models eat, too.

00:40:35.927 --> 00:40:37.260
We're going to have pizza later.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.160
MARTHA HUNT: Yes, and
I also try to show

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.910
that I work out a lot
because I think it's

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:41.460
important to motivate people.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.930
That helps people get
inspired to get to the gym.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:47.330
And it takes a lot of work
to maintain my figure.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:49.890
I'm not trying to act like,
oh, I eat whatever I want.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.480
And I'm tall and
thin and all that.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.520
I definitely work
out and work for it.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.936
AUDIENCE: I think
that's been more

00:40:54.936 --> 00:40:57.060
of a trend, though,
of people-- a lot

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:01.360
of models being more
open about that and about

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.090
how much work it takes
to eat healthfully

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:06.920
to-- especially while
traveling and your lifestyle

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.800
is so demanding.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.981
And that's hard
for someone going

00:41:10.981 --> 00:41:12.480
to work at the same
job every single

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.880
day and workplace let alone
traveling all over the world

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.950
and not having any of
your comforts around.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.040
MARTHA HUNT:
Understandably, yeah.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.498
AUDIENCE: So it's nice that
there's so much exposure there.

00:41:20.498 --> 00:41:22.975
JASON WU: I mean, you and Karlie
inspire me to go work out.

00:41:22.975 --> 00:41:24.100
MARTHA HUNT: Oh, thank you.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.099
JASON WU: You guys are
always going to work out.

00:41:26.099 --> 00:41:28.016
I finally got my ass out
to the gym this year.

00:41:28.016 --> 00:41:29.098
MARTHA HUNT: Always, yeah.

00:41:29.098 --> 00:41:30.320
JASON WU: Everything's wrong.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.180
MARTHA HUNT: But there's also
a tremendous amount of pressure

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:32.926
to post.

00:41:32.926 --> 00:41:34.300
Sometimes I feel
like, oh, I feel

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.470
like I'm so annoying putting
all this content out there.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:40.050
But we're also getting
pressure from our agencies.

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:40.930
We need more content.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:42.820
Show your personality,
because it's

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.310
designers like Jason
who are casting

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:47.394
girls that have a following.

00:41:47.394 --> 00:41:49.810
It's become such a key role
in our industry for the model.

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:51.018
JASON WU: Yeah, so important.

00:41:51.018 --> 00:41:53.407
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah,
it's so important.

00:41:53.407 --> 00:41:54.240
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.244
MARTHA HUNT: Thank you.

00:41:55.244 --> 00:41:55.785
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:55.785 --> 00:41:58.770
I have a question about
dressing celebrities.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:01.360
You talked a little bit about
seeing the person walking down

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.776
the street on the
Upper East Side.

00:42:02.776 --> 00:42:04.040
And that gave you joy.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.640
But then how do
you reconcile when

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.690
we talk about awards seasons and
all these different big events,

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:12.780
and you have very high profile
people wearing your clothes.

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.010
What does that feel like?

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:15.590
Is that the same level?

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.240
Is that the same level of joy?

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.460
Or is that not as
important to you anymore?

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.650
Because I think you've dressed
First Ladies and all of that.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:25.600
Is there an aspirational
piece, like I

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.120
want to dress this
person, but it's also

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.480
interesting to see normal
people wearing my clothes?

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:30.540
How does that feel?

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.220
JASON WU: I think it's both.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.090
I mean, I think it's different.

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:34.232
I love seeing people wear
my clothes in general.

00:42:34.232 --> 00:42:35.815
It's two very different
things, right?

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.790
I love seeing-- I go
to stores all the time.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.460
I interact with my customers.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.530
I dress them.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:46.580
And I suggest.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.702
I'm very blunt.

00:42:47.702 --> 00:42:50.160
So if something doesn't look
good on her, I would just say,

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.970
don't buy it.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:56.350
I'm very-- I love that
process of working with people

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:59.360
and making them feel
great and look amazing.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.320
And seeing my work on them
makes me feel very good.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.680
Award season is different.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:11.340
For me, from I would say a
small brand point of view,

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:16.130
a lot of what red carpet has
become is product placement.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:19.290
And a lot of actors
are endorsing brands.

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:24.060
And for me, for my own
brand, almost, I would say,

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.010
all the actresses
and people I dress

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.090
are people I have a
relationship with.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:31.610
So to me, it becomes about
me helping them accomplish

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.100
something at a moment
that's important to them,

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.580
me making them look the best.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.120
MARTHA HUNT: Very exciting.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.530
JASON WU: And so it's a little
bit more personal for me.

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:42.120
And it makes me feel very
proud if a friend of mine

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.730
wins something and
she's wearing my design.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:48.930
I feel like part of the success.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:54.920
So my goal has always been
more a personal one, I guess.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.810
So, yeah, I still get a rush
seeing something very public

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:04.440
happen, something I'm very
proud of my friend for doing,

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.255
and that I can be a part of that
through making her look great.

00:44:08.255 --> 00:44:10.380
MARTHA HUNT: Could you
share an example of a friend

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.088
that you were really
excited that you got

00:44:12.088 --> 00:44:13.810
to dress in an exciting moment?

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:16.394
JASON WU: I mean,
Kerry Washington,

00:44:16.394 --> 00:44:18.310
she's been my friend for
like-- she's actually

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:20.650
one of the first
actresses to ever wear me.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.970
So I met her about
nine years ago.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:28.560
MARTHA HUNT: She's stunning.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.100
JASON WU: A couple years ago,
she was going to the Oscars.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.870
And she's pregnant
with her first baby.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:39.290
It was really her moment.

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:42.100
She was presenting,
and people were just

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.390
throwing everything at her.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.065
And this is very rare.

00:44:46.065 --> 00:44:48.690
Three months before the Oscars,
she asked me to make her dress.

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.090
And she never changed her mind.

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.370
That sounds maybe not
like so much right

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:58.310
now, but, honestly, actresses
get so much given to them,

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:02.010
that they can change
their mind at any moment

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:03.680
in the last minute.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.210
And she did that.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.145
And it was really a
very special moment.

00:45:09.145 --> 00:45:11.020
AUDIENCE: What about
dressing the First Lady?

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.341
How's that like?

00:45:12.341 --> 00:45:13.090
JASON WU: Amazing.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:18.500
I mean, to be able to-- for me,
as an Asian-American Canadian

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:25.160
person, to be an immigrant,
to be the first Asian person

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:29.210
to dress the first
African-American First Lady is

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:30.760
super significant to me.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.450
I never imagined that
that's something I

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:34.760
would be able to be a part of.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.070
I wanted it to be in "Vogue."

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:40.827
But after that
experience, I started

00:45:40.827 --> 00:45:42.410
thinking so much
bigger, like thinking

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:45.634
about how there's so much--

00:45:45.634 --> 00:45:47.550
MARTHA HUNT: How many
more boxes can you tick?

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:51.634
JASON WU: I mean, though,
it just humbled me a lot.

00:45:51.634 --> 00:45:52.300
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.040
Hey.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.290
Thanks so much for being here.

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:55.110
This is great.

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:56.380
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:59.200
I had a question
around the price point.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.700
You mentioned earlier
that even sometimes you

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.460
think you can't afford
your own clothes, right?

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:07.770
And I understand completely that
good quality, craftsmanship,

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:11.040
and materials, and design,
et cetera, in any field--

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.810
whether that's clothing or
food or anything-- costs a lot

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:14.450
of money.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.350
Have you ever
thought about trying

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:19.200
to adapt your
lines in the future

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.805
to be more accessible from
a price point perspective?

00:46:21.805 --> 00:46:23.430
JASON WU: Well, I
just launched "Grey,"

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:25.596
which is the collection
that is much more accessible

00:46:25.596 --> 00:46:32.110
and a price point between $150
to $800 for an outerwear piece,

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:33.400
for example.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.080
So that's definitely a
different price range for me.

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.440
But it's still
pricey, but I think

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.570
it's also made with
an understanding

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:49.287
that it's clothes you
can keep for a long time.

00:46:49.287 --> 00:46:50.120
It's not throw-away.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.060
MARTHA HUNT: Yeah,
they're classic pieces.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.690
They're classic
investment pieces.

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:55.773
JASON WU: They give you
fashion, but there's still

00:46:55.773 --> 00:46:57.660
a timelessness.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.890
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious on that.

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:01.846
What needs to be
changed to actually

00:47:01.846 --> 00:47:02.970
bring the price point down?

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:04.730
What are the elements
that actually--

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:06.740
JASON WU: Well, lot
of different things.

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:10.030
I think, look, it's also just
very different kind of clothes

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.600
for me.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.130
Now, look, if you
see these pieces,

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:13.213
these are from collection.

00:47:13.213 --> 00:47:14.560
These are from "Grey."

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.790
These are much more day.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:19.410
They're much easier to
wear, casual shapes.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:23.260
Here, this is very expensive
because it's a down jacket made

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.720
with this feather ball fabric.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:31.780
And it's hand-embroidered over
1,000 hours, little feathers

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.450
encrusted on with beads.

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:36.290
If you look at the craftsmanship
of that, that's the difference.

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:37.873
I'm not going to be
able to bring that

00:47:37.873 --> 00:47:40.960
for a different price point.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.300
But that's my obsession, the
art of creating something

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:50.855
so painstakingly made that it's
just sometimes beyond reason.

00:47:50.855 --> 00:47:52.446
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:47:52.446 --> 00:47:53.320
AUDIENCE: Hey, Jason.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:58.390
My question is actually very
related to the last one.

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:01.790
So there's a certain warmth
to handmade clothing,

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:04.170
whereas a lot of
times technology

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:06.600
gets the stigma of
being very cold.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.210
What techniques did you
use in your collection

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:12.870
to make the clothes still
very special and warm?

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:18.800
JASON WU: I mean, everything
I make is made by hand.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.750
I'm a true believer in that.

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:24.500
I'm not very good at
drawing on the computer.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.850
I'm much better drawing by hand.

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:29.540
So I'm a very
hand-oriented person.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.630
I do think that's something
that will probably never

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:35.000
change for me.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.320
But I mean, definitely to
use technology in fashion

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.930
doesn't mean take away the hand.

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:43.750
You can laser cut a fabric.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:47.020
You can treat it with some
sort of interesting coating

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.600
to either change the appearance
or texture of the fabric

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.140
or the function of the fabric.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:56.330
Those are things that could be
very beneficial through using

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:57.240
technology.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.300
But the truth is,
there is still really

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.310
no such thing as
machine-made fashion.

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.760
Even the T-shirt I'm wearing
or something that you think

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.994
is machine made, a
pair of hands still

00:49:08.994 --> 00:49:10.410
has to put it
through the machine.

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.380
It doesn't really exist.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:16.350
There's no such thing as a
machine made fashion really,

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:18.000
not yet.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.055
AUDIENCE: Until robots
are putting clothes

00:49:20.055 --> 00:49:20.888
through the machine.

00:49:20.888 --> 00:49:24.338
JASON WU: Yeah, no, I mean,
something as simple as this,

00:49:24.338 --> 00:49:25.796
it's still made by
a pair of hands.

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:26.900
MARTHA HUNT: That's true.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:27.914
That's a good point.

00:49:27.914 --> 00:49:28.580
AUDIENCE: Thanks

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:29.530
JASON WU: Thank you.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:30.620
MARTHA HUNT: Thank you.

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:32.430
Well, I think that's all
we have time for today.

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:33.610
JASON WU: Thank
you for having us.

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:35.130
MARTHA HUNT: Thank you
guys so much for having us.

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:35.850
It was such an honor.

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:36.450
Thank you.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:39.200
[APPLAUSE]
