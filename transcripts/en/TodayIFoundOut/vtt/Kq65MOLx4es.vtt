00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.600
The Dung Beetle and the Stars

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.050
Dung beetles have long surprised scientists
with their remarkable navigation abilities,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.459
despite the relatively small sizes of their
brains.

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.959
Scientists have also known that after dung
beetles collect the dung, they do a little

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.940
dance on top of it before moving it in a straight
line to their destination.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.410
The dancing was once written off as a “happy
dance,” but now we know better—it actually

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.289
helps the dung beetle get its bearings as
it dances around in circles, looking at the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.289
stars.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.280
This behaviour, as well as the fact that dung
beetles have specialized eyes which analyse

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.950
the direction of light polarization, first
led researchers to hypothesize that the beetles

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.020
might be using the sky to navigate.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.020
During the day, it was easy to see that they
were using a pattern of polarized light around

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.820
the sun in order to navigate.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.600
But no one knew exactly how they continued
to navigate at night, which led to the hypothesis

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.710
that they might be using the moon.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.890
To test the hypothesis, researchers led by
Marie Dacke conducted a variety of different

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.890
experiments.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.000
They set up a circular arena with high walls
in South Africa, blocking out views of everything

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.220
but the sky.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.940
They then timed dung beetles—in this case,
Scarabaeus satyrus—on how long they took

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.300
to cross the arena.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.390
The beetles were tested in different conditions:
with the moon out, with no moon, and with

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.030
an overcast sky.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.940
Some of the beetles were equipped with cardboard
caps which forced their eyes downward, so

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.230
they weren’t able to see the sky at all
under any conditions.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.520
What the researchers found was that dung beetles
had a tough time staying in a straight line

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.220
when there were clouds obscuring the sky and
when they were wearing the caps.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.500
However, when there was a clear sky with no
moon, the beetles were still able to navigate

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.500
correctly.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.330
This led to the idea that they were using
stars to navigate.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.580
That led to a potential problem.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.720
As Dacke said, “We thought that they could
be using the stars [for orientation], but

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.310
dung beetles have such small eyes that they
don’t have the resolution, or sensitivity,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.390
to see individual stars.”

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.409
To investigate this further, the researchers
repeated the experiments under slightly different

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.409
conditions.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.260
They moved the arena to a planetarium where
they were able to control which stars the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.180
dung beetles were able to see.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.520
Once again, some of the beetles wore caps.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.759
This time, they showed the beetles the brightest
stars, showed only the Milky Way, and then

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.719
showed the entire sky.

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.120
What they found was that the beetles were
slow to cross the arena when the brightest

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.529
stars were visible, but they crossed at normal
speed when only the Milky Way was visible

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.950
and when the entire sky was visible.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.349
The beetles with caps had difficulty crossing
no matter what.

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.950
The researchers concluded that the beetles
must be using the Milky Way in order to navigate.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.620
This falls in line with the findings of a
similar experiment that used a different type

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.169
of dung beetle, the Scarabaeus zambesianus,
which was unable to move in a straight line

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:39.720
when the Milky Way wasn’t visible.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.999
Of course, in the Northern Hemisphere, the
Milky Way is less distinct than in the Southern

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.989
Hemisphere, and it’s possible that dung
beetles in the Northern Hemisphere are using

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.060
a different gradient of light than the southern
beetles.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.319
But the revelation that southern beetles are
able to use the Milky Way to navigate is big

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.200
news from the animal kingdom.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.739
They are the first insects known to use the
stars for navigation (outside of our sun,

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.140
which insects like honey bees do use as one
of many reference points for navigation; this

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.099
is particularly fascinating because these
bees will adjust for the change in the sun’s

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.480
location at a given time of day when communicating
locations of things to their fellow bees.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.420
Even if their communication takes many hours,
they’ll adjust accordingly just fine for

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.790
the change in position of the sun.)

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.019
In any event, the ability to roll a ball of
dung in a straight line is crucial for the

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.129
survival of dung beetles.

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.819
After they create a ball of dung, they have
to roll it away from the pile as quickly as

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.790
possible to avoid having their prize stolen
by one of their peers.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.890
Once the pile of dung is a safe distance away,
the dung beetle will bury it and it becomes

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.019
food for the beetle’s offspring.

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.230
Bonus Facts:
• Non-insects that are known to use stars

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.159
for navigation, include many different types
of birds, a few types of seals, and, of course,

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.159
humans.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.139
It’s thought that the ability to read the
stars might be even more widespread among

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.120
other members of the animal kingdom than we
once thought, but a significant amount of

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.090
research still needs to be done to confirm
or deny this.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.120
• Arguably among the most skilled animal
navigators is the homing pigeon, which uses

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.469
magnetic cues, patterns of sunlight, and physical
landmarks to locate their homes.

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:16.470
After an initial trip, pigeons can’t be
stopped by magnets, blindfolds, or even getting

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.650
shipped off to a different time zone in a
sealed box—they can always find their way

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.650
back home.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.590
They’re a bit like salmon, who likely use
magnetic signatures in order to find their

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.020
way back to the streams in which they hatched.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.879
Another animal that uses magnetic fields to
navigate is the sea turtle.

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:49.550
In addition, Robins can actually see magnetic
fields, but only with one of their eyes.
