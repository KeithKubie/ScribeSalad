00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.790
PROFESSOR: So as long
as I'm introducing

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.870
the idea of a vector
space, I better introduce

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.510
the things that go with it.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.530
The idea of its dimension
and, all important, the idea

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.710
of a basis for that space.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.840
That space could be all of
three dimensional space,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.120
the space we live in.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.030
In that, case the
dimension is three,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.740
but what's the meaning of
a basis-- a basis for three

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.220
dimensional space.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.600
Or a basis for other spaces.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.340
OK, so I have to explain
independence, basis,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.150
and dimension.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.670
Dimension's easy if
you get the first two.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.960
OK, independence.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.410
Are those vectors independent?

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.310
Well, if I draw them, in
three dimensional space,

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.690
I can imagine 2, 1, 5
going in some direction.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.130
Let me draw it.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.820
How's that?

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.540
2, 1, 5, whatever!

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.590
Goes there.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.270
That's a1.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.930
OK.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.980
Now is a2 on the same line?

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.400
If a2 is on the same line
then it would be dependent.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400
The two vectors
would be dependent

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.000
if they're on the same line.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.030
But this one is
not on that line.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.710
A 4, 2, 0.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.520
So it doesn't go up and all.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.075
It's somewhere in
this plane, 4, 2, 0.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:24.450
I'll say there.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.280
Whatever.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.569
a2.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:28.610
So those are independent.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.140
So their combinations
give me a space.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.780
The combinations of a1 and a2
give me a plane, a flat plane,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.210
in three dimensional space.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.020
That plane is, I would
say, they span the plane.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.635
a1 and a2 span a plane.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.440
And here's the key word: span.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.220
So there are two vectors.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.740
They're in three
dimensional space.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.800
And the plane they span
is all their combinations.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.850
That's what we're always doing:
taking all the combinations

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.070
of these vectors.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.880
OK.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.940
So there-- and actually, a1 and
a2 are a basis for that pane.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.770
a1 and a2 are a
basis for that plane

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.910
because their combinations
fill the plane.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.240
And also, they're independent.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.840
I need them both.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.170
If I threw away one, I would
only have one vector left,

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.750
and it would only span a line.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.290
OK.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.770
Now let me bring in a third
vector in three dimensions.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.330
Well, what shall I take
for that third vector?

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.330
Ha!

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.840
Suppose I take a1 plus
a2 as my third vector.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.790
So 6, 3, 5.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.810
What about the vector 6, 3, 5?

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.860
Well, what do I know?

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.200
It's obviously special.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.310
It's a1 plus a2.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.940
It's in the same plane.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:14.930
So if I took a3 equal 6, 3,
5, that would be dependent.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.946
The three vectors would
be dependent with that a3.

00:03:22.946 --> 00:03:25.020
They would span the plane still.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.520
Their combinations would
still give the plane,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.880
but they wouldn't be
a basis for the plane.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.510
a1 and 12 and a3 together,
that's too much, too many

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.070
vectors for a single plane.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.790
The vectors are dependent.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.010
And we don't-- a basis has
to be independent vectors.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.590
You have to need them all.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.670
We don't need all three here.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.400
So that's a dependent one.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.780
It can't go into a
basis with a1 and a2

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.190
because the three
vectors are dependent.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.690
Now let me make a
difference choice.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.070
So that one's dead.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.270
That did not do it.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.770
All right.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.790
Let me take a3
equal to some other,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.870
not a combination of
these, but headed off

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.280
in some new direction.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.490
Well, I don't know what
that new direction is.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.900
Maybe 1, 0, 0.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.410
What the heck?

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.140
I believe-- I hope I'm
right-- that 1, 0, 0

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.210
is not a combination here.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.510
I say 1, 0, 0 goes off.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.760
It's pretty short.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.330
Here's a3.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.870
Better a3 then
that loser 6, 3, 5.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.130
1 0, 0 is a winner.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.040
These three vectors--

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.930
So now a1, a2, and let me
add in a3, all three of them

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.790
span a-- what do they span?

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.160
What are all the
combinations of a1, a2, a3?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.310
It's three dimensional?

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.570
It's the whole three
dimensional space.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:02.620
They span all of 3D, the
whole three dimensional space.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.130
They're a basis for the whole
three dimensional space.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.560
They're independent.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.170
So let me-- you see that
picture before I move it?

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.480
a1, a2, a3 are independent.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.830
None of them is a
combination of the others.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.120
They fill a three
dimensional space.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.180
They're are a basis for that
three dimensional space.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.110
And that space is,
in this example,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.720
is the whole of our three.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.230
So let me just write down on
the next blackboard what I mean.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.360
Independent.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.860
Independent.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.600
So independent
columns of a matrix.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:06:01.600
Independent columns of a matrix
A means the only solution to Av

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.520
equals 0 is v equals 0.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.760
So if I have
independent columns,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.970
then I haven't got
any null space.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.860
If I have independent
columns, then the null space

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.590
of the matrix is
just the 0 vector.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.230
So let me write down
that example again.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:37.130
A was the matrix 2, 1,
5, 4, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.520
So I believe that matrix
has independent columns.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.300
So its column space is the
full three dimensional space.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.190
It's null space
only contains-- let

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.070
me put it, make that clear
that that's a vector.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:05.290
And now I'm ready to write
down the idea of a basis.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.650
So what is a basis
for the space?

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:15.485
A basis for a space, a subspace.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.930
Independent vectors.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.260
That's the key.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:39.030
Independent vectors that
span the space, the subspace.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.540
Whatever it is.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:49.810
By the way, if the
column space is all

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:55.260
a three dimensional space, as it
is here, that's a subspace too.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.460
It's the whole space,
but the whole space

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.370
counts as a subspace of itself.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.710
And the 0 vector alone counts
as the smallest possible.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.330
So if we're in three dimensions,
the idea of subspaces

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.600
has-- we have just the 0 vector.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.960
Just one point.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.810
That's a smallest.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.930
We have the whole three
dimensional space.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.160
That's the biggest.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.760
And then we have all
the lines through 0.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.340
Those are on the small side.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.760
We have all the
planes through 0.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.260
Those are a bit bigger.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:36.110
And those dimensions
are 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:40.600
The possible dimensions
is told to us

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.159
by how many basis
vectors we need.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:49.800
So let me look at that and
then come to dimension.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.980
OK.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.790
So independent means
that the only--

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.490
that no combination,
no other combination

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.060
of the vectors, no
combination of these vectors

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.242
gives the 0 vector except to
take 0 of that, 0 of that,

00:09:07.242 --> 00:09:10.710
and 0 of that.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.440
So those are a basis
for the column space

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.070
because they're independent
and their combinations

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.090
give the whole column space.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:21.800
OK.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.241
And now I wanted to say
something about dimensions.

00:09:25.241 --> 00:09:25.740
OK.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.510
Dimension.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.280
It's a number.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:48.800
It's the number of basis
vectors for the subspace.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.300
Oh!

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.530
But you might say,
that the subspace

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.930
has other bases,
not just the one you

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.520
happen to think of first.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.940
And I agree.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.010
Many different bases.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:14.370
For this example, all I need to
get a basis for, in this case,

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.190
for three dimensional space is I
need three independent vectors.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.230
Any three.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.170
But the point is, the
point about dimension

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.370
is that I need exactly three.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:31.720
I can never get two vectors
that span all of our three.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.710
And I can never get
four vectors that

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.090
are independent in our three.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:41.130
If I have fewer than
the dimension number,

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.050
I don't have enough.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.390
They don't span.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.380
If I have too many, than the
dimension, they're dependent.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.400
They won't be independent.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.050
They can't be a basis.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:11:00.050
Every basis has the same number.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:04.645
And that number is the
dimension of the subspace.

00:11:07.712 --> 00:11:11.920
All right, let's just take an
example, just with a picture.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.280
I'll stay in three
dimensional space,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.990
but my subspace will
just be a plane.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.385
So here I'm in three
dimensional space.

00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:21.580
Good.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.950
Now I have my
subspace is a plane.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.610
So it goes through the
origin, but it's only a plane.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.080
So I'm expecting that I could
take a vector in the plane,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.280
and I could take another
vector in the plane,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.681
and they could be independent.

00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:39.180
They are.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.910
They're different directions.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.800
I couldn't find a third
independent vector

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.780
in the plane.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.490
Every basis for the plane--

00:11:48.490 --> 00:12:04.650
So here every basis for this
plane contains two vectors.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.930
Always two.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:11.160
And that number two is
the dimension of a plane.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.080
Well, I'm just saying the
plane there is two dimensional.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.380
It's not the same as r2.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.510
it's not the same.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.910
That plane is a plane in r3.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.090
It's not ordinary two
dimensional space.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:30.420
But its dimension is two
because it takes any vector.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.570
And if I didn't like
the looks of this one,

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.450
well, that's no problem.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.260
Let me go that way.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.910
That's just as good.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.250
Those two vectors
are independent.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.210
They span the plane.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.410
They're a basis for the plane.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.370
The plane is two dimensional.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.210
That's the set of key ideas.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.470
Independent.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.810
Span.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.470
Basis.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.560
Basis is fundamental.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.040
Basis is a bunch of vectors.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.381
And dimension is
how many vectors.

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:02.880
OK.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.350
Those are key ideas
in linear algebra.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:11.910
And you'll see them come
into the big picture

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.400
of linear algebra.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.170
Thank you.
