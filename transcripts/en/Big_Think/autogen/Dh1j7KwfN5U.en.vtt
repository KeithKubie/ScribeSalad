to put this in the most simple
 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.430
to put this in the most simple
developmental model we-we-we gets we can

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440
developmental model we-we-we gets we can
 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.920
developmental model we-we-we gets we can
look at a individual and cultural

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930
look at a individual and cultural
 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.310
look at a individual and cultural
evolution as a leap from egocentric

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320
evolution as a leap from egocentric
 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.140
evolution as a leap from egocentric
which would be the the perspective of

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150
which would be the the perspective of
 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.090
which would be the the perspective of
the small baby right egocentric which

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100
the small baby right egocentric which
 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.560
the small baby right egocentric which
only I exist egocentric to ethnocentric

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570
only I exist egocentric to ethnocentric
 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.250
only I exist egocentric to ethnocentric
ethnocentric is when we are only

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260
ethnocentric is when we are only
 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.990
ethnocentric is when we are only
identified with our own bloodline our

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000
identified with our own bloodline our
 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.270
identified with our own bloodline our
own family our own tribe everyone else's

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280
own family our own tribe everyone else's
 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.710
own family our own tribe everyone else's
others so there's egocentric to

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720
others so there's egocentric to
 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.700
others so there's egocentric to
ethnocentric and to world centric but

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710
ethnocentric and to world centric but
 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.110
ethnocentric and to world centric but
before we get to world centric there's

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120
before we get to world centric there's
 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.330
before we get to world centric there's
two subcategories and one would be myth

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340
two subcategories and one would be myth
 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.950
two subcategories and one would be myth
eccentric because when we take the leap

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960
eccentric because when we take the leap
 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.880
eccentric because when we take the leap
from egocentric to ethnocentric from

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890
from egocentric to ethnocentric from
 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.520
from egocentric to ethnocentric from
from ethnocentric there's a leap -

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530
from ethnocentric there's a leap -
 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.010
from ethnocentric there's a leap -
there's a leap - when we begin to share

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020
there's a leap - when we begin to share
 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.250
there's a leap - when we begin to share
the same creation myth all the great

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260
the same creation myth all the great
 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.810
the same creation myth all the great
traditions share their own creation

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820
traditions share their own creation
 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.880
traditions share their own creation
stories so when we begin to share the

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890
stories so when we begin to share the
 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.190
stories so when we begin to share the
same creation stories creation myth with

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200
same creation stories creation myth with
 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.779
same creation stories creation myth with
other individuals our sense of being

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789
other individuals our sense of being
 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.389
other individuals our sense of being
connected suddenly leaps from just our

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399
connected suddenly leaps from just our
 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.040
connected suddenly leaps from just our
own bloodline to everyone else that

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050
own bloodline to everyone else that
 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.449
own bloodline to everyone else that
shares our particular religious

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.459
shares our particular religious
 

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.190
shares our particular religious
worldview so that would be a myth

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200
worldview so that would be a myth
 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.300
worldview so that would be a myth
eccentric and there's another

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310
eccentric and there's another
 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.889
eccentric and there's another
subcategory which would be nation

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899
subcategory which would be nation
 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.529
subcategory which would be nation
centric which is we have a strong sense

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539
centric which is we have a strong sense
 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.359
centric which is we have a strong sense
of national identity for example I'm an

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369
of national identity for example I'm an
 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.279
of national identity for example I'm an
American so there so so would be

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289
American so there so so would be
 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.600
American so there so so would be
egocentric - ethnocentric - myth

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610
egocentric - ethnocentric - myth
 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.639
egocentric - ethnocentric - myth
eccentric nation centric finally - world

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649
eccentric nation centric finally - world
 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.870
eccentric nation centric finally - world
centric and world centric it is it is

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880
centric and world centric it is it is
 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.219

the level I'm showing but that most of

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229
the level I'm showing but that most of
 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.270
the level I'm showing but that most of
the people that would be listening to

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280
the people that would be listening to
 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.699
the people that would be listening to
this talk today which is when the

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709
this talk today which is when the
 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.779
this talk today which is when the
individual realizes that first and

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789
individual realizes that first and
 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.760
individual realizes that first and
foremost he or she is a human being a

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770
foremost he or she is a human being a
 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.770
foremost he or she is a human being a
member of the human species and a

member of the human species and a
 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.719
member of the human species and a
citizen of the planet Earth while I also

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729
citizen of the planet Earth while I also
 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.809
citizen of the planet Earth while I also
am a member of a citizen of a particular

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819
am a member of a citizen of a particular
 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.370
am a member of a citizen of a particular
nation member of a particular ethnic

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380
nation member of a particular ethnic
 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.719

group have a particular personal ego
experienced I see all those things in

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780
experienced I see all those things in
 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.800
experienced I see all those things in
the context of being a human being a

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810
the context of being a human being a
 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.930
the context of being a human being a
member of the human family a citizen of

member of the human family a citizen of
 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.790
member of the human family a citizen of
the planet Earth first and foremost so I

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800
the planet Earth first and foremost so I
 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.550
the planet Earth first and foremost so I
think that the the most important I

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560
think that the the most important I
 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.320
think that the the most important I
think revolution that has to happen is

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330
think revolution that has to happen is
 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.420
think revolution that has to happen is
this is this leap from ethnocentric in

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430
this is this leap from ethnocentric in
 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.729
this is this leap from ethnocentric in
terms of the world predicament were in

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739
terms of the world predicament were in
 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.460
terms of the world predicament were in
is a leap from ethnocentric and nation

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470
is a leap from ethnocentric and nation
 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.930
is a leap from ethnocentric and nation
centric and myth eccentric and nation

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940
centric and myth eccentric and nation
 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.460
centric and myth eccentric and nation
centric to world centric because when we

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470
centric to world centric because when we
 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.930
centric to world centric because when we
all realize they were

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940
all realize they were
 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.420
all realize they were
all human beings who are basically equal

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430
all human beings who are basically equal
 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.130
all human beings who are basically equal
as citizens of this one planet it's

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140
as citizens of this one planet it's
 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.480
as citizens of this one planet it's
going to become much easier for us to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490
going to become much easier for us to
 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.460
going to become much easier for us to
come together and solve our collective

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470
come together and solve our collective
 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.100
come together and solve our collective
problems but there is a leap there there

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110
problems but there is a leap there there
 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.780
problems but there is a leap there there
is another there's a leap from world

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790
is another there's a leap from world
 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.480
is another there's a leap from world
centric to cosmos centric and cosmos

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490
centric to cosmos centric and cosmos
 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.670
centric to cosmos centric and cosmos
centric is what is when we begin to see

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680
centric is what is when we begin to see
 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.490
centric is what is when we begin to see
as I've been saying our own capacity for

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500
as I've been saying our own capacity for
 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.130
as I've been saying our own capacity for
consciousness and cognition as a product

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140
consciousness and cognition as a product
 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.020
consciousness and cognition as a product
of this deep time developmental process

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030
of this deep time developmental process
 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.970
of this deep time developmental process
then we begin to see everything is

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980
then we begin to see everything is
 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.310
then we begin to see everything is
happening including everything that's

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320
happening including everything that's
 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.560
happening including everything that's
happening on a global scale up from from

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570
happening on a global scale up from from
 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.180
happening on a global scale up from from
the perspective of the evolving cosmos

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190
the perspective of the evolving cosmos
 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.420
the perspective of the evolving cosmos
itself so the bigger our perspective the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
itself so the bigger our perspective the
 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.990
itself so the bigger our perspective the
more the more inclusive our way of

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000
more the more inclusive our way of
 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.450
more the more inclusive our way of
thinking is going to be unless exclusive

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460
thinking is going to be unless exclusive
 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.150
thinking is going to be unless exclusive
and of course the more human beings who

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160
and of course the more human beings who
 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.440
and of course the more human beings who
have a capacity to think in more

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450
have a capacity to think in more
 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.970
have a capacity to think in more
inclusive ways we're going to be

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980
inclusive ways we're going to be
 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.940
inclusive ways we're going to be
thinking about our problems and it's not

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950
thinking about our problems and it's not
 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.860
thinking about our problems and it's not
just the problems of a particular a

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870
just the problems of a particular a
 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.780
just the problems of a particular a
group of people our particular culture

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790
group of people our particular culture
 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.100
group of people our particular culture
but we're going to see everything that's

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110
but we're going to see everything that's
 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.570
but we're going to see everything that's
happening more in a global context

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580
 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.180
I think a lot of people are beginning to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190
I think a lot of people are beginning to
 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.240
I think a lot of people are beginning to
to take to move towards this kind of

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250
to take to move towards this kind of
 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.730
to take to move towards this kind of
leave now I think for several reasons I

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740
leave now I think for several reasons I
 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.020
leave now I think for several reasons I
think because more and more people

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030
think because more and more people
 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.670
think because more and more people
realize that we're all facing a global

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680
realize that we're all facing a global
 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.170
realize that we're all facing a global
crisis right now especially in

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
crisis right now especially in
 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.490
crisis right now especially in
relationship to global warming for

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500
relationship to global warming for
 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.310
relationship to global warming for
example and that simple fact is

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320
example and that simple fact is
 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.490
example and that simple fact is
compelling many people to to to

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500
compelling many people to to to
 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.430
compelling many people to to to
transcend ethnocentric differences and
