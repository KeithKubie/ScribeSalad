CHRIS DEFAY: All right, hello,
my name's Chris DeFay.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.200
And this is a Talks at Google
Presentation here in Google's

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.810
Los Angeles office.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.840
We are very pleased today to
welcome author and musician

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.990
Ian Whitcomb.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.620
Ian is a native of Surrey,
England, and a current

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.430
resident of Altadena, northeast
of downtown Los

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.210
Angeles, and has been
entertaining

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.860
the world for decades.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.240
After hitting the American Top
10 charts in 1965 with his

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.060
novelty record "You Turn Me On"
and finding himself in the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.230
company of young bands like The
Rolling Stones, he devoted

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.250
his work to resurrecting the
roots of pop music, especially

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.530
ragtime and Tin Pan Alley.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.960
He's performed everywhere, from
the Hollywood Bowl, to

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.650
the Montreux Jazz Festival,
and has appeared on Johnny

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.690
Carson, "The Tonight Show." As
an author he has published

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.890
over 20 books, and is best known
for his book, "After the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.060
Ball," on the history of pop
music from rag to rock.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.600
Today he will be discussing the
topic of his recent book,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.430
"Ukulele Heroes, the Golden
Age," and playing us a few

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.320
samples, I think.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.080
IAN WHITCOMB: I'll try.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.010
CHRIS DEFAY: Yes.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.100
Please join me in
welcoming Ian.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.012
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.012 --> 00:01:06.292
IAN WHITCOMB: Thank you.

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:07.940
First of all, how
many of you here

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.270
actually play the ukulele?

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.860
Good, great, well I used to
be a very good player.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.780
But I had an illness, and
I can't strum very well.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.680
Here's the ukulele.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.560
This is a Martin, one of the
best ones you can get.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.600
It's nice.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.090
I call this a pleasingly
plangent sound.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.090
[UKULELE PLAYING]

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.770
IAN WHITCOMB: So it's a
four-stringed instrument.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.070
And I'll give you a little brief
history, but not too

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.450
much of it.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.160
I want to questions
from you all too.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.180
Brief history is that it was
actually not invented in

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.280
Hawaii at all.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.140
It was invented by
the Portuguese.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.540
It was called a machete there.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.750
In fact, there's a picture in
1860 of the girl who became

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.860
Alice in "Alice in Wonderland"
playing her machete.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.430
And it was brought across to
Hawaii by Portuguese who were

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.000
working in the plantations then,
the sugar plantations.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.360
And they had four of them on
board a ship called the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.800
"Raven's Crag," which
had arrived in 1878.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.050
And the Hawaiians immediately
took to this instrument, which

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.709
they called it ukulele, or
oo-kah-lay-lee, as they say in

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.370
Hawaii, which means jumping
or leaping flea.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.210
And they loved it, especially
the royalty, Hawaiian royalty.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.500
At that time it was
a free country.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.590
That was just before America
came in and acquired, well,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.980
shall we say they overthrew
the queen.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.630
We won't go into that.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.070
It's a sore point
for Hawaiians.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.440
It was a bloodless revolution,
or rebellion, or whatever,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.550
takeover , by American
businessmen in

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.450
the pineapple business.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.670
But anyway, it's
all in my book.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.030
The point is the last queen,
whose name I can't pronounce,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.170
who's on the cover of my book.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.210
I should know her name.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.700
Some of you may know her name.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.390
She was a wonderful composer.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.740
And she wrote great songs.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.470
She wrote the famous "Aloha
Oe." It sounds Jewish.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.320
It's not, "Aloha Oe." And
she played the piano.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.390
And she survived the overthrow
of the country.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.530
The steel guitar, by the
way, was actually

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.890
invented by the Hawaiians.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.660
That's where you pull a metal
bar across the strings.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.720
They did actually invent that.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.820
They didn't invent
the ukulele.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.630
But they did invent this slide
guitar, which, of course, is

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.060
now associated very much
with blues and country.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.600
But it actually comes
from Hawaii.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.810
So they can claim that one.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.790
I won't get too historical, but
what happened was that,

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.600
eventually, the mainlanders, as
they call us, got to hear

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.550
about the ukulele.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.150
In 1915, there was an exposition
in San Francisco

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.590
called the Pan-Pacific
Exposition.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.620
And the Hawaiians had
their own pavilion.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.990
And they sent across their
bands, which were the most

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.370
popular things of all, these
Hawaiian bands with ukuleles

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.190
and steel guitars.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.075
And, more importantly, hula
girls swaying because the

00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:41.720
hula, although it's a religious
dance, we see it as

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.160
sort of a sexy dance
from the hips.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.320
But the Hawaiians don't
think that.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.840
They think it's a very
religious dance.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.110
Anyway, the hula girls and the
Hawaiian bands were extremely

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.080
popular in America in 1915.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.930
So much so that Tin Pan Alley,
in New York where they wrote-

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.640
I guess you all know what
Tin Pan Alley is.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.200
It's where they manufactured
popular songs.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.070
They were all published
in sheet music form.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.010
And Tin Pan Alley realized
this was a phenomena.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.710
So they started writing songs
about Hawaii and what a

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.240
blissful place it was.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.690
So Hawaiian bands toured
America, became very popular,

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.880
especially in the south, where
the southerners loved the

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.480
steel guitar.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.790
And that's why you have the
steel guitar in country music,

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.770
because of Hawaiian bands
touring the country.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.030
Now I should just tell you
about myself a bit more.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.460
I was, as what Chris explained,
I was a teen idol

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.340
for a short time in the '60s.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.290
Probably nobody remembers "You
Turn Me On," do they?

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.050
Anybody remember that song,
"You Turn Me On"?

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.630
It was top 10, top
number eight.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.080
I think you do.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.530
In 1965, I was in the top 10,
the same time that the song

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.380
"Satisfaction" was number one.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.680
Anyway, quickly I realized
that rock and

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.530
roll was not my field.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.480
So I started--

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.160
I bought a ukulele in a
pawnshop, P-A-W-N, in Los

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.640
Angeles, a Martin.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.260
And I immediately began playing
the uke on the bus

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.030
tours that I did with these
rock and roll groups.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.615
And a group called The Turtles
heard me and said, you ought

00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:03.940
to record some of these songs.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.470
So I did.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.800
I've been recording the
older songs since.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.375
And my whole career has gone
backwards because of that.

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:11.200
But I was playing ukulele.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.940
And my version of this 1916
song, "Where Did Robinson

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.760
Crusoe Go with Friday on
Saturday Night?" became a hit

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.940
and established me
as a uke player.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.990
And I suppose, in a way, I
started the whole uke revival

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.330
because this was before Tiny
Tim, who is associated with--

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.550
This is from a song book I've
got out called "Ian Whitcomb's

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.760
Ukulele Sing-Along." It's a
nice little book with a CD

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.300
attached, which you
can get online.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.270
And it sells quite well.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.080
Anyway, we've reached the point
where Tin Pan Alley is

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.080
cashing in on the
Hawaiian craze.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.800
And in America, people
are buying ukuleles.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.820
The Martin company begins
to build the ukulele.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.170
If you have any questions ask
them anytime you like.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.360
So, yes, a question?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.270
AUDIENCE: Did you say a date or
a decade when the ukulele

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.689
was introduced by the Portuguese
to Hawaii?

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.940
IAN WHITCOMB: Yes, well they
came over in a ship, the three

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.710
of them, in 1878, in the
"Raven's Crag." They landed in

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.150
Hawaii, in Honolulu.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.230
And they were all craftsmen.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.630
They had the ukuleles
with them.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.820
And many of them could
build ukes.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.430
And so the first ukuleles were
built by Portuguese craftsmen.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.310
And then they gradually, as I
said, it became popular from

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.810
about 1915.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.300
And then the mainlanders
began to make ukes.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.230
Although Hawaii still makes
very good ukes.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.445
If you want to buy one, by the
way, my friend who put this

00:06:37.445 --> 00:06:40.920
out, Jim Beloff has a very good
company called Fluke,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.330
F-L-U-K-E, and they make
really good ukes.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.420
They're designed by
an MIT engineer.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.950
They're partly wood and
partly plastic.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.030
They have a beautiful sound.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.550
So that's Jim Beloff.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.220
His email address is
fleamarketmusic.com.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.345
AUDIENCE: I was curious because
Mark Twain was in

00:06:58.345 --> 00:06:59.605
Hawaii in the 1860s.

00:06:59.605 --> 00:07:02.530
I was wondering if he
would have heard it.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.670
IAN WHITCOMB: There wouldn't
have been a ukulele then.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.370
The Portuguese had
it in the 1860s.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.550
It was called a machete.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.555
It never really caught on.

00:07:09.555 --> 00:07:12.480
It was only when the Portuguese

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.440
brought it to Hawaii.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.580
And then the Hawaiians
loved it.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.890
They called it the ukulele,
jumping flea, and then it got

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:20.920
popularized from then.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.070
They really developed the
whole strumming style.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.440
Yes?

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.470
AUDIENCE: Did they keep
the same tuning?

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.670
IAN WHITCOMB: No, the original
tuning was different.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.010
That tuning I have there is the
standard, G-C-E-A, my dog

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.820
has fleas, but in the old days,
the early days it was

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.455
actually different tuning.

00:07:39.455 --> 00:07:40.815
It was much higher.

00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:42.920
But it got standardized.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.770
If you look at old sheet music,
you'll see that they

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.520
have from the '20s onwards--

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.630
I'm playing around with
my technology--

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.750
if you look at the old sheet
music, and today, they have

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.600
these little grids that show you
where to put your fingers.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.840
Those were invented
about 1920.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.260
And if you look at any old sheet
music from that period,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.770
it'd say ukulele arrangement.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.600
The reason is, and I should
get back to this point, is

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.540
that by that time the ukulele
had become really popular,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.880
very trendy.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.360
In the 1920s, in the Jazz Age,
it was the trend to play a

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.810
saxophone, or play the drums,
or play the ukulele.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.470
That's why you see these young
men in raccoon cotes playing

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:16.970
the ukulele.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.890
It was the way to woo
your girlfriend.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.240
In fact, I have experience
with that

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.120
because- not in the 20s.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.810
But when I had a-- before
I met Regina,

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.000
I had a lady friend.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.460
I once sang on the beach to her,
you were meant for me,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.580
with my uke, and she
took it seriously.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.470
She said, do you mean that?

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.659
Are you serious about that?

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.520
I realized then the power of
these old popular songs.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.030
They're very powerful songs.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.150
It doesn't apply today, because
people shout today,

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:44.730
and they rant.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.340
And I can't understand what
they're talking about.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.980
But in those days there were
very romantic songs, which hit

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.160
the nail squarely on the head.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.980
So I love those songs.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.100
That's why I'm still very
involved with old songs.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.420
I write books about songs.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.940
I love old songs.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.810
By the way, if you go on
YouTube, you can see some

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.630
videos I made with an Akai.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.940
I don't know if you know the
Akai, reel to reel, was an

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.780
early prototype video recorder,
portable one.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.260
I had one and I went to New York
with it, and I videoed

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.280
all the old songwriters I could
find, including the man

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.430
who wrote "Swanny" with George
Gershwin, Irving Caesar..

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.090
And these are all up online
now on YouTube.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.390
You can see me.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.800
You can see my interview with
Johnny Marks, who wrote

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.150
"Rudolph, the Red-Nosed
Reindeer." You can see me--

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.120
if you type in--

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.350
I think he's doing it now.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.710
Type in Ian Whitcomb, Harry
Warren, who's a great

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.280
songwriter, who wrote "Home in
Pasadena." You can see he and

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.870
I singing that song together.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.170
And I'm accompanying
him on the ukulele.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.370
He sings what he calls
an obbligato part.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:42.980
He was a great man.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.146
So I, early on, when these
songwriters were still alive,

00:09:46.146 --> 00:09:47.130
I took my video camera.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.580
And I videoed them, as
many as I could.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.700
Eubie Blake, who lived to
be 100, I videoed him.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.090
I wish I'd done more of this.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.000
I mean, they're all dead now.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.090
But it was a wonderful- I was
so glad that I did that.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.855
G-C-E-A. [SINGING]

00:10:00.855 --> 00:10:04.705
My dog has fleas, fleas,
my dog has fleas.

00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:06.560
And it's easy to play.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.570
The basic, the first
C chord is--

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.600
[UKULELE PLAYING]

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.100
IAN WHITCOMB: And then G 7th.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.320
[UKULELE PLAYING]

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:13.930
IAN WHITCOMB: F.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:24.910
[UKULELE PLAYING]

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.160
IAN WHITCOMB: Pleasant
sound, isn't it?

00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:30.460
I used to be much stronger.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.320
But I had an illness.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.960
Which I'm recovering from,
by the way, folks.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.715
I'll just tell you know.

00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:37.180
I had a stroke about
nine months ago.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.460
So I'm doing my best.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.110
I hope you can understand
what I'm saying.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.680
I survived the stroke.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.410
But I'm still--

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.330
my fingers are still bad.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.350
I can't feel much
in this hand.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.960
They keep telling me it
will all come back.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.920
I'm working on it every day.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.790
My wife's a great help.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.050
Anyway, got that
out of the way.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:53.830
I'm still performing.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.050
IAN WHITCOMB: I'm left-handed.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.970
I'm left-handed, so it means
that I can't play the piano

00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:59.850
well now with my left hand.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.900
But I won't go into all that.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.460
I've survived.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.195
And I can talk.

00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:03.610
And I can walk.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:06.590
And I can be annoying.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.860
By the way, I'm sorry
I'm plugging myself.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.600
But if you're interested, I
have a radio show every

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.650
Wednesday night on a site
called Luxuriamusic.com.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.150
It's a nice company,
LuxuriaMusic.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.880
And I do it live.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.950
It'll be on tomorrow night,
Wednesday night.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.250
If you really enjoy what I'm
saying, if you go online and

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.400
just put in Ian Whitcomb
podcast, there are 93 radio

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.550
shows that I did for XM.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.630
I used to work for
a company called

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.220
Premiere Radio Networks.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.810
And amongst the radio shows
they make the most

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.750
money off, not mine.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.040
They make money off Rush
Limbaugh, Sean Hannity--

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.360
Years to come, because the
CDs will all fade.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.640
We'll be left with LPs, which
will last forever, and '78s,

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.380
which, if you're careful with
them, are wonderful things.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.010
That's my little speech
about technology.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.870
I never understood why I see
all these kids going around

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.680
with these things stuck in their
ears because the sound

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.430
on MP3s is terrible.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.350
They'll never hear what good
sound sounds like.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.080
Good sound is an LP played
through a good turntable.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.720
That's what I think.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.040
And if you've got anything to
challenge me on that tell me.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.060
I'm an old technologist.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.035
I prefer old technology.

00:12:13.035 --> 00:12:17.148
AUDIENCE: Are you going to talk
later about certain, more

00:12:17.148 --> 00:12:20.211
recent resurgences
of the ukulele?

00:12:20.211 --> 00:12:22.290
IAN WHITCOMB: Well,
I do in the book.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.080
Of course, there's been
the resurgence.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.790
I didn't get to that.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.680
Sorry, I should quickly skip
to that before we get onto

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.030
Ukulele Ike.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.215
Well, the ukulele was very
popular, as I was saying, in

00:12:31.215 --> 00:12:33.680
the '20s and the '30s.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.510
And then it started
to fade away.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.325
And with the coming of
rock and roll, it

00:12:37.325 --> 00:12:38.100
was completely out.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.270
When I was playing the
ukulele in the '60s,

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.070
people laughed at me.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.040
It became a joke instrument.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.860
Of course, Tiny Tim
didn't help that.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.530
And it went out for a while
until the resurgence, which is

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.320
started on this West Coast,
which is where most new things

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.030
begin, on the West Coast.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.560
LA is a much better place than
New York, by the way.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.620
This is where we develop the
new things, in LA and

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.540
California.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.870
Anyway, it started to
have a comeback.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.050
It's huge now.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.380
Everybody's playing
the ukulele.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.490
Warren Buffett plays it.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.900
And, as I was saying before,
if you watch any Pixar film

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.650
they always have a ukulele
in every scene.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:16.890
They love ukulele.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.670
They hired me to come up there
and teach them to teach the

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.800
directors to play the ukulele.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.040
So it's having a huge
comeback, why?

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.000
Because it's very simple.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.290
It may be something to
do with the economy.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.563
It's an easy instrument
to play.

00:13:30.563 --> 00:13:31.280
You don't have to plug it in.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.790
You don't have to buy
amplifiers and have

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.510
complicated, sophisticated
equipment.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.910
It's easy to play.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.260
And it's very pleasant.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.480
Everybody loves the
sound of it.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.420
It's a very, very peaceful
instrument.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.930
I believe the whole world's
problems of the world could be

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.630
solved if we all just marched
into trouble spots with our

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.870
ukes and just strummed.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.720
I say that in the book.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.230
I get into that in the book.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.925
Yes, Regina?

00:13:53.925 --> 00:13:57.687
REGINA: Taylor Swift says, right
from the stage when she

00:13:57.687 --> 00:14:02.760
plays the ukulele, she thinks
it has the friendliest sound

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.065
of any instrument.

00:14:04.065 --> 00:14:06.260
IAN WHITCOMB: It's
very friendly.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.210
You couldn't hit anybody
with a ukulele.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.520
You couldn't rob them
or murder them.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.675
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:10.675 --> 00:14:12.380
IAN WHITCOMB: It's a very
safe instrument to play.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.490
I know.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.740
But anyway, I was saying- did
I explain the resurgence

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.376
properly, sir?

00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:22.090
AUDIENCE: The other thing I've
noticed is that teenagers,

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.350
like anything else, and maybe
this hasn't contributed to the

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.337
popularity, but most teens that
I know that have picked

00:14:28.337 --> 00:14:31.584
it up at least began
to learn through

00:14:31.584 --> 00:14:32.875
watching YouTube videos.

00:14:32.875 --> 00:14:34.122
There's thousands of hours.

00:14:34.122 --> 00:14:37.420
IAN WHITCOMB: YouTube has lots
of videos of people playing

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.740
it, how to play.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.240
It's an easy instrument
to play.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.940
Anybody can play it.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.245
It's great fun just to learn
a few chords and

00:14:44.245 --> 00:14:45.725
sing along at parties.

00:14:45.725 --> 00:14:47.950
It's so popular.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.120
As I said, I feel that I did
play a little small part in

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.970
having it become
popular again.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.340
And I've always loved
the sound of it.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.230
You can play any chord
on the uke.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.120
It's a wonderful instrument.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.590
Well, let's just get back to
the '20s if I may, and hear

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.200
Ukulele Ike.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.710
We talked about scat singing.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.750
He did this- he called
it eefing.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.790
Ukulele Ike's real name
was Cliff Edwards.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.110
He had a very checkered life.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.180
If you read the book,
I hope people have

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:10.670
copies of the book.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.060
You'll see there's a whole
chapter on Ukulele Ike, Cliff

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.680
Edwards, and his sad life.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.570
He was born in the
same town as Mark

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.090
Twain, Hannibal, Missouri.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.290
In fact, he met Mark Twain.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.420
But anyway, in the '20s he
became very popular with his

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.990
records playing his ukulele.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.700
And then in the '30s, he
made lots of films.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.840
He's probably best known today
because he lent his voice to

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.010
the sound of Jiminy Cricket in
"Pinocchio." He sings, very

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.110
sweetly, "When You Wish Upon a
Star" in the opening credits

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.030
of that film.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.110
That's Cliff Edwards.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.000
He died.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.925
He was a gambler.

00:15:43.925 --> 00:15:45.710
He had trouble with his wives.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:46.800
He had so many wives.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.760
He spent all his money, drink
and gambling, and died

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.570
penniless and unknown
in Hollywood.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.870
His body lay unclaimed
for days.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.980
Finally, the Walt Disney company
paid for him to have a

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.035
grave, which is actually out
by Bob Hope Airport now.

00:16:01.035 --> 00:16:03.470
You can go and visit him.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.310
Ukulele Ike's stuff
is all available--

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.610
are you all enjoying this
talk by the way?

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.390
I can see you all smiling.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:13.030
Am I talking too fast?

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.150
One of the results of my stroke
is that I speak too

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.812
fast, and my tongue
gets tripped.

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.670
I trip my tongue, but anyway,
as long as you can hear what

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.970
I'm saying, and I'm being
articulate, that's great.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.720
I can see all your
smiling faces.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.100
Well now, we're getting towards

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.410
the end of our examples.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.420
And I'd love to have
more questions.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.370
In England, the ukulele was very
popular, largely through

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.410
a man called George Formby.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.570
He's a hero in England, an
absolute national hero.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.540
He started recording
in the 1930s.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.150
He made films, Ealing Films,
which were the most popular

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.360
films in the British
box office.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.170
And he made songs
in World War II.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.820
He played a banjo ukulele.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.520
But it looks like a banjo.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.790
It has a much stronger sound.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.510
He had an incredible strum,
which if you go on YouTube,

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.890
you can see people
demonstrate.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.100
It's very, very hard to do.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.600
He had a syncopated strum.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.220
He recorded a lot of politically
incorrect songs.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.079
He was from the north of
England, I should add, the

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.819
same part of the world
as The Beatles.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.920
He had a goofy grin
and big teeth.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.339
He spoke in a North
country accent.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:19.349
He used to say, he's turned
out nice again, he-he-he.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.260
My uncle read some
of his songs.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.990
My uncle wrote the A-side of
this next song, but it didn't

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.950
become a hit.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.880
My uncle wrote "Do
De O Do Blues."

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.420
I hope that wasn't
objectionable.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:32.930
I don't think so.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.060
It's just harmless stuff.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:38.380
But, of course, in those days,
British were so insular they

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.620
didn't care about offending
anybody.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.810
And I guess it's not really
offensive, actually.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.380
But we had our empire.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.820
And we've lost our empire now.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.530
Anyway, it won't excuse this
song, except I think his

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.110
playing is very good.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.850
I hope we have some
more questions.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.630
I've really enjoyed talking
to you all.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.210
I thoroughly approve
of Google.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.475
You're wonderful.

00:17:59.475 --> 00:18:01.730
I wish I understood
the computer more.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.190
I have a terrible trouble
with typing now

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.280
because of my illness.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.700
Every other word is a mistake.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.780
Every other word I type comes
out as a typo, so I have to

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.410
keep going back.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.600
By the way, if you're
interested, I write regularly

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.060
on my website a thing called
"Letter from Lotusland." I've

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.640
done that for 20 years now.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.140
There's even a book out, which
you can get on Amazon, called

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:26.310
"Letters from Lotusland." And
if you just put it into

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.270
Google, just put "Letters from
Lotusland," you'll see Ian

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.860
Whitcomb's "Letter from
Lotusland." And every month, I

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.390
write about what I've
been doing.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.950
People seem to enjoy it
all over the world.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.230
I've talked so much about
myself haven't I?

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.660
But anyway, my wife is
a wonderful singer.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.380
It's on that record, called
"Legends of Ukulele." And once

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:48.590
I was up in Oregon at a folk
festival, and this woman said

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.560
she was going to
play this song.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.660
And I said, I'll play it.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:51.475
She said, no I'd like to it.

00:18:51.475 --> 00:18:53.590
And she sang it in the most
beautiful, straight away.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.823
And I thought it's just the most
wonderful thing if you're

00:18:55.823 --> 00:18:57.620
a songwriter if you're somebody
else you don't know

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.680
sing your songs.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.215
It's just so heartwarming.

00:19:00.215 --> 00:19:02.115
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:02.115 --> 00:19:02.590
IAN WHITCOMB: All right,
thank you.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.880
I just want to say that, since
we're in Venice, I play most

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.920
Sundays at a restaurant in
Playa Del Rey called

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.070
Cantalini's Salerno Beach
Italian Restaurant.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.260
It's very popular.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.330
We play from 6:30 'til
9:30, not every week.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.060
I'll be there this Sunday.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.000
But it's really nice.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.250
Lots of people come to that.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.080
It's a lovely, delightful,
no expensive.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.360
It's a nice little
intimate place.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.900
And I play with Fred Sokolow,
the guy you just heard playing

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.660
the slide guitar and guitar, and
a bass player and myself.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.580
And sometimes Regina
comes down.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:39.310
It's on Culver Boulevard in
Playa Del Rey, a nice part of

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:43.310
the world, Cantalini's, Salerno
Beach, Cantalni's.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.956
AUDIENCE: There's a link
in the Wikipedia entry.

00:19:45.956 --> 00:19:49.050
IAN WHITCOMB: Oh there is?

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.220
Well, if you get a
chance, if you're

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.660
interested, do look me up.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.090
I've got so many things
on YouTube.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.950
It's endless.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:56.970
I hope they stay up there.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.026
Some of them shouldn't be there,
perhaps, but anyway.

00:20:00.026 --> 00:20:02.320
But I'm very happy
to be on YouTube,

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.680
tons and tons of stuff.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.310
And all my books are
available there.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.910
I've written about 18 books.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.970
The one that's the most fun,
I think, is "Letters from

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:15.440
Lotusland," which is on Amazon
and something called Lulu.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.890
So anyway, are there
any questions now?

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.619
I've really enjoyed
talking to you.

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:24.371
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering what you
think about someone like

00:20:24.371 --> 00:20:25.309
Jake Shimabukuro.

00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:26.900
IAN WHITCOMB: Wonderful player,

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.520
Japanese, he's virtuosic.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.700
He doesn't sing.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.780
He's playing the concert,
virtuosic style, which is

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.500
completely different to what
I was playing today.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.670
I was playing the singers
who accompany

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.030
themselves on the uke.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.690
Jake is a wonderful player,
nice fellow.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:46.420
And he's playing the virtuosic,
virtuoso, playing

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.470
tunes on the ukulele, which is
completely different to what I

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.880
was playing.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.630
But, I mean, there's
room for us all.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:54.330
Ukulele is a very versatile
instrument indeed.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.470
Any more questions?

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:56.301
Yes?

00:20:56.301 --> 00:21:03.035
AUDIENCE: Any history of
ukulele in the blues?

00:21:03.035 --> 00:21:04.960
IAN WHITCOMB: I don't think it
lends itself to the blues.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.940
It's too happy and jolly.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.260
It doesn't get blue,
the ukulele.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.490
Although there is a book, Fred
Sokolow's put out a book of

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.340
playing the blues
on the ukulele.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.170
But, to me, it's not really--

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.610
its notes are very
short and sharp.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.240
It doesn't really lend
itself to that.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.590
It's just, you know-

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.830
[UKULELE PLAYING]

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:23.055
IAN WHITCOMB: [SINGING]

00:21:23.055 --> 00:21:27.900
I hate to see, the evening
sun go down.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.930
It's too jolly.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:30.650
an instrument.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.410
Anyway, any more questions?

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:32.905
Yes?

00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:36.720
AUDIENCE: I have a text from
my cousin in Miami who is a

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.520
ukulele player, which is one of
the reasons I actually came

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.970
today, because he oftentimes
will bring it to family

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.350
gatherings and that
sort of thing.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.750
And he says, probably too late
now, just thank him for me for

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.896
bringing the uke to
so many folks.

00:21:47.896 --> 00:21:48.470
IAN WHITCOMB: Oh, how good.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:49.660
That's nice to hear that.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.303
AUDIENCE: And he has a YouTube
video he wants me to share

00:21:52.303 --> 00:21:54.190
with you later.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.430
IAN WHITCOMB: Well, in my own
small way, I'm quite popular

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.430
throughout the world.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.100
I mean, I've done
so many things.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.480
By the way, what we didn't
mention was I produced a CD

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.820
which won a Grammy of the
music played aboard the

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.950
"Titanic," which
is a lovely CD.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.190
I decided that I'd worked on
the James Cameron film.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.550
I knew he'd got it all
wrong at the end.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.360
They did not play "Nearer, My
God, to Thee" at the end.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.940
If a ship is sinking,
you don't play that.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.960
You play something
jolly and happy.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.160
So they actually played a song
called "Songe d'Automne." So I

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.820
went to Rhino Records, and I
said, look, why don't we make

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.650
a record to come out the same
time as "Titanic," the film.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.380
We will have the music that
was actually played

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.060
aboard the real ship.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.460
James Cameron was furious.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.000
But our record did extremely
well and won a Grammy Award.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.680
It's a lovely record called
"Titanic, Music as Played on

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.420
the Fateful Voyage."

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.690
So I've done many,
many things.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.620
I've even, believe it or
not, been in films.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.650
You can see me in the film
"Contact." I played a BBC

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.450
reporter in that.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:51.700
I did the music for "The Cat's
Meow" for Peter Bogdanovich.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.980
And other films which
we won't mention.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.610
But I do act.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.390
I do all these things.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.940
Write my books.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.160
But right now I'm sort
of just trying

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.350
to get better, recovery.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.520
But I've really enjoyed talking
to you all today.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.010
So nice to see your
happy faces.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.630
Hope you've enjoyed it too.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:07.340
Any more questions?

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.150
Do we have time still?

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:08.933
AUDIENCE: You did a
couple different

00:23:08.933 --> 00:23:12.671
styles of ukulele playing.

00:23:12.671 --> 00:23:16.800
I was wondering, since you
mentioned the slide guitar

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.120
starting out in Hawaii.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.880
IAN WHITCOMB: Yes, well
that was Hawaiian.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.190
That was my friend Fred was
playing a dobro guitar.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.140
But the earlier Hawaiian
recording was a regular guitar

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.900
which they tuned to open
strings, and then he slid a

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.520
metal bar along.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.870
That really was a Hawaiian
invention, not from blues at

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.410
all, but from Hawaii.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:41.568
AUDIENCE: Did that change how
people played the ukulele?

00:23:41.568 --> 00:23:42.970
IAN WHITCOMB: No, I think they
just strummed along.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.530
I think it's important, when
you've got a slide guitar

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.260
playing, you really have
to have the ukulele

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.760
play a steady rhythm.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.680
Otherwise it all gets thrown.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.020
You have to have them play
a steady rhythm.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.040
I used to have a very
good strum.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.670
I'm sure it'll come
back in time.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:57.890
But my strum's a bit rudimentary
right now.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.870
I'm playing this weekend at a
place that's near Cantalina's.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.490
It's called Boulevard Music.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.720
It's a folk place.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.470
With Janet Klein and
her Parlor Boys.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:08.880
I'm one of her Parlor Boys.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.026
I'm a bit old to be
a boy, but still.

00:24:11.026 --> 00:24:13.150
I still play a lot.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:17.836
I still play all over the place
with my radio shows.

00:24:17.836 --> 00:24:19.920
I can see somebody's bursting
with a question.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.340
Are you?

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.860
I hope you've all
enjoyed today.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.633
Yes?

00:24:23.633 --> 00:24:25.445
AUDIENCE: I've asked this from
several who we've spoke to,

00:24:25.445 --> 00:24:28.140
what do you want to do
when you grow up?

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.770
IAN WHITCOMB: I never
did grow up.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.560
I've never had a proper job.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.320
By the way, I went to university
at Trinity College

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.060
in Dublin, which I believe
Google has a big base there

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.880
now in the tallest building in
Dublin, which was not there

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.310
when I was- I was there
from 1961 to '65.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.080
And Dublin then was a
very old-fashioned,

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.970
priest-ridden country.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.930
It was run by the
Catholic church.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:51.390
You couldn't have

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.020
contraceptives there, for example.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.780
So it was still set in
the 18th century.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.800
It was very nice.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.330
The buildings were all
exactly the same.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:00.585
The pubs were very
old-fashioned.

00:25:00.585 --> 00:25:03.380
You'd watch the man pouring your
Guiness, and it was an

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.400
art form skimming the top
of the foam off the top.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.340
Pouring a Guiness was
really an art form.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.740
Dublin was a completely
different place then.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.740
If you went to see a film
there, you used to have

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.030
commissionaires, men in uniform,
standing outside.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.590
And there were always lines
for films in those days

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.010
because everybody wanted
to see films.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:25.620
And the films were all censored
so they couldn't have

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.390
anything that had sex in it.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.340
And so whenever there was a cut
in the film, the audience

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.740
would shout out, snip! snip!

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.720
Because they thought
it'd been cut.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.250
It was a very old-fashioned
country.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.110
In some ways wonderful,
many ways.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.050
But I had a wonderful time
there, spent most of my time

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.650
in pubs and bars.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:48.810
I took a history degree there
in modern history,

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.400
which ended in 1914.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.450
Went from the fall of the
Roman Empire to 1914.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.810
And political science, didn't
learn much from that.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.380
Most of the time I was playing
in bands in Dublin.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.690
But I had a wonderful
time in Dublin.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.880
And my best friends
I met there.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.310
I really loved Ireland.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.710
I still do.

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.190
I'm going back there in
August to play at

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.750
ukulele hulee there.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.340
Why they've hired me I
don't know because I

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:13.740
can't play very well.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.240
But they're very kind
to me there.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.730
And that's where I made my first
record, which became the

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.170
hit, top 10 hit.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.423
In Ireland, it was the first
Irish-made record to ever get

00:26:22.423 --> 00:26:24.350
into the charts, which means
there's a link between Ian

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.690
Whitcomb and U2.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:29.150
I don't think they like
that connection much.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:29.888
Yes?

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:36.470
AUDIENCE: How hard is
it for a guitar

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.850
player to play the ukulele?

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.900
IAN WHITCOMB: It'd be
going backwards.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.620
It's much simpler to play.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.410
It's much simpler than playing
guitar to get a basic strum

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.550
and find those figures.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.210
It's easy.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.310
That's why so many people- there
are clubs all over Los

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.970
Angeles, I go to them.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.370
And they meet once a week,
these strummers.

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:58.540
And they all sit there, and they
play every kind of song

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.960
from "Bridge Over Troubled
Water" to whatever.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.230
And they sit there and they
strum and they sing.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.890
It's a joyous sight to see.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.330
The ukulele brings nothing
but smiles.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.810
It's a really happy
instrument.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:12.460
I love it.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.880
I've had some very happy moments
playing the ukulele

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.810
and writing songs.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.620
I still write songs.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.790
I mean, songwriting
is really what I'm

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:20.740
interested in most of all.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.680
But when I say songwriting, I
mean songs that have proper

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.860
tunes and words.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:28.240
I know I sound old-fashioned,
but I can't get along with the

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.490
rap today and hip hop
because it doesn't

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.010
need to have any tunes.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:36.750
I mean, if you want to analyze
rap, Winston Churchill was

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.300
actually a rapper because he
just spoke without tunes.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.780
We shall fight them
on the beaches.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.300
I mean, that's rapping too.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.910
He rapped.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:47.640
FDR rapped, too.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.070
The only thing we have to
fear is fear itself.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.020
That's rapping, really.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.820
But rapping has nothing
to do songwriting,

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.240
that's what I'm saying.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.860
It may be saying some
important things.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.190
I'm not against it from that.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.410
But the point is it's nothing
to do with music.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.500
And I've said enough opinions.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.320
And I'm sure I've shocked
you all today.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.770
I'm a man of many opinions.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.110
Thank you very much indeed.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:11.690
And don't forget, help
yourself to the

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.940
books and the CDs.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.610
Anything on stage except my
uke is for you, thank you.
