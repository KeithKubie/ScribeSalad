know an identification identity that we

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
know an identification identity that we
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.160
know an identification identity that we
have also with movie stars that say or

also you know we we talk about breaking

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
also you know we we talk about breaking
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.520
also you know we we talk about breaking
down the barriers of how scientists

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
down the barriers of how scientists
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.370
down the barriers of how scientists
versus who's cool and who's not cool or

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380

barriers or I would say the men we take

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
barriers or I would say the men we take
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.800
barriers or I would say the men we take
up and we take advantage of the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810
up and we take advantage of the
 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.950
up and we take advantage of the
opportunity that a scientists can also

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
opportunity that a scientists can also
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.260

be a rock star or a rock star hit also
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.410
be a rock star or a rock star hit also
be really interested in science and

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420
be really interested in science and

things are just you know be it's become
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.080
things are just you know be it's become
more commonplace I think science will we

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
more commonplace I think science will we
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.620
more commonplace I think science will we
will just naturally become more litter

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630
will just naturally become more litter
 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.650
will just naturally become more litter
in science because its intrinsic to us I

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.930
don't know much about sort of the allow

college and he could have completely
 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.500
college and he could have completely
gone on and become a great physicist but

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
gone on and become a great physicist but
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.600
gone on and become a great physicist but
he decided to you know again to public

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610
he decided to you know again to public
 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.630
he decided to you know again to public
service and and you know you were

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.750
but and also that you can easily study

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760
but and also that you can easily study
 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.580
but and also that you can easily study
science but you can do other things and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590
science but you can do other things and
 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.110
science but you can do other things and
it would be very useful to what you do

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120
it would be very useful to what you do
 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.270
it would be very useful to what you do
and it's never too late to become a

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280
and it's never too late to become a
 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.980
and it's never too late to become a
scientist for example that's what I

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990
scientist for example that's what I
 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.740
scientist for example that's what I
really

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750
 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.140

think the we need to continue to relate
 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.900
think the we need to continue to relate
the the world after school that these

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910
the the world after school that these
 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.650
the the world after school that these
kids experience to what to science that

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660
kids experience to what to science that
 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.230
kids experience to what to science that
they they learn in school so and we also

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240
they they learn in school so and we also
 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.670
they they learn in school so and we also
need to show these kids that like role

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680
need to show these kids that like role
 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.520
need to show these kids that like role
models scientists that look like them

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530
models scientists that look like them
 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.920
models scientists that look like them
that act like them maybe or you know you

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930
that act like them maybe or you know you
 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.830

could be a brilliant potential scientist

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840
could be a brilliant potential scientist
 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.720
could be a brilliant potential scientist
as a young person but you may not

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730
as a young person but you may not
 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.310
as a young person but you may not
necessarily have the personality traits

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320
necessarily have the personality traits
 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.590

that stereotype that that a scientist

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600
that stereotype that that a scientist
 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.750
that stereotype that that a scientist
should have that all you see on on the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760
should have that all you see on on the
 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.330
should have that all you see on on the
movies and I think that these things are

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340
movies and I think that these things are
 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.030
movies and I think that these things are
slowly changing but more the more we

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040
slowly changing but more the more we
 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.860
slowly changing but more the more we
start breaking down the what a scientist

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870
start breaking down the what a scientist
 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.680
start breaking down the what a scientist
looks like acolyte think like the better

job will do at the level of primary
school module of course resources and we

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520
school module of course resources and we
 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.950
school module of course resources and we
need to continue putting the resources

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960
need to continue putting the resources
 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.200
need to continue putting the resources
in there one thing I should I did we

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210
in there one thing I should I did we

when he was he did research for some law

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060
when he was he did research for some law
 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.000
when he was he did research for some law
professor when he was at Harvard where

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010
professor when he was at Harvard where
 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.280
professor when he was at Harvard where
he sort of was you know the student I

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290
he sort of was you know the student I
 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.930

was leading the project for this

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940
was leading the project for this
 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.820

professor and they connected Einstein's

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830
professor and they connected Einstein's
 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.460
professor and they connected Einstein's
theory of general relativity to the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470
theory of general relativity to the
 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.040
theory of general relativity to the
legal sphere and apparently that paper

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050
legal sphere and apparently that paper
 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.320
legal sphere and apparently that paper
is out and so I found out really

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330
is out and so I found out really
 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.730
is out and so I found out really
interested in that you know he had to go

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740
interested in that you know he had to go
 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.780
interested in that you know he had to go
and teach himself a little bit of

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790
and teach himself a little bit of
 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.969
and teach himself a little bit of
appreciate general relativity to help

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979
appreciate general relativity to help
 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.250
appreciate general relativity to help
this professor write this paper so I'm

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260
this professor write this paper so I'm
 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.320

hoping that you know candidates like

the high level would actually start

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840
the high level would actually start
 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.850
the high level would actually start
investing into into science literacy

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860
investing into into science literacy
 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.580
