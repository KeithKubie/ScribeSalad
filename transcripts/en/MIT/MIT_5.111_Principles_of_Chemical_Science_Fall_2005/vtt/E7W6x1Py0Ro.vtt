00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.957
Okay.
We are starting in on the last

00:00:17.957 --> 00:00:20.492
unit.
And so we are going to be

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:24.802
talking about kinetics for the
rest of the semester.

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:29.535
The last class is a bit of a
review of everything we have

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:33.000
done, but this is the last
topic.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.370
And it is mostly in Chapter 13,
but there is a little bit in

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.222
Chapter 17.
If you notice,

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:42.259
on your problem set,
the VSEPR is covered,

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:45.962
which is in Chapter 3,
transition metals in Chapter

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:50.111
16, kinetics in Chapter 13,
and some nuclear chemistry in

00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:53.148
Chapter 17.
We were jumping back and forth

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:57.148
between several different
chapters in this last part of

00:00:57.148 --> 00:01:01.447
the course.
Rates of chemical reactions and

00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:04.210
rate loss.
Today is the introductory

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.921
lecture to rates,
and we will introduce you to a

00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:10.605
lot of terms that you need to
know.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:12.894
All right.
Chemical reactions.

00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:17.631
In addition to asking whether
the reaction is likely to go as

00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:20.631
it is written,
which is a thermodynamic

00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:25.447
question, we also want to know
how fast that reaction will go.

00:01:25.447 --> 00:01:30.645
Kinetics is rates of reaction.
That is what it is.

00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:35.148
And a kinetic experiment
measures the rate at which a

00:01:35.148 --> 00:01:39.997
concentration of a substance
taking place in the chemical

00:01:39.997 --> 00:01:44.846
reaction changes with time.
You are talking about changes

00:01:44.846 --> 00:01:48.050
in concentration with changes in
time.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.513
Let's take a look at a chemical
reaction.

00:01:51.513 --> 00:01:55.930
This is the oxidation of
glucose, glucose and oxygen

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.000
going to carbon dioxide and
water.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.758
As professor Ceyer told you in
the first part of the course,

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:09.354
this is the reason why we eat.
We need glucose for energy.

00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:13.790
This is what drives our bodies.
This is how we make ATP,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.258
which is our source of energy
in our bodies.

00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:21.854
This is the reason why we eat.
Oxygen is the reason why we

00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:22.903
what?
Breathe.

00:02:22.903 --> 00:02:25.725
CO two is the reason
why we?

00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:30.000
Exhale.
And water is the reason why we?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.594
Yes.
You know this reaction quite

00:02:32.594 --> 00:02:35.270
well, a really important
reaction.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.810
Professor Ceyer told you about
the thermodynamics of this

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.486
reaction.
She talked about delta G

00:02:42.486 --> 00:02:45.567
nought.
And delta G nought equals what?

00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:50.027
Delta H minus T delta S.
And so you can consider sort of

00:02:50.027 --> 00:02:54.081
what you get out of this
reaction, how spontaneous,

00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:57.324
how favorable it is,
considering delta G,

00:02:57.324 --> 00:03:03.000
which depends on the value of
delta H and the delta S.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.902
And, of course,
also what temperature the

00:03:06.902 --> 00:03:09.341
reaction is.
In this case,

00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:12.658
delta H is a large negative
number.

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:16.658
What type of reaction is that?
Exothermic.

00:03:16.658 --> 00:03:21.829
Delta S nought is positive,
so that is very favorable.

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.243
You always want to increase
entropy.

00:03:25.243 --> 00:03:31.000
And so delta G is a very large
negative number.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.744
This is a thermodynamically
very favorable reaction.

00:03:35.744 --> 00:03:39.744
If that is true,
if you have glucose around,

00:03:39.744 --> 00:03:44.953
one might expect that when the
glucose is sitting in air,

00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:49.883
in oxygen, that it would be
forming CO two and

00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:52.860
water.
This is a really favorable

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.488
reaction.
I brought some glucose with me

00:03:56.488 --> 00:04:00.729
today to class.
In here there are some

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.503
Hershey's Kisses.
There is chocolate and there is

00:04:04.503 --> 00:04:07.412
sugar.
This is all sealed up away from

00:04:07.412 --> 00:04:09.614
oxygen.
But according to this

00:04:09.614 --> 00:04:12.208
thermodynamics,
if I open this up,

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:14.960
this is a really favorable
reaction.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.442
Air will enter the bag and CO
two should come out.

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:23.845
I am going to open this up,
and we will see what happens.

00:04:23.845 --> 00:04:28.484
Of course, if you did this on
your own, safety glasses might

00:04:28.484 --> 00:04:31.712
be a good idea.
All right.

00:04:31.712 --> 00:04:34.064
I don't really see much
happening.

00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:36.701
All right.
Let's observe this reaction

00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:38.981
over time.
What I want you to do,

00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:43.186
the TAs are going to hand this
out, and during the course of

00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:47.105
the lecture I want you to
carefully study your Hershey's

00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:49.528
Kiss.
[LAUGHTER] And let me know at

00:04:49.528 --> 00:04:53.804
the end if you observe any CO
two coming off of this.

00:04:53.804 --> 00:04:56.868
And we will watch one up here
at some point.

00:04:56.868 --> 00:05:02.000
Christine has one up here,
which we can take a look at.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.567
All right.
You can help me with this

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:16.747
experiment during the course of
the class.

00:05:16.747 --> 00:05:19.601
Okay.
This brings up a point.

00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:24.495
It is thermodynamically
favorable, yet we are not

00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:27.757
observing the reaction
happening.

00:05:27.757 --> 00:05:32.162
Why is that?
Well, it is favorable,

00:05:32.162 --> 00:05:35.799
but it's slow.
Thermodynamics are very

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:39.927
important, but that is not the
whole story.

00:05:39.927 --> 00:05:45.136
Rate or kinetics is also a very
important part of what

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:51.132
determines whether you are going
to be observing this reaction

00:05:51.132 --> 00:05:53.000
happening.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.916
As these are being handed out,
let's just consider these two

00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:08.666
terms for a moment.
This is going back to what

00:06:08.666 --> 00:06:13.416
Professor Ceyer talked about,
and these are actually right

00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:18.166
out of one of her handouts.
She told you about things that

00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:22.083
are stable or unstable.
If you are talking about

00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:25.916
stable-unstable,
you are talking about delta G,

00:06:25.916 --> 00:06:30.000
you are talking about
thermodynamics.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.321
The thermodynamic tendency to
decompose.

00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.961
But that is not the whole
story.

00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:40.049
You also have to consider
whether it is labile or

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:43.200
non-labile, also referred to as
inert.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.629
And that refers to the rate.
And so that is kinetics.

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:52.568
The reaction that we talked
about, it might be that glucose

00:06:52.568 --> 00:06:56.060
is unstable.
Thermodynamically it wants to

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.000
decompose, but it is also fairly
non-labile.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.858
The rate at which it happens is
very slow.

00:07:03.858 --> 00:07:07.831
I think that most likely at the
end, and we have done this

00:07:07.831 --> 00:07:11.805
experiment before in class,
no one has observed any CO two.

00:07:11.805 --> 00:07:14.175
But somehow the chocolate,

00:07:14.175 --> 00:07:17.521
by the end of the class,
seems to have gone away.

00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:21.704
[LAUGHTER] But yet there is no
evidence of the water that has

00:07:21.704 --> 00:07:24.423
formed, so it is a little bit
confusing.

00:07:24.423 --> 00:07:27.211
In any case,
these are important terms to

00:07:27.211 --> 00:07:30.000
know.
Rate is important.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.076
And just as another example in
terms of rate being important,

00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:39.561
someone might say to you that
you could make 5 million

00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:42.353
dollars.
Again, rate is important.

00:07:42.353 --> 00:07:46.838
Will you make that 5 million
dollars in the next year,

00:07:46.838 --> 00:07:51.661
or would you have to life to an
age of 1562 to make that 5

00:07:51.661 --> 00:07:55.046
million dollars?
Rate at which things are

00:07:55.046 --> 00:07:58.515
happening is very important.
In this case,

00:07:58.515 --> 00:08:03.000
this reaction has to go to some
degree.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.433
Because this is how we make
energy to live.

00:08:06.433 --> 00:08:10.276
This is really slow,
but your body is using this

00:08:10.276 --> 00:08:13.874
reaction to get energy.
How does that happen?

00:08:13.874 --> 00:08:17.308
Well, it happens because there
are enzymes.

00:08:17.308 --> 00:08:20.169
In the body,
it must be fast enough.

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:24.666
The body uses catalysts,
enzymes, proteins that catalyze

00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:29.000
the reaction.
They speed up the reaction.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.957
And that is what allows this
reaction to work as your source

00:08:34.957 --> 00:08:38.996
of energy.
We will consider catalysts and

00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:45.055
enzymes a little later in this
unit, but that is an important

00:08:45.055 --> 00:08:48.488
point.
Let's talk about some of the

00:08:48.488 --> 00:08:52.022
factors affecting rates of
reaction.

00:08:52.022 --> 00:08:57.879
What are some factors that
would affect how fast a reaction

00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:00.000
would go?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.585
Temperature?
Did someone say heat or

00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:20.127
temperature?
What else might affect rates?

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:23.000
Concentration.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.298
What about the one that was
just up on that slide,

00:09:31.298 --> 00:09:35.000
about how the oxidation of
glucose works on the body?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.747
Use of catalyst.
Okay, a couple other things.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:47.801
Nature of material and
mechanism, which we are going to

00:09:47.801 --> 00:09:54.072
be talking about.
In the next few lectures we are

00:09:54.072 --> 00:09:59.036
going to be considering
concentrations,

00:09:59.036 --> 00:10:04.000
nature of material,
mechanism.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.240
And toward the end we are going
to talk about temperature and

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.192
catalyst.
That is where we are going in

00:10:14.192 --> 00:10:18.248
this unit.
And how they all affect rates

00:10:18.248 --> 00:10:22.823
of reactions.
First, we have to introduce you

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:30.000
to some terms and talk about
measuring the rates of reaction.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.398
Here we have a reaction of NO
two gas,

00:10:33.398 --> 00:10:36.872
CO, carbon monoxide,
NO gas and CO two,

00:10:36.872 --> 00:10:40.270
carbon dioxide,
which we just mentioned before

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.895
in the last example.

00:10:43.895 --> 00:10:47.596
Suppose you were
measuring a rate of this

00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:50.843
particular reaction.
You could, for example,

00:10:50.843 --> 00:10:54.468
plot the change in
concentration of NO gas versus

00:10:54.468 --> 00:10:56.734
time.
You are forming NO as the

00:10:56.734 --> 00:11:01.605
reaction goes.
You are considering the rate of

00:11:01.605 --> 00:11:05.302
the reaction.
You are looking at how much you

00:11:05.302 --> 00:11:07.991
form in a certain amount of
time.

00:11:07.991 --> 00:11:11.605
Here might be what the data
would look like.

00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:15.134
As time goes on,
you would see an increase.

00:11:15.134 --> 00:11:17.739
And then it starts to level
off.

00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:22.697
You can consider the average
rate, which would be defined as

00:11:22.697 --> 00:11:27.319
some change in concentration
over a particular change in

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:31.466
time.
You could express that as the

00:11:31.466 --> 00:11:35.719
change or delta of the
concentration of NO over the

00:11:35.719 --> 00:11:39.546
change in time,
delta time, and you could pick

00:11:39.546 --> 00:11:43.033
some places and calculate an
average rate.

00:11:43.033 --> 00:11:47.881
You could draw lines over,
two different concentrations at

00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:52.134
two different times,
and calculate what the rate is

00:11:52.134 --> 00:11:55.961
in that interval.
We can do that average rate,

00:11:55.961 --> 00:12:02.000
two different concentrations at
those two different times.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.021
Change in concentration over
change in time.

00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:08.745
And that gives you a value.
But this average rate then

00:12:08.745 --> 00:12:11.205
depends on the time interval
chosen.

00:12:11.205 --> 00:12:15.210
It is going to be a different
rate here than it might have

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:19.216
been down here or up here.
That tells you maybe something,

00:12:19.216 --> 00:12:23.291
but it doesn't necessarily tell
you all the things that are

00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:28.000
going on, because it just
depends on a particular area.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.697
Instead of considering average
rate, you can start talking

00:12:32.697 --> 00:12:37.230
about instantaneous rate,
the rate at a particular time.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.950
And so that is instantaneous
rate.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:44.895
And so you are really wanting
to know, what does the rate say

00:12:44.895 --> 00:12:48.439
at 150 seconds?
At that particular moment in

00:12:48.439 --> 00:12:52.972
time, what was the rate?
Here you are just talking about

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:58.000
the limit as that change in time
approaches zero.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.483
And that can also be expressed
in terms of d concentration of

00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:08.509
NO dt, so the change in
concentration of NO with time at

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:12.347
a particular moment.
As that change in time

00:13:12.347 --> 00:13:16.368
approaches zero,
the rate becomes the same as

00:13:16.368 --> 00:13:22.216
the slope of the line tangent to
that particular point in time at

00:13:22.216 --> 00:13:25.597
time t, the one you are
interested in.

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:30.532
And so, say we will find this
instantaneous rate at 150

00:13:30.532 --> 00:13:34.570
seconds here.
We can do that,

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.920
the rate at that particular
time.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:43.992
We are going to draw a line
tangent to the curve and figure

00:13:43.992 --> 00:13:48.389
out the slope of that line.
We can do that,

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:52.996
find the slope,
get some different points and

00:13:52.996 --> 00:13:59.277
look at the instantaneous rate.
We can calculate the slope of

00:13:59.277 --> 00:14:04.655
that line here.
And come up with a rate.

00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:07.200
In this case,
7.7x10^-5.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.176
And this is in molar per
second, which is a common unit

00:14:13.176 --> 00:14:14.725
for rate.
Okay.

00:14:14.725 --> 00:14:20.590
That tells us about a
particular instantaneous rate at

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:25.016
one given time.
And an important thing to

00:14:25.016 --> 00:14:30.474
consider is initial rate.
And so that is the

00:14:30.474 --> 00:14:35.226
instantaneous rate at time
equals zero, the initial rate of

00:14:35.226 --> 00:14:38.421
the reaction.
That is a little bit about

00:14:38.421 --> 00:14:41.944
measuring rates.
And we will talk more about

00:14:41.944 --> 00:14:46.696
plotting data when you are
trying to get rate constants and

00:14:46.696 --> 00:14:49.236
other factors.
Rate expressions.

00:14:49.236 --> 00:14:52.431
We can express the rate of the
reaction.

00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:56.855
When we are measuring a
reaction, you can often pick to

00:14:56.855 --> 00:15:03.000
measure the increase in the
amount of products being formed.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.742
You can also consider the
decrease in the amount of

00:15:06.742 --> 00:15:10.110
reactants, so you can measure
rate either way,

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.928
looking for disappearance or
looking for appearance.

00:15:13.928 --> 00:15:18.194
And often decisions about how
you are going to measure the

00:15:18.194 --> 00:15:22.835
rate depend on how easy it is to
measure a change in something.

00:15:22.835 --> 00:15:28.000
There are usually practical
considerations that go on here.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.404
Then, the rate can be expressed
in terms of the disappearance of

00:15:33.404 --> 00:15:36.922
one of the reactants,
here NO two.

00:15:36.922 --> 00:15:41.126
The rate is going to depend on
how fast that it is

00:15:41.126 --> 00:15:44.557
disappearing,
or the disappearance of the

00:15:44.557 --> 00:15:48.418
second reactant over here,
and the appearance,

00:15:48.418 --> 00:15:52.621
then, of one of the products or
the other product.

00:15:52.621 --> 00:15:56.997
And this, of course,
is only true if we assume there

00:15:56.997 --> 00:16:02.193
are no intermediates.
Because sometimes the rate at

00:16:02.193 --> 00:16:06.959
which a reactant will disappear
will not be the same as the rate

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:11.725
at which it will appear because
there are lots of steps involved

00:16:11.725 --> 00:16:14.751
in between.
This comes back to mechanism,

00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:17.929
which we are going to talk
about next week,

00:16:17.929 --> 00:16:21.333
but this is what is known as
rate expressions.

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:25.115
Let's look at an example.
Here you have a reaction,

00:16:25.115 --> 00:16:28.444
two HI gas going to H two gas
plus I two gas.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.963
The rate could be considered in
terms of the disappearance of

00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:40.603
the reactant.
And here, we see that for every

00:16:40.603 --> 00:16:44.987
two HI that disappears,
that is decomposed we have one

00:16:44.987 --> 00:16:47.717
H two and one I two.

00:16:47.717 --> 00:16:51.440
If we are going to set up our
rate expression,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.824
we are going to have to
multiply this term by one-half

00:16:55.824 --> 00:17:00.705
if it is going to be equal to
the rate at which H two

00:17:00.705 --> 00:17:06.000
appears or the rate at which I
two appears.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.442
The stoichiometry here matters.
If you just looked at the rate

00:17:11.442 --> 00:17:15.903
of disappearance of HI,
it wouldn't be equal to how

00:17:15.903 --> 00:17:20.453
fast that is forming,
because two are going away for

00:17:20.453 --> 00:17:24.111
every one of each of these that
is formed.

00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:28.304
Then, in general,
you would write the expression

00:17:28.304 --> 00:17:32.428
this way.
Minus one over A,

00:17:32.428 --> 00:17:41.428
where A is the stoichiometry of
reactant A, dA dt minus one over

00:17:41.428 --> 00:17:48.714
B dB dt plus one over C dC dt
plus one over D dD dt,

00:17:48.714 --> 00:17:55.428
that is hard to say.
Those are rate expressions.

00:17:55.428 --> 00:18:00.000
Now we come to rate laws.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.476
A rate law is the relationship
between rates and

00:18:10.476 --> 00:18:14.285
concentrations.
And those are going to be

00:18:14.285 --> 00:18:19.333
related by a proportionality
constant called little k,

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:22.095
rate constant.
Big K was what?

00:18:22.095 --> 00:18:26.476
Equilibrium constant.
And now we have little k,

00:18:26.476 --> 00:18:31.997
which is the rate constant.
A rate law is going to tell you

00:18:31.997 --> 00:18:35.284
how the rate depends on the
things in the reactions.

00:18:35.284 --> 00:18:38.763
There will be a rate constant,
and there is going to be

00:18:38.763 --> 00:18:42.050
concentration terms.
And it has to be experimentally

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.852
determined what that rate law
is, unless it is an elementary

00:18:45.852 --> 00:18:49.138
reaction, and we will come to
that in a few minutes.

00:18:49.138 --> 00:18:52.167
Suppose you have this
particular reaction going.

00:18:52.167 --> 00:18:57.000
Your rate law would have some
expression that looks like this.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.887
It would have rate equals the
rate constant,

00:19:00.887 --> 00:19:04.050
little k, times some
concentrations.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:08.118
And here, we are raised to the
M and to the N,

00:19:08.118 --> 00:19:12.457
and those are known as the
order of the reaction.

00:19:12.457 --> 00:19:16.254
And so M is the order of the
reaction in A,

00:19:16.254 --> 00:19:19.779
and N is the order of the
reaction in B.

00:19:19.779 --> 00:19:22.943
And little k,
of course, is the rate

00:19:22.943 --> 00:19:26.378
constant.
How do you know what terms to

00:19:26.378 --> 00:19:31.252
put in there?
And how do you know what the

00:19:31.252 --> 00:19:35.675
order of the reaction is?
Well, these are experimentally

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:39.053
determined.
The rate law is an experimental

00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:42.109
result.
And you just cannot look at the

00:19:42.109 --> 00:19:46.453
stoichiometry of the reaction
and predict the rate law,

00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:49.268
unless it is an elementary
reaction.

00:19:49.268 --> 00:19:53.932
And so, when you are designing
mechanisms, you are creating

00:19:53.932 --> 00:19:59.000
steps in mechanisms that are
elementary reactions.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.460
And then you can write the rate
law based on the stoichiometry.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.345
And so you will be told this is
an elementary reaction,

00:20:07.345 --> 00:20:10.294
and that is fine.
That will be a step in a

00:20:10.294 --> 00:20:12.021
reaction.
But, otherwise,

00:20:12.021 --> 00:20:15.187
unless you know it is an
elementary reaction,

00:20:15.187 --> 00:20:19.287
you cannot just assume the
stoichiometry is going to work.

00:20:19.287 --> 00:20:23.604
And there will be experimental
evidence to indicate the order

00:20:23.604 --> 00:20:26.913
of the reaction.
Rate laws are not just limited

00:20:26.913 --> 00:20:31.527
to reactants.
Sometimes product terms will

00:20:31.527 --> 00:20:34.687
appear.
You might see terms for C or

00:20:34.687 --> 00:20:37.937
for D, the products of the
reactions.

00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:42.090
And the order of the reactants
can be integers,

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.888
fractions, negative or
positive.

00:20:44.888 --> 00:20:50.034
Again, the order would be
experimentally determined unless

00:20:50.034 --> 00:20:55.451
it is an elementary reaction.
Let's look at various orders of

00:20:55.451 --> 00:21:00.687
reactions and consider how you
would write the rate law and

00:21:00.687 --> 00:21:06.104
also how you would figure out
what was going on with the rate

00:21:06.104 --> 00:21:09.726
law.
And the way the experiments are

00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:12.176
done is if you,
say, double the concentration

00:21:12.176 --> 00:21:15.071
of something and then look at
the effect of the rate,

00:21:15.071 --> 00:21:18.245
that is how you are going to
figure out experimentally the

00:21:18.245 --> 00:21:21.141
order of the reaction,
what effect it has if you keep

00:21:21.141 --> 00:21:23.480
everything else constant.
Double one thing,

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.320
what happens to the rate?
Then try doubling the next

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.438
thing, keeping everything
constant, and you would come up

00:21:29.438 --> 00:21:33.932
with the order of the reaction.
Most of this is blank.

00:21:33.932 --> 00:21:38.498
There are a couple of things
written in your handout,

00:21:38.498 --> 00:21:42.713
but most of it is blank,
so let's fill it all in.

00:21:42.713 --> 00:21:47.543
We will start up here with M
equals one, which is called

00:21:47.543 --> 00:21:50.968
first order.
For something that is first

00:21:50.968 --> 00:21:54.920
order, the rate would be k,
the rate constant,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:00.014
times the concentration of A.
And so this is M is the order

00:22:00.014 --> 00:22:05.454
of the reaction in A.
That would be your rate law.

00:22:05.454 --> 00:22:09.750
And so you can put a little one
there if you want,

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:13.168
but it is implied.
That is the rate law.

00:22:13.168 --> 00:22:18.253
Now let's think about if you
double the concentration of A,

00:22:18.253 --> 00:22:22.461
with this rate law,
what would happen to the rate

00:22:22.461 --> 00:22:25.266
of the reaction?
It would double.

00:22:25.266 --> 00:22:28.422
All right.
Let's look at second order

00:22:28.422 --> 00:22:31.344
then.
M equals two,

00:22:31.344 --> 00:22:34.965
second order.
This would be written,

00:22:34.965 --> 00:22:40.344
rate constant k times the
concentration of A squared,

00:22:40.344 --> 00:22:43.758
the second order,
so M equals two.

00:22:43.758 --> 00:22:47.172
Now, if you double the

00:22:47.172 --> 00:22:51.206
concentration,
what happens to the rate?

00:22:51.206 --> 00:22:54.517
It quadruples.
If you tripled the

00:22:54.517 --> 00:23:00.000
concentration,
what happens to the rate?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.191
You had nine times.
These are the kinds of problems

00:23:03.191 --> 00:23:05.744
that you will get.
Someone will give you,

00:23:05.744 --> 00:23:09.255
in a problem set or on a test
or in real life sometimes,

00:23:09.255 --> 00:23:12.574
a whole bunch of data,
it will talk about doubling or

00:23:12.574 --> 00:23:16.659
tripling concentrations and then
there is the affect on the rate,

00:23:16.659 --> 00:23:20.234
that is how the rate changed.
Then you can figure out the

00:23:20.234 --> 00:23:22.851
order of the reaction.
Let's go down here,

00:23:22.851 --> 00:23:26.297
now, M equals minus one.
I don't think this has a name.

00:23:26.297 --> 00:23:29.489
I don't know what the name is,
if it does have one,

00:23:29.489 --> 00:23:33.000
but we can write the rate law
for it.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.558
The rate equals rate constant
times the concentration of A to

00:23:39.558 --> 00:23:44.040
the minus one.
M up here is

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.412
minus one.
Let's think about what happens

00:23:48.412 --> 00:23:53.113
if we double the concentration
in this case.

00:23:53.113 --> 00:24:00.000
What would happen to the rate?
You would half the rate.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.350
It can also be a fraction.
You can have M equals minus

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.977
one-half, and that is shown
here.

00:24:06.977 --> 00:24:12.149
You would write that as k times
the concentration of A raised to

00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:15.843
minus one-half.
If you double

00:24:15.843 --> 00:24:20.768
the concentration of A in this
case, what would happen to the

00:24:20.768 --> 00:24:22.000
rate?

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.278
It would be 0.7x2.0^(-1/2).
Some of these get a little

00:24:32.278 --> 00:24:36.798
complicated in seeing the
patterns when you are analyzing

00:24:36.798 --> 00:24:39.865
the data.
Some are more straightforward

00:24:39.865 --> 00:24:44.789
than others, but the ones where
it is a negative in a fraction

00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:49.228
are a little more complicated to
observe what pattern is

00:24:49.228 --> 00:24:52.457
happening.
Going up here we have M equals

00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:55.605
one-half, and that is called
half order.

00:24:55.605 --> 00:24:58.269
The positive ones here have
names.

00:24:58.269 --> 00:25:04.000
And so that then would be k
times A raised to one-half.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.363
And if we double the
concentration here,

00:25:06.363 --> 00:25:08.000
what happens to the rate?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:28.309
You have 1.4 times the rate.
What do you think M equals zero

00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:31.375
is called?
Zero order.

00:25:31.375 --> 00:25:37.000
And what would the rate law be
for this one?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.686
Yeah, rate equals k.
What would happen if I double

00:25:49.686 --> 00:25:54.549
the concentration of A?
Nothing.

00:25:54.549 --> 00:26:00.185
No affect on rate.
You can look for this in a list

00:26:00.185 --> 00:26:04.202
of examples where they are
changing the concentration of A

00:26:04.202 --> 00:26:08.431
and you can look at the effect.
And, if there is no effect on

00:26:08.431 --> 00:26:12.590
rate, then it is zero order.
And so the term does not appear

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:15.621
in the rate law.
There are some exercises on

00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:18.933
problem ten on this.
It is a good question for a

00:26:18.933 --> 00:26:22.810
final exam to think about,
looking at data and coming up

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:26.546
with what the rate law for that
expression is for that

00:26:26.546 --> 00:26:30.000
particular reaction based on
data.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.078
You think about what is
happening, what they are doing,

00:26:35.078 --> 00:26:38.369
and then what the effect of
rate is.

00:26:38.369 --> 00:26:43.448
And you can back-calculate,
then, what the order of the

00:26:43.448 --> 00:26:48.056
reaction had to be.
The next thing about rate laws

00:26:48.056 --> 00:26:53.793
is that the overall order of the
reaction is simply the sum of

00:26:53.793 --> 00:26:57.084
the exponents,
so the sum of all the

00:26:57.084 --> 00:27:03.490
individuals orders.
If your rate law was your rate

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:10.472
constant, and it is A to the
two, so that is what order in A?

00:27:10.472 --> 00:27:14.312
Second order.
And what order in B?

00:27:14.312 --> 00:27:19.316
First order.
And your overall order is going

00:27:19.316 --> 00:27:20.712
to be?
Three.

00:27:20.712 --> 00:27:26.530
It would be overall third
order, second order in A,

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:32.000
first order in B,
and overall third.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.179
It always breaks my heart on a
test when people get this part

00:27:36.179 --> 00:27:40.427
right, and they say what is the
overall order of the reaction?

00:27:40.427 --> 00:27:44.049
And they cannot add the one and
the two to get three.

00:27:44.049 --> 00:27:47.114
Remember that part.
That is like the "give me

00:27:47.114 --> 00:27:50.388
points" on an exam,
to be able to add these very

00:27:50.388 --> 00:27:54.567
small numbers and come up with
the sum, so remember how to do

00:27:54.567 --> 00:27:57.492
that for me.
Overall, it is just the sum of

00:27:57.492 --> 00:28:01.745
the individual orders.
Here is the bad news,

00:28:01.745 --> 00:28:05.318
and that is,
the units for the rate constant

00:28:05.318 --> 00:28:08.393
k vary.
The units are going to have to

00:28:08.393 --> 00:28:13.628
do with what units you have for
concentration and rates and what

00:28:13.628 --> 00:28:17.617
terms are in there.
There is no one unit that you

00:28:17.617 --> 00:28:22.603
can memorize and always know
that that is what it is going to

00:28:22.603 --> 00:28:25.013
be.
You actually have to think

00:28:25.013 --> 00:28:30.000
about what the units for the
rate constant are.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.731
That is a little bit trickier.
This one much easier,

00:28:33.731 --> 00:28:37.829
just add, but the units are a
little bit more complicated

00:28:37.829 --> 00:28:40.170
here.
That's all you need to know

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.731
about rate loss.
It is not too much.

00:28:42.731 --> 00:28:45.585
All right.
Here are some of the problems

00:28:45.585 --> 00:28:50.195
with these kinds of experiments.
Some of the data that you might

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:54.512
get, that you are trying to
analyze, may not be too perfect.

00:28:54.512 --> 00:28:58.463
Usually, if it is in the
textbook, it is pretty perfect

00:28:58.463 --> 00:29:01.182
data.
But, in general,

00:29:01.182 --> 00:29:03.546
these things can be tricky to
do.

00:29:03.546 --> 00:29:07.905
And they can be tricky to get
this good data that figure out

00:29:07.905 --> 00:29:12.116
what the order of the reactions
are, because you are often

00:29:12.116 --> 00:29:16.401
measuring really small changes
in concentration of material

00:29:16.401 --> 00:29:20.242
over brief intervals of time.
That can be technically

00:29:20.242 --> 00:29:23.567
challenging to do.
And so the approach that is

00:29:23.567 --> 00:29:28.000
used then is to use these
integrated rate laws.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.201
And so here you can express
concentrations directly as a

00:29:32.201 --> 00:29:35.868
function of time,
and this makes it easier to get

00:29:35.868 --> 00:29:38.312
at the information that you
want.

00:29:38.312 --> 00:29:41.062
Let's look at a first order
reaction.

00:29:41.062 --> 00:29:43.736
You know what first order means
now.

00:29:43.736 --> 00:29:47.173
We just have one thing going to
another thing,

00:29:47.173 --> 00:29:50.993
in this particular example.
Your first order for A,

00:29:50.993 --> 00:29:53.666
rate of a reaction could be
written.

00:29:53.666 --> 00:29:57.409
The rate expression can be
written in terms of the

00:29:57.409 --> 00:30:03.835
disappearance of A over time.
And you know it is first order,

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:09.416
you are told it is first order,
so you can also write the rate

00:30:09.416 --> 00:30:12.343
law.
The rate law for first order

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:17.283
reaction in A would just be the
rate constant times the

00:30:17.283 --> 00:30:20.577
concentration of A,
so M is one here.

00:30:20.577 --> 00:30:25.883
Now, we can derive the first
order integrated rate law from

00:30:25.883 --> 00:30:30.000
this simple expression right
here.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.613
What we are going to do is we
are going to take the

00:30:34.613 --> 00:30:40.333
concentration terms and put them
on one side of the expression,

00:30:40.333 --> 00:30:45.869
and we are going to take time
terms and put them on the other

00:30:45.869 --> 00:30:48.636
side.
We are going to bring the

00:30:48.636 --> 00:30:54.080
concentration of A here over to
this side of the expression.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.863
There it is,
one over the concentration of

00:30:57.863 --> 00:31:01.000
A.
We have dt as well.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.639
And so we have moved that.
And we have moved k and the

00:31:05.639 --> 00:31:10.453
negative sign over here.
And we have moved the change in

00:31:10.453 --> 00:31:15.442
time over to the other side.
We have all the concentration

00:31:15.442 --> 00:31:19.381
terms on one side.
We have rate terms and time

00:31:19.381 --> 00:31:23.671
terms on the other side.
And now we can integrate.

00:31:23.671 --> 00:31:28.047
And we want to consider the
change from the initial

00:31:28.047 --> 00:31:32.336
concentration of A,
A to the O for original or the

00:31:32.336 --> 00:31:36.246
zero.
The original amount that you

00:31:36.246 --> 00:31:40.500
have of A to the concentration
of A you have at time t.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.666
And so we have our

00:31:42.666 --> 00:31:46.358
concentration expression.
And in terms of time,

00:31:46.358 --> 00:31:49.487
we are looking from zero time
to time t.

00:31:49.487 --> 00:31:53.500
And now we can take this and
solve this expression.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.512
This is the same one.
I am just moving it up to the

00:31:57.512 --> 00:32:02.692
top of the screen.
And so now we can express this

00:32:02.692 --> 00:32:06.820
in terms of natural log.
The natural log of the

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.846
concentration of A at time t
minus the natural log of the

00:32:11.846 --> 00:32:15.705
original concentration of A
equals minus kt.

00:32:15.705 --> 00:32:21.269
And we can reorder that and put

00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:25.307
a box around it,
which means it is going to be

00:32:25.307 --> 00:32:30.351
important later on.
We can rearrange this in terms

00:32:30.351 --> 00:32:34.741
of the natural log of the
concentration A of time t minus

00:32:34.741 --> 00:32:39.209
kt plus the natural log of the
initial concentration of A.

00:32:39.209 --> 00:32:43.050
And so we will come back to
this in a few minutes.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:47.362
We can also keep going and
rearrange this in other ways.

00:32:47.362 --> 00:32:51.752
We can rewrite this term,
instead of by subtracting them,

00:32:51.752 --> 00:32:55.358
rewrite it as this division.
Natural log of the

00:32:55.358 --> 00:32:59.983
concentration of A at time t
over the original concentration

00:32:59.983 --> 00:33:03.275
equals minus kt.

00:33:03.275 --> 00:33:06.657
And then we can take the

00:33:06.657 --> 00:33:10.040
inverse natural log.
And so then on the other side

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.250
we have e raised to the minus
kt.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:15.426
And we can write this in this
expression again,

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:17.704
box.

00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:21.847
This is the way that you often
see the first order integrated

00:33:21.847 --> 00:33:25.990
rate law, where you are solving
for the concentration of A at

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:30.133
time t is equal to the original
concentration of A times e to

00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:34.000
the minus kt.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.201
How the concentration of A
changes depends on the rate

00:33:38.201 --> 00:33:41.213
constant and the time that has
elapsed.

00:33:41.213 --> 00:33:46.048
This is often the way that the
integrated first order rate law

00:33:46.048 --> 00:33:49.298
is written.
Sometimes you may see a little

00:33:49.298 --> 00:33:52.310
bit different expressions,
but usually,

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.560
this is the final expression
that you see.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:00.000
And this is an equation for a
straight line.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.248
And that is why it was boxed,
because it is how data is going

00:34:05.248 --> 00:34:08.921
to be plotted.
If you are going to use that

00:34:08.921 --> 00:34:12.770
now and plot data,
you can plot data that you

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:17.319
collect, so the concentration of
A as it is changing.

00:34:17.319 --> 00:34:22.130
You are measuring how the
concentration of A is changing

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.716
versus time.
And so here is your equation,

00:34:25.716 --> 00:34:30.089
the natural log of a
concentration at time t equals

00:34:30.089 --> 00:34:37.000
minus kt plus the natural log of
the original concentration of A.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.833
You can see that this is the
equation for this line.

00:34:40.833 --> 00:34:45.343
And so the intercept over here
is going to tell you about the

00:34:45.343 --> 00:34:49.251
initial concentration of A.
And what you really want,

00:34:49.251 --> 00:34:53.761
the great thing that you want,
is to determine rate constants

00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:57.970
for a particular reaction.
How do I get the rate constant

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.222
out of this plot?
From the slope,

00:35:01.222 --> 00:35:04.157
right.
The slope is going to be equal

00:35:04.157 --> 00:35:06.521
to minus k here.
We can solve,

00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:10.679
then, if we plot our data that
we measure over time,

00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:14.347
how it is changing,
after this amount of time,

00:35:14.347 --> 00:35:18.179
we have this much more and we
can plot the data,

00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:20.706
we can pull out a rate
constant.

00:35:20.706 --> 00:35:25.027
This is a very useful way to
get information about our

00:35:25.027 --> 00:35:30.000
particular reaction that we are
interested in.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.498
When you are talking about
first order equation reactions,

00:35:35.498 --> 00:35:41.093
you also often talk about half
lives, the amount of time it

00:35:41.093 --> 00:35:45.144
takes for half of the material
to reaction.

00:35:45.144 --> 00:35:50.932
Half-life is the time that it
takes for the original material

00:35:50.932 --> 00:35:55.369
to be reduced by a half.
And its expression is,

00:35:55.369 --> 00:36:00.000
in terms of t to the half,
shown here.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.378
Let's derive an expression for
the half-life of a first order

00:36:07.378 --> 00:36:11.313
reaction.
We can take from above,

00:36:11.313 --> 00:36:18.446
from the integrated first order
rate laws, this expression,

00:36:18.446 --> 00:36:23.488
natural log of the
concentration of A at a

00:36:23.488 --> 00:36:30.006
particular time over the
concentration of the original

00:36:30.006 --> 00:36:38.000
material equals minus kt,
the rate constant times time.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.844
All right.
For first order half-life,

00:36:41.844 --> 00:36:47.398
we are talking about half of
the material going away.

00:36:47.398 --> 00:36:52.310
Then we can go in and
substitute in half of the

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:57.330
original material being gone and
solve for that.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:01.160
We can take this.
The A at time t,

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.628
at a particular time,
in this case,

00:37:03.628 --> 00:37:06.965
half of it is gone,
so we can substitute in the

00:37:06.965 --> 00:37:10.739
original material divided by
two, because what we are

00:37:10.739 --> 00:37:13.206
interested in is a first
half-life.

00:37:13.206 --> 00:37:17.487
Half of that original material
is gone, so it is the time at

00:37:17.487 --> 00:37:20.462
time t two that we are
interest in.

00:37:20.462 --> 00:37:24.671
And now we have put t to the
half, so it is not just at any

00:37:24.671 --> 00:37:29.170
time, but at a particular time
at this particular condition for

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:34.867
first order half-life.
And then we can rearrange this

00:37:34.867 --> 00:37:39.073
expression here.
And so this just becomes the

00:37:39.073 --> 00:37:43.757
natural log of a half.
The original concentrations

00:37:43.757 --> 00:37:49.014
will cancel out in this
expression and you are left with

00:37:49.014 --> 00:37:52.742
one over two.
Now we can solve for this,

00:37:52.742 --> 00:37:58.000
the number value,
and so you get minus 0.6931.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.029
And then we want to rearrange
this expression to solve for the

00:38:05.029 --> 00:38:08.717
half-life.
If we bring that over,

00:38:08.717 --> 00:38:13.096
we have half-life equals 0.6931
over k.

00:38:13.096 --> 00:38:18.628
The one thing you will notice
in this expression,

00:38:18.628 --> 00:38:25.773
there is no term for A anymore,
so half-life does not depend on

00:38:25.773 --> 00:38:31.601
the concentration.
It depends on what instead?

00:38:31.601 --> 00:38:34.106
On k.
On the rate constant.

00:38:34.106 --> 00:38:39.212
And rate constant depends on
the material in question.

00:38:39.212 --> 00:38:43.933
Half-life depends on k,
and k depends on material.

00:38:43.933 --> 00:38:48.654
We talked about nature of
material affecting rate,

00:38:48.654 --> 00:38:53.857
so here is one example.
Some materials have much longer

00:38:53.857 --> 00:39:00.005
half lives than other materials.
Just to think about this

00:39:00.005 --> 00:39:03.013
question then.
For the same material,

00:39:03.013 --> 00:39:07.274
does it take longer for one ton
to go to a half ton,

00:39:07.274 --> 00:39:10.283
or for one gram to go to a half
gram?

00:39:10.283 --> 00:39:12.037
It is the same,
right.

00:39:12.037 --> 00:39:16.967
It is hard to think about this
sometimes, it seems like that

00:39:16.967 --> 00:39:19.390
should be wrong,
but it isn't.

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.649
All right.
One last thing before you go,

00:39:22.649 --> 00:39:27.161
let's just look at plots.
This takes the same amount of

00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:31.326
time.
Let's consider what it would

00:39:31.326 --> 00:39:36.063
look like if we plotted then
concentration versus time for

00:39:36.063 --> 00:39:41.049
something that was first order.
And so you would have a first

00:39:41.049 --> 00:39:43.875
half-life.
You would be at half the

00:39:43.875 --> 00:39:48.113
concentration of the material.
The second half-life,

00:39:48.113 --> 00:39:51.686
after it had gone through
another half-life,

00:39:51.686 --> 00:39:56.091
you would be down to a quarter.
And a third half-life,

00:39:56.091 --> 00:40:01.488
you are down to 0.125.
And so that would give rise to

00:40:01.488 --> 00:40:05.221
a curve like this.
You have this kind of decay

00:40:05.221 --> 00:40:08.041
curve.
And you can see where we are

00:40:08.041 --> 00:40:11.525
going on this.
On Monday we are going to be

00:40:11.525 --> 00:40:16.253
talking about examples of
half-life first order reactions,

00:40:16.253 --> 00:40:18.990
which are nuclear decay
reactions.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:22.391
We will talk a little about
radioactivity,

00:40:22.391 --> 00:40:24.857
and that is where Chapter 17
comes in.
