00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.500
To get started running unit
tests with the Java plugin,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.360
all you need to do is place your
tasks in the source test Java folder.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.300
You can, of course,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.820
change the location of your test code
by configuring the test source set.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.630
The only thing we have to manually
configure is our test dependencies.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.800
In this example, we're using JUnit
as our testing framework, so

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.710
we have to add a JUnit dependency
to the test compile configuration.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.070
Running our test is easy.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.280
Just run the test task.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.240
You'll notice Gradle has to perform
a bunch of other tasks before it

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.010
can actually run our tests.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.950
It has to compile our Java source and
then compile our test source, and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.550
finally it can run the tests.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.600
In this case, the build was successful
indicating that all of our tests passed.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.340
Gradle also provides detailed
reports on our test execution.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.320
These reports are placed in
the build reports directory.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.890
Let's take a look at
one of these reports.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.090
In this case, you can see we have one
test and that the test was successful.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.080
Of course in a real project
you'd have many tests.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.600
Now I've gone and
edited our task so it will fail.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.430
Let's see what happens when
we run the test this time.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.840
Oh no, our build failed.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.269
Let's see what went wrong.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.360
Execution failed for task ":test".

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.730
There were failing tests.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.240
All right, we expected that.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.060
Let's check out the report.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.090
Looking at the report tells us we
ran one test, and that it failed.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.160
And then we can even
look at our test class

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.910
to see the full stacktrace
of what went wrong.
