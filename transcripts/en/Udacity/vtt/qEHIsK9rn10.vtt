00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Fix a bug as soon as you spot the problem?

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.000
Well, if you can fix a bug, yes.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.500
But normally you'd like to think about the problem, whether you can generalize it,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.800
find about the best place to fix, reason about it until you have a very good diagnosis,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.000
so this is definitely not true.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
Always keep all details in your head.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.500
Well, the name of the last part was "Explicit Debugging,"

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.300
so you should not always try to keep all details in your head. This is wrong.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.800
Explaining the problem can be helpful. Yes--plenty of anecdotal evidence for that.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.400
And finally, up to 50% to 70% of software development effort

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.500
is spent on validation and debugging.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
This is also true, and this is something we really, really, really must change.
