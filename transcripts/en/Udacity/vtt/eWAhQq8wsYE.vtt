00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.450
Great job on creating your hello server.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.440
Now that we have a working web server,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.290
let's see if we can add some
CRUD operations to our site.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.180
This will be a fun activity, where
you'll finally bring together all of

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.540
the major aspects you've learned
about creating data-driven websites.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.700
In this next section, you are going
to modify our web server code,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.190
such that we can create,
read, update, and

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.900
delete restaurants from our
restaurant menu database.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.490
I will be adding these features
in the next five sections,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.190
divided up into objectives.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.900
I highly encourage you to read through
the objective's descriptions that I'll

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.380
be presenting in a moment, and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.500
attempt to solve them before
seeing the solution videos.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.820
Up until now,
we've been moving pretty quickly.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.660
But this is an opportunity to slow down,
and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.940
get messy,
figuring out these challenges.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.840
I'll be sharing my answers with you,
but through this process you

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.610
might even create more elegant
solutions than my own.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.930
Before we get started coding,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.980
let me list off the objectives I
want to complete for this project.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.460
Listing objectives helps me to
understand the scope of my project and

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.920
create identifiable
milestones along the way.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.550
These objectives should also serve
as guidelines you should follow to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.110
complete this project.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.870
The goal of objective one is to
modify the webserver.py file,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.230
so that opening local hosts or
8080/restaurants,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.180
the user sees a list of all
the restaurant names in the database.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.940
To complete objective two,
after the name of each restaurant,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.680
there should be a link to edit and
delete each restaurant.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.400
These links don't have to work for now.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.800
They should just be visible.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.930
The third objective goal is to add
code such that there is a page to

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.850
create new restaurants, with a form for
writing the new restaurant name.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.350
The form should create a post request
that creates a new restaurant menu item

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.610
in the database.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.270
To complete objective four, we enhance
the web server such that users can

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.560
rename a restaurant and persist
this edit to the database via post.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.580
And the last objective
creates a feature,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.280
such that by clicking Delete,
takes the user to a confirmation page.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.540
That then sends a post command to

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.370
the database to delete
the selected restaurant.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.840
If you don't get it on the first attempt
or have to spend some time debugging or

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.090
looking things up online, that's okay.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.450
Even the best of programmers
have to debug code.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.800
Try to spend about three hours working
on each of the objectives before viewing

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.670
the solutions if you're still
relatively new to programming.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.900
Don't forget to use your resources
like the Python documentation, and

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.520
tools like the source code inspector in
Chrome to help you debug your program,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.870
and don't hesitate to ask
questions in the forum.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.690
I'll be going over the solution
to this challenge piece by piece,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.980
solving each objective in order,
once you're finished with an object,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.900
continue to the next video to see
my implementation of the solution.
