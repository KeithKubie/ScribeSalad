00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.910
The Sun is an unpredictable, violent ball
of gas and plasma, radiating fusion energy.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.770
It can send streams of charged particles right
towards Earth without warning, potentially

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.210
causing catastrophic damage to our power grid.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.280
And while we need the Sun to live, we also
need to protect ourselves from its wrath.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.560
The problem is, we actually know very
little about our nearest star because

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.930
we haven't been able to get close
enough to fully understand its behavior.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.400
But finally NASA believes it has the tech to touch the Sun.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.620
The Parker Solar Probe is humanity's first
trip to a star.

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.870
It will get seven times closer to the Sun
than any mission before, and that's because

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.909
of the probe's Thermal Protection System or TPS.

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.299
The spacecraft and its instruments are shielded
by an 11 centimeter thick piece of carbon

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:01.159
foam sandwiched between two panels of superheated
carbon-carbon composite.

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:07.000
The TPS will enable the front of the shield
to withstand temperatures as high as 1,370

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.570
degrees Celsius, while the inside of the probe
remains at the comfortable heat of a summer

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.800
day - about 30 degrees Celsius.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.170
Twin solar arrays will power the spacecraft
and its cooling system, which surprisingly

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.270
utilizes a low-tech coolant: pressurized water.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.110
The ability to function in extreme heat is
incredibly important because the Parker probe

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.890
will venture to the corona - the Sun's outermost
atmosphere.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.730
There, the data it collects will help answer
two of the most vexing questions in astrophysics:

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.750
why the corona is hotter than the solar surface
and how solar wind is accelerated.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.340
From Earth, we can only ever see the corona
during a total solar eclipse, which is why

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.420
it is incredibly difficult to study.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.060
Because the density is so low, the corona's
brightness is overpowered by energy coming

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.030
from the solar surface.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.360
As the last layer of the Sun's atmosphere,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.060
the corona extends millions of miles into space.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.700
Here temperatures can rise to over 1 million
degrees Celsius, which is about 300 times

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.799
hotter than the photosphere- the lowest layer
of the Sun's atmosphere.

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.469
At this extreme heat, the Sun's gravity can't
hold on to rapidly moving particles charged

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:26.180
in the corona, so they escape in streams of
accelerated plasma, known as solar wind.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.080
These streams carry the Sun's magnetic field

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.760
far into space at speeds up to 800 kilometers per second.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.989
There are theories about the causes of coronal
heating and solar wind acceleration, but we

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.099
haven't been able to land on a definitive
answer without actually going to the Sun,

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.540
and that's why the Parker Solar Probe is so crucial.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.450
The spacecraft will orbit the Sun 24 times,
coming as close as 5.9 million kilometers

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.010
and moving as fast as 690,000 kilometers per hour.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.829
Once close enough, it will trace energy as
it moves through the corona by measuring particle

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.739
properties and shock waves in the Sun's plasma.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.060
If Parker manages to complete its seven year
mission, its data will revolutionize the way

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.569
we look at the Sun by solving these longstanding
solar mysteries.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.180
Parker's discoveries will also help us
better predict our nearest star's volatile

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.940
behavior and enhance our ability to forecast

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.880
solar storms to avoid global disaster here on Earth.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.300
