half-step slower so I begin with most of
 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.560

us are missing all of these fascinating
 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.550
us are missing all of these fascinating
stories all of these insights and it's

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560
stories all of these insights and it's
 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.990
stories all of these insights and it's
like the whole universe is a megaphone

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000
like the whole universe is a megaphone
 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.230

our head down and we're checking our
texts and then I begin secondly that

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590
texts and then I begin secondly that
 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.290
texts and then I begin secondly that
there is the universal and there is the

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300
there is the universal and there is the
 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.140
there is the universal and there is the
particular so there are the particulars

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150
particular so there are the particulars
 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.440
particular so there are the particulars
of a story what she was wearing he was

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.710
in the parking lot of the drugstore and
you described the details in the

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720
you described the details in the
 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.990

takes a while it takes a lot of work to

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690
takes a while it takes a lot of work to
 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.150
takes a while it takes a lot of work to
keep a relationship together so there's

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160
keep a relationship together so there's
 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.830
keep a relationship together so there's
the particular and then there's a

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840
the particular and then there's a
 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.140
the particular and then there's a
universal which is true for all of us

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150
universal which is true for all of us
 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.330
universal which is true for all of us
and so a sermon is moving back and forth

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340
and so a sermon is moving back and forth
 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.630
and so a sermon is moving back and forth
between the particular x' and the

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640
between the particular x' and the
 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.630
between the particular x' and the
universals and it knows the power of a

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640
universals and it knows the power of a
 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.409
universals and it knows the power of a
good story and it knows how that story

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419
good story and it knows how that story
 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.340
good story and it knows how that story
is true at some level for all of us and

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350
is true at some level for all of us and
 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.280
is true at some level for all of us and
