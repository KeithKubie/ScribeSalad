00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:14.740
This DNews episode is brought to you by Domain
dot com!

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.740
You follow the news, right?

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.060
So, I probably DON'T need to tell you that
there's been an outbreak of the measles linked

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.840
to a certain Mouse-centered park system.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.210
I don't know about you but when I hear outbreak
of the measles, I start thinking back to the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.590
17th century, and colonial America, but since
the virus was identified in the nineteen-teens

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.829
and a vaccination was created in the late
50s; the measles has been a relatively easy

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.039
disease to control.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:45.120
In fact, our regional strain of the measles
was eliminated from the US as of 2000, but

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.789
it's still fairly common in Europe, Asia,
Africa and the Pacific.

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.210
In 2014, though, there were a record number
of measles cases in the U.S.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.089
The CDC says there were 644 cases in 27 states
last year; and that a majority of those people

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.280
of the infected were unvaccinated.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.600
Makes sense.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.890
Herd immunity can only protect you for so
long people.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.229
2015 has already had 59 cases, from a single
Disneyland exposure -- including five employees

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.280
of the parks.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.039
The measles is REALLY contagious.

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.140
It was first described in some way by Persian
physicians in the year 900.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.399
It causes a rash all over your body, swelling,
fever, a cough and little spots inside the

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.420
cheeks called Koplik spots.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.820
It's deadly to young children and is one of
the leading causes for children worldwide.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.560
Measles, or rubeola is a virus, and there
is no cure.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.189
It spreads by flying into the air during a
cough or sneeze or piggybacking on the sharing

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.189
of food or drinks.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.790
If you had the measles and you're watching
this, CONGRATULATIONS!

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.729
Tell us about history Nana and PopPop!!

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.369
Most people born before 1957 have had the
measles; so I just want to make them feel

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.369
included.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.859
The reason the cutoff is 1957 -- is because
in 1958** a vaccine went into wide use and

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:57.859
boom.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.439
Measles infections dropped precipitously.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.130
Since then, the WHO has attempted to vaccinate
children worldwide, which likely saved hundreds

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.609
of thousands of lives.

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:12.050
Since 2000 they've dropped cases 75% worldwide
thanks to the MMR vaccine.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.780
The vaccine for the measles is part of the
MMR vaccine; which stands for measles-mumps

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.780
and rubella.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.440
Measles is the worst, but the mumps causes
a swelling of the parotid glands giving the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.110
face a hamster look; sounds cute, but it's
not cute.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.760
It's painful and highly contagious.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.270
It can also caught inflammation of the testis,
ovary, pancreas, or meninges.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.050
Rubella is also known as the german measles,
and it's like the measles, but far milder.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.350
Luckily, the MMR vaccine is one of the most
effective in the world.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.400
With only two doses, 97-percent of human immune
systems create enough antibodies to fight

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.290
off any measles it may come in contact with.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.930
Usually, the first comes near birth, and the
second a few years later to make sure the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.100
immunity is solid.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.330
Measles sounds crappy, what with the rashes
and diarrhea, but it can also cause permanent

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.740
damage to the lungs or the brain.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.980
It's also connected to seizures and meningitis!

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.990
This strange resurgence of measles we're hearing
about in the news, is likely because of the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.640
recent trend against vaccination.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.821
Only six of the infected had the MMR shot,
the rest did notâ€¦ which jives with the high

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:16.841
protection rate; according to Wired and the
CDC.

00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:21.370
If people stop getting the MMR vaccine, they
become happy little dumpsters for the diseases

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.450
which can't take hold anywhere else.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.590
As we only eliminated the endemic measles,
unvaccinated Americans travelling abroad are

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.290
still able to contract measles where it has
not been eliminated and transport it to areas

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.260
where it has before they show symptoms.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.320
Even perfect immunity isn't entirely safe,
remember, it's only 97-percent effective.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.340
So this is where personal choices for vaccination
become problematic.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.201
It might be a personal choice to be an anti-vaxxer,
but this choice can harm other people, even

00:03:51.201 --> 00:04:05.980
those who DID get vaccinated.
