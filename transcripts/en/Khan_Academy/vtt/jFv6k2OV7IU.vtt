00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570
 

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.290
We know that solid phosphorus
will react with chlorine gas

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.000
to spontaneously produce
phosphorus trichloride, liquid

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.330
phosphorus trichloride.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.720
And we're told that we have 1.45
grams of solid molecular

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.980
phosphorus.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.830
And we're asked how many grams
of chlorine is required to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.190
essentially use up all of the
phosphorus that we have?

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.509
And how many grams of phosphorus
trichloride is

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.080
going to be produced?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.130
Now before you do any of these
stoichiometry problems. And

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.180
that's just a fancy word for
problems where you need to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.960
figure out how much of a certain
reactant is required.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.070
Or how much of a product is
going to be produced.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.590
Before you do any of these
problems you have to make sure

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.990
that your reaction, or that your
equation, is balanced.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.000
So let's make sure.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.570
So on the left-hand side,
here, this molecule of

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.670
phosphorus has four phosphorus
atoms. So on the whole

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.620
left-hand side, all of our
reactants combined have 4

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.770
phosphorus atoms. So our
products also need to have 4

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.100
phosphorus atoms. But the
way it's written right

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.020
now, I only have 1.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.200
So let me just multiply
this guy by 4.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.990
Now I have 4 phosphorus atoms on
both sides of the equation.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.870
Let's balance the
chlorine now.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.560
On the left-hand side I only
have 2 chlorine atoms. This 1

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.490
molecule of chlorine
has 2 atoms in it.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.370
Here I have each molecule
of phosphorus

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.980
trichloride has 3 chlorines.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.650
And I have 4 molecules of it.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.760
So 4 times 3, I have
12 chlorine's on

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.930
the right-hand side.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.330
So 12 on the right-hand side.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.650
I need to have 12 on the left.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.930
I only have 2 here.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.760
Let me multiply that by 6.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.190
6 times 2 is 12.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.760
4 times 3 is 12.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.500
Now our equation is
all balanced.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.440
4 phosphoruses each side,
and twelve chlorines.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.620
Now the next thing we have to
do, now that we know that we

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.280
have a balanced equation and
we can get into the meat of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.680
the problem, is figure out how
many moles of phosphorus we're

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.250
dealing with.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.700
Because once we know the
moles, we can use

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.480
stoichiometric ratios.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.320
Which is just essentially
saying, look, for every mole

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.460
of that, I need 6
moles of that.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.260
And for every mole of
that, I'm going to

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.910
produce 4 moles of that.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.730
So you want to get it all
in terms of moles.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.500
So let's figure out how many
moles of phosphorus

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.390
we have on our hands.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.880
Let's look at our
periodic table.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.530
This periodic table, we
have to give proper

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.710
attribution to the maker.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.640
It's made by Le Van
Han Cedric.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.610
I got this off of Wikimedia
Creative Commons.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.220
It had an attribution license.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.300
Other than that, we're
free to use it.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.160
And let's go to phosphorus.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.760
Phosphorous right here has its
atomic weight of 30.974.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.950
Let's just round
that up to 31.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.800
Let me write it down
right here.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:04.060
So phosphorus has atomic
weight of 31.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.820
Which tells us that a mole of
phosphorus will weigh 31

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.650
grams. Remember a mole is this,
you know, 6.02 times 10

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.010
to the 20th.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.460
It's this huge number of atoms.
If you have that many

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.530
number of atoms of atomic
phosphorous.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.580
It's going to weight at 31
grams. Now if you look at the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.470
atomic weight of P4, or a
molecule that has 4 phosphorus

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.910
atoms in it, it's going
to be 4 times this.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.460
So it's going to have an atomic
weight of-- well,

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.480
what's 4 times 31?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.910
it's 124-- of 124.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.140
Which means that 1 mole of--
let me write it here-- this

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.930
tells us, right there, that
1 mole of solid molecular

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.536
phosphorus is going to have a--
well, since we're doing it

00:03:59.536 --> 00:04:08.540
in grams, I should say, will
have a mass of 124 grams. Now,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.870
given that, we can use that
with this information to

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.260
figure out how many moles of
molecular phosphorus we have.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.279
Solid molecular phosphorus.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.029
So let me start over here.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:28.240
So we have 1.45 grams-- let
me write it this way-- of

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.220
molecular phosphorus, each
molecule containing 4 atoms.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.770
And we could just do a little
dimensional analysis, and make

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.770
sure everything cancels out.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.890
Times this information
right here.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:50.140
We have 1 mole of molecular
phosphorus for every 124 grams

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.870
of molecular phosphorus.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.900
I should write this here, just
so we remember what we're

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.930
talking about.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.460
1 mole of molecular phosphorus
for every 124 grams of

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.650
molecular phosphorus.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.990
And then this cancels out.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.460
So the units at least
cancel out.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.290
The grams of phosphorus.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:21.500
And then we get 1.45 times
1/124 moles of molecular

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.050
phosphorus.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.450
And we can figure that out.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.780
Let's get our calculator out.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.600
It's 1.45-- we could just say
divided by 124, right?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.180
That's the same thing as
multiplying by 1/124.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:45.630
So divided by 124 is equal to
0.001-- I'll just round it, 7.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:06:04.480
So this is equal to 0.0117
moles of phosphorus.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.670
That's what we're starting
off with.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.170
That's what this
1.45 grams are.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.660
And that makes sense.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.270
If we had an entire mole of
molecular phosphorus, it would

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.820
weigh a 124 grams. We only
have 1.45 of that.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.760
So it's a little bit more than
1/100, which makes sense.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.300
This number right here is a
little more than 1/100.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.620
Now, we need to think about,
for every mole,

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.560
let's scroll down here.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.120
Although I don't want
to lose my equation.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.430
We need to think about for every
mole-- so let me write

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:45.340
down, so we have 0.0117 moles
of molecular phosphorus.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.260
And for every mole of
phosphorus, how many moles of

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.050
chlorine molecules do we need?

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.360
So let me write this down.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.830
So for every 6 moles of chlorine
gas-- I'll do it in

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:13.650
blue-- for every 6 moles of
chlorine gas, we need 1 mole

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.260
of molecular phosphorus.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.450
And the reason I wrote it this
way, instead of writing 1 mole

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.990
of molecular phosphorus for
every 6 moles of chlorine gas,

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.965
is because I want to make sure
the units cancel out.

00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:26.930
And it also should make sense
for you intuitively.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.720
If I have 1 of this, I'm going
to need 6 of this.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:38.080
If I have 0.0117 of this, I'm
going to need 6 times of the

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.060
chlorine gas.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.340
And the units work out.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.960
This cancels out with that.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.520
And I'm just essentially
multiplying by 6.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.470
So we're going to have
6 times 0.0117.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.060
I think I still have that
on my calculator.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.070
Yes, it's right there.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:59.460
So times 6, is equal to 0.07.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.500
I'll just keep it there because
then it is 0 again.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:13.590
So this is equal to 0.07 moles
of chlorine gas required.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.650
And I could write
it right here.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.560
Let me write, required.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.360
Required in the numerator.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.090
Required in the denomenator.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.780
That makes a little bit more
sense or it clarifies things.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.440
For every 6 moles of chlorine
gas that are required, 1 mole

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.120
of phosphorus is required, of
solid phosphorus, is required.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.270
Or we could say for every mole
of phosphorus is required, you

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.140
need 6 moles of chlorine gas.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.340
We got that just from the
original equation.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.809
So I'll write this, required,
down right there.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:39.820
So we're almost there.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:46.440
We figured out that 0.07 moles
of chlorine gas are required.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.830
But we want to find out
how many grams of

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.180
chlorine gas are required.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.860
So we just have to figure
out how many grams

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.680
there are per mole?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.870
So let's figure that out.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.470
Let's look at the chlorine.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.150
Chlorine is off here
to the right.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.320
This is a super huge
periodic table.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:12.960
Chlorine, right here, has an
atomic weight of 35.453.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:24.090
So chlorine, 35.453
atomic weight.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.430
The weighted average of
all of the isotopes

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.605
of chlorine on earth.

00:09:28.605 --> 00:09:31.760
So molecular chlorine gas, which
has 2 atoms, is going to

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.070
have twice that.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.510
So I could do it in my head.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.770
It is going to be, right,
about what?

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.750
70.9?

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.350
I'll just use a calculator.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.210
I don't want to make a
silly math mistake.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:10:04.850
35.453 times 2 is
equal to 70.906.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.720
I didn't even need
the calculator.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.580
So it's equal to 70.906.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.110
My memory is bad.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:18.690
70.906 atomic weight.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.020
Which tells us that-- well, let
me write this information

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.600
that we had down before.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.930
We were required to have 0.07
moles of chlorine gas.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.650
That is what is required.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.900
And let's multiply it.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.540
We want moles in the
denominator.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.860
So we want moles in the
denominator here.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:48.610
So 1 mole of chlorine gas.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:53.130
For every mole, what's
the mass going to be?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.000
Well if the atomic weight of
chlorine gas is 70.906, that

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.060
means one mole of it is going
to have a mass of 70.906

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.210
grams. So for every mole,
we have 70.90 grams.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.430
We have 0.07 moles.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.770
So we will multiply 0.07 times
70 to figure out how many

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.680
grams we have. And the
units cancel out.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.010
We have moles of chlorine gas
and we're just going to have

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.130
grams required.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.230
So this is going to
be equal to 70

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.850
times 0.07 grams required.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.610
So let's get that over here.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:41.020
So we already have the 70.906
times 0.07 is equal to 4.96

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:52.580
grams. So 4.96 grams of-- and
actually this is grams of

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.520
chlorine gas.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.400
I should write that there.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.940
So grams of chlorine
gas are required.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.650
Even the required worked out
with the dimensional analysis.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.490
And we've answered the first
part of the problem.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:10.270
If we have 1.45 grams of
phosphorus as one of the

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.900
reactants, then we're
going to need 4.96.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.350
4.96 grams of chlorine
are required.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.020
Now, the second question
is how much phosphorus

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.050
trichloride is produced?

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.840
Now there's two ways to do it.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.110
An easy way and a hard way.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.920
The easy way says, well,
mass is conserved.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.790
If you have grams on the side,
the total mass on this side

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.170
has to be equal to the total
mass on that side.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.320
That's the easy way.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.010
The slightly harder way is you
could have done the exact same

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.100
thing we did with the chlorine
gas, you could do it with the

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.640
phosphorus trichloride.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.620
You could say, hey, for
every mole of this, I

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.200
need 4 moles of that.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.840
And then figure out the mass of
each mole and multiply and

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.460
do all of that.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.220
But let's do it the easy way.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:57.050
We know that we have 1.45 grams
of this reactant, and we

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:01.190
have 4.96 grams of
this reactant.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.830
So this, which is the only
product right here, this

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.090
product right here must have
a mass of our combined

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.950
reactants, because it's
going to react fully.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.820
So let's figure that out.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.920
We have 4.96.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:25.560
I'll just round 4.96 plus 1.45
is equal to 6.41 grams of

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.440
phosphorus trichloride.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:34.250
6.41 grams. And we're done.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:34.750
