00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.800
What if you could hear what I'm saying by
measuring the vibrations of the stuff on the

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.220
wall behind me?

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.920
Well, now you can.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:16.980
Howdy spygamers, Trace here for DNews, so
LISTEN UP!

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.670
Science fiction has long talked about high-tech
eavesdropping equipment that can extract sound

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.910
from the environment; like by measuring vibrations
in the windows or coffee mugs.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.619
When a guitar string is plucked, the string
wooshes through the air passing its energy

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.279
to the air molecules it comes in contact with.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.879
Those molecules hit other molecules and pass
that energy on in waves, to more molecules

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.030
and so on, all the way to your ears.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.539
All those vibrating molecules are ALSO hitting
walls, your clothing, your hair, a bag of

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.739
chips… everything in the room!

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.940
They keep going until the energy from that
guitar string is dissipated.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.289
Those vibrations are invisible to the naked
eye, but not to cameras.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.639
A new paper from researchers at MIT looks
at how to extract sound information from those

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:00.639
vibrations.

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:03.930
The researchers call this new technology,
The Visual Microphone.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.470
They use a high speed video camera to measure
the sound vibration of things like chip bags,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.620
plant leaves... anything exposed to those
extraneous sound vibrations.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.050
It takes those vibrations, converts them into
sound waves which can be played back.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.450
The genius part of their technology is the
ability to catch vibrations at a higher rate

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.920
than even the camera can see.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.020
A good consumer-grade camera might only shoot
60 frames each second, but if the vibration

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.680
is around 5,000 hertz,[a] or cycles per second,
the camera can't see it.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.680
It's happening too fast!

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.960
So, to get around that, these researchers
looked at HOW the camera captures 60 frames…

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.960
it's digital, so it does it one line at a
time.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.750
For HD video, that could mean 1080 lines per
frame.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.600
Minute changes in how the chip bag vibrates
in between those lines reveal the whole range

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.720
of human hearing, from 20 hertz to 20,000
hertz.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.120
Eavesdropping technology has come a long way.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.830
Imagine robots that can sense your emotions
from the way blood is pumping through your

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.630
skin, and tiny movements of your muscles in
super high resolution at thousands of frames

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.510
per second -- AND they could even hear you
by looking at a vibrating plant in the room.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.510
We're screwed.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.359
Stuff like this has been used in science fiction
before, and obviously has immediate implications

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:17.889
for intelligence-gathering operations.

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.660
But the researchers ALSO believe this could
be used to explore the STRUCTURES of the things

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.900
they're using to measure vibration.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.870
Which could be interesting, though I'm not
sure what that could do… and sometimes,

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.040
that's where the best science comes from.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.780
What is the ultimate eavesdropping technology?

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.980
Bugs are still the most reliable, but what
would be the BEST?
