00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.530
- When I found out
I was hired by Hala

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.310
to be part of this project,
I was really excited

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.580
and was really looking
forward to working with her

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.630
and hearing from her perspective
and contributing my part

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.640
to this project.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.540
I think it's a great opportunity
that Radcliffe has brought

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.100
us to be able to work together
and for me to have this chance

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.620
to know Hala who's a
leading expert in her field.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.610
This exposure is really
a chance that I wouldn't

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.990
be able to get elsewhere.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.280
I'm really grateful for it.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.120
- Research Partnership
Program at Radcliffe

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.020
is excellent simply because
I am a strong advocate

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.280
for mentoring.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.390
Mentoring young generation,
bright generations.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.610
This is my second term
here at Radcliffe.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.430
I enjoyed very much working
with the previous partners,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.320
we already have
a paper published

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.020
on merging biology
and engineering,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.379
and now we're working
with Linh on introducing

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.860
the concept of 3D printing
to the materials we

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.120
are working with for
orthopedic applications.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.320
If you have a
defect in your bone,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.390
you would replace
that with a metal.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.460
Metal has never
really been designed

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.650
to be part of our body.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.850
So why would we need to
replace the use of metal?

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.530
And this is what I'm
working on, something

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.090
that would replace
the use of metal

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.500
and becomes part of our body.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.010
Linh's application stood out
because of her experience

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.870
in evolution biology.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.220
I recall when I read her
application that there was

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.370
osteosarcoma in it, but that's
not what really attracted me

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.490
to Linh's.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.660
And when she walked into my
office she was on crutches

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.520
and that's when I'm
going, oh my goodness,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.590
that's the one
with osteosarcoma,

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.140
which is cancer of the bones.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.440
And I looked at Linh and she
had these long surgical marks

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.289
on her tibia and
femur and that's

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.640
when I thought it could not have
been a better match of having

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.510
Linh working on the material.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.570
- As Hala already mentioned,
I had osteosarcoma

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.540
when I was 10, which is
a form of bone cancer.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.400
There was an extra
growth in the bone

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.160
and the doctor had
to do an operation

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.930
to remove that section
of bone and that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.570
leaves the question of what
could be put in to that gap.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.870
What they did back
then in 2006 was

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.940
to get bone from a bone bank
and substitute it into the gap

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.520
where my original bone was taken
out and putting a metal plate

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.560
to hold everything together.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.390
There were many complications
with that original bone graft

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.750
because it was not my own bone.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.780
So there were
problems with healing

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.410
and various complication with
the metal parts coming apart.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.820
I've had to go through
a lot of surgeries.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.060
10 surgeries in total
over the past 10 years,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.410
since I was first diagnosed
with osteosarcoma.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.790
I felt that Hala's project is
really meaningful in the sense

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.080
that it negates the need
for metal for patients

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.020
that have bone defects.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.390
- I'm hoping for this
medical technology

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.220
to reach to the patient
as close as 2019

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.840
and we're very,
very close to that.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.960
Having a research
partner at Radcliffe,

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.330
it goes well beyond research.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.000
You form this
bonding relationship

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.310
with these young rising stars.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.690
I still communicate with
my ex-Radcliffe partners.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.620
They email me, update
me on their progress,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.300
and if they need mentorship
I'm always there for them.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.790
And I hope it will be the
case with Linh as well.
