[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.260
LINDSEY: Hello.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.560
So for anyone who doesn't
know me, my name is Lindsey.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.240
And besides being a very proud
Googler, I'm also a wife.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.950
My husband's here today.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.250
I am a mother to two
adorable children.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.190
And I am also a humanitarian.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.350
And up until about
two weeks ago,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.410
I never would have
described myself that way.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.670
Yes, I donate every year and
I participate in Google Serve,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.560
but I never felt
like I was doing

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.730
enough to make a difference in
the world to use that label.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.350
But then about two
weeks ago, I was

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.500
at a conference with
about 400 other Googlers,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.470
and somebody there actually
read us the definition

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.570
of what a humanitarian
was, so I'm going

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.820
to read that to you today.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.240
A person who seeks to
promote human welfare.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.550
A person looking to promote
the health, happiness,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.730
and fortunes of a person.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.480
A person looking to promote
the basic physical and material

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.040
well-being of people in need.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.310
Now, none of you would
be here today with us

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.960
live or joining us
over live stream,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.470
if you, too, weren't
humanitarians,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.410
so I want to thank you for
coming today, taking time out

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.960
of your day to discuss
how we together

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.720
as a group of humanitarians
can work together

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.210
to combat human trafficking.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.950
Now, it was about a
year ago that I first

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.710
learned about Willow.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.840
Up until then, I knew that
human trafficking was an issue,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.760
but it always felt too dark.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.960
It felt too disturbing to think
about, much less talk about.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.460
Not exactly a dinner
party conversation,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.190
I think we can agree.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.050
But it was during
a two-hour lunch

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.910
that I had with
my dear friend Kim

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.270
that day when I realized
that because it's dark

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.420
and because it's disturbing
is exactly why we

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.089
need to be talking about it.

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:56.630
During that lunch,
she shared with me

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.207
the amazing work that
Willow was doing and shared

00:01:59.207 --> 00:02:01.790
these incredible stories about
the strength and the resilience

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.050
of the survivors.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.180
So here I am today
talking about it,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.680
hosting my first talk at Google.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.570
So on to our incredible
speakers here.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.580
We are lucky to have with
us today Kelsey Galaway,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.190
the founder and
executive director

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.720
of Willow International.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.990
Kelsey lived in Uganda
from 2010 to 2015,

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.330
where she worked in the
anti-trafficking effort just

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.380
out of college.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.350
And while there, she founded
Willow, an organization

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.930
that provides aftercare
programs for survivors

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.550
and is dedicated
to the prevention

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.210
of human trafficking.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.720
She founded Willow to provide
aftercare services that

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.060
would keep victims from
getting re-trafficked

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.490
and, ultimately, to eradicate
the global epidemic.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.270
She holds a bachelor or arts
degree in international studies

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.460
from the University
of California, Irvine,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.795
and is currently
obtaining her PhD.

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:52.550
And we're also joined by Shannon
Rogers, who started Change

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.060
a Path, which is a donor circle
that is focused on supporting

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.190
anti-trafficking
initiatives domestically

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.690
and internationally.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.580
They are fully
volunteer run, have

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.970
about 70 members with
varying levels of involvement

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.830
and giving, and
they expect to be

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.330
granting out $300,000 to
grassroots efforts this year.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.905
So I will let Kelsey and
Shannon take it away.

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:15.240
KELSEY GALAWAY: Awesome.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.130
Thank you, Lindsey.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.740
And thank all of
you for taking time

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.880
out your day to be
here to talk to us

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.620
about this important issue.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.260
Like Lindsey said, it is
really dark and a lot of people

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.160
shy away from learning about
it, from talking about it.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.920
When she said it's not
dinner conversation,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.930
that's true unless
you're Shannon and I,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.570
and this is all of our
dinner conversations

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.050
talking about human trafficking.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.810
So thank you.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.700
It means a lot to us.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.730
So we're going to get into it
with a brief overview of what

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.650
human trafficking
is because we all

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.790
enter this conversation with
a vast understanding of what

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.950
the issue is.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.980
Human trafficking, simply
put, is modern-day slavery,

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.990
but it's not a simple issue.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.020
It's a really complex
criminal industry.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.630
And it's human
beings profiting off

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.760
of the exploitation
of other human beings

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.010
through a variety of
different exploitations,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.880
including forced labor and
commercial sexual abuse

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.510
among other things.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.590
It is the third largest and
fastest growing criminal

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.720
industry in the world.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.510
It's a huge thing to take in.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.140
And if we think about it,
the reason it's fast growing,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.560
the reason it's about to
surpass drug trafficking or arms

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.140
trafficking is because
human beings are

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.900
a reusable commodity, sadly.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.600
Unlike drugs, which can be
sold once and used once,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.060
human beings can be
sold multiple times

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.120
and profited off
of multiple times.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.970
There are over 40 million
victims of trafficking

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.660
worldwide.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.520
It's a huge number.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.710
Hard to grasp what
that looks like,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.630
but it's more than
the entire population

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.390
of the state of California
living in slavery.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.730
It's also a huge industry, with
profits of over $150 billion

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.480
annually, which is more
than Apple, Samsung, BP,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.840
Exxon, and Microsoft combined.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.480
It's out of control.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.415
And one in four
victims is a child.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.370
So why is it growing
so fast and where?

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.690
Simply put, trafficking
is an exploitation

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.900
of vulnerable people, so
trafficking happens everywhere.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.990
But primarily, it
grows and it thrives

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.630
in places where you
have populations

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.280
with high vulnerability.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.200
And the International
Labor Organization

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.210
reported last year,
that the region

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.390
in the world with the
highest prevalence is Africa.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.460
And my experience
is that that also

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.130
is the region with the least
amount of organizations

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.890
and people working to combat it.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.290
Another reason it's
growing is that traffickers

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.910
are acting with impunity.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.010
There is no fear
of being caught.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.080
There's no fear
of being punished.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.120
And as John Cotton
Richmond, who's

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.120
about to be the US
Ambassador for Trafficking

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.370
always tells me,
traffickers are more

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.340
likely to be struck by lightning
than convicted of trafficking.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.480
So we're not dedicating enough
resources to fighting it,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.510
and traffickers are able to
traffic people with really

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.930
no fear of being caught.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.210
We work in Uganda.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.030
And Uganda is in east Africa.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.590
And it is a global hub
for human trafficking.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.700
It is a source, a destination,
and a transit country.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.190
And what that means is
that people are trafficked

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.610
into Uganda, through
Uganda, and Ugandans

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.760
are trafficked from Uganda
all over the world--

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.310
far off places like the United
Arab Emirates, Thailand,

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.260
Malaysia, and China.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.380
So it's a huge issue.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.340
And it's human beings
doing horrible things

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.150
to other people.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.020
But the hopeful part of this
is that human beings can also

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.160
do amazing things to work
together to stop this

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.100
and to protect
vulnerable people.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.550
And that is what Willow
has set out to do.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.620
And we do that
through collaboration,

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.630
which we'll get into.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.790
Our mission is to end
human trafficking,

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:11.960
and that's a big mission.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.570
We are doing that
through prevention,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.880
providing restorative
care to survivors,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.670
and partnering with
governments, nonprofits,

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.249
and international agencies.

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:22.790
So we have a short
video, we're going

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.760
to share with you that explains
our work in greater detail.

00:07:28.904 --> 00:07:29.570
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.010
- It's so challenging to
our psyches as human beings

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.580
that there are still
today in 2018 people

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.680
enslaving, and
abusing, and torturing

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.680
other human beings for profit.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.800
People get comfortable in
the world in which they live,

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.117
and hearing about that
can be overwhelming.

00:07:47.117 --> 00:07:48.700
And so they tend to
stay away from it.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.180
- I think people have
an innate desire for it

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.500
not to be true, that people
are enslaving human beings.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.060
We get asked the
prevalence question

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.601
all the time, how
big is the problem?

00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:11.820
How big is the problem?

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.370
And I think what
belies that question

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.340
is a disbelief in
the magnitude of it.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.020
- The International
Labor Organization

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.600
estimates that
traffickers annually

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.150
rake in over $150 billion
a year in profits.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.300
That's more than the
annual profits of Exxon,

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.990
Samsung, Apple, and BP combined.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.660
Trafficking is big business.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.849
- 92% percent or 93%
of all trafficking

00:09:40.849 --> 00:09:42.390
is happening in the
developing world.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.610
- Uganda is one of the most
stable countries in East

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.660
Africa, and it's poised, I
believe, to become a regional,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.290
if not continental leader in
the anti-trafficking fight.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.790
- Willow International
partners with organizations

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.350
and governments
all over the world

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.770
to coordinate the rescue of
victims of human trafficking.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.410
We get referrals from
government agencies,

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.380
international agencies,
and other nonprofits

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.300
who work on the
ground in countries

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.970
to ensure that victims are
rescued from situations

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.640
of trafficking, taken
back home, and given

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.690
the services that they need
to heal and be reintegrated

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.230
with families.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.650
By focusing our efforts here,
we are leveraging resources

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.590
and impact to create
change on the global issue

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.600
of human trafficking.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.500
In Uganda, we formed a coalition
of nonprofit organizations

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.190
so that each organization
could focus on their expertise

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.620
and have the greatest
collective impact.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.660
- The reason that
we need coalitions

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.600
to decimate this
problem is that then we

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.350
get multiple views of
what the problem is.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.240
Any one organization
is only going

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.590
to ever see one
piece of the problem

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.640
and is only going to
be able to respond

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.210
in one aspect of the solution.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.500
And if you get everybody
around the table,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.570
you start seeing
aspects of the problem

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.340
that you never saw before.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:59.310
So this complex issue requires
a very diverse and multi-sector

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.060
response.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.550
- And it's about
relationships, so

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.370
that the governmental and the
nongovernmental organizations

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.420
work together.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.420
Police, prosecutors, and
victim service providers,

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.520
as well-- have them
all partner together

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.190
and come to training together
so that they can then

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.167
become a team.

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.250
They have different functions
and different roles,

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.260
but they all have the
same goal, and that's

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.870
the rescue of
enslaved human beings

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.920
and the conviction of people
who are doing the enslaving.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.440
- We provide therapeutic
aftercare services

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.450
to victims of human trafficking.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.630
And what this looks
like is holistic care--

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.990
access to health care,
residential services,

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.810
psychosocial support
through counseling,

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.180
reintegration
services with family,

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.680
and help getting
back on their feet,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.680
whether that's through an
educational scholarship, access

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.760
to a job, or provision of
capital to start up a business.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.890
And our programs work.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.190
The survivors, despite all
that they have gone through,

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.220
send their kids to school,
buy their own houses,

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.220
get full-time jobs, or
start their own businesses

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.820
and go on to lead
full, healthy lives.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.340
- During the last 15 years that
I've been working full time

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.580
in the human trafficking
space, I have seen a lot

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.700
of service-providing
nonprofit organizations,

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.640
and there are few that I have
been impressed with as much

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.230
as Willow.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.120
I have been to Willow's sites.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.770
I have seen their facilities.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.590
I have met the individuals
that work there

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.230
and the individuals
whom they care for.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.060
It is amazing.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.170
It is a place of hope.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.370
It is a place of joy.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.730
It is a place of healing.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.120
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:57.666
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:57.666 --> 00:13:59.290
KELSEY GALAWAY: So
as the video showed,

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.320
we have a model
that we have seen

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.440
is successful in ending
trafficking, spreading

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.380
awareness, preventing
the crime, and providing

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.720
restorative care to those who
have been victimized by it.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.560
And as you see in
the diagram, what

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.400
holds rescue restoration
and reform together

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.180
is collaboration
because no organization,

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.460
no government can do all
of these things perfectly.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.670
And so we have to
learn from one another

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.210
and be more collaborative,
more integrated

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.570
than the traffickers who
are thriving in this crime

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.910
right now.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.180
Restoration is how I got into
this work in the first place,

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.300
working directly with
survivors of trafficking.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.110
And it is amazing to see the
resiliency and the strength

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.170
of people who have been
through the unimaginable.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.010
And our aftercare homes
are places of joy,

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:57.100
and love, and hope,
and we just wanted

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.880
to show you a couple of
photos of what it's like.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.000
This is one of our
homes in Uganda.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.240
Right now, 15 women live there
with their young children

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.950
receiving all of the
services that they

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.610
need to heal and recover from
what they've been through.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.910
This month, we're having a
huge graduation ceremony,

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.850
where women who have
been in our program

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.230
will be reintegrating
back into community

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:24.760
and families and survivors
from past graduating classes

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.050
will be coming back to share
their stories of where they are

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.210
now, how they're
doing, and support

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.780
other survivors in the program.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.550
So it's a real
family environment.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.790
The survivor you saw in the
video was an adult woman.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.430
And we can't show videos of
the children in our program,

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:47.370
but this isn't just adult
women who are being trafficked.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.770
The people in our program are
as young as two years old,

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.380
so this is happening to
very, very young children.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.380
One of the things that many
of our donors and supporters

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.330
find really important
is the impact

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.870
that their dollar can have
in the developing world.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.590
The average cost of a year of
therapeutic aftercare in the US

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.560
is $172,000.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:21.010
And sadly, recidivism rate,
so being re-trafficked--

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.010
the estimates are
70% of victims who

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.230
are rescued are
re-trafficked at least once.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.600
So that is a lot of money
going into these programs.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.630
Our organization-- the average
cost of a year of aftercare

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.950
is only $6,000 and we
have a 95% success rate

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.316
in preventing
revictimization for those who

00:16:41.316 --> 00:16:42.565
have gone through our program.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.910
One of the things that excites
me the most about our work

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.080
is the reform.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.230
So when I got into
this work and started

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.200
by providing aftercare,
what kept me up at night

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.990
was that the organization
I was working for

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.720
wasn't doing anything
to stop the flow.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.880
We weren't cutting
off the pipeline.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.460
We were getting referrals
from community members who

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.310
were identifying girls
who had been trafficked,

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.770
but nothing was happening
to the traffickers.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.069
And when you work in a community
filled with vulnerable people,

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.064
it's just a sea of
vulnerable people

00:17:17.064 --> 00:17:19.750
for traffickers to
bring into that spot

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.410
where the one girl was
rescued was working.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.420
And so when I
founded Willow, this

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.920
was one of the most
important things

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.380
that I wanted to work
on, was figuring out,

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.390
how do we stop the flow?

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:36.040
How do we change the system
so that victims are protected

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.440
and that traffickers
are prosecuted?

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.470
And we have been very
successful with that.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.810
The chief justice who
you saw in the video

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.580
through our advocacy
efforts shared

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.650
that he wants
combating trafficking

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.960
to be a part of his
legacy, and he's

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.590
taking steps to do so,
designating prosecutors

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.240
to fight trafficking.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.090
They are forming a
specialized unit in Uganda

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.600
to combat trafficking.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.500
So it's amazing to see
with a little bit of work

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.750
and having a collaborative
spirit the impact you

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.000
can have on an entire nation.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.840
And it's super cost effective.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.510
This is just conversations,
knocking on doors,

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.360
asking people to
use their resources

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.060
and their influence to protect
other vulnerable people.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.454
And collaboration
is key in this.

00:18:21.454 --> 00:18:23.370
And Shannon and I were
just talking on the way

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.950
over about what
collaboration means to us.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.020
And she asked me, what
does this mean to you?

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:32.130
And collaboration means to me
having the humility to know

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.600
that you don't know everything
and the value of learning,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.610
wanting to learn and
connect with other people

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.740
who have been in
the field longer

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.710
or have various expertise that
could help you reach a shared

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.760
vision.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.100
And this is a map of
our global footprint.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.970
You can see that although
Uganda is a country of only 30

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.360
million people, we have
a huge network that

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.430
consists of rescue
organizations, governments,

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.090
international agencies who
are all working together

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.770
to combat trafficking,
whether that's

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.950
preventing it, prosecuting
traffickers, reforming

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.010
criminal justice systems,
or ensuring that victims

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.330
are rescued and brought home.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.840
And as the famous
Helen Sworn says,

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.290
"a networked problem requires
a networked solution."

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.090
And traffickers are networked.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.410
They figure out in Uganda how to
get a girl from a rural village

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.550
to the city's capital
onto a plane with a visa

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.990
and vaccination forged
documents to get to Thailand.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.240
All of that is done through
collaborative efforts

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.590
of a lot of people.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.450
So if we want to
combat this, we need

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.350
to be more collaborative, more
networked then the traffickers.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.320
And collaboration can
feel like a fluffy word,

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.150
but it's really
not a fluffy thing.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.880
Some of our-- to give
you some examples

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.520
of what collaboration
looks like for us,

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.500
we have rescue
partners in Thailand.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.180
So we connect with organizations
who work with the Thai police

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.840
and Thai government to identify
victims of trafficking,

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.720
get them out of those
situations, and send them home.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.300
So one of those
organizations is NightLight.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.520
And this year, I
would imagine they've

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.520
sent around 20, 25
Ugandan victims who

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.000
have been trafficked to Thailand
back to Uganda to receive

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.640
restorative care and
be reintegrated back

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.540
into communities.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.000
However, we don't
just stop there.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.490
Through our partners in
these other countries,

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.830
we say, hey, how can we
have a bigger impact?

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:32.610
We see this pipeline of Ugandans
being trafficked to Thailand.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.440
What can we do to stop it?

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.140
And so we both approached
the Thai government

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.330
and the Ugandan government
and said, how can we

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.700
support you in combating this?

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.890
And they said,
let's set up a call.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.690
And so what we did
in Uganda, we went

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.060
to one of our pro bono lawyer
partners and said, hey,

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.160
can you donate a
conference room to us?

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.170
We had a Skype call where we
had the Ugandan prosecutor

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.530
for human trafficking, the
lead criminal investigator

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.830
for human trafficking, and the
human trafficking task force

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.650
coordinator on a Skype call
with the Thai government,

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.780
where they developed
solutions together

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.360
to have they could stop
this trafficking syndicate.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.290
They're now developing a mutual
legal assistance agreement,

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.370
where they will start
sharing evidence

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:19.020
to prosecute these traffickers
and stop the global syndicate.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.180
So it's amazing
how simple that is.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.890
When you just get people
in a room and say, hey,

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.220
how can we collaborate
to stop this thing?

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.870
I believe that
through this, we're

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.690
going to see the pipeline
into Thailand from Uganda

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.930
be shut down.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.650
And it really cost us no
more than the salaries

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.190
of the staff who are
working on this project.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.390
We also partner with academia.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.240
So last year, we
did a research on,

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.720
how do we prevent trafficking?

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.850
What do these communities
know about trafficking?

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.940
What are their
attitudes towards it?

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.500
And how do we stop it?

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.840
And that was done
with Yale Law School.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.320
We also partner with Pepperdine
University Law School's Global

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.790
Justice program.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.330
And through that, we've trained
150 judges on the Ugandan

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.920
trafficking law and we educated
150 key government members

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.480
on what trafficking was.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.250
And that's opened
up this floodgate

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.530
of the Ugandan
government's involvement

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:15.400
in wanting to make stopping
trafficking a priority.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.190
The other thing that
we believe is really

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.560
important with collaboration
is collaborating

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.040
with people, donors who want
to dedicate their resources.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.690
They may not want to quit
their day job to stop and join

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.150
a nonprofit or join the
government to stop trafficking,

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.559
but they're passionate about it.

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:32.350
They want to learn.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.810
They want to get involved.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.580
And financial support is a
way that they can do that.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.790
And I think that that
is a key component

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.280
that nonprofit organizations
need to focus on,

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.430
is how do we bring
people who have a heart

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.990
to do this into the work?

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.150
And that is where
Shannon comes in.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.270
And she has created a
really innovative model

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.990
for how donors can
help join the fight

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.940
to combat human trafficking.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.280
She's going to
take it from here.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.474
SHANNON ROGERS: Hi.

00:23:00.474 --> 00:23:01.890
Thanks so much for
having us here.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:02.940
This is just awesome.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.148
It's awesome that you guys
are showing this interest.

00:23:05.148 --> 00:23:09.270
And it's, as Kelsey was
saying, this issue's huge,

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.710
and it's heavy.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.711
And I often am saying to
our members and donors

00:23:13.711 --> 00:23:15.960
because I know they can come
to some of our gatherings

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.730
and feel that weight, when
you're out in the field

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.220
and you're meeting all these
people that are actually

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.060
implementing solutions, and
driving change, and doing it,

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.450
the weight sort of starts
to spread and go away

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.260
because there are some
amazing people out there doing

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.460
amazing work.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.760
And I'm appreciative that
Google is taking the time

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.800
to highlight
somebody like Kelsey

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.122
and what she's doing
with Willow because they

00:23:43.122 --> 00:23:44.580
are one of those
organizations that

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:49.450
are truly doing amazing work
in addressing this big issue.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.800
So I do run Change a Path.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.530
We're a donor circle
that is focused

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:58.020
on supporting
anti-trafficking initiatives,

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.570
really supporting grassroots
organizations in their work

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:02.460
to address these issues.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:08.310
And we do have about 70
members, like you said earlier.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:13.400
But the 70 members that are
involved in their varying ways.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.260
And as you can imagine, in
running a grant making program,

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.720
having 70 members be
involved in those decisions

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:25.210
would not be very
fun or effective.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.220
It would be quite
frustrating, actually.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.150
So we have a committee of five
that does all of our vetting.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:35.740
And a big part of our
vetting is really--

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.600
we've developed our process.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.340
This past year, we gave to 10
organizations about $300,000.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.170
We've funded 14
different organizations

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.600
over the last three years.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.920
And we consider our grantees
partners in this work

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.290
because we view this
as collaborative work.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.670
We think this is so
important to bring everybody,

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.050
all the stakeholders
to the table

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.060
to get people working together.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.850
And to me, it's
a huge compliment

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:07.090
that Kelsey asked me to be
up here with her presenting

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.580
on this because some
organizations do not

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.290
think of funders as partners.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.180
But the reality
is, funders really

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.180
do need to be partners in
this because to be funding

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.922
effectively, to be
funding well, you

00:25:18.922 --> 00:25:20.380
need to be doing
a lot of research.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.921
You need to do all the learning
that Kelsey is talking about.

00:25:22.921 --> 00:25:24.430
So we spend a lot of time.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.220
So we have our processes,
we have our criteria.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.280
But most of our time is
truly spent on learning.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.390
It's meeting organizations,
meeting many people

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.850
in the space and in the
industry doing different things,

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.309
going to conferences.

00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:39.850
I had the good
fortune to meet Kelsey

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.310
at a conference in Bangkok.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.640
And it was like a dream for
me because all of a sudden I'm

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.240
having dinner with Kelsey,
a woman from Bangkok working

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.670
in Bangkok to address
the issues there,

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.180
a woman in Guangzhou to
address the issues in China.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.920
And they're all
talking about how

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.480
to best support
each other, how they

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.230
deal with different situations.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.320
There's so much learning
that needs to happen,

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.800
and we need to provide
platforms and opportunities

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.870
to share all that learning.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:11.890
And as a funder, we
feel like sharing

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.100
that learning is an
important role in what we do.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:20.050
And when I say, that it's not
about talking to organizations

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.790
or grantees and telling
them what they need to do

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.760
or what the best
way is, it truly

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.465
starts from a point
of listening to them.

00:26:27.465 --> 00:26:28.340
What are their needs?

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.010
What are their challenges?

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:31.990
What do they want support with?

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.600
It's not about telling
them, you should do this.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.730
It's about, how do
we best help you?

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.090
And then I can help connect
you to other resources,

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.240
to other people doing this
work, or other models.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.570
When Kelsey started talking
about her prevention program,

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.670
we were able to talk about
some programs in India

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.544
that were doing similar
work, and maybe she'd

00:26:50.544 --> 00:26:51.910
want to go read about them.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.530
That kind of shared
learning is what's

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.920
so critical to
helping organizations

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.720
work in their communities,
but also moving

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:03.070
the whole anti-trafficking
movement forward.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.320
We have a long way to go.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.220
We've learned a lot, but
there's a long way to go

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.119
and a lot of support needed.

00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:12.660
And there's best
practices out there.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.040
There's great-- the
research piece is really

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.810
picking up in a lot of ways.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:22.070
So as a donor, it's about
funding that collaboration,

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.690
funding the new initiatives,
the new ways of doing things,

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:29.530
and exploring different
opportunities.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.770
So we truly believe
that collectively we

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.342
need to do this, and it's about
helping our grantees and even

00:27:36.342 --> 00:27:38.050
the organizations that
we're not funding,

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.940
but we work with
closely, helping

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.520
them expand their network
because the network

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.670
piece is critical.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.580
So it's all about learning.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.850
It's about networking.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:50.950
It's about doing
this collectively

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.030
and collaboratively.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.730
So sorry, I can ramble.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:28:02.230
So I think the
amazing thing I want

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.880
to highlight about Willow--

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.260
and so when we are looking
at organizations to fund,

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:12.040
I think, and Kelsey has a
very collaborative approach

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.130
to doing this.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:15.250
But one of the amazing
things about that

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.100
is what she's doing-- she
gave a couple examples.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.800
She basically is just
knocking on people's doors.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.480
She's asking the questions.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.380
She's getting out there
and pulling other people

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.970
into the conversation.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.287
So when you're talking to
different organizations

00:28:30.287 --> 00:28:32.620
or learning about different
organizations in this space,

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.620
if they think what they're
doing is the only way

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.960
to do it or the best
way, it's a big red flag

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:44.140
because these issues are so
complex and so integrated

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:49.870
into our culture, whether it's
in the US, or Uganda, Bangkok,

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:50.890
anywhere--

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.310
it's happening everywhere.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.640
We need to be out
knocking on doors.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.260
We need to be
engaging more people

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.320
and talking to more
about possible solutions.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.320
And we need to be investing
in different solutions.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.064
So thank you.

00:29:03.064 --> 00:29:04.480
KELSEY GALAWAY:
Shannon, could you

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.511
share a bit about why you
chose a collaborative model

00:29:08.511 --> 00:29:09.010
for funding?

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.310
SHANNON ROGERS: You mean, in
having it be a donor circle?

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.375
KELSEY GALAWAY: Mm-hm.

00:29:17.375 --> 00:29:18.250
SHANNON ROGERS: Yeah.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:22.030
You know, I was first
exposed to a donor circle

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.390
when I was living in Hong Kong.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:27.610
And it was such a brilliant
form of philanthropy

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:31.780
because it engaged people
at the level at which they

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.340
wanted to engage.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.450
And you end up pooling your
money together and granting it

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.360
out in thoughtful,
creative ways,

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.150
and fully vet it so where
your money is going.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.850
I think it so
impressed me because it

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.010
was so efficient,
and so effective,

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.310
and it was collaborative,
and there was a community.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.380
You could create a
community around it.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.690
And when I moved
back to the US, I

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:00.200
wanted to do something similar.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.100
And then I got hit
really hard by the fact

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.457
that you're asked for
money all the time.

00:30:05.457 --> 00:30:07.040
Like, if you have
children in schools,

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.176
you're asked all the time.

00:30:08.176 --> 00:30:10.300
And they're in different
clubs or different sports,

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.760
you're asked all the time.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.030
So I sort of went back a
bit and said, oh, I don't I

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.260
don't want to be another ask.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.600
I don't want to be
involved in that.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.010
But then I realized
that it's such a missed

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.175
opportunity for engagement.

00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:30.042
And especially when it comes
to something like trafficking,

00:30:30.042 --> 00:30:31.750
which was a very strong
interest of mine,

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.374
and I had been
supporting organizations

00:30:33.374 --> 00:30:35.530
in Asia addressing these issues.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:40.640
But it just sort of--

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.300
it was the perfect model to
be addressing those issues

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.280
because it's about
educating more people

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.030
and engaging more people,
while at the same time,

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.160
doing it thoughtfully
and effectively,

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.390
if that is an answer
to your question.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:31:00.520
Because as a community, as
Change a Path has grown,

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.450
we have events, and engage
more and more people

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.510
in talking about the
solutions, and really building

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:08.470
on our knowledge base.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:11.350
And it's been an impactful
organization in that way,

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.015
and creating that community.

00:31:14.015 --> 00:31:14.890
KELSEY GALAWAY: Yeah.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.306
We'll open it up
to questions now.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.869
SHANNON ROGERS: I should
sit on my hands, I think.

00:31:21.869 --> 00:31:23.410
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for sharing.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:27.490
I'm really curious
about the houses

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.780
that you have for everyone to
have this safe place to be.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.890
How do you really ensure that
the survivors are staying safe

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:39.340
and that these locations,
which seem to be a safe haven,

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.820
but that could also be a target
if people know that this is

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.910
a place where people
can be re-trafficked

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:49.430
or stuff like that, so how do
you keep these centers safe?

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:51.460
KELSEY GALAWAY: Yeah,
well one of the--

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.850
in establishing
safety for anyone,

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.390
having clear boundaries
and expectations

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.110
is super important.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:03.050
So when any survivor
comes into our program,

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.260
they have a case
manager who briefs them

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.236
through an orientation.

00:32:06.236 --> 00:32:07.610
These are the
rules of the house.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:09.452
These are the rules
of the program.

00:32:09.452 --> 00:32:10.660
This is how we keep you safe.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.190
This is when the gate closes.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.530
This is when you
need to be indoors.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.530
So we have clear protocols
for safety for each house,

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:22.100
depending on if it's children,
adults, adults with children.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.610
We also have 24/7 security.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:27.010
And so two of our
homes right now

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.410
have armed police because of
the severity of the situation.

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:34.420
So if we get a referral
from the government of cases

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.490
and we assess it
as a high risk, we

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.960
ask for police guards
to be on the property.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.670
And they are highly
trained, very professional.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.665
We have a really good working
relationship with the police

00:32:44.665 --> 00:32:46.690
that we work with
because they give us

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.120
the highly-trained
people who understand

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.456
working in protecting children.

00:32:52.456 --> 00:32:55.072
Does that answer your question?

00:32:55.072 --> 00:32:55.900
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.150
Thank you for giving
your presentation--

00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.170
very interesting.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:03.820
I was wondering with
regards to corroboration,

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:08.650
what is it that companies
like YouTube or Google can do?

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:10.480
Do these victims
ever have access

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.440
to internet whilst they
are being trafficked?

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.629
Are there any touch points
with any of our products?

00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:18.670
KELSEY GALAWAY: I know
that Google is doing a lot

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:19.930
to fight human trafficking.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:21.760
They have helped
fund and collaborate

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.930
to start help lines.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:24.430
I know that they
work with Polaris,

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:27.280
which is the national
hotline here in the US,

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.320
which is a super easy number.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.680
If you do see a victim of
trafficking, look up Polaris,

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.810
and that's the number
that you can call.

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.160
You can even text.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.510
So Google is doing
a lot to do this.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.710
And I think they do it in a
way that's very thoughtful.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.110
I always call Shannon
a thoughtful donor

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.360
because she researches.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.114
She tries to understand the
needs of the organizations

00:33:49.114 --> 00:33:49.780
in the movement.

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.020
And from what I know about
Google, they're doing the same.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.390
They're doing this
work very thoughtfully

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:56.830
and partnering
with organizations

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.540
who are doing it really well.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:03.970
I think where we could step it
up is just more people getting

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:06.020
involved, and more
employees at Google saying,

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.570
this is really important to me.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:08.750
Let's give more money.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.510
Let's do more projects.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:13.000
And then, having really
long conversations,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.949
strategy sessions
with organizations,

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.949
asking what those needs are
because the needs really do

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:22.460
need to be contextualized for
the region, the demographic,

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.040
the type of
trafficking that it is.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:27.960
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.620
I'd like to know what life
can be like after slavery

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.020
for these women.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.480
KELSEY GALAWAY: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.560
Most people who come to
our aftercare programs

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.280
are really shocked by what
they see because they're not

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.929
expecting the joy
and the laughter that

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:50.550
exists in our aftercare home.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:54.600
So it is incredibly
difficult to heal

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.230
from the trauma of trafficking.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.280
It really is.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.040
But what the survivors
in our program

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.370
often tell us is that what's
even more difficult to heal

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:05.610
from is the vulnerabilities
and the exploitation

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.070
that led up to them being
trafficked-- broken family

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:12.450
relationships,
previous sexual abuse.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:15.660
But through therapy,
through counseling,

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.730
through being in a
loving environment, where

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:21.210
you are supported and
loved just as you are,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.640
through building a
social support network--

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.050
one of the other
programs we have

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:26.790
is a survivor support group.

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.680
So we facilitate
this, where they

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.410
can come together and
share how they've coped,

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:35.280
managing triggers,
reintegrating back into society.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.350
That's been one of
their favorite programs,

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:40.050
that when we ask, what's
working, they say,

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.150
survivor support
group is amazing.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.780
So life after trafficking,
yes, it's difficult.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.880
Yes, it's a painful
thing to heal from.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.950
But there is so much hope.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.740
There is so much
restoration possible.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:57.030
And gosh, these people we work
with are incredibly resilient.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:00.480
Many of them have gone on to
even work for the organization

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.400
or become advocates
for the cause.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.860
When we had the first
trafficking conference

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.950
in Uganda, six
survivors were on stage

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.760
and shared their stories because
they said, this happened to us,

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.402
and we never want this to
happen to another human being.

00:36:15.402 --> 00:36:16.860
That's why we're
sharing our story.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.250
Even though it's painful,
they become advocates

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.580
and want to protect
other people.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys so much
for sharing everything with us.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.410
I'd love to know
more, just about

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:38.840
the experience of these
people in the center.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.440
How long do they usually stay?

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.750
And also, are you guys
usually at capacity?

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.570
Are you like turning
away referrals?

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.450
Do you sort of help
them find jobs?

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:50.310
Just more details about that
would be super interesting.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.310
KELSEY GALAWAY: Yeah,
our programs are all--

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.900
we do individualized
case management,

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:59.420
which is a long way of saying
that every survivor who

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.450
comes into our program
creates an individualized case

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:05.000
plan with a social
worker and counselor.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.490
So we don't say, you
have six months to heal

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:08.570
and you're out the door.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.690
It really is contextualized
to the individual's needs.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:13.790
It looks at their
family of origin.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.220
What was going on before
they were trafficked?

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.170
Is it a safe home to
return to, or do we

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:21.470
need to find a distant relative
who has a safe home who's

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:23.300
willing to take
them in, or do we

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.180
need to prepare them for
a life of self-sufficiency

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:31.160
and creating a new
community for them?

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.530
Other factors are
the level of trauma

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:34.740
that they're experiencing.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.420
So some survivors that we work
with in labor trafficking cases

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.730
are actually coming
back so traumatized

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.110
that they're non-verbal.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:43.970
Some of them are unable
to speak or share

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.330
what's happened to them.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.690
So those cases might be
with us for a longer period

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.640
of time because of
the intense treatment

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.220
that's required
to heal from that.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.500
What was the second
part of your question?

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:54.785
SHANNON ROGERS: Employment?

00:37:54.785 --> 00:37:56.150
AUDIENCE: Do you have
to turn people away?

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:57.175
KELSEY GALAWAY: Oh, yes.

00:37:57.175 --> 00:38:00.260
AUDIENCE: Are you guys
fully at capacity usually?

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.320
KELSEY GALAWAY: Yep, so our
residential homes are usually

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.940
at capacity, and those are
our restorative safe homes.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.240
It is a constant thing that
we're always fundraising for.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.490
We opened a third home this
year to meet the demand.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.220
But in addition
to opening a home,

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.070
we started a community-based
care program.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.680
And this has been really
effective in other countries.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.660
Not every survivor
of trafficking

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.490
needs to live in a safe home.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.410
Some women coming back
from other countries

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.840
had three or four children
before they were trafficked.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.630
And they just want to get
home, and be with their kids,

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.070
and be with their families.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:37.370
So for those cases, we
provide external services.

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.430
So our mobile social work
team either goes to them

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.790
to provide the services or we
provide transportation for them

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:44.600
to come to us.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.330
So we've been able to
scale through that program,

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:51.230
but we're constantly fundraising
so that we can meet the demand.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.620
And I know that that's true for
every aftercare organization

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.700
that I've ever talked to.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.500
And then, in terms
of employment,

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.520
that's a great way to
spotlight collaboration.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.410
We right now have
it an organization

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.357
called International Sanctuary.

00:39:05.357 --> 00:39:06.440
Shannon's wearing one of--

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.265
SHANNON ROGERS:
Necklaces or bracelets.

00:39:07.265 --> 00:39:09.098
KELSEY GALAWAY: --jewelry
that they've made.

00:39:09.098 --> 00:39:11.750
They employ 20
survivors in our program

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:15.630
full time to make jewelry
and also learn job skills--

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.580
getting to work on time,
conflict management.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.290
It's been an incredible
program for our survivors.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:26.030
Some of them stay in that
job for a couple years.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.172
Some of them get some
start-up capital,

00:39:28.172 --> 00:39:29.630
and then start a
business that they

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.190
dreamed of doing before
they were trafficked.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.160
So employment is huge.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.040
And it's one of the things
that we rely heavily

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.110
for collaboration on.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:42.320
We are actually traveling
out to Uganda next month

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.110
with an organization called
Open Gates International.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:48.380
And they start culinary
institutes and then

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.330
corresponding bakeries
or restaurants

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:53.905
that employ survivors as well.

00:39:53.905 --> 00:39:55.280
LINDSEY: I just
want to thank you

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:01.820
so much for taking so much
initiative with this topic

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.190
and this organization.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.780
And that's what
collaboration is all about.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.380
And it takes people who take
initiative to make it happen.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:14.480
So thank you so much for
today and for helping

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.390
with everything we do.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.110
SHANNON ROGERS: Thank you.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:21.470
And that's probably
a good transition

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:25.310
because Google Giving Week
kicks off again in a few weeks.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:30.320
November 26, I will be
running a campaign for Willow

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.100
again this year.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.840
So if anybody wants to
sponsor with me, I'd love it.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.050
Or we're going to get our
donation credit again,

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:42.020
hopefully, this year,
so consider Willow

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:42.960
during that week.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.150
So thank you guys
for being here.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.390
And of course ping me,
email me if you guys

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.400
want to get more involved.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.510
Thank you.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.260
