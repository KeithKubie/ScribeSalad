00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: My name's Scott Giambastiani.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.560
I'm one of the chefs here at Google.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.560
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.020
In a couple of minutes, I wanted to introduce
Barb Stuckey, but before that, I'd like to

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.030
give a little bit of background on why she's
here today.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.120
[clears throat]
Barb Stuckey has been a food industry professional

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.340
for the last 20 years.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.180
She spent her formative years in a Chinese
restaurant with her best friend's parents,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.570
outside of Baltimore.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.480
After college, Barb learned that the food
service business from the vantage point of

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.370
Kraft, back then General Foods, also Brinker
International, the company that operates Chili's,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.980
Macaroni Grill, and Corner Bakery, as well
as Whole Foods.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.150
She later earned a graduate degree from Cornell
University Hotel School.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.650
Barb is currently executive vice president
for marketing at Mattson in Foster City, the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.149
country's largest independent developer of
foods and beverages for the chain restaurant

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.120
and retail food industries.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.840
Barb is known as the food trend, innovator,
consumer, insights, and product development

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.860
expert.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.950
Throughout her career, she's written articles
for journals such as The Morning Cup, and

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.290
industry newsletter distributed to about 6000
plus food executives, and Culinary Currents.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.630
[clears throat] She also wrote the opinion
pieces for the San Francisco Chronicle and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.400
Q&amp;A column for Chow Magazine, now known as
chow.com.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.530
In 2008, she was awarded co-authorship of
the opening chapter, the business of new product

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.560
development of the first textbook to be published
for the Research Chef's Association.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.510
When published in 2012, it will be called
Applied Cornology.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.740
The blending of culinary arts and food science
and technology in food product development.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.680
More importantly, now, today, she's here with
us.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.729
Barb's daily job at Mattson requires her to
taste food and figure out how to make it better.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.259
After more than a decade of doing this, she's
honed her tasting skills, which she's going

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.340
to show you to do today, and shares this insight
through the science of taste that's written

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.850
to the general public.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.150
It's my pleasure to welcome, for the first
time to Google, Barb Stuckey.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.150
[applause]

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.300
&gt;&gt;Barb Stuckey: Thank you.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.300
Thanks.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.849
Thanks for that welcome, Scott.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.340
Now I've lost my-- oh, here we go.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.150
Thanks to Google for having me.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.560
I'm going to get started in just a second,
but most importantly, I need five guinea pig,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.980
I mean volunteers, to experience the sensory
demo with me.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.849
I got one, two, three.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.280
I need two more.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.280
Four, five.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.950
Okay, if you guys would come take a seat up
front, and on your way up, if you would take

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.840
a tasting plate.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.090
We're going to-- Everybody else in the audience
is going to experience these experiments vicariously

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.349
through your five colleagues.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.910
Yes, you can put it on the plate.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.030
And then, afterwards, if there's any of these
experiments that they're going to do that

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.080
you'd like to do, you can hang after.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.470
I've got some extras.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.170
All right.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.440
So I'm going to tell you a little bit more
about me, myself, and then I'm going to tell

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.830
you why I wrote this book called Taste What
You're Missing.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.459
Then we're going to go into the content of
the book, which is basically about how we

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.459
taste.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.459
We're going to do some experiments.

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.490
And then at the end, I'll have a little bit
of time for questions and answers.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.490
Okay.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.490
A little bit about me.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.310
You heard from Scott that I have pretty much
spent my entire career in food.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.620
I am now a professional food developer.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.030
--You can put them on your laps and relax.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.060
[laughs]-- I am a professional food developer.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.989
Our development labs are in Foster City, about
20 miles north of here.

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.950
We work for some of the largest multinational
food companies in the world, like Kraft and

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.239
Kellogg's, and General Mills, Starbucks, McDonald's.

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.140
And then we work for small start-up food businesses,
entrepreneurs who want to introduce new foods,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.939
food businesses.

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:16.810
My job is to come up with these food business
ideas and then to work with my colleagues,

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.150
who are food technologists and chefs, and
in the case of about 10 of them, they are

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.440
both food technologists and chefs, they have
dual degrees.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.560
My job is to take these ideas that exist in
my head and tell them how to make them come

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.810
to life.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.310
We do that through a process we call protosepting.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.660
In the process of protosepting, I found myself
side by side with my food technologists and

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.880
chef colleagues, 15 years ago when I started
in this business, not knowing what the hell

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.440
was happening.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:57.630
Why would I taste something that was as simple
as a tortilla chip and say, "Yeah, I like

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.410
B better than A and C." And they would taste
that same tortilla chip and they would get

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.030
so much more sensory output from it.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.560
So I set out looking for a book.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.620
I was looking for this book that would explain
to me what was happening when I put food in

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.540
my mouth and chew and swallow.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.990
I looked and I looked and I looked.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.030
That book did not exist.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.490
So I ended up having to learn through a painful
process of experience, what was happening

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.550
as I was tasting in the lab.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.330
About five years ago, I decided that that
book that I'd wanted 15 years ago, I was going

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.330
to write it.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.160
I set out on a process of doing some research
into this field of sensory science.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.970
That's the result.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.210
My book is the result of that experience.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.259
The book is called Taste What You're Missing.

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.130
It's basically about how we taste.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.790
There are three sections to the book.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.400
The first one is about the five senses, because
we don't really think about the fact that

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.069
food and eating is a multisensory experience.

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.350
We say it's about taste: I like the taste
of something.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.811
Well, actually, if you like the taste of chocolate,
for example, you like the way it looks, you

00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:19.591
like the way it feels, you like the way it
sounds, you like the way it smells, and you

00:06:19.591 --> 00:06:21.979
like the way it tastes.

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.930
The second part of the book then goes into
great depth about our sense of taste.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:33.910
There are only five things that human beings
can detect using only that one sense: sweet,

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.270
sour, bitter, salt, and umami.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.120
If it's not one of those five things, you're
not using your sense of taste alone.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:50.389
So chocolate that I mentioned, the taste of
chocolate is sweet and bitter, perhaps a little

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.660
bit sour.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.660
That's it.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.949
It's the only tastes you get from chocolate.

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:00.690
Everything else that's happening that makes
chocolate so wonderful: the melting quality

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.680
of chocolate, which just happens to melt at
human body temperature, precisely at human

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.490
body temperature, that's the texture of it.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:14.340
The aromas of the roasty, toasty, beany notes,
that's the smell of it.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.210
And of course, it makes a sound when we snap
it.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.710
Visually, it should look beautifully dark
and glossy and chocolatey.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.690
The end of the book brings all these things
together: your five senses, the five basic

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:32.241
tastes, and then layers onto it other stuff
that impacts the way you experience food:

00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:38.889
of course your culture, your personality,
your experience, and your brain.

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:40.120
Okay.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.789
We're going to start now, go through each
one of the five senses.

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:49.930
I'm going to start with-- I told you, there
are only five things that we can taste.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:55.229
I'm going to tell you a little bit of a story
about how I came to appreciate my sense of

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:56.229
taste.

00:07:56.229 --> 00:08:01.440
Now you have to go back with me to Foster
City, in the lab, a couple of years ago.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.060
We had been hired by this company to develop
new appetizers for the restaurant industry.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.620
This is my job, to think up new appetizers
that haven't been done.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.470
I new right away what I wanted to do.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.910
I grew up in Baltimore.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.970
My dad used to grow tomatoes.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:21.870
I wanted to do fried green tomatoes, which
he used to make every Sunday for breakfast.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.190
So I enlisted one of my chefs to start prototyping
this.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:31.250
It turns out, because we were going to sell
these in huge quantities, frozen, that sliced

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.319
green tomatoes were too flimsy and too wet.

00:08:33.319 --> 00:08:34.570
They weren't going to work.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.919
So she said, "What if we do fried green cherry
tomatoes?"

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.130
"All right, let's try that."

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.339
Then my chef came back to me and said, "You
know what, we can't find the green ones.

00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:45.450
I can only get red ones to start prototyping.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.070
Is that okay?"

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:52.800
So I said, "All right: fried red cherry tomatoes.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.560
Let's try it."

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.420
We decided we would put a cornmeal crust on
it.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.230
I get a page one day, and it says, "Barb,
please come to the lab.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.350
The prototype is ready for you to taste."

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.050
Now this is my favorite part of my job.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.990
This is when the idea that exists up here
comes to life and I get to taste it.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.930
I walk into the lab.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:20.760
My chef is dropping these beautiful cornmeal-crusted
cherry tomatoes into the fryer.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.430
They're bubbling around in the fryer, and
they're golden-coated.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:28.480
I know this is going to be a great idea.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:35.310
Just as she pulls the basket out of the fryer,
shakes it, I reach my hand into the basket

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:41.870
to grab one of these lovely prototypes and
put it in my mouth, I hear her start to scream.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:54.050
[screams] [laughter] That 375 degree cherry
tomato, I spit it out across the room, along

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.970
with the roof of my mouth.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.300
[laughter] My entire tongue was traumatized.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.110
Burned off a lot of taste buds.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.210
I thought, "There goes my tasting career.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.330
I'm a professional taster who can't taste.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.290
What am I going to do?"

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:20.192
Well, lucky for me, taste is such an important
sense that these taste buds that I burned

00:10:20.192 --> 00:10:23.680
off would regenerate in 10 to 14 days.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.390
In fact, they're constantly regenerating on
your tongue, every 10 to 14 days.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.600
Taste is a contact sense.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.600
Think about it.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.430
Food has to be in contact with your tongue
for you to be able to experience it.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:41.839
That's different than the sense of smell or
hearing or sight, which can happen from a

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:42.839
distance.

00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:44.930
But taste has to be a contact sense.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:49.760
So it's important that these taste buds on
your tongue work.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.850
We also found out very recently that there
are taste buds in your gut.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:11:01.000
Now, not just food sensor receptors down there,
but actual taste buds.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.649
Of course, this makes good intuitive sense
when you think about it, because your stomach

00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:08.360
needs to know what to do with the food you've
just eaten.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.920
It needs to tell your body how to start digesting
it.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.070
So it would make sense that it says, "Oh,
there's some sweetness here" or "There's some

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.070
protein here."

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:22.450
Now I'm going to talk a little bit about this
very important sense.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:27.880
There are three things that determine your
taster type.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.230
Your taster type is how you experience the
taste world.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.779
Each one of us experiences the taste world
very, very, very differently.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:40.420
But remember, I'm only talking about this
one sense.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.200
We'll get to the other senses later.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.510
The three things that impact your taster type
are your anatomy, your genetics, and your

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.490
personal history.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.490
Let's start with anatomy.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:55.060
When I'm talking about anatomy, I'm talking
about the anatomy of your tongue.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.120
This is my fiancé's tongue.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.290
He has dyed it blue with blue food coloring,
which you can do at home with your friends

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.660
or your kids.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.779
Just take a little McCormick blue food coloring
and paint your tongue with it.

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:07.779
[laughter] Okay.

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:11.649
So your tongue is painted blue, and you've
got these little taste buds that are going

00:12:11.649 --> 00:12:12.649
to pop up.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:16.661
You want to take a reinforcement and put it
on your tongue and count the taste buds in

00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:18.339
that little circle.

00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:23.700
What you're looking for is the density of
taste buds on your tongue, because the density

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:31.959
of taste buds indicates whether or not you
are a hypertaster or what some people call

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:33.829
a supertaster.

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:36.730
Some people have this incredible density of
taste buds.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.430
Their entire tongue is densely packed with
these taste buds.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:44.899
Then some people at the other end of the spectrum
have just a few dotted around.

00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:51.620
This person, whose tongue is covered with
taste buds, will experience the tastes as

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:58.130
three times as intense as the person who has
less taste buds.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.310
Imagine that you've got all these taste buds.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:06.050
Something that's bitter to you is going to
be much more bitter than it is to someone.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.440
Salty is saltier, sweet is sweeter, spicy
is spicier.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.480
We know this by counting the taste buds on
your tongue.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.440
[scraping sound]
I've offered-- I've asked these volunteers

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440
to come up.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.240
We're going to paint their tongues-- No, I'm
kidding, we're not.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.360
We're not going to paint their tongues, but
we're going to talk about the next thing,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:31.850
which correlates with the anatomy of your
tongue, and that is a genetic marker for supertaster

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.360
or hypertaster.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.700
In one of your cups, you should have a little
white strip.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.130
This is a strip that is-- Do you have one?

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.130
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Yes.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.130
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Okay.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:47.649
This is a strip that is impregnated with a
specific compound that will tell you whether

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:53.320
or not you fall into this hypertaster category,
with lots of taste buds on your tongue and

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.470
the genetic disposition to be able to taste
bitter things, or in the middle, where most

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:03.070
people exist, or on the end which I called
tolerant tasters.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.130
It means that you don't have a lot of taste
buds, and you're very tolerant of bitter taste.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.490
Go ahead and take that piece of paper, stick
it in your mouth, and just put it in your

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.700
mouth, close your mouth, and just suck on
it for a couple seconds.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.980
Now I'd like you to tell me.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.331
Put it in your mouth for-- just don't swallow
it.

00:14:20.331 --> 00:14:22.230
Just put it on your tongue.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:30.240
[laughter] On a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being
"Tastes like paper" 10 being "It's the most

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.350
intense thing I've ever experienced."

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:39.360
Give me a number between 0, paper, and 10,
most intense thing I've ever experienced.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.120
Okay, take it out now.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.040
Some of you probably hate me.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.620
There's a cracker there you can cleanse your
palate with.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.850
Anyone have a really, really intense experience
there?

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:50.940
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Yes.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:51.940
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Moderate?

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.500
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Yeah, a little bit above moderate.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.500
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: And what did you taste?

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.500
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Bitter.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.500
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Bitter.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.500
Anyone else taste bitter?

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.500
Yes?

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.500
A little bitter?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.500
Okay.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.250
I think everybody on our panel is a taster,
which means that they, like the majority of

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:11.089
the population, fall in this middle group
of people that have a good number of taste

00:15:11.089 --> 00:15:14.470
buds on their tongue.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:19.730
The last thing that indicates your taster
type is your personal history.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:24.710
Now that I've told you about my trauma with
the tomato, there are other things you can

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.120
do that traumatize your mouth.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.350
There are surgeries or viruses that you might
have had that can damage your taste nerves.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.330
If you've had your wisdom teeth pulled, for
example.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.269
When you have your wisdom teeth pulled, it
happens very close to one of the taste nerves,

00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:41.120
the chorda tympani nerve.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:47.070
That, if you snip it, can take out taste in
the front part of your mouth.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.990
If you've had ear infections as a kid.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:55.850
If you had those recurrent ear infections,
that may have damaged your taste nerve.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:00.880
There's a lot of things that can go into your
personal experience that are going to layer

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.870
on top of your genetics and your anatomy.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.560
Okay.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.200
So now we're going to move onto more pleasant
tastes.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.940
We're going to start with sweet.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:20.490
Taste-- Let me just say for a minute, the
sense of taste is so important that we wire

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:25.440
it so that it's constantly regenerating.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.670
We call taste the deciding sense.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:33.259
You put a food in your mouth, you have to
make a decision whether or not you're going

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:34.290
to swallow it.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.600
You swallow it, you get nourished.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.400
You spit it out, you don't.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.720
You swallow something that's poisonous, you
can kill yourself.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.350
You spit it out, you don't.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.509
Taste is about making decisions.

00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:49.470
Smell, on the other hand, is about enjoyment.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.839
We're going to talk about smell in a minute.

00:16:52.839 --> 00:16:54.970
But, back to taste.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:55.970
Sweet.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.330
We know that babies are born loving sweet.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.670
They come out of the womb, you can put a little
sugar in their mouth, and they will light

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:03.670
up.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.670
Love sugar.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.300
Why are we wired this way?

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.699
Why do we love sugar?

00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:09.150
Why do we love the taste "sweet?"

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.010
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Energy?

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.260
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Absolutely.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.850
It's a flashing neon sign for calories.

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.540
Sweet equals calories.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:25.819
If, God forbid, there was a little baby crawling
around back when we were cavemen, looking

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:30.510
for food in any way, shape, or form we could
get it, you find something sweet, a little

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.990
baby finds something sweet, they can nourish
themselves.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.980
So we're wired from the get-go to like sweet.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.760
Sour.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.320
This one's a little bit more complicated.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.679
Why do you think we can detect sour?

00:17:44.679 --> 00:17:47.520
What is it that sour communicates to us?

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.059
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Vitamin C.

00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:50.210
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Vitamin C?

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:51.670
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Not ripe.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.670
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Not ripe!

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.670
Yes.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.670
Exactly.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:55.910
You're the first person I've ever gotten that
from.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.100
I've given this to hundreds and hundreds of
people.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.220
That's exactly right.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:05.130
If you take an apple off the tree, you take
a bite of it and it's too sour, might give

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.190
you stomachache.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:11.990
Well, not only that, but at the point where
that sweetness and the sourness in the apple

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.540
are at that perfect balance where you take
the bite and you go, "That's a good apple",

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.170
that is when the apple is at its nutritional
peak.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.419
It has the highest level of micro-nutrients.

00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:26.290
After that point, it starts to decline.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.970
It's an indicator of ripeness, exactly right.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.570
What else does sour do?

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.360
What does it tell us?

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.530
When the milk goes bad, it goes what?

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:36.530
&gt;&gt;audience: Sour.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.530
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Sour.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.530
Right.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.600
So it's a spoilage mechanism.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.100
It's a spoilage indicator.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:46.419
You taste something that's not supposed to
be sour and it's sour, you don't eat it.

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:48.169
Protective.

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:49.919
Bitter.

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:51.300
Now let's talk about bitter.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.580
My people that are sitting up here just experienced
bitter.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.240
What is it about bitter that we need to know?

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.950
Why do we innately reject bitter?

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.860
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Poisonous.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.130
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Poisonous.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.130
Exactly.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.200
Most poisons taste bitter.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:14.520
What's even more interesting, though, is most
bitter things are poisonous in the right quantity.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.920
So you say, "What a second, I drink coffee,
that's bitter.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.920
I drink red wine, that's bitter.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.360
They're not poisonous."

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:27.289
They're not, but the compounds in those foods
that make them bitter, if you ate enough of

00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:29.179
those compounds, you could die.

00:19:29.179 --> 00:19:34.830
Of course, you'd have to eat a lot of coffee,
you have a drink a lot of red wine.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.039
So we generally don't ingest enough.

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:46.440
But what bitter indicates is that there's
something happening pharmaceutically or there's

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.429
some medicinal thing going on.

00:19:49.429 --> 00:19:55.360
There are bioactives that are good for us
in certain doses, maybe not so good for us

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.840
in megadoses.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:03.100
Most medicines what taste bitter, bitter medicine.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:09.169
That's because the compounds in there that
are bioactive are tasting bitter.

00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:11.980
&gt;&gt;Male #4: What about Brussels sprouts?

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:12.980
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: What about Brussels sprouts?

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.980
Pardon?

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:14.980
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Why are they bitter?

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.960
I haven't heard of anyone overdosing and dying--

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:23.429
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: [laughs] You'd have to eat a lot
of Brussels sprouts in order to overdose on

00:20:23.429 --> 00:20:24.429
Brussels sprouts.

00:20:24.429 --> 00:20:27.040
In fact, so much so that I don't think you
could physically get there.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.030
It would be so uncomfortable for you and everyone
around you.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.380
[laughter] So you just don't want to go there.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.590
[laughs] The compound in it, though, if you
extracted that, that's what I'm talking about.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:37.590
Yes?

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:41.370
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Is it the same with spinach or
green leafy vegetables?

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.370
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Yes.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:43.370
Most green, leafy vegetables, yeah.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:48.270
All the things in food that make them healthy
and good for you are bitter.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:53.600
I know this because we do a lot of work at
Mattson in fortifying foods with things like

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.110
antioxidants and polyphenols and flavonols.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.919
All of those things taste extremely bitter.

00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:01.299
Salt.

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:08.270
When we're born, we can't taste salt.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:12.039
Come out of the womb, and we do not have the
mature salt receptor.

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:18.080
Now this terrible story about how we found
out that this is the case is that in Australia,

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.650
they used to mix baby formula.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.929
So they'd mix the sugar with the baby formula
and feed it to the kids.

00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:30.520
Well, at this hospital, someone mistakenly
sugar with the formula and fed it to the babies.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.880
They drank it like they just drank their normal
formula.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.880
Didn't reject it.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.980
You know when babies don't want something.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.990
They will let you know that they don't want
it.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.159
No response whatsoever from the babies.

00:21:41.159 --> 00:21:47.429
The babies drank this incredibly salty formula,
and some of them died from salt poisoning.

00:21:47.429 --> 00:21:50.350
Horrible, horrible story.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.640
But we learned that we don't have mature salt
receptors.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.260
But then, at a certain age, they kick in.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.070
And boy, do they kick in.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:02.020
We love our salt.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.640
Salt obviously provides sodium.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:10.549
We need sodium for our cell function.

00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:15.590
We also need things like calcium, which we
don't really crave in the same way.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:19.990
We need a lot of other micronutrients that
we don't crave in the same way.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.100
Why do we crave salt this way?

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.059
The way that we do?

00:22:24.059 --> 00:22:30.299
The reason is we don't have a way to store
sodium in our bodies.

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:33.140
You can take in calcium in your diet, you
can store it in your bones, you can store

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.170
it in your teeth.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:39.180
You take in some sodium, and you can store
it through water retention, but eventually,

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.180
you'll lose it.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:46.140
You'll lose it through crying and sweating
and other excretion from your body.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.280
You constantly need to replenish your body
with sodium.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:56.540
Of course, that was a hangover from old times
when we used to have to really, really seek

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.540
out sodium.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.090
Today, we have easy access to sodium, and
we don't sweat as much, I guess we don't cry

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.919
as much, so we don't lose as much.

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:07.860
Now we're taking in more sodium than we need.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:13.960
You have-- One of your clear cups is labeled
"S", and this is salt.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.040
I want you to just take a sip of the salt
water and remind yourselves what salt water

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.040
tastes like.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.350
This is going to be important in a minute.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:26.590
I find that most people understand four of
the five basic tastes: the sweet, the salt,

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.470
the bitter, the sour.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:34.590
But we're going to get to the last one, umami,
in a minute, which people are a little confused

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.590
about.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.590
Okay.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:37.590
Salt water.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.590
What does it taste like?

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.590
Go ahead, take a sip.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:40.590
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Drink it?

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.370
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: No, no, no, you don't have to--
[laughs] Just take enough that you can taste

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:44.370
the salt in it.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:45.370
Can you taste it?

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:46.370
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Yes.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.370
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Yes.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.370
Okay.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.419
That's calibrating your palate.

00:23:49.419 --> 00:23:53.210
Calibrating your palate at a certain sodium
level.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.210
Now we're going to move on.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.210
Ah, no, we're not.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:58.320
I wanted to tell you one more thing about
salt, which is-- and I write about this in

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.320
the book.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.029
I have a chapter on each of the basic tastes.

00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:04.230
I call salt the superhero of taste.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.429
It is amazing what salt can do.

00:24:06.429 --> 00:24:08.710
I mean, I don't really need to tell people
salt's amazing.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.039
We know it's really good.

00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:12.110
But the way it works is so cool.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:17.170
The first thing that salt does is that when
you salt a food, take a tomato, for example,

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.539
you upset the cellular balance of that tomato.

00:24:20.539 --> 00:24:27.550
What happens is it forces these aroma compounds
out of the cells into the air.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:33.809
By salting food, you are giving it more aroma,
which gives it more flavor.

00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:39.640
Salt not just adds saltiness, it really does
give food more flavor.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.450
The other thing that salt does is-- I call
it the superhero because it suppresses the

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.260
bad guys and it lets the good guys run free.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.580
The bad guys of taste being bitter, of course.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:56.940
A little bit of salt suppresses the bitterness
of something and allows the sweetness, the

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.200
good taste, to come forward.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.260
I've got a little wedge of grapefruit there.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:08.940
I recommend you go home and take a grapefruit,
cut it into wedges, put some salt in a bowl,

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.940
and sprinkle salt on half of the wedges.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.799
Take the other half of the wedges, take that
same bowl of salt, add a little touch-- same

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:21.050
bowl of sugar, add a little touch of salt,
and then sprinkle that.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:25.780
Taste the one with the sugar on it, and it
will taste nice and sweet with a balance of

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:30.230
the salt and the bitter that's naturally present
in the grapefruit.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.669
Then you go to the one that has a little bit
of salt added to the sugar.

00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:40.970
It will taste sweeter because the salt is
suppressing the bitterness and letting the

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.919
sweetness come forward.

00:25:42.919 --> 00:25:45.990
So salt is really the superhero of taste.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.380
&gt;&gt;Female: Quick question.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.722
When it comes to cooking, then, does that
mean you should only salt at the very end?

00:25:53.722 --> 00:25:54.722
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: That's a good question.

00:25:54.722 --> 00:25:58.390
The question was: should you salt food only
at the end?

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.490
Salting the food in the middle of the cooking
process will help marry the flavors.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:08.100
So yes, I would suggest salting during the
cooking process, but saving some of the salt

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.929
so that you do have the ability to do it at
the table.

00:26:10.929 --> 00:26:14.180
So I would never add all the salt that you
want in the recipe.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.390
You want to leave a little bit of it out so
you can add it at the very last minute.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:23.000
Any of those volatile aroma compounds that
are left will be forced out and into the air.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.179
That will give you more aroma, the food more
aroma.

00:26:26.179 --> 00:26:27.179
Okay.

00:26:27.179 --> 00:26:29.250
Now the fifth basic taste, which is umami.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:36.640
Umami, of course, is a Japanese word for which
we don't have a really good translation.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.010
We call it brothy or meaty or savory.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:46.159
We don't have a really good way of describing
this taste, so we borrow the Japanese word.

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:49.409
I'm going to ask our panelists here.

00:26:49.409 --> 00:26:51.400
Take the cup with the "U" on it.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.179
That is our umami water.

00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:58.050
I've matched the sodium level in the umami
water so I'm going to ask you guys to describe

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.050
it.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.050
What does it taste like?

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.050
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Seaweed.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.050
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Seaweed?

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:03.050
Yeah.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:04.050
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Tasty.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.050
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Tasty?

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:06.050
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Kombu.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.050
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Kombu.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.050
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Savory.

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.050
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Savory.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:10.050
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Disgusting.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:11.050
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Disgusting.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.600
[laughs] [laughter] Yeah, it's really odd,
isn't it?

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.350
It's very odd.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:19.570
The reason I do this exercise is that most
of the time when we taste umami, it's in the

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.549
presence of a whole lot of other things.

00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:25.230
There's aroma that goes along with it, there's
color, there's texture.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:30.560
What this exercise does is really let you
separate salt from umami, which people get

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.580
confused about.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.310
A lot of people will say it tastes like broth.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:39.010
It might taste like Dashi or it might taste
like chicken broth.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:44.159
What is giving the umami its umami-ness is
free glutamates.

00:27:44.159 --> 00:27:50.190
These are the three forms of glutamates that
we taste: monosodium glutamate, disodium inosinate,

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.850
and disodium guanylate.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.920
I'm sure that's clear as mud, right?

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.570
Okay, let me explain how umami works.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.059
These are big protein molecules.

00:28:01.059 --> 00:28:07.289
I use this analogy of someone putting a huge
gumball or a huge cherry tomato in your mouth.

00:28:07.289 --> 00:28:11.610
When it's in that big form, you don't really
get a lot of the flavor from it.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:16.530
You have to chew it down to release the flavor
from it.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.000
That's what happens with umami.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.290
Through a number of processes, these big protein
molecules are broken down into smaller free

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:27.590
glutamates.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:31.360
These free glutamates are what taste so yummy.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.270
They are savory, and they're what makes food
taste so good.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.370
So you take cheese.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.040
Let's start with a fresh mozzarella.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.450
Delicious.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:47.020
Got a nice fatty mouth feel, it melts, it's
got some dairy notes, perhaps a little buttery,

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.620
but it doesn't have a lot else going on.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.600
You take a cheese, then you age it.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.250
Over the course of aging, those protein molecules
are broken down into these free glutamates.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.370
Now think about a Parmesan cheese.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.000
You get the big block of Parmesan.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.710
It's crumbly.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.909
That cheese is loaded with free glutamates.

00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:10.220
That's why it tastes so meaty.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.789
Sometimes you'll get a good Parmesan or an
aged cheese that has that meaty character

00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:14.940
to it.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.890
That's umami.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.080
Take a tomato, a green tomato.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.820
Almost no umami.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:28.179
Through the ripening process, it will develop
seven to eight times as much umami.

00:29:28.179 --> 00:29:33.659
These are the things that help develop that
umami: ripening like the tomato, aging like

00:29:33.659 --> 00:29:36.929
the cheese, curing, all those cured meats.

00:29:36.929 --> 00:29:42.790
You take the big protein molecules and through
the curing process, you develop the glutamates.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.330
Drying, fermenting.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:48.640
One of the reasons we love fermented food
so much is the development of these glutamates.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.640
Okay.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.640
So-- yes?

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.640
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Evolutionarily, what's the point
of this?

00:29:51.640 --> 00:30:00.530
I'm assuming our ancestors didn't have much
chance to eat those kinds of foods.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:01.530
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Yes, that's a good point.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:08.419
There's some debate about whether or not umami
should be considered a basic taste for that

00:30:08.419 --> 00:30:11.279
very reason and the very reason that-- What's
your name?

00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:12.340
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Naha.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:18.830
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: --Naha said that it was disgusting
because we generally-- Some of us like it,

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:19.830
some of us don't like it.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:24.669
We don't really have a definitive, affective
response to it.

00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:31.840
The protein doesn't necessarily taste like
umami, but the amino acids do.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.750
Arguably, it was because we need the amino
acids for survival.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.890
Okay.

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.669
So now we're going to move on to the next
sense, which is smell.

00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:48.440
Everybody take that jelly bean out of your
pocket or your-- What I'm going to ask you

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.980
to do is to first of all hold up your right
hand and say, "I promise not to cheat."

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.510
&gt;&gt;all: I promise not to cheat.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.730
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Okay.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:56.950
All right.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:59.600
We got that on camera.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.529
Grab your nose and just plug it.

00:31:01.529 --> 00:31:04.299
Oh, this is going to difficult right here.

00:31:04.299 --> 00:31:06.110
Here, let me.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.230
Put it on your lap.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.810
Okay. [laughs] Gotta plug your nose.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.330
Now the point of this is to disable your sense
of smell.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.640
Go ahead and put the jelly bean in your mouth.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.470
I don't want you to release your nose until
I tell you to.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:24.370
If you're doing this properly, you should
not smell anything.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:28.140
So start chewing.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.890
Keep chewing.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.130
Keep chewing.

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.140
Keep chewing.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.269
Tell me what you're experiencing.

00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:35.760
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Kinda sweet.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.630
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Kinda sweet.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:38.630
Sweet.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.630
Yeah.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.330
Kinda sweet, that's kinda-- There's not a
lot of basic taste in a jelly bean.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.010
Release your nose now.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.390
[pause] Yeah, okay.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:49.630
What flavor is it?

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:51.830
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Melon.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.299
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Melon?

00:31:53.299 --> 00:31:54.299
Cantaloupe.

00:31:54.299 --> 00:31:55.299
Cantaloupe.

00:31:55.299 --> 00:31:59.270
So what you were getting on your tongue, using
just your sense of taste, was sweet because

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:03.100
that's the only basic taste that's in jelly
beans.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:09.010
Everything else that you smell there, that
whole gestalt of melon, came through your

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.300
nose.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.840
That's the aroma.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.470
It's really important to understand where
the sensory input is coming from.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:22.230
That's-- Now hopefully you've got a good appreciation
for how much of the flavor of food comes from

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:23.830
our sense of smell.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:33.100
I want to tell you a little bit about a fragrant
flashback, which is my term for how powerful--

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.630
one of the examples of how powerful smell
is.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:42.809
This goes back, again, to the lab at Mattson,
where I was walking from my office to taste

00:32:42.809 --> 00:32:46.019
some prototypes.

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:50.340
I have to step back and go back to something
Scott said, which is that I'm from Baltimore.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:54.740
What you should know about Baltimore is that
when I was growing up, in downtown Baltimore,

00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:00.060
the McCormick spice factory was making spices
downtown.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.860
One day, there would be cinnamon in the air
at Baltimore.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.640
And then they'd switch over the lines and
then they'd have basil.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.169
Later in the day would be cumin, and then
later in the day it'd be coriander.

00:33:13.169 --> 00:33:18.320
So all of these crazy spices were hanging
in the air in downtown Baltimore.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.179
A random mixture.

00:33:21.179 --> 00:33:25.850
We have the spice library at Mattson with
every spice known to man.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:30.419
One of our interns was in there, taking old
spices and dumping them and refilling them

00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:34.320
with fresh spices, because you want to keep
your spices very fresh for the most aroma

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.320
impact.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.090
She takes down the cinnamon, dumps it in the
trash.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.790
Basil, dumps it.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.140
Coriander, dumps it.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:50.549
I'm walking by this trash can and I [laughs]
go over to the trash can and I stick my head

00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:51.660
in it.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:55.280
[deep breath in] Home.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.090
[laughs] What?

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.150
So that is the fragrant flashback.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:04.460
When you smell something and it transports
you to another time.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:09.540
I know you've all had experiences like that,
where you just smell something and you just

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.940
remember something, good or bad.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.820
That is-- There's an anatomical reason for
this.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:26.329
When any of our senses are detected through
our neurons, through our receptors, the information

00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:28.839
goes on its way up to our brain.

00:34:28.839 --> 00:34:33.099
It goes through something called the thalamus,
and then it goes on to the brain, and we smell,

00:34:33.099 --> 00:34:35.040
or sight, or whatever.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.270
I'm sorry, taste or sight.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:40.780
Smell does not go through the thalamus.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:49.280
When you smell something, it goes right to
your brain without making this stop in the

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.540
thalamus.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:56.339
It's a more direct route from sensory experience
to your brain.

00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:02.710
We think that is because smell is our most
primitive sense.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:07.610
But that's also why we have such a direct
connection to emotion when we smell things.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:11.500
There's two different ways that we smell.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:16.329
The first way is when we just take something
and we sniff it.

00:35:16.329 --> 00:35:18.010
Stick your nose in something and smell it.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.820
That's called orthonasal olfaction.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.190
That's when the smell molecules are going
like this.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:29.040
The other way we smell something is called
retronasal olfaction.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.280
That's when the smell comes from your mouth.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.490
You put a food in your mouth, you've chewed
the food, and the volatile aromas that are

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:42.050
released from it are sucked up and through
the back of your nasal passages.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:48.540
They come back past your olfactory receptors
this way.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:55.740
The quality of those smells this way [sniffs]
and chew chew that way is a little bit different.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:04.270
We're going to do an exercise now where everybody
take your straw and bend it like this.

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:05.890
Take the long end and put it in your mouth.

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:09.630
See how well they follow the directions.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.900
Okay.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.950
Don't do this yet, but let me show you what
you're going to do.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:17.740
So I've got something in this cup that is
very aromatic.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:22.000
The volatile aromas have been building up
in the headspace.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.170
There's a little hole here.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:29.170
Without looking at it, just take that button,
push it to the side, and stick the short end

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:30.770
of your straw in the hole.

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:33.660
So you're going like this.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.920
Start breathing in and out.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:44.340
[breathing noises] Just breathe normally.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.340
You smell it?

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.340
Don't tell me yet.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.340
You smell it?

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.990
You all smell it?

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:49.990
What is it?

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.030
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Blue cheese.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:53.810
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Blue cheese.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:54.810
You got it.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:55.810
Okay.

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:59.540
They did not smell it before it got into their
mouth and went up that way.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.020
That was all retronasal olfaction.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:05.670
Go ahead and take the lid off and stick your
nose in.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:11.480
[pause] A little different, huh?

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.650
Different.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:16.589
&gt;&gt;Male #1: It's more strong.

00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:21.020
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: It's more strong, for sure, because
you're sticking your nose in there.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:26.400
The way that we experience these volatile
aromas is slightly different given how they

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.339
go in, whether we detect them this way or
that way.

00:37:30.339 --> 00:37:35.710
We don't really know why that is, but we know
it happens.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:40.561
This could also explain why something like
a stinky cheese, a really stinky cheese, may

00:37:40.561 --> 00:37:41.930
just smell wrong.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.480
It just smells gross.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:49.070
Then you put it in your mouth and you chew
it, and it's really pleasant because there's

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.089
something different happening.

00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:53.220
Now, of course, when you put something in
your mouth and you chew it, you're also using

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:58.440
your sense of taste, and you're probably getting
some saltiness and some sour and maybe a little

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.570
bitter.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.849
But you're also getting the mouth feel of
the cheese.

00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:03.070
It just coats your tongue.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:06.810
It's got a nice fatty mouth feel.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:12.980
So that's smell.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:18.119
The way that I describe it in the book is
the difference between taste and smell.

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:21.200
It's like a piece of art, because food is
art.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:26.050
If it's really well made, you have a beautiful
piece of art in front of you three times a

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:27.610
day.

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:32.570
Taste, those five basic tastes, are like the
outlines of the drawing.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.810
They set up the structure of the food.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:40.200
But if all you had was the basic tastes, like
that jelly bean exercise, all you'd have is

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.340
sweet a lot of the time.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.370
All you'd have is sour some of the time.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.380
It's not really that interesting.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:53.880
But when you add smell, the smell comes and
fills in the details.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:39:00.190
And so this art, this beautiful work of art,
becomes what you know it to be, the signature

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.650
work of art.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:08.850
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I have a quick question.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.884
When you have a cold, is it only blocking
that side but it's not blocking the other

00:39:10.884 --> 00:39:11.884
side?

00:39:11.884 --> 00:39:14.730
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: It's usually blocking both ways
because the mucus in your nose, it's in your

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:15.730
nasal passage.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.910
It doesn't matter which way it's going by,
there's too much mucus for you to be able

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:19.910
to smell it.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:21.869
It's in the way of the olfactory receptors.

00:39:21.869 --> 00:39:26.930
But that's a good question.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:31.650
With smell, it fills in the details for us.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.970
It gives us the pleasure from food.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:39.869
Remember, taste is the deciding sense, smell
is the pleasure that we get from food.

00:39:39.869 --> 00:39:44.970
Now I'm going to talk about touch and texture.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:52.310
I'm going to talk about texture in combination
with what you just learned about smell.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.510
You guys have a-- hopefully you have a spoon.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.770
Do you have a spoon on your plate?

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:56.770
&gt;&gt;Male #1: No.

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:57.770
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: No.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:00.130
Why don't you take this straw and just dip
it in the butter.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.490
What-- oh, there you go.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:10.700
What everybody has here is-- Just dip the
spoon in and don't eat it yet.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:15.060
[scraping sound] What they've got is unsalted
butter.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:19.640
When we're cooking, when we're developing
foods at Mattson, we always use unsalted butter.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.740
If you use salted butter when you take the
amount of butter up in your recipe, you also

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.060
take the amount of salt up.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.940
You want to separate those variables so you
can change the variables separately.

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.020
This is unsalted butter.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:37.079
Now take the spoon in one hand and close your
nose with your other hand.

00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:41.830
What I'm going to prove to them is butter
has no flavor.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:45.210
I'm sorry, butter has no taste.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:50.300
Plug your nose, put the butter in your mouth,
and just swish it around.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:55.890
[pause] What are you tasting?

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:56.890
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Oil.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:57.890
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Oil.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:58.890
Nothing.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:40:59.890
Nothing.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.140
Okay, let your nose go.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:05.530
Butter, unsalted butter, has zero taste.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:11.480
There's no sweet, no sour, no bitter, no salt,
no umami.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:17.170
I always thought of butter as being creamy
and sweet and-- yeah, it's creamy, but it's

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:18.170
not sweet.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.520
It doesn't have any sweetness in it.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.420
What we love about butter is not the taste
of butter.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.490
You don't like the taste of butter because
it has no taste.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:33.600
What you like about butter is that oily mouth
feel in combination with those lovely, buttery,

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.250
floral, green aromas that you get.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:39.260
Go home and do that tonight with unsalted
butter.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.829
This was such an "Aha!" for me.

00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:43.890
Butter has no taste?!

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:45.280
It's crazy.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.350
But we do love the flavor of butter.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:51.700
&gt;&gt;Male #7: When you brown butter, are you
developing the aromatics or the umami of it?

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:57.440
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Yes, but that butter also, if you're
using unsalted, will not have any taste either.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.440
No.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:03.220
You are developing the aroma compounds through
the browning process, but if you hold your

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.220
nose, same thing.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.000
You're going to get no taste, no taste, no
taste, fatty mouth feel butter.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.390
All right.

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:16.730
Now we're going to talk about kinesthesia,
which is the awareness of the position and

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:22.180
movement of the parts of the body by means
of sensory organs and the muscles and joints.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:29.510
This is where texture and touch gets really
interesting because we put food in our mouth

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:30.599
all the time.

00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:35.420
We talk while we're chewing and swallowing
without even thinking about it.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:40.540
It's a pretty amazing thing that we do [laughs]
if you think about it.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:45.640
We can manage the swallowing, the chewing,
and the breathing at the same time.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.819
How do we know when it's time to swallow?

00:42:47.819 --> 00:42:49.230
We just know.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:55.010
We're aware of the food in our mouth at all
times, but we're not paying attention to it.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.150
But we're aware of it.

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.880
That's why we don't choke ourselves to death
when we eat.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.970
We know when it's time to swallow.

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:08.180
If you think about it, next time you chew,
think about what side you're chewing on.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:13.319
Everybody always has a dominant side, but
you only chew on one side at a time, never

00:43:13.319 --> 00:43:16.400
chew on both sides at the same time.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.400
Doesn't happen.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.691
You chew over here, then you push it over
there, then you chew over there, then you

00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:23.869
push it over there, then you chew, then you
push it over.

00:43:23.869 --> 00:43:25.520
Can't chew on both sides.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:30.240
It's the only joint in the human body that
you can't operate separately.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.530
You can't do it.

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:37.740
Another experiment for you to do.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:43.160
There are a couple of foods that I called
irri-tastes because we commonly think of them

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.050
as tastes, but they're not tastes at all.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:50.839
They are actually tactile experiences, and
they are irritants.

00:43:50.839 --> 00:43:53.130
The first one is tannin.

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:57.770
If you think of the tannin that you get when
you drink tea that's not sweetened.

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:03.500
Or red wine, a really big California Cabernet,
has tons of tannin.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.750
That tannin will feel astringent on your tongue.

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:07.300
It will dry your tongue out.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.099
It will suck all the moisture out of your
tongue.

00:44:09.099 --> 00:44:10.579
That is a textural experience.

00:44:10.579 --> 00:44:12.819
That's a tactile experience, not a taste.

00:44:12.819 --> 00:44:13.980
It's not bitter.

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:19.280
Now if it's grapes, there might be some bitterness
in there, but the tannic quality of grapes

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:24.560
and tea is not a bitterness, it's an astringent
texture.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.320
Jalapeños.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.610
We love the taste of jalapeños.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:31.440
Well, actually, jalapeños don't have a lot
of taste.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.410
Might be a little bit sour, but not much.

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:39.440
But what you're experiencing, the burn of
jalapeños, is a tactile experience.

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.520
It's working on the same fibers as pain.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.140
Take a fork and jab it into your tongue.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:49.460
[laughter] [laughs] That's basically what
you're doing when you eat a chili.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:54.839
We're the only species on Earth that enjoys
food that's painful.

00:44:54.839 --> 00:44:57.990
[laughter] But we love it.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.410
It's an irritant.

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:03.000
Coca-cola, sorry, carbonated soft drinks like
that, are irritants.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.720
These little bubbles irritate your tongue.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.290
Now it's a pleasant irritation.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.450
We like it.

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:10.339
But it's an irritation nonetheless.

00:45:10.339 --> 00:45:12.280
All right.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:19.290
Now I've hopefully explained to you the difference
between taste and smell and texture.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:22.890
Flavor is the combination of all three.

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:24.630
It's the taste.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:30.840
Back to the chocolate example, the taste of
chocolate is bitter and sweet and maybe fruity

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:35.829
depending on the chocolate varietal or how
it was prepared.

00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:42.800
The texture of chocolate is that melty, creamy,
hopefully not too waxy mouth feel.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:49.970
Then the aromas of chocolate are the lovely
browned, roasted, toasted, beany notes that

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:50.970
we get.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.970
You might get some floral or some fruity notes
as well, depending on the varietal.

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:58.750
That is the flavor of chocolate.

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:02.470
When you talk about the flavor of butter,
you're talking about the combination of taste,

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:05.819
texture, and aroma.

00:46:05.819 --> 00:46:08.819
Now we're going to talk about sight.

00:46:08.819 --> 00:46:14.630
We're going to talk about how we use our sense
of sight to experience food.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:15.869
Some of these things are pretty obvious.

00:46:15.869 --> 00:46:21.420
If I show you these two steaks, which one
is going to be more tender, the one on the

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.890
top or bottom?

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:24.790
Top, obviously.

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:25.790
You knew that right away.

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:28.880
You used your eyes to see that the marbling
is greater.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:35.560
So you're constantly making these judgments
about food based on its sight.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:40.390
Sometimes, once you see it and you make a
judgment, it's really hard to change your

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:44.700
mind once something's not quite right.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.810
Beer brewers.

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:49.060
They were brought into a research facility.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.359
There were three beers.

00:46:50.359 --> 00:46:53.930
Let's just say one was Amstel, one was Budweiser,
and one was Coors.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:47:00.349
A, B, and C. They took three glasses of Amstel
beer, poured them into pints, and then they

00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:04.880
added a little bit of color to number 2 and
3 Amstel.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.180
They did the same thing for Bud and Coors.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:13.630
So you've got three glasses of Amstel in three
different colors, three Bud, three Coors,

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:14.850
three different colors.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:21.550
Then you have these professional beer brewers
come in and taste them in the dark.

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:29.589
When they're sitting in a dark room and they
have to rely only on their senses excluding

00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:31.670
sight, they get them right.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:34.620
They're beer brewers, they should know how
to taste beer.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:35.920
Then you turn the lights on.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.780
You have them do the same exact exercise.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:39.780
And they fail miserably.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:44.500
These are professional beer brewers that do
this.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.301
What do they do?

00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:48.109
They group them by color.

00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:50.210
Then you ask them, "Why did you group them
this way?"

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:52.160
"Oh, well they all taste the same.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.160
These all taste the same."

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.740
Well, they just did the experiment and got
it right in the dark.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:01.150
We don't even know when our eyes have overrided
what we experience.

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:02.589
It happens all the time.

00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:07.470
This type of research was done with gelatin,
it was done with candies, it was done with

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:09.089
fruity beverages.

00:48:09.089 --> 00:48:11.240
You can do it with wine.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:15.829
There's a very popular, a very famous study
that was done with white wine with a little

00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:19.240
bit of red added to one of them so it looked
like red wine.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.240
Same thing.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.240
You can fool wine professionals.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.450
[audience member coughs]
Why?

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:27.500
Why does our eyes, why are they so influential?

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:28.500
There's a couple reasons.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:34.710
The first is that sight is fast in terms of
processing the sensory input.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:37.680
Sight happens ten times faster than smell.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:41.240
If we were able to control it in a perfect
environment, which would be really hard to

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:48.130
do, but if we could control when we smelled
something and when we saw it, we would process

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:49.500
the smell faster.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.750
I'm sorry, we would process the sight faster.

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:55.109
It's faster than the other senses.

00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:57.840
The other thing is that sight happens at a
distance.

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.470
Back there, you can probably see me, right?

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:04.210
I hope you can't smell me.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:06.200
You have to be a lot closer to smell something.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:10.780
You have to be even closer still to taste
it, remember, because taste is a contact sense.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.150
It has to be in touch with your tongue.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:18.330
So you have these senses that have to be a
whole lot closer to you for you to start making

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.700
judgments about it.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:25.140
The first one that happens, the first thing
you see, biases or infects your ability to

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.780
make a good decision.

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:33.730
[pause]
Now this last sense that we're going to talk

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:34.730
about.

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:39.369
I'm going to unplug this so you're without
your sense of sight.

00:49:39.369 --> 00:49:49.950
And I'm going to ask you some questions about
[pause] a couple of different audio files.

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:54.839
[noisy file playing] This one's a restaurant.

00:49:54.839 --> 00:49:59.720
What do you know about this restaurant?

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:06.690
Do they have an open kitchen or a closed kitchen?

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:08.089
Open kitchen.

00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:10.880
It's an open kitchen.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.670
Do they have carpeting?

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:19.950
Do they use paper or plastic or real silverware?

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:22.740
They use real glasses.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:25.530
They use real silverware.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.619
Is it full?

00:50:27.619 --> 00:50:29.010
Pretty full.

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:37.890
So this is-- [pause] [file stops playing]
It's Delfina Restaurant, in the mission, which

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:43.339
is a restaurant that has thought a lot about
its sound.

00:50:43.339 --> 00:50:48.790
If you talk to Craig Stoll, the chef owner
there, he will point up and he'll say, "That's

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:54.809
$10,000 worth of sound panels that I've applied
to my restaurant."

00:50:54.809 --> 00:51:03.950
He knows very well that sound can have a somewhat
masking effect on flavors.

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:10.750
He talks about his food being authentic Italian
via California, but he says it can't be as

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:12.380
subtle as it is in Italy.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.040
"I have to turn it up."

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.280
He actually used that analogy.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:22.010
"I have to turn the volume up a little bit
to compete with the energy of my restaurant."

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:25.910
He's a very smart restauranteur to know this.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:32.140
There's some research that was recently done
in the fuselage of an airplane, with jet engines

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.140
going.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:38.860
The people in the airplane experienced food
with the jet engines going, that constant

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:40.440
flum of those engines.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:46.530
They experienced the food as less salty and
less sweet than they did in the absence of

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:47.530
that noise.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:54.250
So we know that sound has a masking influence
on tastes and flavors.

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:58.180
We also know that it can pull you in one direction.

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:02.940
We can actually put a bitter taste in your
mouth with the right music, or I should say

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:03.940
the wrong music.

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.010
[laughter]
All right.

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:09.050
I have two more audio files.

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:17.040
These are files of me pouring water from a
tea kettle into a cup.

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.920
One of these files is hot water, and one of
these files is cold water.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.099
I want you to listen and tell me which.

00:52:23.099 --> 00:52:27.480
This is file number one.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:36.020
[file playing] This is file number two.

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:41.130
[file playing] Which one was hot?

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:43.040
&gt;&gt;audience: The first one.

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.599
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: How'd you know that?!

00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:46.599
Yes!

00:52:46.599 --> 00:52:51.200
Everybody, hundreds of people I've done this
test with, everybody gets it.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.540
How do you know the temperature of water from
sound?

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:57.760
&gt;&gt;audience: [inaudible]

00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.860
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: You know this.

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:06.230
You're so in tune with the sound of your food.

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:10.599
Incredibly intuned to the point where you
can tell the temperature of water by its sound.

00:53:10.599 --> 00:53:13.000
Yet we take this totally for granted.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:20.100
We don't really think about how much information
we take from the food's sound.

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:23.839
Bite into an apple, and if it crunches one
way, you know it's going to be a good apple.

00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:29.170
You bite into it and it crunches the wrong
way, ugh, you know it's not going to be right.

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:30.900
Okay.

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:38.020
In summary, [pause] what I have hopefully
taught you today is just the basic fundamentals.

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.420
I have a chapter on each one of the five basic
senses.

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:45.460
All five of which we use incredibly well when
we experience food.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:54.770
Food that tastes good, using the word improperly,
looks good, sounds good, feels good, smells

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:58.530
good, and tastes good.

00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:02.980
Then I have a chapter on each one of the five
basic tastes and go into them in great detail:

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:06.080
sweet, sour, bitter, salt, and umami.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:12.890
And how understanding how they work and how
they work in balance and how you can balance

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:17.870
the tastes in a food is really important,
because once you get the five basic tastes

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:20.960
right in a dish, the rest is easy.

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.550
It's the structure of the dish.

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:33.210
I say once you have this fundamental understanding
of how we experience taste, just like anything

00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:38.680
that you study, the more you understand about
it, the more appreciation you're going to

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:39.680
have for it.

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:44.690
The more you study something, the more you
understand, the more pleasure you get from

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:45.690
it.

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:50.950
That is the whole point of this book, is that
you start to understand what's happening via

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:55.640
all of your senses and all of your tastes
and how they're being stimulated.

00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:00.369
Then you can take more pleasure from it.

00:55:00.369 --> 00:55:01.369
That is all.

00:55:01.369 --> 00:55:03.260
Thank you to my five volunteers.

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:04.260
[laughs]

00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:05.260
[applause]

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.799
&gt;&gt;Male #1: What was this?

00:55:07.799 --> 00:55:15.390
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: I have-- Oh, I forgot to-- I was
going to make you tape your nose up.

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:19.910
I have a couple minutes, I think, for questions,
maybe?

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:21.770
Bitter is the indicator.

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:27.250
Bitter is the one that correlates with the
anatomy and the genetic ability to taste.

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:29.059
The other ones follow suit.

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:34.080
So if you do not taste that paper as bitter,
if you just taste it as bitter, you're not

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:37.780
going to taste salt as intensely or sweet.

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:42.069
It follows along exactly.

00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:51.880
We don't use the others to test because they
don't-- The bitter one is one that we know

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.490
the genetics to that.

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:57.130
We don't know the genetics for the other four
basic tastes.

00:55:57.130 --> 00:55:59.160
But they're correlated.

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.420
Once we get that one right, we know what the
other ones are going to be.

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:06.470
The second part of your question, which is
can we train ourselves?

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:11.200
Yes, and hopefully that's-- There are a number
of exercises in the book, kind of like these

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:17.540
exercises, which are like the one we did where
we separate salt from umami.

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:21.740
Being able to understand the difference between
salt and umami.

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:25.579
Once you do that exercise, then you're going
to be much more aware of the umami in your

00:56:25.579 --> 00:56:27.240
foods.

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.780
It's simple training.

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:34.631
One of the hardest things to do is to take
something and just sniff it and know what

00:56:34.631 --> 00:56:36.710
it is without seeing it.

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:39.070
That is really hard for chefs to do.

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:40.650
It's just very, very hard.

00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:46.470
But people that do it professionally, people
that are in the wine business, for example,

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:50.890
or in the perfuming business, tend to be better
at it.

00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:53.770
It does show that practice makes perfect.

00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:58.500
For example, when I started in food development,
my colleagues would talk about rancidity and

00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.940
what was rancid.

00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:05.420
I had no idea what rancid was, so I begged
them, "Please let me taste something rancid.

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:09.350
[laughter] Next time there's something rancid,
can you point it out to me?"

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:12.880
I have a little rancid vial, if anybody wants
to smell rancidity.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:17.510
Because I had to train myself because I wasn't
detecting it.

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:19.790
I didn't know what to look for, what to smell
for.

00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:25.920
Now I know, and now-- Olive oil, I can smell
rancid olive oil a mile away.

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.410
But 20 years ago, I couldn't.

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:29.950
It's practice makes perfect.

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:32.710
Really, really, really does help.

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:38.521
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Does the practice makes perfect
principle hold true for foods you don't like?

00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:40.020
Like Brussels sprouts?

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.020
[laughs]

00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:42.020
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Yes.

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.040
Yes, yes, yes.

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:53.410
Research has shown that it takes between five
and eight attempts at a food before not rejecting

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:54.410
it.

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:56.720
That doesn't mean you're going to become,
after the fifth or the eighth taste, you're

00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:01.839
going to become the world's biggest fan of
Brussels sprouts, but keep trying it.

00:58:01.839 --> 00:58:05.000
Give yourself a couple of times.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.750
Your taste buds and your olfactory system
change dramatically as you age, so you might

00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:16.250
decide, if you keep trying it, keep trying
it every couple of months or every season,

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:18.400
every Brussels sprout season, try it again.

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:24.460
As you age and your olfactory changes, you
may be able to experience it with less of

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:32.570
the sulfury smell or you may be able to experience
it with more sour and less of the bitter.

00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:35.800
Your whole physiology with regard to taste
changes.

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.380
So I would suggest continuing to taste.

00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:41.250
&gt;&gt;Male #8: So there are two pieces to it?

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:44.609
There's the degree which I can affect it by
consuming it formally--

00:58:44.609 --> 00:58:45.609
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Yes.

00:58:45.609 --> 00:58:46.609
It's called mere-exposure.

00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:48.339
It's just the mere exposure to something.

00:58:48.339 --> 00:58:49.680
I'll give you an example.

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:56.390
When I started in the Mattson lab 15 plus
years ago, I hated canned tuna.

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:58.810
Just the smell of canned tuna was disgusting
to me.

00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:01.829
Then I get a tuna project.

00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:04.040
For four years, I ate tuna every day.

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.440
I had to.

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.160
I tasted canned tuna every day.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.090
I love tuna today.

00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:11.000
I love it!

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Because I can-- I don't like every kind of
tuna.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.500
I like good tuna.

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.609
And I'm discriminating now about my canned
tuna.

00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:19.670
I like the once cooked and not the twice cooked,
and I like the albacore and I don't like the

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:20.670
light.

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:22.370
So mere-exposure will help.

00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:23.370
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Okay, great.

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:24.370
Thank you.

00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:26.760
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Have you tried a stinky tofu
or durian?

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.460
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Yes.

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:32.530
I think-- the question was: have I tried stinky
tofu or durian?

00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:37.390
I think durian is, I think there's something
similar that happens with durian that happens

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:43.810
with a stinky cheese, which is the orthonasal
smell of durian is just-- If you haven't smelled

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:50.329
it, it's kinda like rotting flesh, like garbage,
sewage.

00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:52.579
It's just really rank.

00:59:52.579 --> 00:59:54.450
But people love it.

00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:56.990
So something different happens when you eat
it.

00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:02.260
Of course, when you eat it, now you're not
just getting-- What happens, I think, is when

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:07.460
you're smelling it, all you're getting are
those rank odors, and you get them one way.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.690
Then you put the fruit in your mouth.

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:14.049
Now you've got sweet and sour basic tastes,
because now you can use your sense of taste.

01:00:14.049 --> 01:00:19.390
So you take that rank odor and you combine
it with the sweet and the sour that you get

01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:22.730
from taste, and now it's something different
altogether.

01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:26.420
Maybe things start to fall in place.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:30.780
There are a lot of foods like that, where
we think that the smell is just so-- Stinky

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.960
tofu comes up all the time.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.230
Just unbearable.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.230
But taste it.

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:39.000
If you put it in your mouth, if you can get
it into your mouth, you will have a different

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.359
experience of it.

01:00:40.359 --> 01:00:43.130
Of course, a lot of this is cultural, too.

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:44.130
Stinky cheese is.

01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:48.510
You grow up in France, and a stinky cheese
shop smells really good to you.

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:49.510
[pause]

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:57.470
&gt;&gt;Male #9: So my daughter says that kale is
the most hideous thing ever.

01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:58.470
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Kale?

01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:59.470
&gt;&gt;Male #9: Kale.

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:01.059
And my wife is convinced that is has no taste
at all.

01:01:01.059 --> 01:01:03.109
You can't even tell it's there.

01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:06.260
How can I let them know that they're both
right?

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:08.920
That they both have different taste experiences?

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.770
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: What you've just described is what
I hope people take away from this book, which

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.180
is taste empathy.

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.890
[laughter] We have to have taste empathy.

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:21.180
Really, we don't talk about it in this country.

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:26.099
Like it's okay for us to say, "I can't see
that over there because I don't really have

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:33.569
good eyesight" but yet we don't accept the
fact that one of our other senses can vary

01:01:33.569 --> 01:01:35.670
from person to person.

01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:36.670
Right?

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:40.299
We all have different vision, different visual
acuity.

01:01:40.299 --> 01:01:45.290
What I think happens, or is happening in your
household, is your wife is a tolerant taster,

01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:54.829
meaning she has probably a very not so densely
populated tongue, with taste buds, and she

01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:59.410
genetically is probably also unable to taste
the bitterness in kale.

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:01.490
She might be right.

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:10.030
To her, in her private sensory world, kale
is crunchy and fresh and vegetal and not bitter.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:14.480
Then in your daughter's sensory world, it
might be the most bitter thing she's every

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.520
put in her mouth.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.800
And they're both right.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800
You're exactly right.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.800
They're both right.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:24.869
Of course you can never know what-- another
person's sensory experience.

01:02:24.869 --> 01:02:26.130
You should do that at home.

01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:31.760
Take the blue dye and paint your daughter's
and your wife's tongue and then have them

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.039
count the taste buds inside the hole of the
reinforcement.

01:02:36.039 --> 01:02:41.339
They can prove it to themselves that they
have very different anatomy.

01:02:41.339 --> 01:02:44.510
That hopefully will give your wife some taste
empathy.

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:47.430
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Is it big enough to count?

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.070
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Yes.

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:52.500
You're just going to need to get really close
to a mirror.

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:56.660
But watch out, because blue dye stains carpets
and towels.

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:58.500
I found this out the hard way.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.500
[laughs]

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:08.650
&gt;&gt;Male #11: Along those lines, I was wondering
if you have any explanation, specifically

01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:12.079
for why some people claim that cilantro tastes
like soap?

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:15.130
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: I always get this question.

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:16.630
Always get this question.

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:18.720
Cilantro is a really interesting thing.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.040
In the food world, we call it polarizing.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.380
You just don't sit on the fence about cilantro.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:26.030
You either love it or you hate it.

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:28.910
[laughter] We know a lot about cilantro.

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:33.880
We know that there is a genetic component
to your liking of cilantro.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:38.670
The way we know this is that we do research
with twins.

01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:41.500
There's this place in Ohio called Twinsburg.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.890
Every year, they have a twin festival.

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:44.990
All these twins go there.

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:50.970
The researchers are just drooling at the mouth,
because they can take a set of fraternal twins

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:54.680
and a set of identical twins and test something.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.910
Of course, you can determine, by the correlation,
whether or not there's a genetic component

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:00.910
to it.

01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:06.109
If the correlation is perfect for the identical
twins who share 100% of their DNA but not

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:11.650
for the fraternal twins, who don't, in fact,
they're just like any other set of siblings,

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:13.640
you know there's a genetic component to it.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.799
We know there's a genetic component to the
liking of cilantro.

01:04:16.799 --> 01:04:21.660
The other thing that we know about cilantro--
There's been a lot of research on this subject.

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:25.140
This is such a polarizing food.

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:35.250
What apparently happens is that when you run
cilantro through the GCMS, the gas chromatograph

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:40.690
mass spectrometer, which is what you can run
something through to get the volatile aroma

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:44.340
menu out of it.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:50.890
You expose someone to the smells that occur
in cilantro.

01:04:50.890 --> 01:05:02.119
There is an aroma experience that people who
love cilantro get, that people who don't,

01:05:02.119 --> 01:05:03.119
don't get.

01:05:03.119 --> 01:05:04.119
The same thing.

01:05:04.119 --> 01:05:12.760
People who hate it, they're smelling different--
When you run something through this GCMS,

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:16.349
it gives you spikes in volatile aromas.

01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:22.819
There are certain things, certain volatiles
in the cilantro, that people that hate it

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:25.470
are not experiencing.

01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:29.010
There are certain things in there that people
who love it are not experiencing.

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:32.920
So they're getting different pictures of it.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.309
They're not-- Neither one of them is getting
the same picture as the other.

01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:38.490
This is true of cilantro.

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:40.359
It's probably true of a lot of foods.

01:05:40.359 --> 01:05:45.299
But there's been a lot of research done on
cilantro.

01:05:45.299 --> 01:05:52.530
That is that your personal experience of the
aroma of cilantro may be very different than

01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:53.760
someone else's.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:59.310
The beautiful stuff that makes it beautiful
to you may not occur, may not be happening,

01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:01.240
in someone else's experience.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:07.069
Or the disgusting part that you find really
offensive may not be experienced by people

01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:08.069
who at it.

01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:13.030
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Going back to your early comment
about sound in restaurants, does that mean

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:20.700
that if you're a really good chef, you should
try to get a really, really quiet restaurant,

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:24.530
and if your food's not so good, you should
have it as loud as you want, blare loud music,

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:25.530
and everything?

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:26.530
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: I don't think it's that literal.

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:27.530
I hope chefs don't take it as that literal.

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:29.630
Of course you want appropriate sound in your
restaurant.

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:35.070
You want to pair the sound and the music with
the food.

01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:37.880
It needs to be appropriate.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:43.470
I think what chefs try to do, or what restauranteurs,
I don't know that it's chefs necessarily,

01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:46.860
what restauranteurs try to do is build ambiance
into the restaurant.

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:52.069
They try to build energy into the restaurant
via sound.

01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:56.910
That can work in some cases where the food
can stand up to it and where you want that

01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:58.730
energy.

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:03.840
There are other restaurants where the food
is much more subtle, and you want people to

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.570
experience the subtlety of it, which probably
wouldn't work.

01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:14.700
It's so different for every experience, every
restaurant, every chef, every owner, and every

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.059
type of food.

01:07:16.059 --> 01:07:20.070
It's just-- What I'd like people to think
about is just think about it, period.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:24.120
Just think about the sound of food, which
we just don't think about those two things

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.120
together.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.640
&gt;&gt;Giambastiani: All right, well, I think that
wraps up our time for right now.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.960
We'll have some time for more questions at
the book signing.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.190
But Barb, thank you very much for speaking
with us today.

01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:33.190
&gt;&gt;Stuckey: Thank you.

01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:34.190
Thank you guys for having me.

01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.191
[applause]
