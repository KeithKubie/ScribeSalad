00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:01.434
- [Voiceover] Paige!
- [Voiceover] What?

00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:02.462
- [Voiceover] I think
we left something out

00:00:02.462 --> 00:00:03.535
of the last video.
- [Voiceover] Oh no.

00:00:03.535 --> 00:00:06.191
- [Voiceover] I left exclamations
out of the last video!

00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:07.051
- [Voiceover] That's not good.

00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:08.201
- [Voiceover] Okay, we can fix this.

00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:09.034
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:09.990
- [Voiceover] We just
need to make a video.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.883
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:00:10.883 --> 00:00:13.454
- [Voiceover] Oh, hello grammarians.

00:00:13.454 --> 00:00:14.287
Hello Paige.

00:00:14.287 --> 00:00:15.120
- [Voiceover] Hi David.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.077
- [Voiceover] So, I want to talk today

00:00:16.077 --> 00:00:17.428
about the exclamation!

00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:18.484
- [Voiceover] Whoa.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:21.084
- [Voiceover] An exclamation
is a type of sentence,

00:00:21.084 --> 00:00:24.703
so previously we covered
three other kinds of sentence.

00:00:24.703 --> 00:00:25.536
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

00:00:25.536 --> 00:00:26.513
- [Voiceover] We covered
declarative sentences,

00:00:26.513 --> 00:00:28.575
which are just sort of statements, right.

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:32.481
We covered interrogative
sentences, which are questions.

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:35.265
And we covered imperative
sentences, which are orders.

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:36.098
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:39.448
- [Voiceover] But, but I forgot
to include the exclamation!

00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:42.210
I didn't actually forget, I
just wanted to save space.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.377
- [Voiceover] Oh okay.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:47.086
- [Voiceover] But Paige,
what is an exclamation?

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:48.966
- [Voiceover] So it's a sentence

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.216
or maybe a word that's like

00:00:52.126 --> 00:00:54.570
an expression of a really strong emotion.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.643
That's why we were
screaming a lot and stuff.

00:00:57.643 --> 00:00:59.443
Those were all exclamations.

00:00:59.443 --> 00:01:00.712
- [Voiceover] So it
doesn't even necessarily

00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:02.061
have to be a sentence,
you said, so it could

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.321
just be something like, ow!

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:04.154
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:04.154 --> 00:01:05.105
- [Voiceover] Like an
interjection like that.

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:06.196
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
that's a great example.

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:08.680
If you hurt yourself,
you might scream, ow!

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.976
That's an exclamation.

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:11.680
- [Voiceover] Can an exclamation also be

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.257
an imperative, like if I said, look out!

00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:15.928
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I think
so, right, that's an order.

00:01:15.928 --> 00:01:17.224
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:19.226
- [Voiceover] And it's being,

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:21.773
it's being exclaimed, it's being yelled.

00:01:21.773 --> 00:01:22.935
So I think that's an exclamation too.

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:23.768
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

00:01:23.768 --> 00:01:25.391
- [Voiceover] So there's some overlap

00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:29.243
with like imperative and
exclamation sometimes.

00:01:29.243 --> 00:01:31.124
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm, I
would also say that there's

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:34.431
probably an overlap with
declarative sentences too.

00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:35.928
- [Voiceover] That's
true, that's very true.

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:36.979
- [Voiceover] So you could be like, ah,

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.087
that ogre is about to attack the village!

00:01:39.087 --> 00:01:41.062
- [Voiceover] Right,
that is just a statement,

00:01:41.062 --> 00:01:43.514
but you're clearly pretty scared about it.

00:01:43.514 --> 00:01:45.897
So there's an exclamation point.

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:48.488
- [Voiceover] But I could
also walk that statement back

00:01:48.488 --> 00:01:49.947
also as an exclamation and say,

00:01:49.947 --> 00:01:52.555
I was wrong about the ogre, he's nice!

00:01:52.555 --> 00:01:53.895
- [Voiceover] Oh, he was
just coming to say hi.

00:01:53.895 --> 00:01:54.730
- [Voiceover] He's just coming to say hi.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.563
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:55.563 --> 00:01:57.287
- [Voiceover] Give you
a big ol' thumbs up.

00:01:57.287 --> 00:01:59.514
So we're expressing something.

00:01:59.514 --> 00:02:01.187
We're expressing strong emotion.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:03.527
We could just be very
excited about something.

00:02:03.527 --> 00:02:04.360
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.191
- [Voiceover] Or you can
use exclamation points

00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:07.537
when you're trying to convey

00:02:07.537 --> 00:02:09.609
that someone is speaking at high volume.

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:10.727
- [Voiceover] Okay, right.

00:02:10.727 --> 00:02:12.884
- [Voiceover] So I
could be yelling across,

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:16.283
you know, the field, to you, my pal.

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:17.116
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:19.147
- [Voiceover] To be like,
don't worry about the ogre!

00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:20.512
He's just bringing snacks.

00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:22.221
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
there's not even necessarily

00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:24.670
strong emotion there, you
just want me to hear you.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.503
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

00:02:25.503 --> 00:02:26.673
- [Voiceover] 'Cause I'm far away.

00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:28.275
- [Voiceover] So Paige, I reckon that's,

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:29.870
that's what an exclamation is.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.817
- [Voiceover] I think so.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.379
- [Voiceover] Expression of
strong emotion or volume,

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.219
so they can be, they're
not always sentences,

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:36.923
so they can be interjections like, ow!

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:39.029
Or they can be full
sentences like, look out!

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.068
Or that ogre is about
to attack the village!

00:02:41.068 --> 00:02:42.912
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it
can be a lot of things.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:44.280
- [Voiceover] Be a lot of things.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.589
Just like you can learn
anything, David out.

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:49.200
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
