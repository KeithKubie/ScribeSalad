00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.980
My name is Talia Guzman-Gonzalez
and I am a Reference Librarian

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.630

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.300
On behalf of the Hispanic

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.340
[ Applause ]

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.640
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.220
I have to thank very
warmly Talia Guzman-Gonzalez

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.020
because thanks to her we've
been able to set up this kind

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.280
of partnership with the Library
of Congress for, i think,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.790
the third year in a row of
presenting the wonderful work

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.110
of our colleagues
in the Department

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.980
of Spanish and Portuguese.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.530
So I'd like to thank
Georgette Dorn,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.190
who is basically the outgoing
Chief of the Hispanic Division,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.310
and I'd like to welcome
also Suzanne Schadl,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.600
who's going to be our new Chief.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.380
And I cannot say enough good
things about the Library

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.430
of Congress and the
Hispanic Division.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.350
You guys make these kind
of events really worth it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.250
for us to come out here.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.910
And -- and it's a --
welcome to all of you.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.570
Thank you for being here.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.620
And it kind of helped that
it's kind of humid out there

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.070
and we can take refuge
over here.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.370
But you'll see that this'll be
worth it, every minute of it,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.800
because we have the presentation
of this wonderful book written

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.680
by my colleague,
Carmen Benito-Vessels,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.180
Spain and the Atlantic Coast
of The U.S.: Four Characters

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.010
from the 16th Century
in Search of an Author.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.280
If we had any doubts that
Spanish should be spoken

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.600
in Virginia, Washington, D.C.,
Maryland, all along the coast

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.310
from the Carolinas up, this
book has proven basically

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.080
that it's probably the
first European language

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.950
that was spoken on
the eastern coast

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.150
of the U.S. We have
two wonderful guests

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.540
that I'm going to introduce.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.360
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to introduce everyone here

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.530
and then they each will take
turns talking and we're going

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.510
to open the conversation
at the end

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.150
so we can ask general
questions and we can,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.820
you know, establish a dialogue.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.280
So Carmen Benito-Vessels
received her B.A. in [inaudible]

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.010
from the University
of Salamanca in 1977,

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.020

the University of Salamanca,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.340
and earned her Ph.D.
at the University

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.990
of California-Santa
Barbara in 1988.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.070
I don't want to date
you, Carmen.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.820
Benito-Vessels has worked at
the University of Maryland

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.710

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.580

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.280
Her cutting-edge research
skillfully combines classical

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.910
and contemporary
studies while insightful

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.210
and original combinations

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.330
of the diverse interests have
captivated a wide academic

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.630
transatlantic audience.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.300
in collective monographs.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.860
In fact, the journal
Mediaevalia from the UNAM

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.850
in Mexico has just chosen one of
her articles from 20 years ago

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.320

to be reprinted next year

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.030
in a special edition celebrating
30 years of the journal.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.780

00:08:50.510 --> 00:09:14.820
[ Inaudible background speaker ]

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.690
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everybody.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.380
I'm very pleased to be here
at the Library of Congress,

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.960
particularly at this
event sponsored

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.760
by the Hispanic Division.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:35.740
The Library, of course, holds
many books that are dear to us

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.260
that do research in
various genres and periods.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:47.000
And also it holds the
voice of writers, authors,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.280
some of them are gone,
and I was listening

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:55.410
by chance the other day to
the voice of a dear person

00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.050
that I know, Jose Juan
Arrom, that was recorded here

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.870
at the Library of Congress.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.250
And it was really
moving and it's real

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.450
because he has been gone
for a number of years

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.320
and he was a forerunner
of colonial studies

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.290
and the development of
the field in the U.S.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:18.290
I'm here thanks to Benita.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.720
Thank you for inviting
me to be here.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:27.570
Thank you, Aida, a good friend
with whom I have traveled

in several areas, including
the Galapagos Islands

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.160
that we were reminiscing
this afternoon on.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:43.090
Benita has brought us not only
to -- to Florida with her book,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.250
but I think also
with the climate.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.230
How did you manage that?

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:55.050
And I want to thank Aida
for the lovely introduction

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.830
and mentioning that
I am distinguished.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.160
Sometimes I feel
extinguished more.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.080
But I am -- it's
great to be here.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.770
So I will then read my
thoughts on the book

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.840
and share them with you.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:20.380
I have some slides that I will
try to present as we go on.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:25.180
So in this -- in the España y
la costa atlántica de los EEUU:

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.870
Cuatro personajes del siglo
XVI en busca de autor,

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:34.590
Spain and the Atlantic Coast
of the U.S.: Four Characters

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.700
of the 16th Century in
Search of an Author.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.000
Can you hear me?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.100
Im a little bit nervous
with this microphone.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:46.180
I'm not Oprah Winfrey-like,
but so anyhow,

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.930
Carmen Benito-Vessels
aims to recover

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:55.700
without reservations the
early history of the country

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:01.430
of Washington and Jefferson by
restoring a glaring omission,

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:05.050
the Spanish presence
in our land.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:10.290
The title alludes partially
to a drama by Luigi Pirandello

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:15.620
that in turn refers to a
novel by Miguel de Unamuno.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.240
As the names given
to people, to books,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.730
to geographical spaces are
not assigned by chance,

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.610
it is important to explore
briefly the connections

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.510
of this title.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:34.360
In his drama, Six Characters
in Search of an Author,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:40.760
released in 1921, the Sicilian
Pirandello presents the

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:46.110
relationship of the playwright
with his cynic protagonist.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.280
In his novel, Niebla,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.740
the Spaniard Unamuno created
a narrative based on events

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:59.790
from the life of its
protagonist, Augusto Perez.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:05.120
Both works, the play and the
novel, question the relationship

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.330
between authors and characters.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:15.500
They offer also a philosophical
meditation on existent identity,

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.750
the link between
reality and imagination.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.220
At the same time, the
books inform readers

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.470
as to how a dramatic
piece or a work

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.370
of fiction should be written.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.970
Like Pirandello and Unamuno,

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:37.960
Benito-Vessels carefully
selects her protagonists

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.790
and situates them in
a different paradigm.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.240
The paradigm is the
reconfiguration

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.420
of North American history
of the Atlantic southeast.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.280
Through the analysis
of the deeds

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.620
of two native protagonists,
Francisco de Chicora

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.990
and Don Luis de Velasco,
also known as Paquiquino

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.170
or Paquiquineo, and
two Spaniards,

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:09.730
Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón and
Pedro Menéndez de Avilés,

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:15.380
the author guides us through a
time when the Spanish presence

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:21.350
in territories now part of the
United States was paramount.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:25.360
By charting the itinerary
of these characters,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.860
Benito-Vessels attempts
to explain why they

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.670
and also others are absent

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.580
from the early history
of the United States.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.410
It is worth remembering

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:43.220
who these forgotten
historical actors are.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:49.920
Francisco de Chicora, or
Chicorano, was one of 70 natives

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.460
of the coast of the
current state

00:14:52.460 --> 00:15:00.450
of South Carolina deceived,
imprisoned, and enslaved in 1521

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.840
by two Spanish conquistadors.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.020
When they arrived in Santo
Domingo of Hispaniola,

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:13.740
authorities there found that
these natives were not rebels

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:18.150
and therefore could
not sold as slaves.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:23.270
The group was released and in
their turn they were ordered

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.660
to return to the mainland.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.600
However, the return
trip was never made

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.350
and most died in Santo Domingo.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:38.620
Among the survivors of the
group was Francisco de Chicora,

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.240
who was baptized,
learned Spanish,

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.660
and began to tell the
wonders and riches

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:53.200
of his native land perhaps with
a secret desire to return to it.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:59.070
As expected, such descriptions
did not go unnoticed.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:05.070
The learned and powerful judge
Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón soon

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:10.270
became protector of El
Chicorano and took him

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.590
to Spain to the court.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:20.890
There he met none other than
the chronicler Peter Martyr

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.750
d'Anghiera, who penned
the descriptions

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:32.620
of the land Francisco de Chicora
was telling about and thus began

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:39.430
to build the legend that
resulted in the expedition

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:44.090
to the [inaudible]
Nueva Andalucia.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:50.150
Charles V granted lawyer
Vázquez de Ayllón the right

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:54.110
to explore and colonize
the lands of Chicora

00:16:54.110 --> 00:17:00.490
and there he went with six ships
and more than 600 persons, and,

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.180
of course, the guide was
Franciso el Chicorano.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.850
After arriving, Francisco
disappeared

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:12.930
and he was never seen.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.530
The expedition was
a total failure.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:22.990
Vázquez de Ayllón died
in North American lands.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:28.520
There was a settlement
of a very brief duration.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.100
The colony was called
San Miguel de Gualdape

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.490
and it's now located
in South Carolina.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:41.770
The San Miguel de Gualdape
precedes San Augustin de la

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.210
Florida, the English
colonies of Roanoke

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.920
and Jamestown for
several decades.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:55.330
In a map by Diego
Ribero, the area explored

00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:00.590
by the unfortunate oridor
is called Tierra de Ayllón,

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:04.200
and this is the map
that Carmen has used

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.500
for the cover of the book.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:10.660
Let's go to the second
character, Luis de Velasco,

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:15.730
or Paquiquineo, which is
another protagonist discussed

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.730
by Benito-Vessels.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:22.410
He was an Indian from the modern
state of Virginia, Allison,

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:27.530
probably of Algonquian
ethnicity, who by force

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.400
or by his own free
will, we don't know,

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.570
joined a Spanish
expedition [inaudible].

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.290
Educated by Dominicans
and Jesuits,

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:44.480
protected by the Viceroy
of New Spain, and baptized

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.260
with his name, the young man
traveled to Spain, Mexico,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.660
and Havana with friars who
insisted on creating a mission

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.100
in the Bay of Santa
Maria de Ajacán,

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.280
right here, Chesapeake Bay.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:05.200
Don Luis managed to return
to his land acompanied

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.690
by Jesuit priests and brothers.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.490
He served as a guide
for them and then later

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:17.330
on he murdered the
priest and brothers.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:23.520
Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, then
governor of Cuba and adelantado

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.500
of La Florida, was in
charge of punishing Don Luis

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.040
and his followers
for their misdeeds,

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.240
but they were never found.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.270
It is worth mentioning or noting
that Menéndez de Avilés,

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:44.210
supported by relatives
from Asturias and friends

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:50.820
from that same area, had far
more ambitions for La Florida.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:57.490
No. 1, he was determined to
expel the French, which he did.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:04.410
No. 2, he wanted to find a
land route from Zacatecas

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:09.680
in Nueva Espana in order
to cross the continent

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.850
and with the silver
from that mining town

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:18.640
and avoid the pirates,
French and English,

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.400
that were roaming the Caribbean.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:26.640
No. 3, and this was
still interesting to us,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.000
he aimed to explore
the north of Florida.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.480
I'm not talking about
Florida peninsula.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.450
Florida was a vast
land extending

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.370
into what is today Kansas.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:46.010
And he hoped remotely
to find a way to China.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:53.340
No. 4, to continue evangelizing
the native of La Florida

00:20:53.340 --> 00:21:00.400
with Franciscan missionaries and
obviously to colonize the area

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.890
and establish settlement
as point of entry

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:08.460
to the center of North America.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:14.170
He, like happens, died
of typhus before any

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:18.030
of these plans could
be realized.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:22.200
In an account backed
by careful research,

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:28.060
the characters Benito-Vessels --
of Benito-Vessels acquire a life

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:33.670
of their own in a historical
flow where the predominant role

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:39.230
of Spain has been
historically minimized.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.670
First, she explains, this was
due to the territorial ambitions

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.480
of England and France,
and later,

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.690
in the Independence period
and in the 19th Century,

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.470
to those who put
together a history tainted

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.540
with religious preferences,
ethnic prejudice,

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:03.860
outright carelessness or
simple ignorance of the sources

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:09.630
that amply support the role
and the presence of Spain.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:13.060
Not many listen to
Thomas Jefferson,

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:18.670
and I brought his image to us
because he donated his books

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.060
to this very library, no.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.560
Not very many listen
to Jefferson.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.660
He was a reader of Cervantes.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:34.200
And not only Don
Quixote, but other nobles

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.750
and tracks by Cervantes.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:41.220
And he find -- Jefferson
frequently indicated

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:45.660
that in order to know the early
history of the United States,

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.710
and to establish strong
relations to our neighbors

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:55.040
to the south, it is
essential to learn Spanish.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.560
Carefully chosen and
studied with determination

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.740
by Benito-Vessels, her
characters, de Chicorano,

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:08.070
Don Luis Vázquez de
Ayllón, Menéndez de Avilés,

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:12.340
can be added to other early
authors and protagonists:

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.480
Álvar Núñez Cabeza de
Vaca, Hernando de Soto,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.050
Inca Garcilaso, Alonso
Gregorio de Escobedo,

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.100
Luis Jerónimo de Oré.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.550
That, in the words
of Benito-Vessels,

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:30.070
constitute the missing
link to Spain

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.320
in the early modern history
of the United States.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.100
Their career, as the
author has pointed out,

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.800
and I quote her now, is
full of the small triumphs,

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.830
great failures, and
enormous risks, end of quote.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.530
Without exception,

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:54.270
Benito-Vessels' book illuminates
these complex periods

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:58.230
and helps us appreciate
the many facets

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:02.400
of an early Hispanic
presence in territories

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:07.430
which later will become
part of the United States.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:11.900
The research summarized in
the book by Carmen also leads

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.930
to other facets of the
early Colonial period

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:22.130
of North American, particularly
to translation and cartography.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:26.560
It is worth remembering
how Spanish sources related

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:32.730
to the area were put to use and
also the preference on the part

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:36.550
of the English to
disseminate works

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:44.230
where a given chronicle harshly
criticized Spanish colonization.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.820
One work comes to mind,

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:51.470
fray Bartolomé de las Casas'
Brevísima Historia de la

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.970
Destrucción de las Indias,

00:24:53.970 --> 00:25:00.050
translated with a very graphic
title of Tears of the Indians.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.720
As for misrepresentations,

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.110
perhaps the most notable
case is a translation

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:11.870
by Congressman Robert Greenhow
of the Chronological Essay

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.760
for the General History
of Florida

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.180
by Andrés González de Barcia.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.200
Following Anne Brickhouse,

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.440
the author explains how Greenhow
disassociates the history

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.270
of Virginia from
the Spanish presence

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:31.410
in that territory thus
diminishing its link

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:36.510
to the indigenous past through
the demonization of Don Luis.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:40.080
In this sense, Benito-Vessels'
book brings

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.440
to the floor the debate
about what did give rise

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:49.290
to possession, discovery
or colonization.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:55.010
Obviously, England felt that
colonization was the answer

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:58.880
to that, but we can just
talk about this later.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.680
Central to the [inaudible]
illustrated by the biography

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:09.440
of the four initial characters
is the language of cartography.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:15.540
Maps, explains Carmen, do not
just point to a route by means

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:21.010
of the images illustrating their
edges, the selection of drawing,

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:25.930
of a style of arrangement,
of colors and lines.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:31.060
They offer a language that
first we must know how

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.320
to decipher, how to understand.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.470
As we know, the Spanish
navigational charts were

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.950
jealously guarded in the Casa
de Contratación in Seville.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:49.160
Sailors sponsored by
Spain had the obligation

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:54.960
to indicate new discoveries and
routes in the royal register

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.740
and could not discuss them
under penalty of death.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:04.000
However, due to the
defections of cartographers

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.130
and the pressures of
other European powers,

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.340
secrets were frequently
revealed.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.210
Benito-Vessels offers
a classical example

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.270
and I will bring this
to your attention.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:23.780
The German cartographer Martin
Waldseemüller inscribed the

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:31.460
name of the continent, America,
in his 1507 map prepared thanks

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:37.580
to the information provided
to him by Amerigo Vespucci,

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:42.130
at that time at the service
of the Spanish crown.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:48.900
Chapter 7's Cartographers to
Power is a true treasure trove

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:54.000
as far as information while
also showcasing the practicing

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.320
of the time.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.490
As the author points
out, these struggles,

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.700
cartographic struggles,
make us think

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:08.420
of Edmundo O'Gorman's classic
book The Invention of America.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:13.910
Imagine not only by chroniclers
but also by cartographers

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:17.580
who responded to the
interest of a wealthy

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:23.410
and curious European readership
devoted themselves to describing

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:28.350
and plotting the
wonders of the New World.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.300
We cannot fail to
mention common practices

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.730
in the Spanish colonial
expansion evident

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:38.610
in North America and
in South America.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:43.300
For example, in the
conquest of the Inca Empire,

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:48.530
the Pizarristas, or the
followers of Francsico Pizarro,

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.460
sought with earnest the
grave of the Inca kings.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.740
It wasn't because
they were devoted.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:01.180
They wanted to basically,
as far as the priests go,

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:06.080
they wanted to find information

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.590
to accuse the Inca kings
of being idolaters.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:18.400
And the soldiers of Pizarro
or Pizarro's [inaudible] knew

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.420
that the Inca kings,
the Inca lords,

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:28.230
were buried with large amounts
of gold and silver and treasure

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:33.790
and they wanted to go to
where they were buried just

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:36.110
to check on the booty.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:39.910
On the Atlantic coast
of North America,

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.900
pearls often replaced
the coveted metals

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.700
and these are also sought
in temples and graves.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.350
In his account of the
marches of Florida,

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:57.890
the Peruvian Franciscan Luis
Jerónimo de Oré proposes

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:03.050
to activate in La Florida
a method of evangelization

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:06.990
that was a disaster for
the Indian population

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:11.910
in what was then the
Viceroyalty of Peru.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:15.100
Deredduciones, it didn't --

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.190
it was never implemented
in Florida.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:22.810
Now, in her desire to
understand the kind of history

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:26.880
that produces distortions
and omissions,

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.980
Carmen Benito-Vessels, a
Medievalist by training,

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:35.670
goes to the prologue of
Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:39.420
in his recasting of
the Amadis of Gual,

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.980
the classic chivalric novel.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:47.160
In his prologue to this
book, the author speaks

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.980
of three types of history.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:55.000
No. 1 was a true
factual narrative

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.420
about real deeds provided
by a reliable eyewitness.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:07.550
No. 2 was what he calls historia
de la afición, hobby history,

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.580
or writing history
for the love of it

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.890
and offering a partial
representation.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:21.090
And No. 3 would be historia
fingida, or false history,

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:26.770
which recasts facts within the
realm of the real maravilloso

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.470
and is equivalent to fiction.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:33.860
As we know, the three models
are evident in the stories

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:38.670
and chronicles about the Spanish
in this and its frontera norte.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:42.780
The frontera norte is what
is now the United States.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.950
However, clarifies
Benito-Vessels,

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:49.340
in the configuration
of the early history

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:54.390
of the current United States,
hobby history predominates

00:31:54.390 --> 00:32:00.290
with the consequent exclusion
of the Hispanic component.

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:06.210
So in her book, Carmen
outlines this forgotten history

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:11.650
and underscores the importance
of its recovery and study.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:15.900
I conclude remembering,
going back to the beginning,

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:21.810
words attributed to Pirandello,
and I quote, we do not give life

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.380
to a character by chance.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.550
The victim helps us

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:31.800
to understand why the author
selected her protagonist,

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.230
the four protagonists,
Francisco de Chircora,

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.680
Don Luis de Velasco,
Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón,

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.590
and Pedro Menéndez de Avilés,
and placed them in the context

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.950
of an exact textual journey.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:52.570
Like Augusto Perez in Niebla by
Unamuno, the protagonist refused

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:57.240
to disappear, they
clamor for recognition,

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:02.090
and from the atalaya, the
watch-over of your journey,

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.520
Carmen, who is a wise sentinel,

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:11.170
recovers these historical
figures and gives them new life.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.380
In this way, the
book that we present

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:19.180
and celebrate today
contributes to the necessary

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.770
and welcomed rescue of
the early Spanish history

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:26.690
of the United States
in its Atlantic side.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:32.470
I thus congratulate Carmen for
her accomplishment and thank her

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:37.950
for plotting such a worthwhile
journey, and I learned so much.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.750
Thank you.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:48.360
[ Applause ]

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.580
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Raquel, for
this wonderful intervention,

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.240
for reminding us the treasures
that are here at the Library

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.360
of Congress for all of us
to use, for reminding us

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.640
about the ways of
Jefferson, who insisted

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.410
that we all must learn
Spanish, and the University

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:09.150
of Maryland is here to help
you if you haven't started yet.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.500
We have a pretty
serious program.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.720
Come to us.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:19.430
And I would like to basically
call Allison Bigelow now to --

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:21.200
and by the way, I
have to apologize.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.250
I mischaracterized
this presentation today

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:25.550
as a book presentation.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:26.990
It's really a mini-symposium.

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:31.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for
the invitation to share some

00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:33.600
of my thoughts on
this fascinating book

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.370
and the questions that
it opens up for our field

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.090
with this group today.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:41.250
I'd like to begin by recognizing
that we are on indigenous soil,

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.960
the ancestral home of
communities like the Piscataway,

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.280
who were only recognized by
the state of Maryland in 2012,

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.140
and by recognizing
the many intellectual

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:52.510
and creative contributions of
indigenous women and men present

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.310
and past to the kinds
of academic exchanges

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.600
that we're engaging in today.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.900
In his capacious

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.090
and meticulously researched
comparison of British

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:05.580
and Spanish imperial strategies
and colonial practices,

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.870
historian John Huxtable Elliott
names what is perhaps the

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:11.890
deepest and most persistent
methodologically challenge

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:14.420
in the study of the
early Americas,

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.880
our lack of a time machine.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.940
Without such a device, it's
hard to say how the paths

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.630
of the two largest
European empires

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.250
of the Atlantic world would
have forked their ways

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:27.490
and forced their powers upon
the American landscape had their

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:30.060
circumstances unfolded
differently.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.830
What would Spanish colonization
have looked like in places

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.860
without large mines and
without indigenous communities

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:39.180
who had developed sophisticated
metallurgical technologies

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.050
to process those ores?

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:43.790
What might English colonization
have looked like in a place

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.710
like Potosí or Zacatecas?

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.940
Elliott, entertaining a
well-reasoned counterfactual

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.390
in his books -- in his book,
Empires of the Atlantic World:

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:55.670
Britain and Spain in
America, 1492-1830,

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.680
published by Yale
University approximately 2006,

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.810
argues that if large quantities
of silver had indeed been found

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.550
in Virginia, there's
little reason to doubt

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:05.850
that the development

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.470
of an extractive economy
would've created a high-spending

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.620
elite which would have more
than lived up to the dreams

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.550
of the gentlemen
settlers of Jamestown.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.450
But instead, the presence
or absence of silver

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.260
and of large native populations
that could be domesticated

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:22.550
to European purposes
had other implications

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:25.480
for the imperial enterprises.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.200
These implications were
both local and global.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.550
Local because they affected the
day-to-day realities of women

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:34.050
and men who made their
homes in Virginia before

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:36.810
and after the forced and
unforced arrivals of Africans

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:38.580
and Europeans in the region,

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:41.940
and global because scholars
trace the origins of world trade

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.060
to this historical moment
in the 16th Century.

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.680
Because silver was worth
almost twice as much as gold

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:51.870
in East Asia, Iberian agents
extracted it in the Americas,

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.790
shipped it to China and
Japan, and traded silver,

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.560
which they liked but
not that much, for gold,

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.100
which commanded the
highest prices

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:03.710
in European bimetallic markets
at a profit of nearly 2:1.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:06.200
Then they used that gold to
purchase people and goods

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.040
on their return through the
Indian Ocean world, West Africa,

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.770
and Europe before
departing to the Americas

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.520
to once more extract silver
and initiate a new cycle

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.810
of world trade, slavery, and
capitalist political economy.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:22.720
So these two factors, silver
mines and indigenous population,

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.630
shaped their respective
crown's roles

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.470
in all aspects of
colonial planning.

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:30.040
Because the English crown
did not expect great profit

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.340
from its plantations,

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.060
it maintained a relatively
low profile

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.490
in the crucial opening stages

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.680
of development, according
to Elliott.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.690
In contrast, the Spanish
crown intervened heavily

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:41.990
in colonial affairs

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.010
and documented its
decision making powers

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:47.720
in nearly every aspect of
life in the Americas, letters,

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.730
books that were printed
and not printed,

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.650
petitions from colonial
subjects, policies determined

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:55.890
at council, and maps that
were shared and guarded.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.890
Scholars who study the Spanish
empire do not suffer from a lack

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.300
of primary sources, although
these sources are often silent

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.180
on the kinds of questions
that we ask today.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.250
Hence, Elliott's question
about the possible paths

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:10.940
of colonization can really only
be answered with a time machine

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.470
that would allow us to place
British imperial agents

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:15.260
in what is today Latin America

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.990
and to place Spanish
imperial agents

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.800
in what is today
the United States.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.740
So fortunately for
us, and with the use

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.650
of textual interpretation,
cartographic analysis,

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.400
and historiographic study,
rather than the time machine

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.200
that our colleagues in physics
have yet to build for us,

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.170
this is precisely what Professor
Carmen Benito-Vessels does

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:36.650
in her new study, España y la
Costa Atlántica de los EEUU:

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:39.980
Cuatro Personajes del Siglo
XVI en Busca de Autor,

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.950
published this year in New York

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:45.200
by La Academia Norteamericana
de la Lengua Española.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.720
That is, Professor
Benito-Vessels locates

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.430
in a wealth of documentary
evidence and visual sources,

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.170
many of which are housed here
in the Library of Congress,

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:56.850
the materials for a history
of Spanish colonization

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.850
in what is today
Maryland, Virginia, Georgia,

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:00.800
and the Carolinas, and what was

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.900
at the time a complex
constellation

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.890
of Algonquian-speaking
communities who traded

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.980
with diverse indigenous peoples,
like copper-producing cultures

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.590
of present-day Michigan
and Iroquois merchants

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.190
from present-day New York.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:16.270
These were not separate closed
communities but critical players

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.310
in a dynamic indigenous
world that negotiated change

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:23.750
and continuity before
and after colonization.

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:27.090
Two historical actors
from these communities,

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.550
two indigenous historical
actors from these communities,

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.080
are at the heart of
Benito-Vessels' book,

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.980
Francisco Chicora, or Chicorano
in Spanish-language sources,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.550
a man we think to have
been Catawba based

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.850
on where he was captured

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:41.860
by licenciado Lucas Vázquez
de Ayllón, for whom he served

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.820
as a guide and interpreter in
what is now Georgia, Virginia,

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.440
and the Carolinas, and
Don Luis de Velasco,

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.470
named after the Viceroy of
New Spain, who served as guide

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.990
and interpreter for Pedro
Menéndez de Avilés

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.740
in what is now Florida
and South Carolina.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.010
The book focuses on
these two indigenous men,

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:00.350
although there are many other
native actors whose histories we

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.650
could trace as message-saving
go-betweens.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:07.150
The decision to reveal
and conceal information,

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.770
decisions made by men
like Juanillo [Inaudible]

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:13.120
in North America, by women
like Pocahontas in Tidewater,

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.230
Virginia, Doña Maria
Magdalena and Antonia

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:19.250
in Timucuan-speaking regions
of La Florida, Doña Marina

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.240
or La Malinche in Mexico,

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.200
and the unnamed informants whom
Colon took as his prisoners

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.340
on La Hispaniola on
November 12, 1492,

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.420
believing that the women
would teach him their language

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.210
and that native men
would not run away

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.570
if Iberian forces held their
families, shaped the movement

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.090
of Spanish imperial
agents as well as those

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:40.140
of the many Italian explorers
and Portuguese subjects

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.770
who Carmen quite rightly
points out worked on behalf

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:45.960
of the Spanish crown
in these early years

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.130
of New World contact
and conquest.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:52.290
As these examples suggest,
La Florida was a space

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:55.500
of contested waters and
unstable ground, a shifting site

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.800
of imperial rivalry between
and among factors of English,

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.940
French, Spanish, and Portuguese
colonists who negotiated

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.720
with indigenous confederations,
or empires, as some might say,

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.180
given that Captain John
Smith calls paramount chief

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.870
Wahunsenacawh, known as Powhatan

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:14.320
in English-language
sources, an emperor.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.730
And yet, as Benito-Vessels
shows in her book,

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.840
much of this multilingual
pluricultural past has been

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.500
papered over, or perhaps
more accurately whitewashed,

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.280
in a series of historical
distortions, intentional or not,

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.260
that have reinforced
the narrative

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.990
of what she beautifully calls

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.530
"la accidental
occidentalización de los

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:37.630
Estados Unidos" or the careful
fashioning of the history

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.480
of the United States
into a narrative

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.900
of white Western modernity.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.110
Professor Benito-Vessels
makes a convincing

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:47.260
and well-documented case
for a determined crafting

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.300
of Western identity and heritage

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.280
in British-speaking
North America,

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.720
one that marginalized
its indigenous roots,

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.590
African histories, and
multiple European colonizations.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:02.990
As we learn in España y la
Costa Atlántica de los EEUU,

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.790
the making of an anglophone
national identity was a slow

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.530
process that unfolded
over time as 19th

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:11.480
and 20th Century academics
and government officials

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.290
like William Gilmore
Simms, Robert Greenhow,

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:18.310
mentioned by Raquel, and
Frederick Jackson Turner funded,

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:21.750
wrote, published, cited,
and taught histories

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:24.900
in which England and France
became meta-geographic points

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.200
of reference.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.030
Meta-geographic, Carmen
explains, in the sense

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:31.540
that these thinkers
use cartographic logic

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:35.050
and spatial imaginaries to
project a particular vision

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.210
about their country,
its origins,

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.670
and its place in the world.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:42.640
They chose to adopt France
and England rather than Spain

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.950
or Portugal as critical points
of reference in this making

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:48.260
of national mythology.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.160
France's alignment with
England, in contradiction

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.400
with other romance-speaking
languages,

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.760
where cause philosopher Immanuel
Kant's two-part taxonomy

00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.270
of the character of the nations
articulated in his observations

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.030
on the feeling of the
beautiful and sublime.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:07.160
Writing in 1798, Kant sketched
a model of world division

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.490
in which France, England,
and Germany stood on one side

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:13.450
and Spain, Italy, and
Portugal on the other.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:16.770
These six European powers
form the analogical root

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:19.740
of his comparative
framework wherein he writes,

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:23.090
"If the Arabs are as it were
the Spaniards of the Orient,

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:25.330
then the Persians are
the Frenchmen of Asia

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:28.510
and the Japanese can be regarded
as it were as the Englishmen

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.160
of this part of the world."

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.860
Such 18th Century assessments
were not just anthropological

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.570
aesthetic or racist.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:41.030
They were, for Kant, evaluations
of morality as he argued,

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:44.580
"The characters of mind of
the people are most evident

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:49.440
in that -- in them
which is moral."

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.300
Over time, these moral
geographic assessments became

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.400
indistinguishable from
ideas about languages

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.630
and the people who speak them.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:00.250
According to Walter
Mignolo, in the transition

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:04.120
from Renaissance humanism to
18th Century Enlightenment,

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.950
English, German, and French
replace Spanish, Italian,

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:10.800
and Portugese as the perceived
knowledge-generating grammars

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.260
of reason and scientific
modernity.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.520
In Mignolo's compelling history
of the perception and power

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.350
of language, there
was a fracture

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:21.760
within the romance languages
and the fault line was French.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.220
Although French maintained what
he calls the expressive flair

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:28.490
attributed to romance languages,
it was also the language

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.230
of philosophical rigor and one

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.840
of the colonial power's
modernity.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.190
After World War II, these
divisions were magnified

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.090
by new geographic
interpretations

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:41.550
of political economy in which
much of the Francophone world,

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:44.210
with the exception of Canada,
he notes, began to share

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.150
with Spanish its belonging
to the Third World.

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.090
As Mignolo argues
based on his reading

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:53.870
of Martinique philosopher Frantz
Fanon's Black Skin, White Masks,

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:57.020
to understand how these
processes developed in the 18th

00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:00.710
and 19th Centuries and how they
came to exert such influence

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:04.250
over the 20th Century world, to
say nothing of our world today,

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:07.100
we must return to the kinds
of spatial projections,

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.800
geographic imaginaries, and
real world questions of power

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.620
that Carmen Benito-Vessels
locates

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.740
in the 16th Century
inter-imperial contest to name,

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:20.560
claim, and colonize particular
parts of the Americas.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:25.370
At least 17 maps
produced between 1526

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:29.700
and 1570 plot Las Tierras de
Ayllón on the territories

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.850
that we now think of as
part of the ecosystem

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:35.300
of the Chesapeake Bay as
well as fictional projections

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:36.870
that linked Virginia
and Maryland

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.270
with Zacatecas and
the South Sea.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.930
As late as 1650, English
promotional agents

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:46.290
like John Ferrar and
Edward Williams printed maps

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.690
in which the backside of
Virginia led to commerce

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:52.380
with Asia via the South Sea.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.690
English imperial
projectors thought

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:58.060
that the Virginia colony would
become if not a land of milk

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.710
and honey, then certainly one
with a vibrant culture of wine

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:04.080
and a lucrative silk industry.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.210
Because Virginia was found on
the same latitude as China,

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.160
Virginian silkworks would equal

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.550
or exceed what Williams called
the more opulent provinces

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:14.630
of the East to their
wealth, reputation,

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:18.960
and greatness (besides the most
Christian of all improvements,

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.440
the converting many
thousands of the natives).

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.670
These lines from
Williams' Virginia:

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:26.920
more especially the
south part thereof,

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:31.910
richly and truly valued,
published in London in 1650,

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.630
suggests how the same
[inaudible] logic

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.930
that gave pride of place to
latitude rather than longitude,

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:38.690
as we see with Ayllón,

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:41.850
influence later generations
of projectors.

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:45.500
Recall that we heard that
Chicora in Nueva Andalucia,

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.280
or lands fit for peopling,

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:51.030
porque hay muchas arboles
y plantas de la Espana,

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:55.050
according to the asiento that
Vázquez de Ayllón negotiated

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:59.530
with the crown in 1525, as
Carmen analyzes in her book.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:03.000
Williams' work also shows
how these English projectors,

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.680
by which I mean early modern
writers who proposed elaborate

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:09.410
and often untested ideas to
reform government and commerce

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:13.190
in domestic markets and overseas
territories, called projectors

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:17.720
in English and arbitristas in
Spanish, shifted the center

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.230
of colonial possibility

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:22.200
from Spanish Florida
to English Virginia.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.550
Williams' Virginia:

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.970
more especially the
south part thereof was,

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:29.490
as we see in Carmen's book,
those portions of the Carolinas

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:32.370
where Jesuit missionaries
and Spanish imperial agents

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.660
like Vázquez de Ayllón
brought with them slave traders,

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.890
women to bear children, and a
variety of artisan laborers,

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:42.340
including masons, tailors,
carpenters, and ironworkers,

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.640
to create the biological

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.330
and physical foundations
of a colony.

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:49.270
And yet, as far as we know,

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:52.110
there are no archeological
remains to give testimony

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.180
to this colonial project.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.490
Instead, we have maps
that record the failures

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:59.140
of permanent European
settlement, such as that made

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.820
by Diego Ribera in 1529
which relays how many

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.490
of the early Spanish settlers
of present-day Georgia

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.150
and the Carolinas died
of hunger over the winter

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:12.090
because they lacked basic
mantenimientos or provisions.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:14.850
These moments remain
understudied in colonial history

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.590
because their brief
presences tend

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:20.020
to leave scant long-term
evidence of the things

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.980
that we often analyze,
such as political, social,

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.910
and economic relations between
and among indigenous, African,

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:29.270
and European communities, or the
realities of life on the ground

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:33.210
for these diverse populations
as they changed over time.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:34.950
We dismiss them as
failed colonies

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:37.070
and we turn our attention
to the imperial projects

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:38.960
with more visible
long-term consequences.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.710
As Carmen's work shows,
this approach is misguided.

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:44.600
And as I conclude today,

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.970
I'd like to suggest how Carmen's
book opens up new questions

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.480
in three areas of
colonial study.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.120
As I see it, España y la costa
atlántica de los EEUU invites

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:58.100
us to consider three major
questions of failure, race,

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.050
and collaboration from
a new perspective.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:02.870
First, it suggests that we need

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:05.790
to critically revise
dominant notions of failure.

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.090
This definition, of course,

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:08.880
presupposes an imperial
viewpoint

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.630
in which a successful colony
is one that takes root

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.450
and leaves a lasting
imprint upon the colonized.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:18.150
That alone is enough to give
us pause, but it also means

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:21.690
that we prioritize places
in context in which 16th

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:25.330
and 17th Century events have
lasting provable consequences

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:28.880
in the 18th, 19th,
and 20th Centuries.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.960
By starting with these later
periods and mapping questions

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.230
of power, inequality,
and colonization back

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:39.490
onto early colonial documents,
we are doing history backwards.

00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:42.290
I'm not arguing that
historical legacies

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:44.560
of colonization are unimportant,

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.500
rather that we prioritize
particular histories

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.070
because of their influences in
later-day eras, and in doing so,

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:52.950
we miss important opportunities

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:56.480
to analyze what Robert Blair St.
George called the possible pasts

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.810
of colonial life.

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:01.710
We also miss opportunities to
analyze what colonial subjects

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:04.120
and imperial agents
thought was possible

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.300
at a particular moment in time.

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.940
These possibilities tell us
about the history of the idea

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.910
of the New World and they
are in many ways as important

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:15.890
to understand as are the
histories of the New World.

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:19.100
After all, Vázquez de Ayllón
may not have left a trace upon

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.690
the landscape, but his
story and the story

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:24.410
of his story inspired
other European agents

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:27.550
who viewed the 17 maps of this
territory to try their hand

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:29.850
at New World colonization.

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:31.760
Recent work on imperial
failures,

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.850
one of the two framing devices
of a volume on European Empires

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:38.120
in the American South, edited by
Joseph P. Ward with an afterword

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.720
by Kathleen Duvall and published
by the University of Mississippi

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.150
in 2017, provides what Ward
calls evidence of the power

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:48.030
of the concept of empire
to hold the imagination

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:51.330
of all concerned despite
the many obvious challenges

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:53.480
that would-be imperialists
face when striving

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.010
to bring their ambition
to fruition.

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:59.480
Indeed, this type of analysis
suggests that the study

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:03.150
of failed colonial enterprises
can reveal critical insights

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:06.800
into the many souths, a wide
variety of forms and experiences

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.820
of slavery, and myriad in
changing empires, nations,

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.670
confederacies, and towns,

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:14.970
as Duvall writes in
the closing pages.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:18.250
Second, as we think
about these many souths,

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.090
works like Carmen
Benito-Vessels' book invite us

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.130
to reconsider our study of
race casta and the marking

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:26.600
of human difference
in the early Americas.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.800
We know that there are
major differences in the way

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.220
that Anglophone colonists
in North America

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.590
and Hispanophone colonists
and Lusophone colonists

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.440
in South America
categorize human beings,

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.320
whose humanity they
denied, by external factors

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.720
like skin color, spoken
language, clothing,

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.170
and hair texture as well
as less observable features

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:48.830
like religious professions,
craft labor, and family lineage.

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:51.560
We know also that ideas
of a one-drop rule

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.600
and the proliferation
and contraction

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.620
of casta categories shift
by region and over time.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:00.700
So what would it look like to
study early English reports

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.250
on indigenous communities
of Algonquin, Susquehannas,

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:05.120
and Cherokees through the lands

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:08.740
of Native American contact
with Iberian empires?

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.540
Recent research by scholars like
Alejandro [Inaudible] begins

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.730
to ask these important questions
and to do so with methods

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:17.130
that center indigenous
historical actors.

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:19.130
But more work is needed.

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:22.270
For example, we know little of
how the Spanish colonization

00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:25.170
of the mid-Atlantic might have
shaped indigenous communities'

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:28.910
ideas about race and how those
expectations may have influenced

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:32.400
their interactions with black
Africans from Estevanico

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.000
to the 20-odd women and men
who landed in Hampton Roads,

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.660
Virginia, in 1690 marking
the first permanent community

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:42.120
of enslaved Africans in
British North America.

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.630
Cassander L. Smith asks some of
these questions in her research,

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:48.240
and Cassie would be among the
first to tell us that we need

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.380
to know more about the
complex interaction

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.160
of indigenous African
and European populations,

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.830
insights with layered
colonial histories.

00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:58.800
Third, and finally,
Carmen's study

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.860
of indigenous collaborators
like Don Luis

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:04.490
and Francisco Chicorano ask
that we reconsider the nature

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:06.720
of collaboration itself.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.860
As my colleague Anna Brickhouse
shows in The Unsettlement

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:12.070
of America, and as Carmen
points out in her analysis

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:15.190
of Brickhouse's work,
indigenous agents were central

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:18.470
to the movement of European
empires, shaping, sharing,

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:21.590
and withholding information to
shape the path of colonization

00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:24.560
and to protect the
people where they could.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.350
New studies of indigenous
translators and messengers,

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:30.950
such as Cecil Carrion's work on
gestures in the French Atlantic,

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:33.920
offers to extend our analysis
of indigenous agencies

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.850
into performative and
non-lettered realms.

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:39.600
Doing so also asks that
we consider what it means

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.960
to inform and to collaborate.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:45.240
We used to study hybridity and
[inaudible] as powerful acts

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:49.230
of transculturation and cultural
accommodation, but now we see,

00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:52.130
as art historian Ananda
Cohen-Aponte argues,

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:55.170
the hybridity cannot happen
without the kind of violence

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:58.060
in which one side imposes
its will and way of being

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.980
in the world upon another.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:03.920
In a similar way, as we
begin to center histories

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:07.180
of Spanish America, including
spaces like the mid-Atlantic

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.340
and present-day DeSoto
County in Mississippi,

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.330
and to center indigenous
actors within those histories,

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:14.630
we will need to more carefully

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:16.650
and more critically
analyze the nature

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:18.780
of colonial collaboration.

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:22.190
Professor Benito-Vessels is
right to detail the importance

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:26.120
of la collaboracion con
el indio Don Luis as part

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.470
of the Spanish strategy
against Colonial French interest

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:31.300
and to note how Don
Luis sabotaged Spanish

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.010
imperial efforts.

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:36.110
So what then does it mean for
indigenous actors to collaborate

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:37.710
with colonial officials?

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:40.870
How should we study acts
of colonial collaborations

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:43.090
within what Enrique
[Inaudible] identifies

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:45.490
as the overarching
framework of coercion

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:48.000
within which indigenous
women and men made decisions

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.770
about where and how to work?

00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:53.250
So as we think about new
directions in the field

00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:57.000
of colonial studies, whether on
failure, race, collaboration,

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.360
or any of the other rich
avenues of inquiry laid

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.680
out in España y la costa
atlántica de los EEUU,

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.240
we can all agree that Carmen
Benito-Vessels' book gives us an

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.700
exciting new way to approach
and to frame these questions

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.950
in a rich set of
multidisciplinary methodologies

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:14.360
with which to analyze them.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.060
Congratulations, Carmen,
on a wonderful book.

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:19.950
I look forward to reading all of
the studies and future projects

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:21.750
that your work inspires.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:32.150
[ Applause ]

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:33.700
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Allison.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:37.100
If you're not blown away
already by the possibilities

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.720
of this book, you know,

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.370
I know that your
curiosity is now spiked,

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:44.780
but I will actually urge you

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:47.970
to go get a volume of,
you know, get a copy.

00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:56.080
I was trying to plug-in
Carmen's book.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.460
Get your own copy.

00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:58.760
Don't be satisfied.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.700
I know this presentation's
absolutely marvelous

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:06.250
and they have placed this book
in a fantastic context in a,

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:10.180
you know, multi-imperial context
and also present a really,

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.910
you know, the erasures
that are there

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:15.130
that are beyond the
Hispanic population and those

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:18.190
of indigenous and so on,
but go get your own copy.

00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:20.130
And now I am going to call

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:21.720
to the podium my
esteemed colleague,

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:24.420
Carmen Benito-Vessels,
who will talk a little bit

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:27.130
about her project as well,
and maybe respond a bit

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:28.700
to her two presenters.

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:31.700
I want to announce that she
is no longer a Medievalist,

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.260
no longer a closet colonialist.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.980
She has just come out and
she's now a full colonialist.

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:40.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:42.630
Very nice.

00:56:42.630 --> 00:57:00.290
[ Applause ]

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:01.590
Thank you.

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:03.720
Thank you so very much for
the generous introduction

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.480
of the previous speakers

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:09.160
and I owe a special
thanks to Dr. Merediz.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.440
She is the mastermind
behind this event

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:16.090
because she created the
series and gave us a forum

00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:18.430
for all the professors
from the Spanish

00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:21.080
and Portuguese Department at
the University of Maryland

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:26.120
to be able to discuss our works
here at the Library of Congress.

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.120
I don't need to explain
where we are.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.710
It's really a humbling
experience for me

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:34.330
to be here today and I
don't - I hope that my work

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:37.850
in a way is a contribution
to the legacy started

00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:42.130
by Thomas Jefferson, and I
can make my children proud

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:45.760
of their mommy working
day and night

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:49.580
and be a citizen
of both countries.

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:54.700
Also, I don't have enough words
to thank Dr. Chang-Rodriguez

00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:57.310
for her generous support
from the very beginning.

00:57:57.310 --> 00:58:00.850
I was a little bit hesitant,
I have to admit, because, yes,

00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:02.460
I was coming from
the Middle Ages.

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:06.270
Not the Dark Middle Ages,
the bright Middle Ages,

00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:10.800
and having her accolades
meant a lot to me.

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.420
I knew that I had a story
to tell, but I didn't know

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:19.290
that my story had a place
in the new modern times,

00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:21.550
in the colonial times.

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:22.850
Thank you.

00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:24.150
Thank you very much.

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:25.930
And of course, Professor
Bigelow, she is -

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:28.550
she has been the most
generous person I have met

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:31.800
in the last few decades.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.410
She accepted to leave
aside her work.

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:37.520
We know about the
deadline that she has.

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:40.210
We know how important
it is to meet deadlines

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:43.310
and she put her book on one
side of the table in order

00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:48.950
to read carefully mine and
discuss it with such eloquence.

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:52.750
I think I'm going to read it
myself after your presentation.

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:55.750
It was - it was a very wonderful

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:58.070
and insightful reading
from both of you.

00:58:58.070 --> 00:58:59.370
Thank you so much.

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:02.260
And of course, I
cannot forget the help

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:04.500
of my former colleague
Talia Guzman,

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.720
who has done impeccable
work in order

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.800
to make this event
a possibility.

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:13.160
We are here thanks to her and
she has had [inaudible] in order

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:17.700
to finally put us all together.

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:23.700
And of course, the former
and present directors

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:28.160
of the Hispanic Division,
Dr. Mere - Merediz?

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:34.000
No. Dr. Georgette Dorn
and Dr. Suzanne Schadl.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.300
Thank you.

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.600
Thank you very much.

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:40.200
Also, thank you to my family,
friends, distinguished guests,

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.590
my colleagues, of
course, my students.

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:45.670
Thanks to you I keep fighting
every day and I keep reading

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:48.170
to know any more
than you already do.

00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:51.310
And thank you to all of
you for being here today.

00:59:51.310 --> 00:59:55.920
As I say, it is a pleasure
and an honor to be able

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.950
to talk a little bit about
work that is very solitary,

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:03.630
and whenever I have an audience
I try to please the audience.

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:06.090
Let's see if I achieve
my goal today.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:10.510
And since I cannot speak
with - in an impartial manner

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:13.440
about my work, I would -

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:19.010
I thought that I could tell you
a few [inaudible] how I became

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:22.450
an author of this book.

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:26.200
It all started with a class,
a class for a summer session,

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.420
and that is an intensive
summer session,

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.200
five days a week,
four hours daily.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.790
You have to be really, really -
you have to have good material

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:37.840
in order to captivate
your students

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.790
and in order to keep
your sanity.

01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:45.290
So I started by calling
this class Spanish Treasures

01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:49.070
in the Washington, D.C., Area,
trying to bring the [inaudible].

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:51.850
I didn't have any idea
where I was going,

01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:57.370
but trying to link what I saw
at the National Gallery of Art.

01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:59.510
Of course, we have
enormous treasures there.

01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:04.720
It's easy to connect Velázquez
and Duran, Murillo, Goya, Greco,

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.590
and all these painters with
traditional literary works.

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:12.110
[Inaudible] so I decided to
go a step farther and come

01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:13.990
to the Library of Congress.

01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:16.690
And this is where
I came face-to-face

01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:21.200
with Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón,
who was in the entourage

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.100
of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.530
I knew a little bit about
Pedro Menéndez de Avilés.

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:29.520
I don't think I have
heard the name of Ayllón,

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.800
or at least I didn't
register it in my mind,

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.820
and I came also face-to-face
and became good friends

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:40.140
with the two Native American
Indians that they are waiting

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.850
in my book, Chicorano,
Francisco Chicorano,

01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:45.310
and Don Luis de Velasco.

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:48.320
So I started digging and reading
and reading more and more

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.110
and in order to reassure
myself whenever I write

01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:56.620
to a colonialist or a
professor of English history,

01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:00.790
I try to put just a little
question to test the waters

01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:06.610
and to see what do you - and
not much in the beginning,

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:11.810
and I kept talking and usually
the answer I received was,

01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:13.110
"Really?

01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:15.520
No kidding.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.440
Where did you get that?

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.470
The Spanish were
here in Virginia?

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:22.610
No way. And I say,
well, you know.

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:26.300
I think that these characters
are looking for an author.

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.700
I volunteer.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:34.220
I volunteer and I will
be the author for this

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.530
and see where we go together.

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:39.700
So we also know about the
imaginary line on the Treaty

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:45.540
of [Inaudible], 1949,
which is marvelous.

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.090
It's the wisest decision
to divided the war

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:53.600
in between two countries,
Spain and Portugal.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.900
[Crosstalk] logical thing to do.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.890
No. Okay, so we knew about
this line but as well

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:03.370
if the Spaniards were here,
there may be other lines

01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:04.950
that we don't know about.

01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:10.230
Sure enough, I found a book that
was called Spanish Borderlands,

01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:12.380
written by Eugene Bolton.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.680
Coincidence.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.980
Coincidence.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.320
I live, we live, my husband
and I, lived in Bolton Walk

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.620
when we were in California.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:19.920
I didn't have any idea

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.920
that Bolton will come
back to me in my life.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.400
So the other imaginary lines

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.770
for the Spanish borderlands
were a little bit blurry and we,

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:34.860
as Professor Chang-Rodriguez
mentioned, La Florida,

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:36.330
the colonial La Florida,

01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:39.690
the limits were much
more extraordinary

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:42.220
than anything that
we can imagine.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:46.890
Some of them, like Escobedo,
we don't - let's not be shy

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:51.450
and we'll put an image
between Siesta Key

01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:54.420
and the [Inaudible] Peninsula.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.250
Why? That's in my book.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:58.560
You can see the picture.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.780
So why? Why am I
going to be shy?

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.520
You know, let's go
all the way there.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.920
I'm not saying he was right
claiming that territory

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:11.070
in reality, but what is
extremely important to all

01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:16.540
of us is to know that he
knew about these territories,

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:22.170
that he had seen maps or he
had seen documentation in order

01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:25.910
to speak about these territories
and in order to claim them.

01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:28.560
So everyone, you know, you can
claim whatever you want to.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.770
That's okay, you know.

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:35.180
What's important is to realize
what sources he was using.

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:37.290
We also find -

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:40.590
so the borderlines were a
little bit blurry, as I said,

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:44.410
for the Spanish borderlands, but
then again that's nothing new.

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:46.100
Professor Bigelow spoke

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:50.440
about Virginia having a
direct connection to China.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.990
I'll show you the slide
later on because it's true.

01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:57.620
[Laughter] And you know,

01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:01.170
we all know that
California was an island.

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:04.420
That is the way it was described

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:08.710
in Garci Rodríguez de
Montalvo's Amadís de Gaula.

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:10.230
It was not only an island,

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:13.150
but it had a queen,
La Reina Califia.

01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:17.740
So yeah, so we do
- we do have maps

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:22.660
and we do have literary
works and historical works

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:27.820
that can help us to document
what we call cartografía en

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.210
brocha, brush cartography.

01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:32.870
Thanks to that brush
cartography,

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:35.910
the letter of Amerigo
Vespucci, who was a professor,

01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:38.790
as Chang-Rodriguez said, was
working for the Spanish crown.

01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:45.090
He described it so well that
Martin Waldseemüller was able

01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:51.530
to do that map adapting every
[inaudible] what Amerigo

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:55.040
Vespucci thought it was America.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:01.550
So what - it sounds so very -
I thought it was very puzzling

01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:04.890
and I go back to Dr. Bigelow's
comment on the Native Americans

01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:06.600
and the question of language.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.900
Language fascinates me.

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.280
I think that is one of the -

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.940
is probably the most
powerful tool that we have.

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:18.090
It's the only thing that
connects human beings

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:22.170
and makes human beings put
at the same level as that.

01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:25.330
We can create with
words the same way

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:28.520
that God created the
world with words.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.590
So don't this - don't
take offense by this.

01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:34.260
[Inaudible] worth exploring.

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:39.530
And these Native American
Indians not only spoke Spanish,

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:45.320
probably the very first
speakers of Spanish in this land

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:49.710
and we don't study them.

01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:51.030
To make things even worse,

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:54.170
they tell the stories,
an oral narrative.

01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:58.060
An oral narrative, as we
know, doesn't have an author.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.890
It has a million of
authors and only one -

01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:04.000
and we end that knowing
one version.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.310
This is exactly the same thing
that we have with oral epic,

01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:11.310
with the Spanish -
all the Spanish epic,

01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:14.740
all the oral history
of Northern Africa.

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:20.030
I wish a commercial and we'll
speak about this tomorrow

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:22.150
at the conference
of the [inaudible].

01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:27.610
So I thought that this
was kind of an issue

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:33.640
that needed serious attention
and I found myself that I have

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.510
so much material and so
many avenues to explore

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:40.480
that I was a little bit
puzzled and that was one

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.160
of the hardest moments
for me to react.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.550
How to put this together,
how to make it readable,

01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:51.340
without making it just a series
of lists which I use often

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:54.140
in the book simply
because I, you know,

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:56.850
I have to document what I'm
saying so I just use all

01:07:56.850 --> 01:08:01.680
of the bullets to say this,
this, this, this in order

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.180
to advance the narrative and
to let the reader choose.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:08.500
If I want to see exactly every
year, every comma, every period

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.140
that she is mentioning, fine.

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:13.390
If you don't want to do that,
you can escape - escape that

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.500
and keep going with a narrative.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:20.720
But anyway, I think that
this book is just the tip

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.050
of the iceberg, at least for me.

01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:28.890
I have many, many, many - and
I do, I mention that at the end

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:30.900
of the book, many other options.

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:37.220
And one thing that I consider
one of the achievements of

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:42.730
or one of the things that I'm
most proud of is this book,

01:08:42.730 --> 01:08:45.930
I believe, is very
difficult to catalog.

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:47.240
Many definitions.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.990
Many definitions will fit,

01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:54.150
but none of them
will be exclusively.

01:08:54.150 --> 01:08:59.330
And I - this is also a
collaboration that children,

01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:03.050
I mean, their books have
a life of their own.

01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:04.350
They are like children.

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:07.870
You have a child, but then
the child do whatever it wants

01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:11.470
to do, and he brings you
wherever he wants to bring you.

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:17.760
And the book, that's in a way
some - has a path of its own

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.970
and you have to let it go a
little, come back a little,

01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:24.120
go a little, come back a little,
until you find common grounds

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.340
and you become friends
with your own book

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.640
or with your own children.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:33.610
So that ability of making
it really work was a

01:09:33.610 --> 01:09:35.660
real challenge.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:41.000
And as I said, if - another
two things that I would

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.230
like to mention about the
book and 'Im very proud

01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:47.350
of is I didn't put a conclusion.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.830
It doesn't have a final
- a final sentence.

01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:52.130
It's an open ending.

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.920
And it's not that I forgot.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:57.200
No. I didn't forget.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:02.130
I knew I had to put an end one
day to keep my sanity, too,

01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:04.150
but anyway, I didn't forget.

01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:07.480
I didn't want to put an end
because the story goes on.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:11.170
The story goes on and we
have much more to research.

01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:15.830
And I wanted to have the
last sentence as a sentence

01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:17.780
to speak to the reader.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:20.500
And it's a direct,
it's a conversation,

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:25.040
that way the reader and the
scholars, students, right there,

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.470
all of you, have to continue.

01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:32.710
Well, I hope that
they continue one day.

01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:37.570
I came - many items
can surprise us

01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:40.570
in the story of these
characters.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:45.110
And another one, to go back to
the Native American Indians,

01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:48.310
is that we have with Chicorano

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:53.250
and with Don Luis de
Velasco the first two persons

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:59.310
who partially achieved their
goal of defeating colonialism.

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:02.720
So when we're talking about
national history, well,

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.630
are they not national enough?

01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:08.930
Why do we have to
prove in which nation?

01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:12.700
And by the way, we use gross,
very general and generic terms,

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.270
the Indian Nation [inaudible].

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:18.340
I don't even want to
enter that territory.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.700
The Indian Nations.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.290
I think that they can transfer a
scholarship in order to be able

01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:28.410
to dominate this field a little
bit because they are a question

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:33.500
of nationality and defending
your own land, that feeling

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:36.780
that you are not national and
you belong to a different race

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.120
or you are still national.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.780
Anyway, of course, there are
many other points in the book

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:47.720
that I will have lots to pursue
because they are really funny.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.960
But I didn't do it
because I would lose track

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:54.140
and that's why I have many
pages so I don't lose track.

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:58.470
But there are - they're
the perfect explanation

01:11:58.470 --> 01:12:02.410
of how histories are
always a mix of at least -

01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:06.810
of at least three kind
of narratives: fingida,

01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:10.840
afición y verdadera,
which is fictitious,

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:15.110
[inaudible], and true history.

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:18.550
All the histories have
that and the fictious

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:21.460
and this combination
of three, I think,

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:26.720
that is marvelously represented
in, for instance, the wife,

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.060
the Spanish wife of Pedro
Menéndez de Avilés,

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:32.220
Doña Maria de Solis.

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:35.970
Pedro Menéndez de
Avilés's family wanted that -

01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:38.640
wanted to keep that
guy close to home.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.840
Apparently, he was not
a very peaceful person.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.420
And they tried to marry him

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:47.160
or to make an engagement
early in his teenage years.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.480
He was not very successful.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.680
Anyway, he ended up
marrying this Maria de Solis,

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.500
and this Doña Maria
de Solis was informed

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.910
by Pedro Menéndez de
Avilés that they were going

01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:59.620
to cross the Atlantic
and they were going

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.090
to set up in La Florida.

01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:05.250
So Doña Maria de Solis
puts to shame any character

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:09.540
from [Inaudible], Mama
Grande or anybody else,

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.130
and they're put to shame.

01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:14.600
They don't get even
close to this Solis.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.670
She decided, okay, it's
time to cross the Atlantic.

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:19.900
I want to bring my bed, my
bedspread, my furniture,

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:26.340
my silverware, enough plates
for 18 people, chairs,

01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:30.150
enough products to cook
cocido, Spanish cocido,

01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:32.220
nails to build my future house.

01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:35.300
She was determined
to settle there.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.600
And that's another point.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.250
If she was going to settle,

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:41.350
that's another very
interesting difference

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:44.350
between when we're speaking
history of the English

01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:47.430
or the French and the
Spanish or the Portuguese.

01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:49.510
We are conquistadores,
they are settlers.

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:53.130
I think that this lady
was quite a settler.

01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:57.200
I mean, she got everything
that one may need

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.800
in her future - in
her future home.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:06.500
We have mentioned before that
Amerigo Vespucci's Letter

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.500
and how that letter - by
the way, there's a copy

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.880
in this library, in the
basement of this library,

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:17.010
and here in the basement of this
library you have the richest

01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:21.070
collection of maps in the world.

01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:24.820
Four million is the last
number that I - five?

01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:26.830
Five, thank you.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:28.140
I knew that my [inaudible].

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.480
Five million maps.

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:33.440
So you don't have
anything else to do,

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:38.840
get yourself a library card.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.320
And there's five million there.

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:45.870
Five treasures that belong to
the early American history,

01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:49.140
and one of them was shown
by Professor Chang-Rodriguez

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:52.820
by Diego Ribera in 1629.

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:57.780
And there are others like the
Romeo and other Portolanos.

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.970
Wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful maps,

01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:02.650
and they're all right here.

01:15:02.650 --> 01:15:04.790
Anyway, I'm losing my track.

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:08.530
I was talking about Amerigo
Vespucci, how the importance

01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:12.800
of secrecy in the Casa de
Contratación and the failure

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:18.270
to keep those secrets and
how they were sold, stolen,

01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:21.960
or simply spoken about in a bar.

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.260
Who knows?

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:24.990
Anyway, I want to
conclude because I want

01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:27.210
to present just some
images to prove

01:15:27.210 --> 01:15:33.420
that what we were
telling you is true.

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:37.420
And just one - a
couple of things.

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:42.430
I also expect that when
my book is read, it is -

01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:45.800
I point out I say that's
several times in the book,

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.910
but I hope you use erasers
in the reader's mind

01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:50.950
because sometimes we only
read what we want to read

01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:53.360
and not what is written.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:16:00.620
And what is written in the book
is that I do not point my finger

01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:05.750
to anybody or any
country, and I do -

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:08.670
the only thing I do
is point out facts,

01:16:08.670 --> 01:16:11.380
and there's plenty
of them, believe me.

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:15.210
Also, I do not claim
any national territory.

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:17.140
I'm beyond that.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:22.000
I claim the knowledge of
territoriality and the maps

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.730
that prove that territoriality.

01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:28.100
Also, I hope that this
book is a thank you note

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.160
to the U.S. universities.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.440
I would not have been able
to write - to write this book

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:38.450
or any of my books if I had
not been under the auspices

01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:41.000
of American universities.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.940
And finally is the late, late,
very late thank you note also

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:52.010
for my late parents who
bought me my first book,

01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:54.520
the book that I own
and treasure.

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.110
I still have it in my library.

01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:58.560
It was a book, a
history of Spain.

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.540
It was, well, it was
much better than that.

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.510
It was called Soy Español.

01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:07.040
[ Laughter ]

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.760
What's there I forgot, but
what I didn't forget was the

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.970
beautiful form of that
book, the beautiful form

01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:18.740
in which the stories were
told, they were all fantastic.

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.480
And I loved that.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.560
I liked it so much
that in the cover

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:27.910
of the book I wrote my name
and four family names, not two,

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:32.960
four family names and my age
so I look like an author.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.390
Finally, I have my own book
and only two last names.

01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:42.960
But anyway, before we conclude
and have time for questions,

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.640
I would like to show you
just a couple of images.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.970
This is - we know
very well this map.

01:17:48.970 --> 01:17:52.600
This is the Juan de
la Cosa Map in 1500.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.510
In it, we have the -

01:17:54.510 --> 01:18:02.370
[ Background speaking ]

01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:08.160
So this is a very famous map
and we all know about it.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:12.010
It was - it was drawn

01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:13.750
after [inaudible]
voyages in the Atlantic.

01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:15.990
[Inaudible] was working first
in Spain and then in England,

01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:19.510
and we will go through that
later, and this is the -

01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:31.100
[ Inaudible ]

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:35.710
And we have the Amerigo
Vespucci with America,

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:39.850
the way it was described by
Amerigo Vespucci in his letter

01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:42.060
to the King of Spain
and Portugal.

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:46.900
We have in the book you can find
an engraving showing this part

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:49.480
of the King - of Vespucci
leaving the letter.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:59.510
This is the - the quality is the
best I could with what I have.

01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:00.810
It is a very [inaudible].

01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:04.700
I call him that way because
he was signing that name.

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:08.610
He was the nephew of Amerigo
Vespucci, or Amerigo Vespuccio,

01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:12.770
and in this I think
that [inaudible]

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:15.750
where the Spanish line
is and the imperial flag

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:22.130
of Charles I is right there
in the middle of the country.

01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:23.930
And of course -

01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:30.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:34.060
You have an image from a
modernization of that map

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:37.370
and you see all the important
things, not only the names

01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:39.310
of the regions but
also the [inaudible]

01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:40.900
and towns are all in Spanish.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:48.280
This is the [inaudible]
by Diego Ribero, 1527.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.840
We'll see detail later on.

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.690
[Inaudible] 1527, 1529.

01:19:56.690 --> 01:20:00.610
We have the discussion
on these two narratives.

01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:02.010
They are almost identical.

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:05.210
And what is interesting
is the detail.

01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:07.010
Here we have -

01:20:07.010 --> 01:21:12.440
[ Inaudible ]

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.650
This is another very
interesting and unique map.

01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:16.590
It's housed in this library.

01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:21.120
[Inaudible] 1562, and
what is interesting is

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.310
that Valla de Santa Maria
is really not located

01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:32.180
in the Roanoke Sound
area and - which is new

01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:35.760
and more interesting is that
the English call it the Roanoke

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:40.650
Colony, in Roanoke, of course,
thinking that they were going

01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:43.150
to Valla de Santa Maria.

01:21:43.150 --> 01:21:46.310
This - Sir Walter
Raleigh was guided

01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:50.490
by a Portuguese pilot
[inaudible].

01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:57.730
This pilot was not interested
in how things [inaudible].

01:21:57.730 --> 01:22:05.290
He was interested in
letting his own portion

01:22:05.290 --> 01:22:08.440
and they were fighting all
the way and [inaudible] knew

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:12.690
about the information
provided by the [inaudible].

01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:15.700
And that's my theory.

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:18.360
Some will refute it,
but I have the maps.

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.000
[Laughter] I'll be
happy - I'll be happy

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.110
to continue the conversation

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:24.720
because I'm not the
cartographer.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:31.530
And to show you California
was an island.

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:43.200
It was an island
all the way to 1658.

01:22:45.510 --> 01:23:11.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:17.670
In which we have the
information here in the corner

01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:19.970
from the [Inaudible] and
the chronicles, I think,

01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:23.770
described by Chicora
as paradise.

01:23:23.770 --> 01:23:28.850
And to prove his idea was
convincing [inaudible].

01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:31.270
These are numerous forts
and missions founded

01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:35.220
by the Spaniards in Florida
all the way to Virginia

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.920
and [inaudible] related
to the New World, I think,

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:43.270
Atlantic City, and his
idea of personifying

01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:50.350
and making [inaudible]
whatever you want to make.

01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:53.280
And of course, España
is at the head.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:57.420
England's at the bottom.

01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:59.510
Okay, gracias.

01:23:59.510 --> 01:24:08.500
