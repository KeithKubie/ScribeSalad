00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.300
We are being asked, what
is the smallest-- this

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.680
is a little typo here--
what is the smallest

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.480
possible sum of
squares of two numbers

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.170
if their product is negative 16?

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.670
So let's say that these
two numbers are x and y.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.950
So how could we define the
sum of the squares of the two

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.710
numbers?

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.940
So I'll just call that
the sum of the squares,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.840
s for sum of the squares,
and it would just

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.910
be equal to x squared
plus y squared.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.470
And this is what we
want to minimize.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.900
We want to minimize s.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.690
Now, right now s is expressed
as a function of x and y.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.190
We don't know how to minimize
with respect to two variables,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.540
so we have to get this in
terms of only one variable.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.660
And lucky for us, they give us
another piece of information.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.850
Their product is negative 16.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.690
So x times y is
equal to negative 16.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.360
So let's say we
wanted this expression

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.330
right over here
only in terms of x.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.690
Well, then we can
figure out what

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.095
y is in terms of x
and then substitute.

00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:11.470
So let's do that
right over here.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.700
If we divide both sides by x,
we get y is equal to negative 16

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.750
over x.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.740
And so let's replace
our y in this expression

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.030
with negative 16 over x.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.150
So then we would get
our sum of squares

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.140
as a function of
x is going to be

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.390
equal to x squared
plus y squared.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.230
y is negative 16 over x.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.020
And then that's what
we will now square.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.900
So this is equal to x
squared plus, what is this?

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.800
256 over x squared.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.870
Or we could write that as
256x to the negative 2 power.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.690
That is the sum of our squares
that we now want to minimize.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.196
Well, to minimize
this, we would want

00:02:02.196 --> 00:02:04.070
to look at the critical
points of this, which

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.260
is where the derivative
is either 0 or undefined,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.972
and see whether those
critical points are possibly

00:02:09.972 --> 00:02:11.180
a minimum or a maximum point.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.680
They don't have to
be, but those are

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.012
the ones if we have a
minimum or a maximum point,

00:02:15.012 --> 00:02:16.970
they're going to be one
of the critical points.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.640
So let's take the derivative.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.060
So the derivative
s prime-- let me

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.630
do this in a different
color-- s prime of x.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.320
I'll do it right
over here, actually.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.970
The derivative s prime
of x with respect

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.520
to x is going to be
equal to 2x times

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.360
negative 2 times 2x plus
256 times negative 2.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.705
So that's minus 512x to
the negative 3 power.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.650
Now, this is going to be
undefined when x is equal to 0.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.620
But if x is equal to
0, then y is undefined.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.240
So this whole thing breaks down.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.330
So that isn't a useful
critical point, x equals 0.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.920
So let's think about
any other ones.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.777
Well, it's defined
everywhere else.

00:03:04.777 --> 00:03:07.110
So let's think about where
the derivative is equal to 0.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.570
So when does this thing equal 0?

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:16.040
So when does 2x minus 512x
to the negative 3 equal 0?

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.520
Well, we can add 512x to the
negative 3 to both sides.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.390
So you get 2x is equal to 512x
to the negative third power.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.010
We can multiply both sides
times x to the third power

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.890
so all the x's go away
on the right-hand side.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.380
So you get 2x to the
fourth is equal to 512.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.730
We can divide both
sides by 2, and you

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.940
get x to the fourth
power is equal to 256.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.650
And so what is the
fourth root of 256?

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.900
Well, we could take the
square root of both sides just

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.140
to help us here.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.990
So let's see.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.400
So it's going to be x squared
is going to be equal to 256

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.160
is 16 squared.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.180
So this is 16.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.500
This is going to be x squared is
equal to 16 or x is equal to 4.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.000
Now that's our only
critical point we have,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.170
so that's probably
the x value that

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.790
minimizes our sum of
squares right over here.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.529
But let's make sure
it's a minimum value.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.680
And to do that, we can just
do our second derivative test.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.700
So let's figure out.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.640
Let's take the
second derivative s

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.260
prime prime of x and figure
out if we are concave upwards

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.030
or downwards when
x is equal to 4.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.690
So s prime prime of x is
going to be equal to 2.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.430
And then we're going to have
negative 3 times negative 512.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.070
So I'll just write that
as plus 3 times 512.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.077
That's going to be 1,536.

00:04:48.077 --> 00:04:48.660
Is that right?

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.190
Yeah, 3 times 500
is 1,500, 3 times 12

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.080
is 36, x to the
negative 4 power.

00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.270
And this thing right
over here is actually

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.900
going to be positive for any x.

00:05:04.815 --> 00:05:08.024
x to the negative 4, even
if the negative x value,

00:05:08.024 --> 00:05:09.190
that's going to be positive.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.650
Everything else is positive.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.590
This thing is always positive.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.840
So we are always in a
concave upwards situation.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.480
Concave upwards means that
our graph might look something

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.270
like that.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.395
Actually, I don't want to
draw the little squiggle.

00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:26.857
It might look
something like that.

00:05:26.857 --> 00:05:29.440
And you see there's a reason why
the second derivative implies

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.760
concave upwards, a second
derivative positive

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.119
means that our derivative
is constantly increasing.

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:36.910
So the derivative is
constantly increasing.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.920
It's negative, less
negative, even less negative.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.400
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.320
You see it's negative, less
negative, even less negative,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.940
0, positive, more positive.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.230
So it's increasing
over the entire place.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.290
So if you have a
critical point where

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.830
the derivative is equal to 0,
so the slope is equal to 0,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.110
and it's concave upwards,
you see pretty clearly

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.170
that we have minimized
the function.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.662
So what is y going
to be equal to?

00:06:06.662 --> 00:06:08.370
We actually don't even
have to figure out

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.440
what y has to be
equal to in order

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.961
to minimize the sum of squares.

00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:13.460
We could just put
it back into this.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.010
But just for fun, we see that
y would be negative 16 over x.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.900
So y would be equal
to negative 4.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.690
And we could just figure out
now what our sum of squares is.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.460
Our minimum sum of
squares is going

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.780
to be equal to 4 squared,
which is 16 plus negative 4

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.524
squared plus another 16,
which is equal to 32.

00:06:35.524 --> 00:06:37.440
Now I know some of you
might be thinking, hey,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.106
I could have done
this without calculus.

00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:41.650
I could have just tried out
numbers whose product is

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.560
negative 16 and I probably would
have tried out 4 and negative 4

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.282
in not too much time
and then I would

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.740
have been able to maybe figure
out it's lower than if I did

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.552
2 and negative 8 or negative
2 and 8 or 1 and 16.

00:06:53.552 --> 00:06:55.010
And that's true,
you probably would

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.197
have been able to do that.

00:06:56.197 --> 00:06:58.280
But you still wouldn't
have been able to feel good

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.405
that that was a minimum
value, because you wouldn't

00:07:00.405 --> 00:07:03.130
have tried out 4.01 or 4.0011.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.030
In fact, you couldn't have tried
out all of the possible values.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.155
Remember, we didn't say
that this is only integers.

00:07:08.155 --> 00:07:12.700
It just happened to be that
our values just worked out

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.940
to be integers in
this situation.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.330
You can imagine what would
happen if the problem wasn't

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.630
if their product is
negative 16, but what

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.080
if their product is negative 17?

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.880
Or what if the product
is negative 16.5?

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.204
Or what if their
product was pi squared?

00:07:28.204 --> 00:07:30.370
Then you wouldn't be able
to try everything else out

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.370
and you would have
to resort to doing

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.640
what we did in this video.
