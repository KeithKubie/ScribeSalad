00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.580
In most spicy foods, this is thanks to the
same chemicals that cause the burning sensation

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.720
on your tongue, namely capsaicin or allyl
isothiocyanate.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.789
Capsaicin is chemical found in fruits of the
genus Capsicum, which includes peppers.

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.459
It is present, usually in relatively high
amounts, in the placental tissue that holds

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:20.211
the seeds of the peppers, as well as in lower
concentrations in other parts of the fruit.

00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:24.300
The capsaicin works as a deterrent to stop
various animals, particularly mammals that

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.779
would crunch the seeds, from eating the fruits
or otherwise harming the plants or seeds.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.510
It also functions as an anti-fungal agent,
which further protects the plants.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.750
Allyl isothiocyanate, on the other hand, is
a colorless oil that can be found in things

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.450
like mustard, radishes, and wasabi.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.680
Like capsaicin, it serves as a defense for
the plant against various animals, as well

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.720
as works as an anti-fungal agent.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.600
These chemicals end up not only causing a
“hot” sensation on your tongue, but also

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.210
irritate the mucous membranes in your nose,
causing them to become inflamed.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.220
This triggers those membranes to produce extra
amounts of mucous as a defense mechanism to

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.750
try to keep out whatever unwanted substance
or particles are causing the irritation.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.900
This same type of irritation is why your eyes
may also become watery when you eat very spicy

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.900
foods.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.580
The capsaicin or allyl isothiocyanate can
irritate the membranes in your eyes, causing

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.909
your tear ducts to kick into overdrive trying
to wash the irritant away.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.280
This can make your nose even more runny as
some of the tears drain into your sinuses.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.600
Capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate also irritate
various tissues inside your body, such as

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.000
your intestines.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.940
This causes your body to react by trying to
flush the irritant out.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:55.689
This is why after eating spicy foods you sometimes
have the dreaded “liquid fire” poop.
