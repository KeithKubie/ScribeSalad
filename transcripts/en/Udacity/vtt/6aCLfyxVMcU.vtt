00:00:00.205 --> 00:00:02.840
So,we made some changes in the browser itself.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.870
&gt;&gt; But we can't share those changes.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.160
&gt;&gt; Right or save them.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.640
&gt;&gt; Right so to do that I guess we're going to have

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.500
to be a little more sophisticated than just working the browser. We're

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.930
going to need to get a code editor and we need to

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.040
get the code and how are we going to get the code?

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.840
&gt;&gt; So, the code is stored on GitHub so we will need GitHub accounts

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.370
and we'll need to actually figure out how to get the code from GitHub.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.690
&gt;&gt; And you, depending on your background in programming you may already have a

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.800
code you may like, you may know nothing about GitHub or you may be

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.140
an expert, so answer this next question it'll sort of guide you, there might

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.860
be some videos that you can skip and we don't want to waste anyone's time.
