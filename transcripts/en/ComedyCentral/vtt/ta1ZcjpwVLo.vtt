00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:05.004
- YOU THINK?
- WELL, NO.

00:00:05.037 --> 00:00:06.906
I ACTUALLY DIDN'T
EVEN DRINK THAT MUCH.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:08.408
JUST TWO BOTTLES,
BUT THEN

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:11.744
BEFORE I CAME,
I HAD THREE DRINKS.

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:13.646
[burps, clears throat]

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.715
HELLO.
[laughs]

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:20.420
TODAY WE'RE GONNA TALK
ABOUT EDITH WILSON,

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:23.289
THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:30.329 line:0%
WOODROW WILSON WAS
THE PRESIDENT OF--OF AMERICA.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:31.864
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:36.369
EDITH [bleep] WILSON WAS
THE GODDAMN PRESIDENT'S WIFE.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:38.071
WHEN HER HUSBAND'S AT WORK,

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.506
SHE'S LIKE, WHAT DO I DO?
I GOTTA THINK OF [bleep].

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.477
IT'S WORLD WAR I RIGHT NOW,
SO LET'S RATION.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.949
SHE'S LIKE,
DON'T EAT MEAT ON MONDAYS.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:54.887
DON'T EAT THE GAS ON SUNDAYS...
WITH THE CAR.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.391
AND THEN DON'T GET AN STD,
SHE SAID TO THE SOLDIERS.

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:00.259
WRAP IT UP.
WRAP YOUR DICK UP.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:03.629
SO, WOODROW WILSON,
HE HAD 18 MONTHS LEFT IN OFFICE,

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:05.665
AND HE HAS A [bleep] STROKE.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.033
HIS DOCTOR WAS LIKE,

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:11.704
UH, WOODROW WILSON HAS HAD
A STROKE, A BIG STROKE.

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:14.607
LIKE, WE CAN'T MOVE, Y'ALL,
STROKE.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.110
SO WHAT YOU GON' DO?

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:22.215
AND EDITH WAS LIKE,
WELL, WHO I LOVE IS THIS MAN.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.684
FOR WHO HE IS,
AND WHO HE IS

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:26.719
IS A GUY WHO WANTS
TO BE PRESIDENT

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.788
FOR SOME [bleep] REASON.

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.556
SO IF I DON'T--

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:31.724
JUST IGNORE THAT.

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:34.627
IF I DON'T--
JUST IGNORE THAT.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.363
IF I DON'T HELP HIM
BE PRESIDENT,

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:39.365
WHAT A KIND OF WIFE AM I?

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:43.069
THE DOCTOR'S LIKE, UH...

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.872
YOU GOT TO RUN
THE [bleep] COUNTRY

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:48.074
'CAUSE THIS GUY'S OUT
FOR THE COUNT.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:50.576
SO EDITH WAS LIKE, NO PROBLEM.
I GOT THIS.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.345
SHUT UP.
SIT DOWN.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.013
I AM IN CHARGE NOW.

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.748
CAN I GET MY CHEESY BREAD
I BROUGHT?

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:56.816
- YOUR WHAT?

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.318
- CHEESY BREAD
THAT I BROUGHT.

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:02.622
- CAN WE FINISH THIS PART?
- WHAT PART?

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.290
- THE PART THAT
WE WANT TO DO.

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:05.691
- [whimpers]
MY CHEESY BREAD.

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:07.126
- WE'RE STILL DOING IT.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.995
ALL RIGHT.
WELL--

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:10.897
- I DON'T WANT
THE BREAD ANYMORE.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.898
- [laughs]

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:14.100
- SO EDITH WILSON TOLD AMERICA,

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.502
HEY, GUYS.
[claps]

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:17.703
EXCUSE ME.

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:20.239
MY HUSBAND, THE PRESIDENT--

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:21.674
HE'S VERY TIRED,

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:23.709
AND HE WILL BE RESTING.

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:28.381
HE'S VERY TIRED,
SO HE NEEDS TO REST.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:30.416
BUT AT THIS POINT,
THE CONGRESS WAS LIKE,

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:35.621
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T
COME OUTSIDE IN A COUPLE WEEKS.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:37.290
WHAT'S HE DOING?

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:40.626
AND SO THEY KNOCK ON THE DOOR,
LIKE, 'SCUSE ME!

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.128
IT'S ME, CONGRESS.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.030
WE'RE HAVING A FEELING THAT--

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.065
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WE'RE FEELING,

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:47.633
BUT CAN YOU TALK TO US?

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:50.102
AND SHE'S LIKE,
NO, HE'S JUST SUPER TIRED.

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:52.572
HE HAS EXHAUSTION.
LIKE, DON'T BOTHER HIM.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:55.408
GET OUT OF HERE, CONGRESS.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.244
AND THAT
ACTUALLY QUIETED PEOPLE.

00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:00.713
IT ACTUALLY QUIETED
THE CONGRESS.

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.448
AND SHE EVEN WENT TO CONGRESS

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:04.984
AND WAS LIKE,
HEY, NO BIG DEAL.

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:07.386
I'M GIVING HIM EVERYTHING
YOU'RE SAYING, CONGRESS.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.957
I'M GIVING HIM ALL
THE LETTERS AND OTHER THINGS.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.859
SO, WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
OF THIS RULE

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:16.963
OR A LAW OR THING
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON?

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.865
AND THEY'D BE LIKE,
WHATEVER, WE THINK THIS.

00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:21.968
AND THEN SHE'D BRING IT
TO WOODROW WHO WAS LIKE,

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.136
HALF AWAKE,
AND SHE'D BE LIKE, ALL RIGHT.

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.138
WELL, CONGRESS IS LIKE,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:28.908
AND HE'D BE LIKE...
[mumbles indistinctly]

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:32.044
AND SHE WAS LIKE,
WELL, I GUESS I'LL COMPROMISE.

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:35.014
I'M JUST GONNA [bleep]

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:36.015
[stammers]

00:03:36.048 --> 00:03:39.018
MAKE THE DECISIONS MYSELF.

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:42.922
SO BASICALLY, EDITH WILSON WAS
THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:47.093
SHE RAN MEMOS BETWEEN
CONGRESS AND HIM.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:49.228
CONGRESS IS LIKE, ALL RIGHT.

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:54.200
WHAT? WHAT?

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:56.435
WHAT IS GOING ON?

00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:59.872
SO CONGRESS PICKED THIS ONE
REPUBLICAN SENATOR, ALBERT FALL.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:03.576
THEY'RE LIKE, ALBERT, GO SEE
WHAT HIS TRUE CONDITION IS.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.845
GO SEE WHAT WILSON'S
TRUE CONDITION IS.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:08.347
SO ALBERT FALL SHOWS UP.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.485
HE'S LIKE, CAN WE COME IN
AND SEE THE TRUE CONDITION?

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.754
SHE'S NOT [bleep] STUPID.
SHE'S LIKE YEAH, SURE.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.255
COME ON IN.

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:17.990
SO ALBERT FALL COMES IN.

THAT'S HOW DUMB GOVERNMENT IS.

00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:50.356
WE HAD A WOMAN [bleep] RUNNING

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:59.825
AND THAT'S HOW DUMB
PEOPLE WERE BACK THEN.

00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:02.294
THEY'RE LIKE,

HE SEEMS TO BE ALL

THAT'S HOW SHE RAN
