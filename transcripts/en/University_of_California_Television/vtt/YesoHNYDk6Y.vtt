- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bipedal, naked, large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.650
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:48.630
Aware that death is inevitable yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.130
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.510
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.330

we got here. An exploration made possible

- [Daniel] So I'm going to change gears a
little bit and talk a little bit more

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.700
about behavior and selective forces acting
on several larger behavioral packages but

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.520
I have to say I do so with a certain
degree of anxiety because, thanks to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.540
Photoshop, because there's two reasons
really why this talk has given me enormous

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.880
attack of the nerves. One is that I am, as
you've already learned, this is a really

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.340
confusing topic and anybody who ventures
to say they understand how our genus arose

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.130
is probably self-delusional. But the other
problem is that I actually started my

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.600
career actually getting interested in
studying the origins of Homo. And so I

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.020
have some kind of psychological issues
that I have to work out and so I hope

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.210
you'll forgive me if I start off this
lecture a little bit autobiographical and

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.930
I'll tell you a little bit how I got
interested in this crazy problem, which is

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.020
that when I was a freshman in college I
actually started working on this fossil to

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.230
try to estimate its cranial capacity. And
I thought that was really cool and we'd

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.380
published a paper and, wow, that's what
I'm going to do for the rest of my life

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.600
and then because of that for my senior
honors thesis we did the first

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.990
probabilistic study to ask if Homo habilis
and this thing rudolfensis were different

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.910
and that was really fun. And then of
course the next question, which was really

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.090
the subject of my Master's thesis, was to
see if we can figure out the evolutionary

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.290
relationships among these things and my
conclusion was there's so much

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.960
convergence; what we call homoplasy, that
it was a completely impossible task and so

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.600
I gave up on all this sort of stuff and
got involved in working on other things

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.390
like the fossil record and doing
biomechanics and stuff like that. But all

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.600
along I've been really interested in the
origins of Homo and one problem that

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.260
continuously puzzled me is that basically
I'm a splitter, I can split species. I

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.510
generally prefer to do that rather than
being a lumper, but I'm convinced that the

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.740
species Homo erectus really is a bona fide
species and it's lasted a long time and

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.570
it's had an enormous range of variation.
It's actually more or less doubled its

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.610
brain size over the course of about 2
million years and there seems to be sort

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.320
of this gradual increase in brain size
regardless of what the errors might be for

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.040
some of those points. And furthermore as
we're going to learn a little bit later

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.970
on, there's also an enormous amount of
variation not just in brain size but also

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.410
on body size in the species. And as you'll
learn from Leslie Aiello who will be

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.710
talking later on and also from Herman
Ponzer who'll be talking later on, there's

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.660
an interesting energetic issue here
because big brains bigger bodies and

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.930
they're probably other two shifts going on
like in life history, that require extra

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.690
energy and these are some estimates that
Leslie Aiello and Kathy Kee published a

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.180
bunch of years ago, it's one of my
favorite papers. And they more or less

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.970
estimated that Australopithecus female
like Lucy, she would've needed about 1200

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.470
calories a day, more if she were
lactating, whereas a female Homo erectus

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.270
would need a good 50% more calories per
day and again that amounts to quite a

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.210
number of calories required if they are
lactating. And at the same time, more

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.890
energy is needed you also see that Homo
erectus has smaller teeth so this is tooth

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.080
size of Homo erectus compared to Homo
habilis and Australopithecus and at the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.380
same time also these are estimates of bite
force from a paper we published a few

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.210
years ago showing that the genus Homo was
able to produce much lower bite forces

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.890
than those of Australopithecus. So
therefore if they're getting more energy

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.250
it's not from eating more food, it's
eating from more higher-quality food. So

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.840
this raises two interesting questions. So
one is how did early Homo, and I'm going

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.940
to focus primarily on Homo erectus because
I don't really know how to make sense of

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.920
the earlier stuff, how did they get more
energy and secondly what was the effect of

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.680
more energy on early Homo erectus
evolution? And again I'm going to focus on

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.980
Homo erectus. And so there a lot of
hypotheses out there people have been

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.040
thinking about this for a long time. One
idea is that it has to do with food

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.700
processing, better efficiency at long
distance locomotion, you might call that

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.280
tracking, I've been of course very
obsessed with the idea of running and its

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.210
importance in hunting, and I'll talk about
that in a second, origins of meat eating,

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.720
food sharing, extractive foraging, the
list goes on. And to me, when you actually

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.430
look at all these tasks and put them
together what they suggest is that

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.740
actually what we're looking at is the
origins of a way of life that still

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.390
exists, just barely, called hunting and
gathering. And to me hunting and gathering

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.770
is really an integrated system. There's no
one component to it, it's not just hunting

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.310
and gathering, although both of those are
important. So you have meat, is an

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.900
important component of the hunting and
gathering diet, either through hunting and

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.210
scavenging, there's also foraging but
importantly it's often extractive so

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.150
you're actually digging things up rather
than just plucking them off trees or

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.470
collecting honey or whatever, things that
take more effort. But you can't make the

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.490
system work without also, without tools
and food processing and I'll talk about

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.050
that in a second, and furthermore the
system also requires intense cooperation

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.280
in various ways, division of labor, food
sharing, and so on. So I would like to

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.030
suggest that actually much of what we
think about in terms of the origins of

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.120
Homo has to do with this hunting and
gathering system and that you can think

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.200
about it as a trend not as a moment in
time when, voila, the world's changed and

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.510
as a trend, a selective trend, that has a
lot to do with energy and that you have

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.090
selection for two major kinds of skills.
First of all, they're the cognitive/social

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.900
skills, the skills that require increased
intelligence or brains, that's very

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.130
important for being a hunter and gatherer,
but there also athletic skills, hunter

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.140
gatherers are athletes, they actually have
to go out and do work every day and use

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.360
their bodies in complex ways and a lot of
the athletic activities that hunter

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.870
gatherers do involve endurance athleticism
rather than power or speed athleticism.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.580
And those in turn led to increased energy
availability which then permitted

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.290
selection, you might even say it released
selection, released constraints on

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.010
selection for bigger brains, etc, that
drove the system forward. Here's a more

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.310
formal version of the model, so you have
selection for better hunting and gathering

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.650
abilities, a combination of brain and
brawn, not just brains over brawn, this

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.380
leads to increased available energy and of
course that's going to be especially

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.370
important for mothers.
You can only do so much with energy, you

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:46.160
can either increase the use of energy and
reproduction or you can increase it in

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.050
maintenance and growth or somatic
investment and that will lead to not only

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.310
maybe population growth but also energy
that can grow bigger brains, grow bigger

00:07:54.310 --> 00:08:01.160
bodies, have longer life histories, and
that indeed leads to selection for better

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.230
athletic capabilities and better cognitive
capabilities which then keep the system

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.960
going forward and so that you have what I
would call a SIR Classic Feedback Model.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.420
Now in only 18 minutes, I don't have the
opportunity to go into great detail, so

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.600
I'm going to focus on just a few aspects
of this model and I'm going to focus in

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.920
particular on hunting and scavenging and
then briefly talk a little bit about food

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.720
processing. So I've been interested for
many years about the problem how it is

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.600
that early hominins hunted and scavenged.
So here we have Usain Bolt mythically

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.270
racing a cheetah. It would be no contest
because Usain Bolt is the fastest guy on

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.550
the planet but he can run about 10 meters
a second, can do so for about 10 or 20

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.460
seconds, pretty much any quadruped out
there in the Savanna can run twice as fast

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.840
as Bolt and can do so for about 4 or 5
minutes. So he would have no chance, being

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.110
either prey or for that matter escaping
from any predator. In addition hunting is

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.420
difficult and chancey, humans lack natural
defenses and also, until very recently, we

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.830
lacked any kind of technology. This is the
oldest known stone point, it's

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:02.510
controversially dated to 500,000 years ago
from southern Africa and actually really

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.160
stone points really don't appear commonly
in the archaeological records until about

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.360
300,000 years ago. So that means early
Homo, if it was hunting and scavenging,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.190
did so basically with just a sharpened
wooden stick or some rocks to throw. And

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.300
then finally, if you're going to become a
carnivore, you also have to deal with

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.750
other carnivores and that's a very
dangerous guild to deal with. I wouldn't

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.330
like to do that, I certainly when these
things happen, I stay in the Jeep. I don't

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.990
get out of it. So we've, Dennis Bramble
and I, of the University of Utah, based on

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.340
earlier work done by Dave Carrier have
argued that one important factor that

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.630
helped early hominins become hunters,
after all it's kind of a weird thing to

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:42.210
think about bipedal primates becoming
hunters, is our incredible ability to run

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.770
long distances at relatively fast speeds,
endurance running. And I don't have time

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.610
now to go through this list of wonderful
features that we all have in our bodies

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:56.000
literally from our heads to our toes but
we have a wide range of adaptive features,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.370
features that improve our performance and
our ability to run long distances even if

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.460
you don't run long distances, you have the
ability to do it. In fact, you're right

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.640
now sitting on one of those features, your
gluteus maximus especially enlarged in

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.280
humans. And we think there's good evidence
that it's an adaptation for long-distance

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.720
running. And some of these features of
course we can see in the fossil record

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.620
some of them we can't see, of course,
because they don't preserve. We also have

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.720
some of these features, and the features
I've listed with the exception of long

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.300
legs, I believe can really only make sense
in terms of their ability to improve in

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.140
performance and running and not walking.
So these are not just consequences of

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.730
walking a lot, these are features for
running. And also intriguingly, and again

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.620
I don't have the time to do this today, a
lot of these features, not all of them,

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.400
first appear in the genus Homo. Some of
them appear in australopiths, that's for

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.930
sure, some of them we can't see in early
Homo though we have some guesses about

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.240
them from footprints that are dated to the
same time period. But for the most part,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.490
if you look at the package of features
that make human beings able to run

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.610
marathons or other sort of long-distance
events they more or less appear in the

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:01.090
genus Homo and I think that we can say
that with some degree of confidence. So

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.110
how have these been adapted? So one
hypothesis is that it may have been

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.080
important for the very earliest
meat-eating, is that we started off, or

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.910
our ancestors started off scavenging. This
is called power scavenging, where you

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:16.370
detect a scavenging opportunity and one
way to do it would be to observe vultures

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.050
in the distance and in fact there's some
really neat data from South Africa showing

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.950
that actually vultures do this. So
vultures follow other vultures, so why

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.160
couldn't hominins do this too? And if you
do this in the middle of the day when we

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.530
can run better than other animals, you
would, particularly other carnivores, you

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.550
might have an opportunity to get to these
carcasses before, say, the hyenas or other

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.390
competitors could've gotten there, so that
might've been an advantage. We think that

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.990
the really more important process that
maybe happened later because we have

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.310
evidence that running, that hominins are
hunting, they're actually hunting large

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.620
adult prime males by at least 2 million
years ago, is a motive of hunting that

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.640
still exists, it's kind of rare, called
persistence hunting. And it's been

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.030
documented all around the world in Africa
and the New World, and Asia, and Europe,

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.990
etc, but of course it's become less common
today because we have not only

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:07.210
supermarkets but also bow and arrow and
dogs and nets and things like that. But

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.290
here's how persistence hunting works. So
I've graphed here on the X-axis speed in

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.830
meters per second and in blue here I've
got the endurance running range for human

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:21.700
beings and here's our sprinting range and
here I've got the trot range for various

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.610
quadrupeds. So humans can run marathons,
for example, well above the trot/gallop

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:31.690
transition speed of dogs the same size as
humans well above ponies and actually good

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.130
human runners can run above the
trot/gallop transition speed of horses. So

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.530
we can run long distances at speeds that
make quadrupeds gallop. And importantly,

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.960
when we run, we grew cool primarily by
sweating, such as this woman at the

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.960
Westminster dog show, but where her dog
and this zebra, for example, that's being

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:54.720
chased by a film crew obviously, can't
sweat, they don't sweat but they cool down

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.380
by panting, short shallow breaths. And the
cool thing is that when animals gallop

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.090
they cease to be able to pant, that's
basically because their guts slam into

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:08.270
their diaphragm with each stride and so
that's a serious constraint. So if you go

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.280
on a hot date don't take your dog for a
really long run and force it to gallop,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.540
you'll kill your dog. So that enables us
to do something call persistence hunting.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.830
Again as I said, it happens in the heat so
people typically do it in the middle of

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.700
the day when it's really hot, they'll pick
really big animals, the bigger the animal

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.870
the better, because big things overheat
faster than small things, and they'll

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.910
chase that animal, force that animal to
gallop, course the animal will gallop

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.740
faster than the human can run, the animal
will hide in the bushes but then the human

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:38.750
chases it, attracts it, usually at a walk,
finds it again and then chases it again.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.830
So there's this kind of dance. In fact,
it's called in South African by the

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:46.280
bushmen, sometimes the great dance, which
they go from the chase versus track, run

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:51.030
versus walk, and over the course of about
15 to 30 km, again only about half of that

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.620
spent running, they can drive animals such
as this kudu into a state of hypothermia,

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:01.680
where the animal's going to die anyway.
And according to the number of hunts that

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.380
have been followed by Louie Levenberg,
down in South Africa, about 75% of the

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.510
hunts that he's followed, these
persistence hunts, were actually

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.150
successful, which is a remarkable level
for hunting. Now of course hunting is not

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.060
all about running. There are many other
adaptations, which I think are very

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.910
important, for example we've done work in
my lab on throwing. Obviously you need to

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:23.440
walk long distances in order to run, you
have to carry food back, you have to carry

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:29.390
weapons or things to defend you, the
ability to lose heat is very important. I

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.910
would also argue there are important
cognitive adaptations which are important

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.130
for hunting. For example, you have to be
able to track an animal which is not a

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.450
trivial task. You have to have really good
spatial memory and mapping, you have to

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.950
have a good theory of mind. There's this
wonderful book by Louie Levenberg,

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.420
actually in which he goes through the
various kinds of cognitive tasks that are

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.970
necessary to do this kind of hunting. You
have to be a really good naturalist with

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.570
knowledge of the ecology. You have to have
sharing and division of labor and

00:14:55.570 --> 00:15:01.480
communication, etc. So I'm not arguing
that hunting is the sole deal here. And

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.640
furthermore, I would also not make the
argument that these are features that only

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.370
were beneficial for hunting, obviously
some of these features would've been

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.960
important, for example, getting honey, for
digging underground storage organs and so

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.980
on. So there's a lot going on, I've just
been focusing on hunting. I don't want to

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:23.200
overstate my case here. But I would also
argue that again there's more. Again

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.800
there's a lot of systems here to talk
about and I just want to talk about one

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.250
more of them today because again we don't
have time to do everything and talk about

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.760
the importance of I would say is food
processing. So let's imagine you're a

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.640
hunter and you've come back from a long
day's hunt and maybe one of those 25% of

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.810
the time, maybe even more who knows, that
you came back empty-handed. So you've been

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:45.060
gone for much of the day chasing some kudu
and damn you didn't get it, you didn't get

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:50.190
a lot of food. You come back and you're
hungry and you need food. You don't want

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.460
to go into negative energy balance. Now
unfortunately, I would say 2 million years

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:58.890
ago cooking hasn't yet been invented. In
addition, if you try to eat the normal

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:02.530
kinds of food that foragers eat, you're
going to have to spend a lot of time doing

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:07.190
it. Food processing... Chimpanzees spend
about half their day eating. They fill

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.740
their bellies, wait for their bellies to
empty, fill their bellies again, wait for

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.100
their bellies to empty, do that, basically
that's what they do all day long. You

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.380
can't afford to spend all night long
eating, waiting for your belly to empty,

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.780
to fill it up again to go in the next day.
And then finally if I were to give you raw

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:27.730
meat to chew, which of course, doesn't
require that much time to chew, you'd

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.730
actually have a pretty horrible time doing
it. You should by the way check out this

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:36.600
video. This is a piece of goat that we
gave to somebody in our lab and after, raw

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.240
goat I should say, and after 40 chews you
can see these are the other particles, we

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.190
had the person spit it out, you can see
that after 40 chews this person was unable

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.570
to actually reduce this particle any
smaller. In fact, and you can also try

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:53.250
this experiment at home if you'd like to,
the point is, that human teeth are

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:58.240
dreadfully designed or adapted for chewing
raw meat. But there's a simple solution,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.650
all you need to do it sort of simple
processing that wasn't invented back in

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:07.030
the Oldowan that might've been started 3.3
million years ago, you can cut your meat,

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:11.800
which of course people still do to today
and you could also pound your underground

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.730
storage organs and break them into smaller
pieces. So again I would argue that this

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.730
suggests there's some kind of feedback
group going on in the genus Homo. You've

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.110
got selection for better hunting/gathering
abilities that's not just brains, but also

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:27.920
brawn and I would argue that many of these
athletic capabilities have to do with

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.010
endurance, but not all of them, power is
important sometimes, and that we have,

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:37.250
again, this feedback loop giving us more
energy, allowing more investment, not only

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:42.750
reproduction but in bodies which then
improve capabilities that provide extra

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:47.210
energy which drive this loop forward. And
of course for a theory to be useful it has

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.180
to have some predictive power and I would
say that it helps us explain several

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.380
trends that we see in the genus Homo. So
one, for example, is the dispersal of

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.420
humans out of Africa. If you do some basic
models and I'm not going to go through the

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.910
math now, if you have early Homo
increasing its population size by 0.4% per

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:06.850
year, which is about average for many
hunter/gatherers today, and you keep group

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:11.500
size and population density about the same
as hunter/gatherers you can actually

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:17.970
account for the dispersal of hominins from
Nairobi all the way to Tbilisi in between

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:23.310
50,000 and 100,000 years. Secondly, I
would argue that all this increased energy

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.290
might've been just what was necessary for
that increase in brain size and also body

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:31.970
size that we've observed and already
discussed about in the genus Homo. It

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.800
also, I think explains an interesting
specimen Homo floresiensis because we've

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.600
talked about increased energy driving this
positive feedback loop in Homo, well what

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.220
happens to those poor descendants of maybe
Homo erectus that ended up on the Island

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.040
of Flores, then they're stuck there and
there's not much food and it seems that

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.550
there, selection drove them in reverse so
they went down to smaller bodies and their

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:58.360
brain sizes shrunk even more presumably as
adaptations to save energy. And then

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.390
finally I think also it helps us explain
why we have such a hard time not only

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.780
talking about the origins of the genus
Homo but also its next transition to

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.690
archaic Homo, another maybe not so well
kept secret, as we have a hard time

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.800
defining Homo heidelbergensis just as much
as we have defining Homo habilis or Homo

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.630
erectus. And this is an analysis I did a
few years ago but if you take this fossil

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.770
which is an early Homo erectus and blow it
up to this fossil and actually look at the

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:28.370
differences in size and shape, actually
hold size constant, basically Homo

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.430
heidelbergensis, this archaic Homo is a
version of Homo erectus that has

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.480
essentially a bigger brain, you can see
that from these arrows, and a relatively

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.530
larger face, which I would argue scales
with having a bigger body. So basically, I

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:44.450
would argue that archaic Homo is a Homo
erectus that's basically had its brain

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.930
blown up and its face and body blown up
and that's more or less what you get. And

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:52.160
there's plenty of evidence now that it's
maybe then an archaic Homo and I hope

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.530
Leslie Aiello will agree with me that it's
really in archaic Homo that we see this

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.430
slowdown in life history, this extended
period of childhood, because early Homo

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.110
erectus doesn't have that. And I would
venture to guess, but we don't have any

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.630
evidence, that if you found an archaic
Homo it would have lots of body fat, like

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:11.760
most of us today, but not like
chimpanzees. I don't mean excess body fat

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.460
I mean the thin humans are still fat
compared to most primates. So in short,

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.080
hunting and gathering, I would argue
favored selection for both brains and

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.390
brawn and in particular I would say
endurance athleticism and that more brains

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.740
and more brawn led to increased energy
availability which released constraints on

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.260
selection for yet more brains and brawn
and drove an interesting feedback loop.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.640
And the ramifications of this are
particularly interesting in a world today

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.410
where we get all the energy we want from
the supermarket and no longer have to do

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:44.577
any endurance athleticism in order to get
it, but that's obviously another lecture.

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:45.924
Thank you.
