00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.790
well I thought we'd kick off by doing a

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800
well I thought we'd kick off by doing a
 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.619
well I thought we'd kick off by doing a
little experiment with you Brady

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629
little experiment with you Brady
 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.400
little experiment with you Brady
I've got some weights here and I want to

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410
I've got some weights here and I want to
 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.530
I've got some weights here and I want to
see how sensitive your hands are that

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540
see how sensitive your hands are that
 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.039
see how sensitive your hands are that
don't mean I want you to lift some

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
don't mean I want you to lift some
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.310
don't mean I want you to lift some
weights this is a workout session and I

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320
weights this is a workout session and I
 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.960
weights this is a workout session and I
wanted to see if you can tell the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
wanted to see if you can tell the
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.900
wanted to see if you can tell the
difference between how heavy different

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
difference between how heavy different
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.849
difference between how heavy different
things are so I think when we take

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
things are so I think when we take
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.609
things are so I think when we take
camera it's fine Freddie you're fine

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
camera it's fine Freddie you're fine
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.720
camera it's fine Freddie you're fine
you're fine it's not the most flattering

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
you're fine it's not the most flattering
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.040
you're fine it's not the most flattering
angle a which one of those is heavier

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050
angle a which one of those is heavier
 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.670
angle a which one of those is heavier
that one correct correct answer right so

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
that one correct correct answer right so
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.490
that one correct correct answer right so
that one is and I look yeah a hundred

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500
that one is and I look yeah a hundred
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.920
that one is and I look yeah a hundred
and twenty grams okay and then your

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
and twenty grams okay and then your
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.830
and twenty grams okay and then your
other hand you have a hundred grams okay

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
other hand you have a hundred grams okay
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.750
other hand you have a hundred grams okay
okay now I'm gonna make it slightly

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
okay now I'm gonna make it slightly
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.490
okay now I'm gonna make it slightly
harder you could tell the difference

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
harder you could tell the difference
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500
harder you could tell the difference
between 120 and 100 so you can sense 20

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
between 120 and 100 so you can sense 20
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.890
between 120 and 100 so you can sense 20
gram difference then

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900
gram difference then
 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.460
gram difference then
[Applause]

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470
 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.920
is what you're shooting vaguely usable

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930
is what you're shooting vaguely usable
 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:15.160
is what you're shooting vaguely usable
type thing okay and now okay now I feel

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170
type thing okay and now okay now I feel
 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.940
type thing okay and now okay now I feel
like that's heavier incorrect so that is

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950
like that's heavier incorrect so that is
 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.140
like that's heavier incorrect so that is
200 grams and 220 and you can't tell the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150
200 grams and 220 and you can't tell the
 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.660
200 grams and 220 and you can't tell the
difference and there is a reason for

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670
difference and there is a reason for
 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.240
difference and there is a reason for
that okay okay so what was going on

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250
that okay okay so what was going on
 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.560
that okay okay so what was going on
there is something that Ernest Weber

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570
there is something that Ernest Weber
 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.330
there is something that Ernest Weber
discovered in 1834 we need to do exactly

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340
discovered in 1834 we need to do exactly
 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.820
discovered in 1834 we need to do exactly
this experiment he noticed that even

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830
this experiment he noticed that even
 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.760
this experiment he noticed that even
though you can sense a small change in

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770
though you can sense a small change in
 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.890
though you can sense a small change in
between two weights when the initial

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900
between two weights when the initial
 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.010
between two weights when the initial
weight is very small as that initial

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020
weight is very small as that initial
 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.190
weight is very small as that initial
weight gets bigger you can no longer

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200
weight gets bigger you can no longer
 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.040
weight gets bigger you can no longer
detect that change the just noticeable

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050
detect that change the just noticeable
 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.840
detect that change the just noticeable
difference that you need changes

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850
difference that you need changes
 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.420
difference that you need changes
depending on the size of the weights now

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430
depending on the size of the weights now
 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.760
depending on the size of the weights now
this led him to come up with an equation

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770
this led him to come up with an equation
 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.650
this led him to come up with an equation
which is known as Weber's law that small

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660
which is known as Weber's law that small
 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.130
which is known as Weber's law that small
difference that tiny change in the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140
difference that tiny change in the
 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.840
difference that tiny change in the
intensity if you like a bit of the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850
intensity if you like a bit of the
 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.130
intensity if you like a bit of the
feeling depends it's a ratio really that

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140
feeling depends it's a ratio really that
 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.009
feeling depends it's a ratio really that
you're you're sensing and that ratio is

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019
you're you're sensing and that ratio is
 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.009
you're you're sensing and that ratio is
constant so although you can detect a 20

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019
constant so although you can detect a 20
 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.370
constant so although you can detect a 20
gram difference when you've got 100

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380
gram difference when you've got 100
 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.900
gram difference when you've got 100
grams in your hand you can't detect it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910
grams in your hand you can't detect it
 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.699
grams in your hand you can't detect it
when you're at 200 grams you need a much

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709
when you're at 200 grams you need a much
 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.320
when you're at 200 grams you need a much
bigger difference that small it's just

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330
bigger difference that small it's just
 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.210
bigger difference that small it's just
noticeable difference before you can

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220
noticeable difference before you can
 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.520
noticeable difference before you can
detect it and the thing is is that

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530
detect it and the thing is is that
 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.800
detect it and the thing is is that
although in weights you know often in

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810
although in weights you know often in
 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.050
although in weights you know often in
that situation where you're testing

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
that situation where you're testing
 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.360
that situation where you're testing
different ways actually I think that

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370
different ways actually I think that
 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.220
different ways actually I think that
this Weber's law applies to a lot of

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230
this Weber's law applies to a lot of
 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.050
this Weber's law applies to a lot of
different situations so you know if

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060
different situations so you know if
 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.960
different situations so you know if
you're in a really dark room and someone

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970
you're in a really dark room and someone
 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.310
you're in a really dark room and someone
maybe turns on their iPhone torch and

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320
maybe turns on their iPhone torch and
 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.259
maybe turns on their iPhone torch and
you can see it kind of like lights up

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269
you can see it kind of like lights up
 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.060
you can see it kind of like lights up
the entire room but when you're in a

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070
the entire room but when you're in a
 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.979
the entire room but when you're in a
really bright room if someone flicked on

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989
really bright room if someone flicked on
 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.479
really bright room if someone flicked on
their torture with me you wouldn't

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489
their torture with me you wouldn't
 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.550
their torture with me you wouldn't
notice the difference

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560
 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.110
and this explains why as you get older

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120
and this explains why as you get older
 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.730
and this explains why as you get older
years seem as though they're going

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740
years seem as though they're going
 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.460
years seem as though they're going
faster time kind of speeds up as you get

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470
faster time kind of speeds up as you get
 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.710
faster time kind of speeds up as you get
older right even though a year is the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720
older right even though a year is the
 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.280
older right even though a year is the
same length always the ratio of how long

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290
same length always the ratio of how long
 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.800
same length always the ratio of how long
that year is to how long your life has

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810
that year is to how long your life has
 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.660
that year is to how long your life has
been ends up getting smaller and smaller

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670
been ends up getting smaller and smaller
 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.750
been ends up getting smaller and smaller
and smaller so how it feels changes over

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760
and smaller so how it feels changes over
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.229
and smaller so how it feels changes over
time

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239
time
 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.449
time
so this here is Weber's law but what it

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
so this here is Weber's law but what it
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.970
so this here is Weber's law but what it
means is that the way that we experience

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980
means is that the way that we experience
 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.690
means is that the way that we experience
things in in life actually follows a

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700
things in in life actually follows a
 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.420
things in in life actually follows a
logarithm so if you think about how

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430
logarithm so if you think about how
 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.130
logarithm so if you think about how
something feels your response to

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140
something feels your response to
 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.050
something feels your response to
something and then you compare that to

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060
something and then you compare that to
 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.330
something and then you compare that to
the sort of intensity of whatever it is

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340
the sort of intensity of whatever it is
 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.410
the sort of intensity of whatever it is
you're feeling so this could be light

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420
you're feeling so this could be light
 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.420
you're feeling so this could be light
can be sound it could be weights the way

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430
can be sound it could be weights the way
 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.820
can be sound it could be weights the way
that this changes it takes sort of this

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830
that this changes it takes sort of this
 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.430
that this changes it takes sort of this
shape here it's kind of a logarithmic

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440
shape here it's kind of a logarithmic
 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.830
shape here it's kind of a logarithmic
shape so what that means is if you start

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840
shape so what that means is if you start
 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.470
shape so what that means is if you start
off down here and you're a very low

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480
off down here and you're a very low
 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.809
off down here and you're a very low
weight okay and then you take a really

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819
weight okay and then you take a really
 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.699
weight okay and then you take a really
tiny change in the weight so this 20

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709
tiny change in the weight so this 20
 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.309
tiny change in the weight so this 20
gram change so this is gonna be I this

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319
gram change so this is gonna be I this
 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.850
gram change so this is gonna be I this
would be I plus Delta I the difference

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860
would be I plus Delta I the difference
 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.000
would be I plus Delta I the difference
how that feels is gonna be quite big but

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
how that feels is gonna be quite big but
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.430
how that feels is gonna be quite big but
then if you're over here so now this one

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440
then if you're over here so now this one
 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.960
then if you're over here so now this one
will be sort of a hundred grams down

will be sort of a hundred grams down
 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.850
will be sort of a hundred grams down
here and let's say when you're over here

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860
here and let's say when you're over here
 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.800
here and let's say when you're over here
you're up at 200 grams made the y-axis

like almost nothing in your response so

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320
like almost nothing in your response so

essentially what this means is the way

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760
essentially what this means is the way
 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.159
essentially what this means is the way
that we feel stuff the way that we

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169
that we feel stuff the way that we
 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.250
that we feel stuff the way that we

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419
linear relationship it actually follows
 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.390
linear relationship it actually follows
a logarithmic relationship which is what

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400
a logarithmic relationship which is what
 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.760
a logarithmic relationship which is what
this curve and here is my thing that is

this curve and here is my thing that is
 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.380
this curve and here is my thing that is
quite interesting because when you come

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390
quite interesting because when you come
 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.850

the reason why I came across this was

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370
the reason why I came across this was
 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.869
the reason why I came across this was
because I was doing some research into

that the same amount but the thing is is
 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:03.420
that the same amount but the thing is is
that a six-month jail term feels a lot

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430
that a six-month jail term feels a lot
 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.850
that a six-month jail term feels a lot
longer than a three-month jail term but

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860
longer than a three-month jail term but
 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.100
longer than a three-month jail term but
a twenty year and three months jail term

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110
a twenty year and three months jail term
 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.050
a twenty year and three months jail term
doesn't really feel like that much more

it's because of this it's because it
 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.620
it's because of this it's because it
doesn't it just doesn't feel like enough

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630
doesn't it just doesn't feel like enough

preferred numbers so you get lots and

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840
preferred numbers so you get lots and
 

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.530
preferred numbers so you get lots and
lots of fine granular sentences down low

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:38.540
lots of fine granular sentences down low
 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.750
lots of fine granular sentences down low
and then you just get nice big round

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:40.760
and then you just get nice big round
 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.170
and then you just get nice big round
numbers like 20 years and 30 years

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.180
numbers like 20 years and 30 years
 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.320
