00:00:06.953 --> 00:00:09.856
Have you ever tried to picture
an ideal world?

00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:12.676
One without war, poverty, or crime?

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:14.636
If so, you're not alone.

00:00:14.636 --> 00:00:19.206
Plato imagined an enlightened
republic ruled by philosopher kings,

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:22.077
many religions promise 
bliss in the afterlife,

00:00:22.077 --> 00:00:23.382
and throughout history,

00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:27.447
various groups have tried to build
paradise on Earth.

00:00:27.447 --> 00:00:32.926
Thomas More's 1516 book "Utopia"
gave this concept a name,

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:35.517
Greek for "no place."

00:00:35.517 --> 00:00:37.707
Though the name suggested impossibility,

00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:40.077
modern scientific and political progress

00:00:40.077 --> 00:00:44.068
raised hopes of these dreams
finally becoming reality.

00:00:44.068 --> 00:00:48.007
But time and time again,
they instead turned into nightmares

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.837
of war, famine, and oppression.

00:00:50.837 --> 00:00:53.988
And as artists began to question
utopian thinking,

00:00:53.988 --> 00:00:58.768
the genre of dystopia,
the not good place, was born.

00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:03.418
One of the earliest dystopian works
is Jonathan Swift's "Gulliver's Travels."

00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:06.738
Throughout his journey, Gulliver
encounters fictional societies,

00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:11.728
some of which at first seem impressive,
but turn out to be seriously flawed.

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:13.628
On the flying island of Laputa,

00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:18.287
scientists and social planners
pursue extravagant and useless schemes

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:22.147
while neglecting the practical needs
of the people below.

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:25.168
And the Houyhnhnm who live
in perfectly logical harmony

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:30.128
have no tolerance for the imperfections
of actual human beings.

00:01:30.128 --> 00:01:33.488
With his novel, Swift established
a blueprint for dystopia,

00:01:33.488 --> 00:01:37.179
imagining a world where certain trends
in contemporary society

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.928
are taken to extremes,

00:01:38.928 --> 00:01:42.258
exposing their underlying flaws.

00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:46.952
And the next few centuries would
provide plenty of material.

00:01:46.952 --> 00:01:50.129
Industrial technology that promised
to free laborers

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:54.530
imprisoned them in slums
and factories, instead,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.858
while tycoons grew richer than kings.

00:01:57.858 --> 00:02:02.699
By the late 1800's, many feared
where such conditions might lead.

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:06.489
H. G. Wells's "The Time Machine" imagined
upper classes and workers

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:09.209
evolving into separate species,

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.840
while Jack London's "The Iron Heel"
portrayed a tyrannical oligarchy

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.399
ruling over impoverished masses.

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:22.609
The new century brought more exciting
and terrifying changes.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.680
Medical advances made it possible
to transcend biological limits

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.350
while mass media allowed instant
communication

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.980
between leaders and the public.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.159
In Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World",
citizens are genetically engineered

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.910
and conditioned to perform
their social roles.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.690
While propaganda and drugs keep
the society happy,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.490
it's clear some crucial 
human element is lost.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.020
But the best known dystopias
were not imaginary at all.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.101
As Europe suffered unprecedented
industrial warfare,

00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:57.673
new political movements took power.

00:02:57.673 --> 00:03:01.100
Some promised to erase 
all social distinctions,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.331
while others sought to unite people
around a mythical heritage.

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.621
The results were real-world dystopias

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:11.572
where life passed under the watchful eye
of the State

00:03:11.572 --> 00:03:16.902
and death came with ruthless efficiency
to any who didn't belong.

00:03:16.902 --> 00:03:19.812
Many writers of the time didn't
just observe these horrors,

00:03:19.812 --> 00:03:22.231
but lived through them.

00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:26.782
In his novel "We", Soviet writer
Yevgeny Zamyatin described a future

00:03:26.782 --> 00:03:30.652
where free will and individuality
were eliminated.

00:03:30.652 --> 00:03:34.832
Banned in the U.S.S.R., the book inspired
authors like George Orwell

00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:39.533
who fought on the front lines
against both fascism and communism.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:43.362
While his novel "Animal Farm" directly
mocked the Soviet regime,

00:03:43.362 --> 00:03:50.442
the classic "1984" was a broader critique
of totalitarianism, media, and language.

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:54.013
And in the U.S.A., Sinclair Lewis's
"It Can't Happen Here"

00:03:54.013 --> 00:03:59.412
envisioned how easily democracy
gave way to fascism.

00:03:59.412 --> 00:04:01.293
In the decades after World War II,

00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:03.214
writers wondered what new technologies

00:04:03.214 --> 00:04:06.963
like atomic energy, 
artificial intelligence, and space travel

00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:09.553
meant for humanity's future.

00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:12.422
Contrasting with popular visions
of shining progress,

00:04:12.422 --> 00:04:18.044
dystopian science fiction expanded
to films, comics, and games.

00:04:18.044 --> 00:04:21.403
Robots turned against their creators

00:04:21.403 --> 00:04:25.494
while TV screens broadcast
deadly mass entertainment.

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:30.153
Workers toiled in space colonies
above an Earth of depleted resources

00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:34.003
and overpopulated, crime-plagued cities.

00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:36.644
Yet politics was never far away.

00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:42.064
Works like "Dr. Strangelove" and "Watchmen"
explored the real threat of nuclear war,

00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:44.645
while "V for Vendetta"
and "The Handmaid's Tale"

00:04:44.645 --> 00:04:49.634
warned how easily our rights could
disappear in a crisis.

00:04:49.634 --> 00:04:53.294
And today's dystopian fiction continues
to reflect modern anxieties

00:04:53.294 --> 00:04:54.644
about inequality,

00:04:54.644 --> 00:04:55.634
climate change,

00:04:55.634 --> 00:04:56.705
government power,

00:04:56.705 --> 00:04:58.914
and global epidemics.

00:04:58.914 --> 00:05:01.565
So why bother with all this pessimism?

00:05:01.565 --> 00:05:04.984
Because at their heart, dystopias
are cautionary tales,

00:05:04.984 --> 00:05:08.095
not about some particular government
or technology,

00:05:08.095 --> 00:05:14.344
but the very idea that humanity can be
molded into an ideal shape.

00:05:14.344 --> 00:05:17.665
Think back to the perfect world
you imagined.

00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:20.936
Did you also imagine what it would
take to achieve?

00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:24.355
How would you make people cooperate?

00:05:24.355 --> 00:05:28.065
And how would you make sure it lasted?

00:05:28.065 --> 00:05:30.055
Now take another look.

00:05:30.055 --> 00:05:32.507
Does that world still seem perfect?
