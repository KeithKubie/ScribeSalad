ROBERT REID: Welcome to
the world of travel.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.590
My name is Robert Reid.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.880
I'm the US travel editor
for Lonely Planet.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.170
Kind of feel a little bit of
a thrill being at Google,

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.090
because I do use Google.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.270
I'm not one of the Bing crowd
or anything like that.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.710
So it's kind of exciting
just being in the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.960
offices, to be honest.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.970
I guess I'm here because when
I was a little kid I had the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.240
dream basically just to go all
over the world and live as

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.350
many places I possibly could.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.280
And I thought that meant
rock and roll.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.640
So I played guitar
for a while, but

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.600
that didn't work out.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.500
So somehow I ended up with
Lonely Planet 13 years ago.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.930
And I've done a couple dozen
guidebooks for Lonely Planet.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.530
I got to go to the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.820
Trans-Siberian Railway and Burma.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.670
I got to go to Columbia and
Mexico and Bulgaria and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.510
Transylvania, even Queens for
working on guidebooks and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.000
things like that.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.900
I've written a lot of articles
on travel both for Lonely

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.690
Planet's website, but also "New
York Times" and "Wall

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.620
Street Journal" and "Wanderlust"
magazine in the

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.220
UK and various newspapers
around the States.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.100
A few years ago, I switched
positions at Lonely Planet,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.990
and I became this thing--

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.070
US Travel Editor, which
thankfully involves no editing

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.780
whatsoever.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.790
So it's kind of a
strange title.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.000
What I do is I write things
for the website.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.370
And I make videos.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.770
They said go do something
viral.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.030
So I just started
making videos.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.290
They did not become viral.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.200
But I started making travel
videos to throw on YouTube and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.540
use throughout social media
and things like that.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.620
And I get to speak about
travel, which is

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.740
just kind of miserable.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.510
No, it's fun.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.910
It's really good.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.820
But despite all this, a lot of
people come up and they ask

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.140
how can you be a
travel writer.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.810
That's the dream job,
vacationing for work

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.390
and stuff like that.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.780
And it isn't exactly
like that.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.470
And the funny thing about it
is, as much as you do it,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.940
there's moments where you have
this kind of wide-eyed glory

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.780
still about travel, wherever
you go, and you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.610
see something new.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.520
And I still feel that, despite
having lived in London and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.030
Vietnam and Australia and
traveling to all these places,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.440
I still have that sense
on occasion, at least,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.539
of just like wow!

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.500
This is travel for the first
time, just like the Madonna

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.050
song says, I guess.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.010
And this year, just last month,
I went on a vacation--

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.760
oh, I was going to say with
that, I still make mistakes

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.600
all the time too.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.150
Along with my wide-eyed wonder
of travel, there's all these

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.710
mistakes that are being made.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.740
So despite being a travel
expert, there are still things

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.940
that you're learning as
you go and do this.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.860
And I realized that again last
month because I did a trip to

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.380
France, in the southwest of
France, Languedoc-Roussillon

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.980
which would be more popular if
it had fewer French syllables

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.280
in it and was something as
simple as Burgundy or

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.820
something like that.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.400
But this is a great region of
France between Provence and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.500
the Spanish border.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.250
It actually produces the
most wine in France.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.280
It's very mountainous.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.360
There's knights of
Templar castles.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.410
There is a nice coastline.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.040
And I went there because Robert
Louis Stevenson in

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.540
1878, went and traveled through
there with a donkey

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.260
and wrote about it.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.690
And it's one of the definitive
travel books, because he coins

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.730
the phrase "travel for
travel's sake."

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.800
And it isn't so much about
where you're going

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.200
but how you get there.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.580
And so I thought I'd retrace
some of Robert Louis

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.780
Stevenson's steps, without his
mustache and velvet jacket,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.720
and without the donkey,
importantly.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.860
So I went village to village
in Languedoc-Roussillon a

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.610
little bit, and I was following
Robert Louis

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.560
Stevenson's footsteps.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.480
And the last day, my
feet were tired.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.340
There was a huge
mountain ahead.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.240
And so I took a break and went
by car that day, around all

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.230
these little great 600-year-old

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.020
villages and things.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.520
And someone said, right as the
sun was about to go down,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.500
you've got to go up on
top of this mountain.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.290
You take this drive up here.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.750
There's a huge plateau, and
there's these big stone slabs

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.790
up there called [? miniars ?].

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.330
And they've been there
for 2,500 years.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.110
They're made of granite.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.400
No one knows why or who
put them there.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.540
But they were moved for miles,
because it's the kind of rock

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.310
that is isn't up there.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.150
You should go see it.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.710
You'll love it.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.340
I don't know why they
thought that of me.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.660
So I drove up there, going
quickly because the sun was

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.550
starting to dip.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.370
And suddenly, I found
myself in Texas.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.710
It was like this rolling field
of cow pastures, and just

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.850
beautiful sunlight and mountains
kind of cascading

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.400
towards the Mediterranean
in the distance.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.130
Views unlike I've ever
seen before, and I

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.850
was completely alone.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.750
And finally, I was driving--

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.310
I saw these little mounds
in this field.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.410
And I turned on the dirt road,
and rocks are bumping against

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.780
the bottom of my rental car.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.070
And I'm going as
fast as I can.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.750
And I get up to-- oh, I was
supposed to show this.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.260
This is what

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.110
Languedoc-Roussillon
looks like.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.940
Sorry.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.350
That's much more interesting
than the field of blue.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.090
I'm new to PowerPoint.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.310
This is like my second time.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.350
But so I get up to this place
where these are, and I see a

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.030
barbed wire fence.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.050
And it's like, oh.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.450
And here they are, these little
guys out here, like

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.550
what is that?

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.650
What are you supposed to do?

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.200
I don't like to encourage people
to break rules and

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.140
break laws when they travel,
but I'm sitting

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.920
here at this moment.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.640
I drove all this.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.350
I've been in France.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.570
I leave the next day.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.360
I kind of want to see what
those things are.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.120
Do I go out there?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.310
And so, well, you know,
yeah, you do.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.790
And so I went out there.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.490
And as soon as I got out and saw
these slabs, I looked up

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.180
and you see these kind of things
just in the middle of

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.830
this field.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.720
And this doesn't quite capture
how beautiful the light was.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.190
And then I look and I see a
whole bunch more over here

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.620
that I hadn't noticed.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.250
But these were cows.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.570
And the cows were coming.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.770
And they were coming fast.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.620
And I realized that I had never,
ever thought to prepare

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.230
myself for basically
very simple cow

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.520
attack preparation skills.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.160
I had no idea what to do.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.020
Do cows bite?

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.510
Will they ram into
your pelvis?

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.270
That one has horns.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.680
Do cows have horns in France?

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.820
Because they don't
here, do they?

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.030
I'm not around cows.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.760
I have no idea.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.460
I mean, do you play
dead with a cow?

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.630
One of them's bucking and
running, and like the back

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.475
legs are going up.

00:05:54.475 --> 00:05:58.490
I was honestly looking at that
and going oh my god, I really

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.330
kind of don't know what to do.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.510
And I was frozen.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.115
And I took picture, picture,
picture, picture, picture, as

00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:04.670
they got closer and closer.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.660
What do you do?

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.740
I ran.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.720
So I thought before I go too
much further, I would share

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.020
some little travel rules that
no one tells you that

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.540
sometimes you find through
mistakes on the road.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.920
And maybe it'll be of use.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.180
This is the kind of things that
I learned really from

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.600
writing Lonely Planet
guidebooks

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.770
and things like that.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.540
Some of them are more
silly than others.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.420
But the first thing
that I always

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.210
say is just ask questions.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.760
As a writer, you go and you're
just paid to be curious.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.260
And you're constantly
asking questions.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.660
You're asking for permission to
gain entry to this castle

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.360
that's been closed
for 11 years.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.380
Or to go up that tower and
see the view up there.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.760
And if you just ask questions,
you can get a lot done, just

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.240
asking questions.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.070
This right here is one of three
Abraham Lincoln hats.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.940
And I went to Springfield
recently, because I'm a bit of

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.360
a Lincoln nut, and
the movie's out.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.540
And I saw it last week on the
opening night at 12:01, and

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.740
didn't go to sleep, for an
appointment the next morning.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.720
It was crazy.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.640
This is one of three
of his hats.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.530
And it's in the Lincoln vault.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.090
It's not open to the public.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.270
But I asked.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.590
Said, yeah, I came all the
way from New York.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.450
I heard that in the vault,
there's one of the hats and

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.340
the Gettysburg Address.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.970
Can I see that?

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.390
And then I got a Lincolnologist
with

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.910
plastic gloves on.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:22.730
And he showed me this.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.910
And so a lot of times, things
like that happen.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.510
One of the things I've learned
is whenever you go to a small

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.290
museum, ask if the curator is
there, because they're usually

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.530
really quiet and flattered
for the attention.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.150
And I was at some
stupid dinosaur

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.010
museum in North Dakota.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.290
Just a bunch of fossils and
stuff, and I didn't know what

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.790
to make of it.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.345
I'm not into fossils.

00:07:40.345 --> 00:07:41.520
I'm not into dinosaurs.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.010
But the curator had spent his
entire life collecting these

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.720
fossils on the plains
of North Dakota.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.510
And he walked me around, and
he had stories for how he'd

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.460
collected these fossils.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.930
And it made me appreciate
fossils more and gave me just

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.160
a new appreciation of
how to access it.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.730
So if you just ask, people
will let you do things.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.230
I really mean it.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.380
Similar to that is making
your own attractions.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.230
I always feel that museums
are great.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.000
But they're a little bit
overrated, as a day filler

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.540
attraction.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.420
Sometimes there are things that
we do on the road, but we

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.630
don't do at home.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.570
And so sometimes we go to
places, oh, I need to

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.330
see this Greek art.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.340
I need to see this
Monet, et cetera.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.290
And you sometimes miss kind of
how the town lives, the local

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.080
scene, et cetera.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.653
And I'm not saying museums
are bad, if

00:08:22.653 --> 00:08:24.360
you're a museum person.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.780
Or if you own a museum,
I apologize.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.640
I like museums.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.300
But I think that sometimes
we go to them too much.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.980
But sometimes you can
make your own

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.150
attractions on the road.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.510
And one example is I
actually researched

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.700
Kansas for Lonely Planet.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.520
And you see all these grain
elevators that are spaced out

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.809
apart, and they become like the
skyscraper of the plains.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.240
And they mark each
town and stuff.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.420
And I was just going you know,
I see these things.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.040
They're not particularly
attractive.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.380
What's in them?

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.370
You just go up and ask, and like
the dinosaur guy, people

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.540
are very often very interested
to show off

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.280
parts of their life.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.980
And I got this tour with Glenn
in this tiny little elevator

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.150
fit for one person--

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.800
someone smaller than
Glenn probably.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.920
And I'm crammed with Glenn
and he's in a jumpsuit.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.150
And I go and get a whole tour
of the grain elevator.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.320
And it made me appreciate--

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.250
every time you see those grain
elevators, I know what it

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.550
looks like on the inside.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.890
This is the Montreal
Bagel Festival.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.780
And last year I went to
Montreal, and it's a city that

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.830
has festivals every
45 minutes.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.690
There's another festival.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.650
No place parties harder
than Montreal.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.660
And I decided Montreal Bagel--

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.640
I don't know if you know,
and I hate to say this.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.420
I'm going to go ahead and say
it-- is better than the New

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.080
York bagel.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.550
It is better.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.270
The hole is bigger, and it's a
little sweeter because it's

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.190
made with honey water.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.220
But they use wood burning ovens
like the old style.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.140
It's much more traditionally
made.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.510
You don't have to have
cream cheese.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.140
I don't know how you could put
lox on something like that.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.890
But it's really good.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.650
If you go to Montreal, you
have to go for the bagel.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.635
But I decided just to make a
box, and go around and make a

00:09:52.635 --> 00:09:54.720
bagel festival and
give bagels away.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.970
And I ended up having some
of the most hilarious

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.530
conversations by doing that.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.310
And people we're just assuming I
was local, because it was so

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.260
much how people do things
in Montreal.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.590
So I think that sometimes--

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.580
well, you don't have to create
your own museum or whatever

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.250
this is-- but sometimes there's
ways of just using

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.200
your eyes and creating
things as you go.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.240
One of the other things is
you should always say

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.400
yes whenever possible.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.630
Lot of people have strict
itineraries of what they're

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.780
going to do in a day.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.090
And then they get offered--

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:29.150
these twins with eye patches and
their mom are going to a

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.850
soccer game and then afterwards
are going to their

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.640
great aunt's to have
a big lamb feast.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.010
But you were planning on going
to X monument or Y museum or Z

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.430
organized walking tour.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.630
Go with them.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.110
You're not going to have
that chance again.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.340
Say yes, whenever you can.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.690
I mean, if it's something
scary, don't say yes.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.132
And don't say yes to
this, like I did.

00:10:49.132 --> 00:10:51.530
I was interested in Mounties.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.560
I can see some of
you are probably

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.610
Mountie fans yourself.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.640
And I just asked if
I could tour the

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.880
Mountie boot camp place.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.070
Like in Saskatchewan,
all Mounties are

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.790
trained to become Mounties.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.690
And they offered me a two-day
boot camp pass, so I could

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.030
train with the Mounties
for two days.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.310
And I got a very regrettable
haircut.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.790
I got a regulation
Mountie mustache.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.190
And I went through two days, and
I'm being hog-tied here.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.900
This was a lesson
on how to arrest

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.025
people if they are resisting.

00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:28.280
And I really don't recommend
doing this.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.840
But I'm glad I said yes to this,
but I've never saying

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.700
yes to that again.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.120
Try to always say yes.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.860
Akin to all this stuff,
locals were great.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.430
People like to get local.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.380
It's kind of the buzz in
travel these days.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.080
You stay in neighborhoods
and go to the places--

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.680
the farmers' markets that they
what would shop as well.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.150
And you figure out ways to save
money and see a town and

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.030
almost pretend like you're
kind of a local by proxy.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.630
I think the most underrated way
to see locals is sports.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:03.440
I think people forget about how
easy it is to go into a

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.840
minor league hockey game
in Quebec and sit.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.380
And everyone is voicing, and
there it's a social gathering.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.410
And even if you don't know
anything about hockey, people

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:14.690
will teach you.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.800
I've had very interesting
experiences bonding with

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.750
people through sports.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:27.000
And last year, I was in
Edmonton, Alberta in Canada,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.216
and I got the opportunity to--

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:34.180
I asked if I could go to a
12-year-old hockey league's

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.930
practice and play with them.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.790
I've never played hockey
before at all.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.020
I don't know how to skate.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:39.680
And they let me do it.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.840
It was actually one of my most
thrilling travel experiences

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.400
I've ever had.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.720
So that goes back into asking
for permission and stuff.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.880
But sports--

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.790
I think it's an underrated
way to see things.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.506
But now, similar to
locals are great--

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:55.010
whoops, I pressed the
wrong button.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.440
Locals are great, but also
locals are overrated.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.080
Same guy.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.530
No offense to him.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.240
He's really nice.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.270
If he's here-- no,
he's not here.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.640
But what I mean by that is
sometimes an outside

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.270
perspective of a place is
what you're looking

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.410
for more than locals.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.640
Sometimes locals will suggest
you go and eat at Applebee's.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.570
Sometimes locals haven't left,
and they don't have a

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.180
perspective of how you
see the place.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:26.680
So you can't only try to talk
to locals and find out

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.700
recommendations, because
sometimes they have a very

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.130
routine way of doing things.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.770
What I always like to say
is footfall and eyeball.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.650
The number one goal in travel
is just to trust walking

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.000
around and looking
yourself, because

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.390
ultimately it's your trip.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:45.110
So I'm just kind of joking
about this, but you can't

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.260
completely be a slave
to everything the

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.810
locals say, I guess.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.150
Socks and sandals are OK--
whoever said socks and sandals

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.200
aren't OK, they're wrong.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.340
They haven't gone to a place
that have rats on the ground.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:54.720
Seriously.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.330
I don't want rats on my feet.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.800
So I think it's OK.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.660
If you take nothing else from
the discussion, I think it's

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.300
you don't have to wear
socks with sandals.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.150
I think it's OK.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.250
I think it's over-criticized.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.080
Seven-- travel's the
fountain of youth.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.830
And what I mean by this
is that you'll live

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.470
longer if you travel.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.445
The reason why I say this is
sometimes when you travel, and

00:14:14.445 --> 00:14:16.840
you have a good experience,
it feels really long.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.250
Like it isn't a bad trip, but
you go for a week, and it

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.160
feels like-- you go to study
Spanish in Guatemala, and

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.470
you're living with a family,
and there's volcanoes, and

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.620
people speaking a Mayan language
and things like this.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.350
And it's very different and
crazy, and one week feels like

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.350
three weeks of your life.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.810
And there's scientific
back-up to that.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.650
There's a neuroscience guy
named David Eagleman.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.600
He was profiled in the
"New Yorker" maybe

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.690
about a year ago.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.480
And he monitors how people have
near death experiences.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.710
And they say that the life
flashes before their eyes, and

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.820
things feel slowed down.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.580
And there is scientific truth
to that apparently, because

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.280
you're going through that
process of real danger,

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.240
something new and shocking to
you, and it slows down how we

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.140
perceive things.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.310
It makes us revert a little bit
more to like when we're

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.300
kids and when time seemed to go
slower, particularly Monday

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.330
to Friday during the school
week, and then the

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.630
weekends fly by.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.660
So travel can do that,
if you go to more

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.940
exotic places, he says.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.460
We've got a neuroscientist
saying that

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.300
you should be traveling.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.690
And not only traveling
in general, but

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.190
traveling to new places.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.620
I find a lot of people always go
to the Outer Banks and stay

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.380
at the same beach and
things like that.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.120
That's great.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.100
But if you go to places
that are--

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.240
at least once every three trips,
go to a place that's

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.395
new and a little more exotic,
you'll live longer.

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:33.190
That's how I like to think,
so a little bit maybe.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:33.540
Eight.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.480
The one thing the travelers do a
lot, and it really changes a

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.630
trip, is researching.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.010
And I think that any trip you
do, you should make it a rule

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.390
to read a book and see
a movie about it.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.290
Just as simple as that.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.260
A history book, a travelogue,
a novel that's

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.510
based on that place.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.460
It's exciting, the pre-research,
it can get you

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.420
thinking about the place.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.550
And you go and you'll recognize
a statue or a name

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.220
of a person.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.100
Hey, there's the street that
that guy got killed or

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.050
whatever it may be.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.360
Research beforehand is a thing
that travel writers do.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.470
And it just gives you your own
story line once you're there.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.600
This is a picture of
a Monopoly board.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.630
I had to go and do something
in Atlantic City.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.715
And Monopoly, all those place
names on the Monopoly board

00:16:14.715 --> 00:16:16.000
are based on Atlantic City.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.330
And it was created by someone
from Philadelphia, but they

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.410
based it on Atlantic City.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.490
And so I just went simply to
all of the places on the

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.750
Monopoly board around Atlantic
City, some of them were not

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.620
recommended to go to,
perfectly honest.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.970
But some of them were
interesting.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.860
This is outside a lighthouse
on Vermont Avenue--

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.490
not one of the higher-paying
properties.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.420
But that's all right.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:40.360
But these guys were from Indiana
and they had no idea

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.780
that they were on the corner
of Vermont and Connecticut,

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.170
just like the Monopoly board.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.910
I don't know.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.310
Atlantic City should do more
promoting that, I think.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.160
Another one that I liked a
lot, here in New York.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.660
It's one of my favorite things
that I've been able to do is I

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.110
was studying about
Presidents Day.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.790
And I was going to write
something about Presidents Day

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.480
for the Lonely Planet website.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.030
And I was researching presidents
and I realized only

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.480
two presidents ever became
president in New York City.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.160
George Washington
and everyone's

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.869
favorite, Chester A. Arthur.

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:12.579
He's the guy with
the big chops.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:14.540
And he became president because
James Garfield was

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.339
shot and killed for no
apparent reason.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:20.605
And anyway, he was living
at Kalustyan.

00:17:20.605 --> 00:17:23.780
It's an Indian spice shop,
23rd and Lexington.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.800
I don't know if you've
ever seen this.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.295
It's called Kalustyan.

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:29.470
It's a kind of spice shop, all
kind of different Asia and

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.510
kind of Eastern European spices
and the Middle Eastern

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.090
spices and things like that.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.260
That was his house!

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.870
And you can go to his house
and to his former bedroom

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.950
where he became President
and order a sandwich.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.040
And I just love that you could
get a Chester Arthur sandwich.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.560
I mean, I would like the
sandwich anyway, but because I

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:49.450
found out that it was Chester
Arthur's room, I was happy.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:50.830
People talk about
bucket lists.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.760
I think a rule is that everyone
should put traveling

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.190
alone on their bucket list
and do it at least once.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.710
I travel alone so much.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.140
But traveling alone is
interesting because one, you

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.140
can do whatever you want.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.360
You don't have to pacify Uncle
Todd and Uncle Todd's needs.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.660
You can just go and do
whatever you want.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.160
You will be more patient,
at least I am.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:09.740
A lot of people are.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.640
Much more patient.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.830
You complain less.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.620
You meet people more when
you're by yourself.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.000
If you're in a noodle shop in
Beijing, and the people next

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.070
to you see you by yourself
then they might be more

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.420
inclined to talk to you than
if you're with some other

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.720
people talking about
football scores.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.570
But it's also very
empowering to be

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.020
able to do it by yourself.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.020
And I think--

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.630
not that anyone would ever want
to leave Google but I

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.920
think it's something you should
put in job description

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.420
and put into--

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.030
not job description-- but on
resume or talking interviews

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:39.610
and things like that.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.860
Just that notion of that kind
of travel shows a lot of

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.620
strength in self, and confidence
in self to

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.200
be able to do it.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.640
Everyone travel by yourself.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.570
You might see that guy.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.240
I don't know.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:50.940
Here's one.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.650
Very important.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:52.220
Almost finished--

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:52.970
13 of these.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.470
10, wash your hands
before you sleep.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.870
The reason is because if you
have some Snickers on your

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.690
fingers, rats can come
and lick it off your

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:02.600
fingers when you sleep.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.370
I know, I know.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.830
OK?

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.592
Wash your hands before
you sleep?

00:19:07.592 --> 00:19:11.030
You know that ice hotel thing
that people talk about?

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.420
Don't do it.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.250
12, travel is not a contest.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.080
I mean a lot of people will
debate "real travel," that

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.170
cruises don't matter, that Las
Vegas or Orlando is silly.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.450
No, it's whatever
you want to do.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.010
There's no right and
wrong in travel.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.610
It's supposed to be fun.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.380
I made this shirt because I
was going to some travel

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.110
thing, and we're getting
worked up

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.720
about a lot of stuff.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.880
You have to remember that it
is supposed to have fun and

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.360
each person has their own
definition of it.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.410
There was an essay in "The New
York Times" not too long ago

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.100
by someone from Amherst that
wrote about "real travel." And

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.440
he lamented that it used to
be that people would go on

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.000
pilgrimages, and they would
travel for great quests and

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.990
things like that-- sometimes to
kill people or find trade

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.060
routes and stuff like that.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.200
He didn't put in his essay.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.590
I was invited to talk with
him on the radio on

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.170
some show on NPR.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.600
And people called in to share
their travel stories.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.570
And all these people had these
amazing stories about

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.390
traveling overland all the way
to South America, going on a

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.520
boat from Panama to Columbia
and skipping the Darien Gap

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.210
and taking buses and traveling
for months and months.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.420
I would love to do that.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.490
That's great.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.260
But the guy that I liked the
most that called in was a guy

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.080
that was in Nashville.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.290
He didn't have much money.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.140
He didn't have many means
to travel far.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.310
And so he went fishing.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.660
And he said I had never
fished before.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.480
I didn't know how to take a fish
off a hook or anything.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.540
And he talked about that.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.980
And I really liked that, because
he was challenging

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.090
himself by something that was
easy and accessible but

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.350
different nearby.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.880
So I thought if anyone got a
ribbon that day, it was him.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.920
So in other words, travel's
not a contest.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.135
There's no right or
wrong as long as

00:20:40.135 --> 00:20:41.550
you're not hurting someone.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.160
The 13th and most
important rule--

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.380
run from cows.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:46.930
That's the cow.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.030
I took a lot of shots.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.940
And this is not a zoom.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.930
And I turned and ran and I did
make it outside the barbed

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:54.380
wire fence.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.870
It's about 100 yards.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.760
I mean they were like kind of
going around me like this.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.370
And I think they were
running with me.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.480
I don't know.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.770
They looked nice.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.730
But those are some
of my travels.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.710
But I thought that I would talk,
because we have these

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.940
little Best In Travel books
that I worked on.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:13.810
For 2013--

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.950
every year, Lonely Planet
covers every

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.980
country in the world.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.310
And so we come up with these
lists of things.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.920
And based on this book, there
are some places that I am very

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.070
interested in.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:27.900
And I just thought I would just
mention five places I'm

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.280
very interested in 2013 and
thought that you might be

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.280
interested in it as well.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.180
Next year, if you're
thinking of going--

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.800
or in the future, you ever want
to go to Rio, go quick.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.300
OK?

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.050
Go to Rio now.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.060
That's the number one best
value destination for us.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:41.920
Not that it's cheap.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.720
There are cheaper places
in the world.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.110
But they have the World
Cup in 2014.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.450
And they have the Olympics
in 2016.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.180
Demand, development
is going up.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.280
Now it's going to be better.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.210
If you don't go during Carnival,
the prices will be a

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.130
little lower.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.460
But it's only going to get
more and more expensive.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.780
At the same time, I don't know
if you've seen the movie "City

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.630
of God" about the favelas and
the shantytowns in Rio.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.900
But things have changed in
the last five years.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.550
They're policing some
of these more.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.040
And a lot of tourists, for
better or worse, are going

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.710
into a lot of these shantytowns
and things.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.550
And there's some very
interesting places to stay in

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:17.250
shantytowns now that have jazz
concerts and they have--

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.870
because they're up on the
mountainsides, they have like

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.190
some of the best view of Rio.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.930
And it used to be about
$40 and stuff.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.590
So I think that if you're
thinking about Rio in general,

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.090
maybe next year is the
year or this winter.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.720
Our number one country for the
year is a place I haven't

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.060
been, and is a place that you
probably wouldn't have gone

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.970
till pretty recently.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.460
And that is Sri Lanka.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.920
Sri Lanka is a country that
was hit by the tsunami.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.130
And it just got past its Civil
War a few years ago.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.000
But tourism is picking up.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.380
And we are convinced that within
four or five years,

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.490
you're going to see it
on the front of every

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.100
glossy travel magazine.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.300
Go before that happens.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.950
The price will be a little
lower, and before there's too

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:56.520
many crowds.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.690
It's rimmed by just stunning
beaches, great wildlife.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.970
There's a national park where
you go and there is an

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.070
elephant gathering.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.040
And 150 elephants come
in to bathe.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.040
And you just see so many
elephants just naturally

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.990
coming there to bathe and
things like that.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.860
There's cooking courses.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.790
There are curries that they have
there, and you can take

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.020
these curry cooking courses.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.220
But some of the beaches on the
east side and the south side

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:16.630
of the coast.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.990
It's a pretty squat little
island country south of India.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.670
That is a place that's going to
rise, if you happen to be

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:23.570
in the area.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:24.940
Everyone's looking
for a new Asia.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.630
For Europe, our top country
is Montenegro.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.670
I've not been to Montenegro.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.910
If you've seen "Casino Royale,"
that James Bond

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.800
movie, that was supposed
to be in Montenegro.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.400
It was actually shot in
the Czech Republic.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.030
But it's a place that's about
the size of Connecticut.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.810
It's on the Adriatic Sea, and
it has some coastline.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:42.330
It's very nice.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.130
But it's better known
for its mountains.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.826
The name itself, Montenegro is
a black mountain, I guess.

00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:47.560
Right?

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.350
It must be.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:53.150
But it has about 150 peaks in
this area of Connecticut and

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:54.310
Europe's deepest gorge.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.910
And they have these rafting
trips that go through there,

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.170
just towering between
the mountains.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.030
And the water's so clean,
you can drink it.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.070
Montenegro and also two
countries up, other side of

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:05.150
Croatia, just east of
Italy, Slovenia is

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.300
another one that's rising.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.930
It's relatively inexpensive.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.130
You have Gothic Venetian style
towns for about half the

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.220
price, about three hours from
Venice on the train.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.290
So those two countries--
everyone's looking for new

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.890
Europe and where
crowds aren't.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.060
There are crowds, but
fewer than you

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.310
have in Western Europe.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.940
Oh, I need to talk about
Gangham style.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.370
I mean I'm not the last person
to see this thing.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.510
I was, actually during the
election, I was getting a

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.100
little bored of the
results and stuff.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.040
And I went and said OK, I'm
going to watch the video.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.810
And so I watched the Gangham
style video.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:39.570
I saw Psy on the "Today Show" or
something, which I thought

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.500
was the greatest performance
I'd ever seen.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.490
But South Korea is one of our
top countries a year.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:45.320
Gangham--

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.730
if I'm saying it correctly-- is
a neighborhood south of the

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.020
Han River in Seoul.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.970
It is both really modern
and very traditional.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:53.900
And it has a lot
of nightclubs.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.540
It's a little bit upscale.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.090
Our favorite hotel
in Korea's there.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.590
It's a new Park Hyatt that's
very Zen minimalist.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.810
It just has a concrete
wall with a rock

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.130
sticking out of it.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.825
But you have the eighth century
temples next to malls.

00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:09.770
And you can go to the temple
and learn how to have

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.870
meditation or they have tea
ceremonies and things.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.320
And then you can go to the
mall right afterwards.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.610
But Korea is on the list, not
for that, but for-- it's a

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:22.190
really rising outside
destination, activity

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.445
destination.

00:25:22.445 --> 00:25:24.920
You can take bike trips along
the DMZ once a month--

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.080
I would love to do that--

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.410
in between land mines and barbed
wire, just like mom

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.320
always wanted to do.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.410
Big golfing destination,
over 100 golf courses.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:35.530
But there's a tropical island
to the South called Jeju,

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.430
which is where a lot
of honeymooners go.

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.610
I think I'm pronouncing
it correctly--

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:44.750
J-E-J-U. It is rimmed by white
sand beaches and backed by

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.140
kind of black lava cliffs.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.780
And there's a very naughty
theme park there called

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.840
Loveland, because all
the honeymooners go.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.010
And there's very suggestive
statues to inspire honeymoons

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:55.930
apparently.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.000
Kids are not allowed.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.260
But anyway, that's kind
of a unique place.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.460
And then the last thing I'm
going to mention is our top

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.540
country in the Americas.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.690
I just got back.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.820
During Sandy, I was there.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.020
And I was stuck there for
several days, because I

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.530
couldn't fly back, and
that's Ecuador.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.580
People are looking
at South America.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.310
We talked about Rio before.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.980
Ecuador is a place that's always
kind of hovering, And

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:18.960
it kind of comes and goes.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.840
This is where the Galapagos
Islands, that wildlife just

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.020
kind of haven, offshore
as part of Ecuador.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.670
But people are staying
in Ecuador.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.520
It's like doubled its tourism
in the last 10 years.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.450
Quito, the capital, I went to,
is in the heart of the Avenue

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:34.975
of Volcanoes.

00:26:34.975 --> 00:26:37.670
There's like 27 volcanoes
around, so you're likely going

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.790
to be killed while
you're there.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.550
Because the volcanoes--
no, I'm just joking.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.990
But the main reason I think that
Ecuador is going to be

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.755
big is because of chocolate.

00:26:44.755 --> 00:26:46.360
It's number one in chocolate.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.650
And they're starting these
chocolate tours.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:48.690
And you go to these
chocolate farms.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:49.840
And the chocolate
is really good.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.050
I honestly had no idea how
much chocolate was there,

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.030
until I went.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.140
and it's very inexpensive.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.110
So I think that Ecuador is
going to-- as people are

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.290
looking for something beyond
Machu Piccu, for example, in

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:05.180
Peru or going further than
Mexico perhaps, Ecuador is

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.430
certainly rising.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.210
Those were five things.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.450
That's really endless.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.690
Oh, that's the book.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:15.540
And here's the cow.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.340
See I got out.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.720
This is the barbed wire fence,
so I did make it out.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.600
And that's the cow there.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.920
So I ran, and I was laughing
while I was running actually,

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.050
because I thought that if I get
killed or smeared or kneed

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:33.480
or head-butted, I guess that's
really the way to do it, just

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.300
be in a French field and just
killed by French cows would

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.370
be-- it's kind of my
dream, you know?

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.180
No, I made it.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:40.560
OK.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.800
I think that the
rule is to run.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.760
I'm not sure.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.740
But that's what I have.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.540
If you have questions-- if you
have trips that you're doing

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:52.070
or any questions about travel
at all, I'll take it all.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.890
If I don't know the answer,
I'll email you later.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:54.842
Any?

00:27:54.842 --> 00:27:55.318
Yeah.

00:27:55.318 --> 00:27:59.364
AUDIENCE: What's the most
bizarre, unique place you've

00:27:59.364 --> 00:28:00.614
ever been to?

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.410
ROBERT REID: I'm going to
give two quick answers.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.780
One is Yakutsk, Russia.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:07.660
I did the Trans-Siberian.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.890
This was very far up.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.410
It's like about way above
the train lines.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:12.450
And it's a city on permafrost.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.730
So all the buildings
were on stilts.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.570
And it's the coldest city-- over
200,000 people-- in the

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.280
world, but I was there in the
summer and got heatstroke.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.040
Because it's so hot in summer,
people don't realize how hot

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.630
Russia can be.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.570
And then Burma, I covered the
Burma guide, me and Mark, for

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:28.170
Lonely Planet.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.940
And I don't know where to begin
talking about how unique

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.070
and wonderful that place and
the people are fantastic.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.900
Just the snake pagoda
that's like--

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.390
of course, there's snakes there
and you go up and then

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.370
there's this burping little
volcano, butane gas that just

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.230
happens to be there.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.900
And they guard it with snakes
and Buddhas with huge

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:48.580
spectacles.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.410
If you're having problems with
your eyesight, you're supposed

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:50.830
to go there.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.200
It's just endless the things
that happen in Burma that's

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.690
just like--

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.400
I saw a guy killing an owl. with
a stick, because it made

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.840
his mom sick.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.020
And after a while, you
just believe that.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.150
There's a lot of different
beliefs that go pre-Buddhism.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.400
And it's just a country
of just total wonder.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.710
I felt sorry for the
owl, though.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:11.350
But his mom was OK.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.320
I checked the next day.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.290
She wasn't sick.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:14.090
Yes?

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.920
AUDIENCE: You ever had qualms
about finding some really

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.710
awesome local thing and not
wanting to write on it?

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:20.960
ROBERT REID: Yeah,
I understand.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:25.970
I think it depends on what
the destination is and

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.100
what's around it.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.430
It's like you talk about
the tsunami in

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.020
Sri Lanka and stuff.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.690
On one level, when is
it too soon to go?

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.450
And do you want to
talk up a place?

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:39.280
The "New York Times" talked up
Sri Lanka right after the

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.990
civil war there ended.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.235
And it was too early,
and there was

00:29:42.235 --> 00:29:44.200
some negative backlash.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.380
So that's one angle of it.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.850
Another is just this kind of
oasis, like the movie "The

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.700
Beach" or something that you
don't want to talk about.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.070
It's outside the guidebooks
and all that.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:55.640
I think that there are cases in
the case of Lonely Planet

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.780
where Lonely Planet dominates
the market.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.480
Thailand, overwhelmingly.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.640
So there's a Thai beach
that no one's been to.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.750
What do you do with that?

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.825
What do you do?

00:30:05.825 --> 00:30:11.490
I think that if it's ready for
people and people are going,

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.100
you're going to include it.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.460
But you don't have to make it
the number one highlight in

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.930
the country and make
it very big.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.395
Sometimes it's just the
power of inclusion.

00:30:19.395 --> 00:30:22.390
And close readers can get
rewarded by going

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.210
to find this place.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:27.030
And the clue comes just with
a couple key words or

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.060
something like that.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.110
But it's hard to say.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.700
If it's a place that has no
infrastructure, nothing,

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.860
whatsoever, then it could be a
little bit different, because

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.560
you don't want to flood
it too much.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.870
Part of it is just how
you mention it.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:45.170
And also in that area, there are
some deserted beaches, 20

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.838
to 30 more miles north
of town if you

00:30:46.838 --> 00:30:47.750
have your own transport.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:48.950
Some people go and
look for that.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:49.970
You might say something
like that.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:51.820
Most people will miss that.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.630
But those who don't,
might have the

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.540
experience of their trip.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.420
So I hope that answers
your question.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.840
It's something that you
debate all the time.

00:31:01.845 --> 00:31:03.690
Any other questions?

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.690
Yes.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.950
Oh, I forgot to repeat
the question.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:07.910
Sorry, go ahead.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.340
AUDIENCE: You were going through
the list of the tips,

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:14.228
the traveling tips, there was
one that I think goes between

00:31:14.228 --> 00:31:17.030
[INAUDIBLE] same years
and locals.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.280
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:20.810
ROBERT REID: What was it?

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.915
AUDIENCE: Resist the
urge to be lazy.

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:27.359
I was in Kenya recently, and we
wanted to go to the center

00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:31.004
of town, and at the hotel
they told us that you

00:31:31.004 --> 00:31:32.177
should take a taxi.

00:31:32.177 --> 00:31:33.584
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:33.584 --> 00:31:37.336
Go on ahead, take a taxi, and we
decided to take a local bus

00:31:37.336 --> 00:31:40.068
and instead of like five minutes
for $0.50 we spent

00:31:40.068 --> 00:31:42.864
half an hour because we spent
it chatting with locals.

00:31:42.864 --> 00:31:45.300
The music was blasting, and
[INAUDIBLE] the city around.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.290
And that's one of the things
that usually when I talk to

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:51.402
people over their travels,
they tend to do that.

00:31:51.402 --> 00:31:54.804
Just like take a local taxi or
something that they feel is

00:31:54.804 --> 00:31:57.720
protected and they don't need
anybody and they just go and

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.670
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:03.240
ROBERT REID: I think the idea
of using local transport or

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.400
something like that
can be great fun.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.130
I find it fascinating, just to
see how people commute, just

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.700
looking what ads
are in the bus.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.350
How sticky are the bus floors?

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.680
What's the ticket look like?

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.460
What's the fine I'm paying for
not getting the ticket right?

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:20.120
I mean I think it's a very
good-- and this goes back to--

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.945
I was kind of joking when I
said locals are overrated.

00:32:21.945 --> 00:32:24.510
But sometimes locals will
tell you not to do that.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:24.740
Right?

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.310
They'll think that because you
don't know the language

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.740
completely, you're a visitor,
that you shouldn't do that.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.950
You might get lost
or something.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.660
Well, that's OK to get lost.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.150
And so that's why sometimes
you have to trust

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:36.800
your own kind of--

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.560
I love the notion of just giving
up a little bit of time

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.060
to see what happens.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.540
If you're driving four hours,
don't do it in four hours.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.740
Give yourself 12.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.930
See what happens.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.452
And I think it goes in
the lines of what

00:32:48.452 --> 00:32:49.330
you're talking about.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:50.330
Not everyone wants to do that.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.260
And that's OK.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.520
But I think that more people
would appreciate it than they

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.270
realize, perhaps.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:55.730
Yes?

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:59.166
AUDIENCE: What have been some
of your best sources of trip

00:32:59.166 --> 00:33:02.640
inspiration other than
Lonely Planet?

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.440
ROBERT REID: Well, there's
a lot of answers.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.430
I mean, I look at different
things.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.910
I look at books and history.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.580
I'm very interested in going and
retracing things that have

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.790
happened in the past.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.320
It depends on the place.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:21.860
It could be a campy 1970s
movie or a rock song.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:25.380
One time I used Billy Joel's
lyrics, and I looked at all of

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:25.930
his lyrics.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:27.990
And the lyrics that he talked
about Long Island--

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:30.200
because he's from kind
of Long Island.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.170
And then I just used that
as a guidebook and went.

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.070
It's kind of like that
Monopoly example.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.560
I wouldn't recommend
anyone doing that.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.740
It's not particularly
exciting.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.330
But I had a lot of fun because I
researched it and then I saw

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:42.930
it for real.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.740
I went to Billy Joel's
high school!

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.560
I met his former neighbor who
got beat up the night before,

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.710
apparently, because he
had a black eye.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:52.870
And I saw the village green he
sings about, and the Italian

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:53.800
restaurant that--

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.020
"Scenes from an Italian
Restaurant." I saw this stuff.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:57.970
And then, I'm not a huge Billy
Joel fan necessarily, but

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.120
won't listen to the music
the same way again.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.610
So it's eyeball, footfall.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:06.600
I'm always kind of looking and
thinking about oh, that.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.650
How do I connect that
into travel?

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:09.730
And I just find it--

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.219
I give myself a quest
on any trip.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:14.038
Yeah, I mean I do this for a
living, so I write about it

00:34:14.038 --> 00:34:14.830
and make videos.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.300
But I'd do that anyway.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.380
And I think that that's
being active.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.739
Pre-research is the best part.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:22.790
Pre-trip planning is the
most exciting part.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:26.960
And I think that's where it
comes, movies, rock songs,

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.260
Billy Joel lyrics,
Mountie hats.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:33.460
Any other questions?

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.010
Yes, in the back.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.619
Oh sorry.

00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:39.912
AUDIENCE: When you go someplace
new that's totally

00:34:39.912 --> 00:34:42.780
off the map, how do you
decide what to do

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.610
that's not already done?

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:50.965
ROBERT REID: Well, sometimes
it's OK to do something that's

00:34:50.965 --> 00:34:52.040
been done a million times.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.610
I mean, you go to Vietnam and
everyone goes to the Cu Chi

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:56.550
Tunnels and stuff.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:00.230
And they're not particularly
rewarding, but I did it.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:03.350
I've done it a couple
times actually.

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.470
It really varies.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.730
Am I writing about it?

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.255
Am I looking for something
new and different?

00:35:08.255 --> 00:35:10.390
Or am I just kind of a couple
days in Istanbul

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:11.145
and see what happens?

00:35:11.145 --> 00:35:12.650
I mean, I go to the
Blue Mosque,

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.110
and I go to the bazaar.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:18.060
And I pretty much play
it as normal.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.980
But I always try to give myself
time to just kind of do

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:25.250
something that I catch
on a whim.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:27.680
I don't know how to say
it other than that.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.740
I was in Quito, and I went on
this little weird kind of tour

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.310
around the old center.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.290
And we're going around for
four hours and looking at

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.820
colonial architecture and seeing
markets and stuff.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.370
And I went down this one little
street and I saw these

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:41.280
little babies.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.290
These little baby jars with
these kind of neon liquids.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:45.600
I was going wait a second,
what's that?

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.220
And they say, oh,
that's nothing.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.100
It's a [? Bebas. ?]

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.040
It's not important.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.770
And I was going no, well,
what is this?

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.630
And so I found out that
these were kind of

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:53.740
like a retro thing.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.480
It was like in the '70s,
all the kids used

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.360
to drink these things.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.060
And they had them as a joke.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.230
So I bought one, and had it.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.190
And I end up having about 10
conversations with people.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:03.735
They all went "Ah [? Bebas ?],
I haven't seen

00:36:03.735 --> 00:36:04.660
those for 30 years.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.360
How'd you get this?

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.770
And these old couples
come up and talk.

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:08.940
That's just because
I just noticed

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.430
something a little different.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:13.120
And I just went off it.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.975
And then I left the [? Beba ?]
in the hotel and

00:36:14.975 --> 00:36:15.610
they threw it away.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.730
They thought it was just
an empty bottle.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.920
I lost my [? Beba. ?]

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.110
I don't know.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.970
That's the best I could
do, probably.

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.503
I think you had a question
in the back?

00:36:25.503 --> 00:36:27.395
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah, what
kind of camera do you

00:36:27.395 --> 00:36:27.868
[? guys use ?]

00:36:27.868 --> 00:36:29.760
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.880
ROBERT REID: I over-document.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.780
Sometimes I'll use the iPhone
and tweet things.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.510
I do a lot of video, and I have
this kind of Sony, about

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.320
this shape.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.150
I forget the number.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.060
I think it starts with an
x and something else.

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.725
It's about an $800
video camera that

00:36:45.725 --> 00:36:47.110
has an external mic.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.870
I can use these mics
that we have here.

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.090
Because the audio is often more
important than the video

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.400
quality if you're going to
create videos, you have to

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.000
have good audio.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.410
And for a camera, I just have
a little kind of Panasonic

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:01.100
thing, with a Leica lens.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.575
I remember it was like
a $400 camera or

00:37:02.575 --> 00:37:03.420
something about this big.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.870
It doesn't have a zoom,
so that was--

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:07.480
I mean that cow, when he was
running, he was right there.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.310
I don't know what I was doing.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:09.205
What do you do?

00:37:09.205 --> 00:37:09.990
He's just running.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:11.240
You're going this is going
to be a good shot, good

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.870
shot, and you know.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:13.790
I don't know.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:14.510
Not too fancy.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.780
I don't like to go too far.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.280
I like the idea of
using things that

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.420
almost anyone could.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.500
I think it's important.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.320
I think there's another
question somewhere.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:23.790
Oh yes.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.766
AUDIENCE: How do you
know where to stay?

00:37:25.766 --> 00:37:29.720
How do you research just any
kind of accommodation?

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.180
ROBERT REID: Well.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.200
I always like to have a place
to stay the first night.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.390
If I'm doing a trip and I'm
roaming around a little bit, I

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:36.600
might not know where
I'm going to be the

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.320
third and fourth night.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.200
But I always like to know
the first night.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.780
And it depends.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.620
It depends on where it is.

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.440
To be honest, I get free
Lonely Planet books.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.150
So I look at what Lonely Planet
says and author's pick,

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:50.130
the right price, OK.

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:53.420
But I'll look online as well.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.500
I look at--

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.960
to be honest, I look at "New
York Times" articles.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.930
I look at websites with
hotel reviews.

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:01.240
And I'll look at multiple
sources, just as I do when I'm

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.440
booking an airplane ticket,
I'll compare.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:09.330
To be honest, I use Lonely
Planet to be honest, mostly.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.670
Any other questions?

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.295
Oh yes, hi.

00:38:15.295 --> 00:38:17.273
AUDIENCE: Do you find it hugely
beneficial if you learn

00:38:17.273 --> 00:38:20.860
some local phrases?

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:26.000
ROBERT REID: Yeah, that's a
really good question about

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.150
using local language
and learning a

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:29.390
few phrases and stuff.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:32.540
A lot of the times when I go
to places, even if I don't

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.560
have much time, I will try to
get a 1- or 2-hour lesson when

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:35.990
I get there.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.070
Because there might be a little
school that teaches

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:40.860
Romanian language and then you
go and take two hours.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.330
Because when you first show up
at a place, I'm often alone.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:44.960
You're like oh my gosh,
what am I doing?

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.570
It's crazy.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:46.720
I'm supposed to be
researching this.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.620
And you immediately
have an outlet.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.870
There's someone, a local,
who's being nice to you

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:53.380
because you're giving
them money to teach

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.270
you a little bit.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.450
And it kind of settles me
in to the new place.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:00.110
But at the same time, it gives
me enough that I could say

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:03.330
where is, how much is, how much,
what are the numbers,

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.100
and working on my own
pronunciation.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.610
Most trips I do learn a little
bit before I go.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.670
I don't know French, because
I cheated in high school in

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.680
French class.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.940
And so I took some French
lessons before I went.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.860
That was amazingly beneficial.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.910
It's amazing how much
even when you cheat,

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.180
some gets in there.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.480
I don't recommend cheating,
by the way.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.925
Yeah, but I think it's
always good to at

00:39:21.925 --> 00:39:22.520
least know a few things.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.440
It's respectful too.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.450
And people will appreciate
it, even if you're in a--

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:27.400
in Burma, I learned a
few Burmese phrases.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.310
They didn't expect it.

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.540
A lot of people speak
English there.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.630
And that goes a long
way, I think.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:33.990
It's not that hard.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.314
Sorry.

00:39:35.314 --> 00:39:37.402
AUDIENCE: What do you think
about the thing called the

00:39:37.402 --> 00:39:39.893
Lonely Planet effect where you
go somewhere with a row of

00:39:39.893 --> 00:39:42.311
cafes all [? lighted full ?],
probably share the same

00:39:42.311 --> 00:39:44.400
dishes, [INAUDIBLE]
very [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.100
on Lonely Planet [INAUDIBLE]
with a queue of tourists.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.214
And then, you go
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:53.330
ROBERT REID: Yeah, it's funny.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:57.630
There was, years ago, in Vietnam
in Hue, there was a

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:58.620
place that's still there--

00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.230
I presume.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.940
It was a few years ago--

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:04.360
that's a noodle place that was
run by a deaf-mute family.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.910
And Lonely Planet
wrote about it.

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:07.930
And of course, you're going to
go to the deaf-mute place.

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.340
Of course, everyone's
going to go there.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.180
So some of this is
classic Vietnam.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.330
So they created a place next
door, some other people, and

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.650
named it the same thing and
pretended to be deaf and mute.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:20.460
I love Vietnam.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.170
OK.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:23.940
That's great.

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.970
I think that it's up
to the traveler.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:27.600
I'm sorry when I see that.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.640
It's like that's the problem,
when you talk about the

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.660
Khaosan Road in Bangkok is a
perfect example about just

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.220
completely lines a tourist
ghetto, essentially.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.860
And almost everyone
has Lonely Planet.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:45.410
And it's just how do you cover
that so that you don't have

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:47.800
one with a giant line?

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.470
And I think that part of it is
tempering your enthusiasm for

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:53.620
places that Lonely
Planet dominates.

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.510
It's a very subtle thing, but
it's like sometimes it's

00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:00.950
better to say there's 15 guest
houses on this street.

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:03.360
You can get rooms with air
conditioning and a silly

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.490
little refrigerator you won't
need for about $12 for one

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.090
person, $15 for two.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.150
And you can go there.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.740
And here's a few examples if you
need a number, but there's

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.410
a lot and the changeover's
very quick.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:15.850
They come and go frequently.

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:16.970
You'll find something there.

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:18.950
I think that sometimes I'd like
to see a little more of

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.860
that in those cases, in those
cases in particular.

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.690
If someone's going to pay $200
or pay more money, then you

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:29.220
can stand to put a more solid
review for it, because people

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.950
are really wanting to make
sure they have someplace

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:33.190
that's very comfortable, that
they have all the amenities

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.750
and thread counts that they
need, et cetera, which is

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:36.390
important too.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.300
But then you would write
more about it.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.330
This is in terms of
accommodation.

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.530
So I like the idea when
you just point people

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:44.940
to the right way.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:48.640
And they're going to find the
same thing, but not all at the

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.680
same place.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.750
But it's ultimately
the traveler.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.530
As people travel more,
they get that.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.090
They learn that a little bit.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:57.700
Some of the first and second
time travelers that go to a

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.280
place, they don't
quite know yet--

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.900
that they don't have maybe the
confidence, perhaps, to

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.860
completely put the guidebook
down-- it got them to the

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.450
right area-- and go
figure it out.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:09.200
But I think people get
there pretty quick.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.680
I hope.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.630
I don't know?

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.680
Any other questions?

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.160
Thoughts?

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.250
Complaints?

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:17.760
Complaint?

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.704
No, just checking.

00:42:19.704 --> 00:42:21.880
AUDIENCE: How much traveling
do you do just for you as

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.422
opposed to writing an article
or researching or making a

00:42:24.422 --> 00:42:25.160
video or whatever?

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:30.080
Do you ever not take notes
and write them up?

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.750
ROBERT REID: Well, there are
some trips that you do--

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.980
that's the problem is knowing
how to turn it off.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.030
And when we do travel writing,
you feel like everything you

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.770
do, there's experiences
you can use somehow.

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:42.550
I have a unique position that
a lot of times we're talking

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:48.570
on radio or TV or something
about that, so I might have an

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.560
experience in Ecuador
that I use that way.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.610
I'm not writing about it.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:53.850
It's just kind of in the
back of your mind.

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:56.340
But I don't know
the answer yet.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.760
Because I work too
much sometimes.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.380
I try to write or make a
video about everything.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.580
So they get backed up, because
it takes a long time.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.590
It doesn't stop.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:10.300
I mean, that's a great thing
about this work is that travel

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.550
doesn't ever stop.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.160
And I see the space
tourism stuff.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:14.960
I'm just going why are you--

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.160
[FRUSTRATED  GROAN].

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.920
Nah, I'm not ready for that.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.000
I think there's enough
here to work with.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.340
But I don't have $190,000 or how
much ever ever it costs.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:28.946
But it's hard to stop it,
to be honest, work

00:43:28.946 --> 00:43:32.220
less, but I like that.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:32.850
Yes.

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:36.150
AUDIENCE: Why are travel books
so very centered on finding

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.580
accommodations, finding
restaurants, and having

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.130
categories with bars,
cafes, and so on.

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:42.960
It's so boring to read.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.915
You can't pick up a Lonely
Planet and read

00:43:44.915 --> 00:43:46.190
it from front to--

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.090
it's too boring.

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:51.240
I'd like to have more
description of the

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:51.860
neighborhoods.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.550
That takes place in this
piece at the beginning.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.000
ROBERT REID: A lot of people
use them different ways.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.720
It is a reference book
on some level.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:05.280
I mean, to me, I know how to use
them in a way that I can

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.050
be inspired by it, even if I'm
not reading every page.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:09.190
I'll read the opening.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.200
I mean you sit in a bookstore,
and you compare guidebooks.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.660
Read the opening paragraph to
several different cities.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.370
And if you're at the city,
what's within three hours?

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:17.850
Go to the transportation--
you see three

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:18.900
hours here, three here.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.360
Go and look at those places.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.920
And you can imagine building
your own itinerary.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.980
And it has all the information
that you can figure out.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.660
Oh, I land here, then I can go
see this and this and this.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.950
You're not going to read it
front to back, you're right.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:31.530
It's just not designed
to do that.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.490
I would love to be able to see
more space about neighborhoods

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.420
and a little bit more
asides and features

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.040
and things like that.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.130
There are some.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:44.730
And as a writer, it isn't the
most rewarding writing.

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:45.555
It's the power of inclusion.

00:44:45.555 --> 00:44:48.090
It's what you include and
where you place it.

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:50.150
And how much you talk about that
guest house that has a

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:54.920
line and everyone's going to,
versus that hidden beach and

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.000
thinking about the science
of how you include stuff.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:44:59.970
I know what you mean.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:00.590
I know what you mean.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:05.620
But it's just used
as a reference.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.300
And then you get the little
areas where you can flash your

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:13.830
style in the little box text
and things like that.

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:17.420
City guides have more of that
than a multi-country guide.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.680
Eastern Europe is going to be
much more bare-bone and kind

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.970
of reference then the Rio
city guide or the Paris

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:25.260
city guide would be.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.220
They'll have more on the
neighborhoods in that.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:31.010
But, yeah, I'd love to
not stop writing.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:36.160
But they got word counts
to adhere to.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:36.840
Yes?

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.000
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
bad food experiences?

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:39.520
ROBERT REID: I have.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.730
I've vomited on a lot of
different countries.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.610
I'll give you a vomit
list later.

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:47.620
Yeah, the funny thing is a lot
of people think that there's

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:50.440
street food and you see bugs
for sale and little street

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.250
tacos and stuff.

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:53.870
And generally speaking, those
can be very safe.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:57.540
I mean, if they're making it
fresh and its meats and stuff

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.230
aren't sitting out.

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.720
And they've been made, and the
sauce is getting under the sun

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.620
and things like that, then
you could have problems.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:05.250
But generally little kind of mom
and pop places and stuff

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:07.390
that are fresh, they have a high
turnover of food, you see

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.170
a lot of people eating there,
those are almost always safer.

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:12.780
I mean, the most sick I ever got
was in Vietnam eating at a

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.810
very nice Thai restaurant,
sitting down, air conditioned,

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:18.210
bamboo interiors,
and all this.

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:19.410
I'm the only one there.

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.990
And I get ridiculously sick
and vomit for days.

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:26.440
And so it isn't about so
much the condition.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.420
In Vietnam--

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.870
I lived in Vietnam, that's
why I mention it a lot--

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:33.270
you go to places with
cockroaches and you're fine.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:36.160
A little kind of outside
sidewalk selling pho noodles,

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.400
and it's totally fine.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.800
But it's just because you're
outside and sometimes there's

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.880
cockroaches in Vietnam.

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:42.920
That's fine.

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.880
As long as they don't
get in the soup.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.790
But yeah, I have gotten sick.

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:49.900
It happens.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.430
Dehydration is the
worst though.

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:53.280
Because you forget
to drink water.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.100
And you're moving around.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.610
We move so much more when
we're traveling.

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:57.220
You're constantly
outside moving.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.920
We're in New York,
we walk some.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.460
A lot of people don't walk.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.590
And they go somewhere, and
then they don't realize

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:04.960
they're out in the sun,
and oh my god.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.790
That's what happened to
me in Yakutsk, Russia.

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:10.210
I got this unbelievable heat
exhaustion, heat stroke thing.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:14.650
I was completely out of it
for two or three days.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:15.890
Sick.

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:16.370
Crime?

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:17.580
Should we talk about crime?

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.270
No.

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:20.630
I don't have to talk
about that then.

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:23.810
Any other questions
about travel?

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:24.260
Yes.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.680
AUDIENCE: What strategies have
you seen effective for people

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.100
who want to do open-ended travel
but are like us, and

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:32.490
have full-time desk jobs?

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:32.810
ROBERT REID: Quitting.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:36.790
Yeah, quit your job.

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:37.220
I don't know.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.630
I don't know how
it works here.

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:41.120
I mean, you see there is a huge
trend of people taking

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.010
career breaks.

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:43.380
That's very normal in Europe.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:48.060
Here, this cursed land, people
work and work and work and

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:48.815
have two weeks vacation.

00:47:48.815 --> 00:47:50.810
And so we talk about ugly
Americans, because they don't

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.330
get to travel as much.

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.150
And they stick around the
United States and stuff.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:55.130
We don't have as
much vacation.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:55.830
It is hard.

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:56.810
It's a challenge.

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:58.270
But there's a huge
trend of it.

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:00.830
There's a lot of books and sites
that are talking about

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:02.360
taking career breaks and
things like this.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.600
Does Google allow
a career break?

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.980
Is this controversial?

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:07.560
Are you allowed to
take months off?

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.470
I think everyone
should do that.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:11.180
It's human.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.320
I don't know what to tell you.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.010
It depends on where you work
and what the program is.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:19.370
And maybe do something you can
work remotely, and you can set

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:24.760
up in Nicaragua and surf the
waves and work from there for

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:25.695
very, very cheap.

00:48:25.695 --> 00:48:26.850
Who knows?

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:29.280
I'm afraid I don't know.

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.530
Or you could be a
travel writer.

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.350
Any other questions?

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:36.440
Anyone planning a trip?

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.310
Don't know where to go?

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.234
We can figure out your
trip for you.

00:48:39.234 --> 00:48:40.222
Yes.

00:48:40.222 --> 00:48:42.444
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm trying to
decide for next year-- we have

00:48:42.444 --> 00:48:42.692
a honeymoon.

00:48:42.692 --> 00:48:44.915
[? Would it be ?] better
to go to Scandinavia or

00:48:44.915 --> 00:48:46.650
do maybe a UK tour.

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:47.460
ROBERT REID: A UK tour?

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:49.610
AUDIENCE: Not like a tour group
but just all around.

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:50.420
ROBERT REID: Yeah.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.780
And when would the
honeymoon be?

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.276
AUDIENCE: July.

00:48:53.276 --> 00:48:54.526
ROBERT REID: OK.

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.350
Do you speak other language--
well, everyone speaks English

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:01.240
in Scandinavia.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.610
Well, I don't know
what to say.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:04.950
I mean, it depends
on what you want.

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:07.430
I think England and Britain is
one of the most underrated

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:10.010
destinations, because
it's so different.

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:11.000
We live in New York.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.320
All of our namesakes here
in this country

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:13.960
are linked to there.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.870
And you can talk to everyone.

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:15.970
And there's stories
on every street.

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:16.610
I lived in London.

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:17.630
I love it.

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:18.900
I actually like it more
than New York.

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.100
I don't say that often.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.220
But I do.

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.350
And you could have
a fantastic time.

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.140
Oh but, oh my gosh,
you get the fjords

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:26.800
and stuff like that.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.710
Great food in Scandinavia.

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:29.580
Oh my god.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:33.530
I had a great time
in Copenhagen.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:35.610
Go way up, way all the way up.

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:37.350
Just go to Norway
all the way up.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:38.460
It'd be hard to beat that.

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:39.430
It's beautiful.

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:40.650
I don't know what to tell you.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:41.140
I don't know.

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.880
How would you get around?

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.520
You would get around by
train, a train pass,

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.530
or you would drive?

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:48.030
AUDIENCE: Probably
mostly train.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.650
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:51.280
ROBERT REID: I would be tempted
to do Norway and back

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.170
down through Sweden.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.710
Go all the way up past
the Arctic Circle.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:55.450
You can get the train
pass and do that.

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:56.940
Go to the fjords and
stuff like that.

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.160
That'd be great.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.480
That'd be great.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.370
I haven't done that.

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:02.040
So that's what I would do.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.651
If you need a third,
let me know.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.970
Any other questions?

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:08.470
Yes.

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:10.350
AUDIENCE: Do you travel
with a [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:11.600
or do you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.330
ROBERT REID: You mean
for my hair?

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:18.510
No, you mean like someone there,
that's helping you

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:19.830
research and stuff like that.

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:22.750
No, I mean when you did
guidebooks, I would go often

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:24.140
anonymously in places.

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.770
And I always love when
they say well, Lonely

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:27.550
Planet never came here.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:28.540
Yeah, actually we did.

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.340
We just didn't tell you.

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:33.790
So a lot of it was very,
very independent.

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:36.710
I worked in Colombia
on the Columbia

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:37.660
guide a few years ago.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.300
And my Spanish kind of
dipped sometimes.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:44.020
And so I got some people to go
around, just travel around

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:49.740
with me and I hired some kids
and stuff, essentially to help

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.900
with language barrier, because
I thought it was important.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:55.520
And I've done that a little bit
in other places, but most

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.250
the time completely
on your own.

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:58.490
You have to figure
it out as you go.

00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:59.740
It's crazy.

00:51:02.008 --> 00:51:03.700
Do you all like travel?

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:04.060
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:04.525
ROBERT REID: Oh, OK.

00:51:04.525 --> 00:51:06.850
That's good.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:08.450
Most people do, I think.

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.923
Yes?

00:51:08.923 --> 00:51:12.240
AUDIENCE: Any tips about
being a travel writer?

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.720
ROBERT REID: To be
a travel writer?

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:14.170
Yeah.

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:16.900
Well, it's kind of the best
time, in some ways.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:17.810
Kind of the best and worst.

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:20.610
There's never been more travel
writers, because of

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:21.550
self-publishing.

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:23.220
I mean, people create blogs.

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.590
And that's the way to start.

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:26.690
It used to be you had
to get clips.

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:27.530
You had to have something.

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.270
I got into Lonely Planet,
because I'd written for a

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:32.590
newspaper in Vietnam, an
English language paper.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:33.870
And so I said here's clips.

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:34.640
I can write.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.280
Look at this.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.170
And now you can publish
yourself, so it's

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:38.060
easier to get in.

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.840
And then some people are
blogging, and they create

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.000
their little niche--

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.080
plastic stool, street eats,
or something like this.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:47.530
Very niche kind of things that
you have to eat on a plastic

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:48.590
stool and talk about that.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:49.290
Whatever it is.

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:50.906
I'm just making stuff up.

00:51:50.906 --> 00:51:55.280
But if you develop your niche
and persona, without worrying

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.850
about money initially, through
the blog, then things happen.

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:01.870
And it's funny, for better or
worse, we're at a time, when

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:04.360
writers are increasingly doing
things connecting with

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.360
marketing and PR.

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.390
And they're getting sponsorship
deals with Expedia

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:07.780
and things like--

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.695
I don't know if I'm allowed
to say Expedia here.

00:52:09.695 --> 00:52:11.170
Are you allowed to say that?

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:12.160
I don't even know.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.610
With Bing?

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:14.810
No, I'm just joking.

00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:20.380
And so people are finding more
unique ways of doing it than

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:22.080
just the old newspaper way.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.975
You could argue there's a
downside to that too.

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:26.370
But more people are writing.

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:29.650
And a lot of people want
to be travel writers.

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:31.220
There isn't a lot of money.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.410
Rock stars, music stars,
movie stars, they all--

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:35.800
you know who they are.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:36.630
Famous travel writers?

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:38.050
You probably don't
know how to name.

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:39.990
I mean, there isn't a lot of
fame, and there's isn't a lot

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.390
of money in it, but
you get to travel.

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:45.620
But I think that I would
start writing first.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.010
Guidebooks used to be a very
easy way to get in.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:49.220
It's a lot harder now.

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.185
Lonely Planet isn't looking for
authors right now because

00:52:51.185 --> 00:52:52.710
they have so many already.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:54.990
And so that changes, but
they look for people

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:56.700
with a local expertise.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.620
I mean if you know Delaware
better than anyone in the

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:05.040
world, you could be the Queen
of Delaware and govern all

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.220
Delaware travel content.

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.055
Because they want to find
someone that really knows it.

00:53:08.055 --> 00:53:10.390
It's not the best example,
but I'd like

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:11.650
to know about Delaware.

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:12.715
Can you tell me about
Delaware?

00:53:12.715 --> 00:53:13.467
Do you know?

00:53:13.467 --> 00:53:14.717
Oh, OK.

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:21.460
Any other questions
about anything?

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.825
Well, thank you very much.

00:53:23.825 --> 00:53:25.973
I hope that was fun.

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:33.360
Work hard this afternoon.
