I is very student from potions and
 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.349
I is very student from potions and
tremulous my question is why do some

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359

very difficult to imagine that the

very difficult to imagine that the

break this symmetry and for the same

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730
break this symmetry and for the same
 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.590
break this symmetry and for the same
reason it's impossible to imagine that

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600
reason it's impossible to imagine that
 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.200
reason it's impossible to imagine that
gluons have a very little mass now if

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210
gluons have a very little mass now if
 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.800
gluons have a very little mass now if
the symmetry is there and we believe it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810
the symmetry is there and we believe it
 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.110
the symmetry is there and we believe it
is these particles must be truly

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120
is these particles must be truly
 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.060
is these particles must be truly
massless now if they're massless like

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070
massless now if they're massless like
 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.600
massless now if they're massless like
light rays why haven't we seen them

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610
light rays why haven't we seen them
 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.130
light rays why haven't we seen them
streaming throughout the universe well

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140
streaming throughout the universe well
 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.840
streaming throughout the universe well
the reason we haven't seen them is that

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850
the reason we haven't seen them is that
 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.860
the reason we haven't seen them is that
unlike light rays gluons have charge as

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870
unlike light rays gluons have charge as
 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.400
unlike light rays gluons have charge as
well not only are they that carriers of

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410
well not only are they that carriers of
 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.220
well not only are they that carriers of
the force between charged particles like

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230
the force between charged particles like
 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.780
the force between charged particles like
quarks they also carry charge themselves

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
quarks they also carry charge themselves
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.160
quarks they also carry charge themselves
so they pull on each other

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170
so they pull on each other
 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.890
so they pull on each other
gluons are attracted to gluons and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900
gluons are attracted to gluons and
 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.870
gluons are attracted to gluons and
they're held together by the strong

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880
they're held together by the strong
 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.509
they're held together by the strong
nuclear force which gets to be quite

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519
nuclear force which gets to be quite
 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.650
nuclear force which gets to be quite
strong at very smart small distances so

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660
strong at very smart small distances so
 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.960
strong at very smart small distances so
the gluons much like the quarks are

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970
the gluons much like the quarks are
 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.530
the gluons much like the quarks are
trapped within nuclei the proton is made

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540
trapped within nuclei the proton is made
 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.020
trapped within nuclei the proton is made
out of inside the proton there are

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030
out of inside the proton there are
 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.229
out of inside the proton there are
quarks and gluons moving around and the

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239
quarks and gluons moving around and the
 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.180
quarks and gluons moving around and the
gluons never get out even though they're

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190
gluons never get out even though they're
 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.970
gluons never get out even though they're
massless and are traveling at the speed

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980
massless and are traveling at the speed
 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.310
massless and are traveling at the speed
of light they are also held together by

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320
of light they are also held together by
 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.860
of light they are also held together by
this very strong force and never get out

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
this very strong force and never get out
 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.140
this very strong force and never get out
of the proton that's why you've never

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150
of the proton that's why you've never
 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.160
of the proton that's why you've never
seen a gluon directly but indirectly we

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170
seen a gluon directly but indirectly we
 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.490
seen a gluon directly but indirectly we
do see gluons when we smash together two

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500
do see gluons when we smash together two
 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.790
do see gluons when we smash together two
protons what happens is that the quarks

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800
protons what happens is that the quarks
 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.550

inside those bags of quarks and gluons

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560
inside those bags of quarks and gluons
 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.840
inside those bags of quarks and gluons
collide produce gluons those gluons are

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850
collide produce gluons those gluons are
 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.310
collide produce gluons those gluons are
shot out of the collision but they can't

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320
shot out of the collision but they can't
 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.560
shot out of the collision but they can't
get out freely themselves because

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570
get out freely themselves because
 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.030
get out freely themselves because
they're attracted to all the other

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040
they're attracted to all the other
 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.789
they're attracted to all the other
gluons and quarks and what comes out is

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799
gluons and quarks and what comes out is
 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.570
gluons and quarks and what comes out is
a jet of ordinary particles which are

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580
a jet of ordinary particles which are
 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.080
a jet of ordinary particles which are
totally neutral have

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090
totally neutral have
 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.630
totally neutral have
this net charge but we see the Jets that

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640
this net charge but we see the Jets that
 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.789
this net charge but we see the Jets that
the gluon turned has turned into and by

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799
the gluon turned has turned into and by
 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.800
the gluon turned has turned into and by
by observing the properties of these

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810
by observing the properties of these
 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.710
by observing the properties of these
Jets we can tell that those Jets came

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720
Jets we can tell that those Jets came
 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.810
Jets we can tell that those Jets came
from one single blue

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820
from one single blue
 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.659
from one single blue
so in effect in these experiments we see

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669
so in effect in these experiments we see
 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.510
so in effect in these experiments we see
the gluons or the more precisely the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520
the gluons or the more precisely the
 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.240
the gluons or the more precisely the
Jets into which they be which they

Jets into which they be which they
 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.180
Jets into which they be which they
eventually become and in that way we

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190
eventually become and in that way we
 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.260
eventually become and in that way we
indirectly see gluons
