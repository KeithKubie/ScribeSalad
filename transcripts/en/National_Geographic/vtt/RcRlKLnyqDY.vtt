00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
the United States is so obsessively

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.319
protective of its currency that it

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.540
guards its security right down to the

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.340
specific fibers that comprise each bill

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.990
US currency may be the most

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.990
counterfeited money in the world

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.390
mccrane paper here in Dalton became the

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.780
supplier of paper for US currency in

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.540
1879 has held that contract ever since

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.360
then we are now the sole supplier of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.930
currency paper for the US government

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:57.140
crane paper is special because of the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:59.570
materials that we choose high quality

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.100
natural fibers cotton and flax fibers

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.589
which had traditionally been used in

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.360
textile making are still used for US

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:15.080
currency as opposed to ordinary papers

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:17.119
made today with wood pulp there are a

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.539
lot of clever people that work hard to

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.910
try to create counterfeits security

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.460
features in the 100 dollar note include

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.530
a watermark feature with the portrait of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.690
Benjamin Franklin which is put in the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.880
paper making process and then the most

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.509
prominent security features now the 3d

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.509
ribbon here

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.000
Western world and we are accustomed to

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.740
credit and digital electronic

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.799
transactions but one of the features of

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.289
currency paper of course is anonymity I

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.850
think that's partly why it's valued by

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.310
many around the world as they can

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.060
conduct transactions using money without

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.829
having traceability to it so a lot of

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.780
the world that still relies on this

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.780
tangible product paper and money
