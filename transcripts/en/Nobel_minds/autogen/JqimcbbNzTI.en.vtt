I just gotten for Christmas apart to get

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
I just gotten for Christmas apart to get
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.400
I just gotten for Christmas apart to get
the electric motor out and I think my my

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
the electric motor out and I think my my
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.160
the electric motor out and I think my my
parents didn't scold me I think my

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170
parents didn't scold me I think my
 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.500
parents didn't scold me I think my
father was quite fascinated with my

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510
father was quite fascinated with my
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.390
father was quite fascinated with my
fascination and as time went on I he was

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
fascination and as time went on I he was
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000
fascination and as time went on I he was
a physician in town and his patients

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010
a physician in town and his patients
 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.009
a physician in town and his patients
would obviously give him things to give

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
would obviously give him things to give
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.549
would obviously give him things to give
to me so I was one of five children I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
to me so I was one of five children I
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.620
to me so I was one of five children I
don't know if they all got quite that

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
don't know if they all got quite that
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.639
don't know if they all got quite that
much attention but but you know he you

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
much attention but but you know he you
 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.740
much attention but but you know he you
know some of these things like a box of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
know some of these things like a box of
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.560
know some of these things like a box of
of parts from the telephone company and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
of parts from the telephone company and
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.049
of parts from the telephone company and
a box of magnets and stuff like this and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
a box of magnets and stuff like this and
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.569
a box of magnets and stuff like this and
and i just found all of this stuff so

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579
and i just found all of this stuff so
 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.700
and i just found all of this stuff so
fascinating and there was once an

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
fascinating and there was once an
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.799
fascinating and there was once an
explosion that you came running up with

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809
explosion that you came running up with
 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.670
explosion that you came running up with
oh yo well this was uh you know i can't

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
oh yo well this was uh you know i can't
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.200
oh yo well this was uh you know i can't
remember who told me you could buy

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
remember who told me you could buy
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.410
remember who told me you could buy
calcium carbide at hardware stores you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420
calcium carbide at hardware stores you
 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.020
calcium carbide at hardware stores you
the idea was to put it in moles runways

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
the idea was to put it in moles runways
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.410
the idea was to put it in moles runways
and the generates settling gasps when

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
and the generates settling gasps when
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.719
and the generates settling gasps when
when the calcium carbide gets in contact

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
when the calcium carbide gets in contact
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.000
when the calcium carbide gets in contact
with water and that would sort of drive

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
with water and that would sort of drive
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.630
with water and that would sort of drive
out the moles it but but you could take

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
out the moles it but but you could take
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.910
out the moles it but but you could take
a soda pop bottle fill it mostly full of

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
a soda pop bottle fill it mostly full of
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.460
a soda pop bottle fill it mostly full of
water drop in one of these grains of

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
water drop in one of these grains of
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.340
water drop in one of these grains of
silicon calcium carbide and then jam a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
silicon calcium carbide and then jam a
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.890
silicon calcium carbide and then jam a
rubber stopper with a with a glass tube

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
rubber stopper with a with a glass tube
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.340
rubber stopper with a with a glass tube
with it that was pulled to a fine point

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
with it that was pulled to a fine point
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.130
with it that was pulled to a fine point
so there was just very small orifice and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
so there was just very small orifice and
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.800
so there was just very small orifice and
then you'd have to wait until all the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
then you'd have to wait until all the
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.109
then you'd have to wait until all the
oxygen was out of the bottle and then

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
oxygen was out of the bottle and then
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.490
oxygen was out of the bottle and then
you would like this and you get this is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
you would like this and you get this is
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.410
you would like this and you get this is
intense white flame and this is

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
intense white flame and this is
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.810
intense white flame and this is
essentially a miner's lamp it was fun

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
essentially a miner's lamp it was fun
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.460
essentially a miner's lamp it was fun
but it would go for I don't know a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
but it would go for I don't know a
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.230
but it would go for I don't know a
minute or something or less and then

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
minute or something or less and then
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.060
minute or something or less and then
that you'd have to open it up and put

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070
that you'd have to open it up and put
 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.980
that you'd have to open it up and put
another one in and so I thought I would

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
another one in and so I thought I would
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.410
another one in and so I thought I would
make one kind of differently that would

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
make one kind of differently that would
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.120
make one kind of differently that would
run for hours so I took a 500 milliliter

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130
run for hours so I took a 500 milliliter
 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.810
run for hours so I took a 500 milliliter
beaker and filled it full of calcium

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
beaker and filled it full of calcium
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.380
beaker and filled it full of calcium
carbide and then put a had a long

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
carbide and then put a had a long
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.260
carbide and then put a had a long
beurette so there was a so it would drip

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
beurette so there was a so it would drip
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.140
beurette so there was a so it would drip
a water into this thing and then there

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
a water into this thing and then there
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.330
a water into this thing and then there
was

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340
was
 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.750
was
a delivery tube and and I didn't think

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760
a delivery tube and and I didn't think
 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.309
a delivery tube and and I didn't think
about the fact that there was such a

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319
about the fact that there was such a
 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.070
about the fact that there was such a
much larger volume in this thing so I I

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080
much larger volume in this thing so I I
 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.930
much larger volume in this thing so I I
waited what seemed like a proprietary

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940
waited what seemed like a proprietary
 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.920
waited what seemed like a proprietary
adumbrate than this this brilliant white

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930
adumbrate than this this brilliant white
 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.320
adumbrate than this this brilliant white
flame and I instinctively knew enough to

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330
flame and I instinctively knew enough to
 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.449
flame and I instinctively knew enough to
move my head like this this thing blew

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459
move my head like this this thing blew
 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.210
move my head like this this thing blew
up I went went like this and it blew up

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
up I went went like this and it blew up
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.880
up I went went like this and it blew up
and I had glass on the side of my face

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890
and I had glass on the side of my face
 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.949
and I had glass on the side of my face
which would have gone in my eye if I

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959
which would have gone in my eye if I
 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.009
which would have gone in my eye if I
hadn't been luckier and and so my mother

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019
hadn't been luckier and and so my mother
 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.319
hadn't been luckier and and so my mother
was up fixing dinner and she hears this

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329
was up fixing dinner and she hears this
 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.630
was up fixing dinner and she hears this
explosion downstairs and she comes to

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640
explosion downstairs and she comes to
 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.979
explosion downstairs and she comes to
the top of the stairs I was in the

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989
the top of the stairs I was in the
 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.440
the top of the stairs I was in the
basement and and so I'm coming up the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
basement and and so I'm coming up the
 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.870
basement and and so I'm coming up the
stairs cupping my hands to keep the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880
stairs cupping my hands to keep the
 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.470
stairs cupping my hands to keep the
blood from dripping on the carpet and I

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480
blood from dripping on the carpet and I
 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.780
blood from dripping on the carpet and I
was so famous for practical jokes that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790
was so famous for practical jokes that
 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.580
was so famous for practical jokes that
she of course couldn't trust anything I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590
she of course couldn't trust anything I
 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.710
she of course couldn't trust anything I
did so she says if you're kidding i'll

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720
did so she says if you're kidding i'll
 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.809
did so she says if you're kidding i'll
kill you though I I was old enough to

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819
kill you though I I was old enough to
 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.729
kill you though I I was old enough to
drive and I drove myself down to my

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739
drive and I drove myself down to my
 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.650
drive and I drove myself down to my
father's office and he sewed up the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660
father's office and he sewed up the
 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.710
father's office and he sewed up the
largest of the cuts and this had

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720
largest of the cuts and this had
 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.250
largest of the cuts and this had
happened so many times before
