00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.880
&gt;&gt; BRADY HARAN: I think most Numberphiles are fascinated by the idea of Graham's number,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.500
which is supposedly unimaginably big -

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.420
but what actually is it? What does it count?

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.620
Well, I think the best person to explain that

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.240
is none other than the world famous mathematician himself, Ron Graham.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.300
&gt;&gt; RON GRAHAM: Suppose you took four vertices of a square -

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.500
and, this is two dimensons, so it has how many vertices?

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.600
Two squared (four vertices).

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.540
Now, what I'm going to do is take these four vertices, and put -

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.080
two more edges connecting all possible pairs of these vertices.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.860
Now how many possible edges would you be able to draw?

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.040
Well, there's something called a binomial coefficient,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.500
and there are four vertices, and you choose two of them,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.780
and this turns out to be six.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.380
So you see there are six edges here - all the ways you could join these four dots.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.640
And now, what we're going to do - is -

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.420
take the four dots again and look at each one of these

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.100
possible six lines and color them red or blue

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.500
in any way that you like, so for example -

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.080
I might color this one red, and maybe this one red,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.200
and then I'd say, well ok, maybe I'll color this one blue, and this one blue,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.340
and this one blue, and this one blue.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.500
Ok, so that's one way, and you might say, well, okay, so what?

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.940
I'm looking for certain special configurations - and,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.660
I'm not going to find it here in a square because

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.560
this is too small; we need more dimensions.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.740
What about three dimensions? Well, what does a three-dimensional cube look like?

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.800
Well, I can't really draw it on a piece of paper, but you can kind of draw a version of it,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.100
namely, if you take your four vertices that form your square

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.980
and then you kind of move it a little bit,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.260
well, that's a picture you might recognize,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.440
how many vertices on these corner points here?

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.720
Well, you can see there are eight, which is two cubed.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.700
So the three-dimensonal cube has - two cubed - eight vertices.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.000
28 possible line segments. And if you color them,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.420
say, this one's red, and this one's red, and this one's red, and that one's red,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.640
but - you know - a lot of the others are blue,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.720
and what you're trying to do is do it in a way that

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.920
avoids something. Now, what is this thing you're trying to avoid?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.460
That's the whole point.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.560
You're trying to avoid the following configuration:

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.820
namely, four points in here someplace

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.720
and all the six line segments have the same color (in this case it's red)

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.100
and, furthermore, these four points lie in a flat plane.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.640
They don't stick up in three dimensions.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.680
Usually, if you took four points, you'd have three dimensions.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.840
It kind of spans a three-dimensional volume.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.800
Here, I want four points to be flat, and they form a square,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.740
and all six line segments are the same color.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.240
In three dimensions, you definitely can avoid such a configuration,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.620
because this only seems to happen on, just kind of the faces.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.740
And what you have to do - your challenge -

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.220
is to go in a much larger dimension.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.900
And what do you mean by a cube - in say - four dimensions?

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.220
Well, in four dimensions, you could take this picture,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.900
and translate it, and join the lines, but it gets kind of messy,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.000
but yeah. I'm not afraid; I think I can do that. Let's see.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.600
Here's a three-dimensional cube, and now I have to shift it, okay, well,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.160
I've gotta be a little careful here -

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.840
and now I join the corresponding things. Well,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.540
you can see it's going to be,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.100
as we can call it, a tesseract.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.620
Now how many different ways can you color

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.060
these 120 different lines

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.540
with red and blue?

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.560
Well, with each one of them, there are two choices.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.340
So, it's two times two times two

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.540
times two 120 times,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.900
or 2 to the 120 (2^120).

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.360
Already beyond what computers can do, and no computer can do 2^120 things right now.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.020
But the problem we're trying to avoid

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.500
having these four points that form a square

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.920
lie in a plane and have all six line segments the same color

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.120
and in four dimensions, you can do it.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.040
Not too hard to do. Well, what about the five-dimensional cube?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.200
In five you can avoid it, six - it takes more work,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.540
seven - yes, it takes a lot more work,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.340
the question is, can you always avoid it?

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.340
The answer: no.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.340
If the dimension is large enough,

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.540
you cannot avoid it.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.560
No matter how hard you try to color it, you can't avoid it.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.420
And when is that dimension finally reached?

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.900
Well, you know it's reached by the time you get to a very large number,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.820
sometimes known as Graham's number,

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.840
a pretty big number,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.000
and you know for sure, in that dimension, you cannot avoid it.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And the proof that you can't avoid it is pretty complicated, pretty recursive,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.980
and that's what causes this number to be so large.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.520
Now, you might say, well, what's the truth?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.660
Sure, if you go as far as Graham's number, in that dimension, you can't avoid it,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.800
but maybe you can make it unavoidable in a smaller dimension.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.920
And it turns out that it appears that already in thirteen dimensions

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.900
you can't avoid it.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.680
Now, how could you check that by computer?

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.420
Well, okay,

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.280
no problem really,

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.300
in thirteen dimensions, so "n" is thirteen dimensions,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.660
so how many vertices in your thirteen-dimensional cube? Well,

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.120
2^13 vertices, which is, what,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.620
that's about 8192.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.600
Okay, a little over eight thousand vertices.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.220
Well, how many line segments?

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.400
Well, 8192 times 8191

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.760
over two - you have to check -

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.080
no matter how you color them with red or blue -

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.500
you'll make one of these things. Well, it's uncheckable.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.540
You can't check that; it's impossible. You need to think!

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.080
You can't just compute. Right now,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.680
we don't know. It's between 13 - we know, maybe -

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.900
uh, 12 is not enough, it turns out,

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.020
and this other, slightly bigger number,

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.880
which uh - I can - I can try to write it,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.440
&gt;&gt; BRADY HARAN: So there we go. As cubes move up the dimensions, from

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.660
three dimensions, that I think we all understand,

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.500
to four dimensions, to five -

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.140
eventually we reach a number of dimensions

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.160
in which one of these configurations

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.680
must exist.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.220
And the upper bound on that, the point where it has to happen by,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.420
is this "Graham's number".

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.200
Now, we know this number is unimaginably big,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.320
it was even in the Guinness Book of Records.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.960
But just how big is it?

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.480
Well that deserves a video all of its own, and again, we've got Ron Graham to explain it.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.400
The links are on the screen here,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.680
I've also put them in the description under the video.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.240
So, why don't you check it out?

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.440
It's a pretty big number.
