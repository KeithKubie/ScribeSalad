00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's get to work on defining an optimal pig strategy.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So we need a Q and a U function, and an actions function.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's get started on that.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Q function we'll call Q_pig.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It takes a state and an action

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and evaluates the quality of that

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
against the utility function.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And what should we use for the utility function?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, I think the best thing to use

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is the probability of winning

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because we get 1 point for winning

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and no points for losing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That's a good way of thinking about the game.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And so our expected outcome is going to be

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
somewhere between 0 and 1, and that's like a probability.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And so the probability of winning is our score.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If we win all of the time, the probability of scoring--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
of winning is 1, then that should be worth 1 point.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If we win none of the time, that should be worth 0 points.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So our utility is just the probability of winning. And what is that?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Well, if we hold, then we're turning it over to our opponent,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we still have our hold and roll functions

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that tell us what state we get to when we hold.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And then it's our opponent's, and he's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
going to do his best, so our utility

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
would be 1 minus the opponent's utility--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
what he can do best, his probability of winning

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
because either one player or the other has to win

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So our probability of winning

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is 1 minus our opponent's probability of winning.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If we roll, it's more complicated.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If we roll a 1, then we pig out,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and it's 1 minus our opponent's probability of winning

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
because it's his turn.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And otherwise, we just take

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
all the possibilities for the other die rolls,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and it's our probability of winning

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
from the result of rolling in that state,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and that's six probabilities all together.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So we have to average them. So we add them all up, and divide by 6.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And if the action wasn't hold or roll,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm going to raise the value.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What are the actions in this state?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Well, if there's some pending numbers,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I can roll or hold,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and if they're not, I'm just going to roll.

00:01:57.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's the only thing that makes sense to do.
