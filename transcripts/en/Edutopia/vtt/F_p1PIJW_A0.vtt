00:00:08.056 --> 00:00:11.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The sounds of spring
in Apple Valley, Minnesota,

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:17.306
rain falling, birds singing,
and students learning.

00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:18.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Open up
"Find Wild Ginger."

00:00:19.126 --> 00:00:20.286
It's on page 59.

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:23.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These students at the
School of Environmental Studies,

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.496
just outside Minneapolis,

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:26.986
are learning to identify
the plants growing

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:29.366
around a pond next to their school.

00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:30.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Why do you
think it says, "A base?"

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:32.566
&gt;&gt;Student: Like down
towards the bottom,

00:00:32.736 --> 00:00:34.826
maybe the animals spread the seeds?

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:35.616
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Excellent.

00:00:35.876 --> 00:00:39.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There won't be a multiple
choice test on what they've learned,

00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:41.036
because there are few tests here.

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:44.166
instead, they'll apply their
knowledge later in the week

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:46.776
when they conduct a
survey of plant material

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:48.536
for the City's Parks Department.

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.366
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, it looks
like they're budding.

00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.616
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This kind of
hands-on exploration is part

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:55.276
of the school's unique
interdisciplinary approach

00:00:55.276 --> 00:00:58.066
to project-based learning
in service of the community.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.356
&gt;&gt;So there's red and black
raspberry right here.

00:01:01.356 --> 00:01:03.636
&gt;&gt;Dan: We're a two-year high
school, eleventh and twelfth grade.

00:01:03.806 --> 00:01:05.506
And when kids come into the
school, it's a little bit

00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:07.436
of a transition time
coming into the school,

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:08.726
because this is quite different.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:11.446
When the juniors come
into the school,

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.916
right away they're doing
something called a pond profile.

00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:17.506
And we work with the local
communities, and we have 20 ponds

00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:20.896
and lakes that we are monitoring
every year since we've been open.

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:22.326
And now this is our seventh year.

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:26.056
And so the kids go out and do a
chemical analysis of the water.

00:01:27.016 --> 00:01:29.436
They also will write
a technical paper,

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:31.286
and then they present their findings

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:33.296
to the water commissioners
from the local cities.

00:01:33.296 --> 00:01:37.186
And those people actually will
be assessing the student work.

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:39.676
And what we find is it
really raises the bar

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:41.276
for kids in their performance.

00:01:41.576 --> 00:01:45.416
And what we also find is that kids
tend to remember what they've learned

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:48.716
down the road, because they
put so much effort into it,

00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:51.966
and they work with other students
to create a high-end product.

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:53.346
&gt;&gt;Could use one more, I think.

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:53.936
&gt;&gt;We need way more.

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:57.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While the school offers
courses in many different subjects,

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.446
including art, and
multi-media production,

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.246
the environmental focus
informs everything.

00:02:02.506 --> 00:02:06.426
From a video promoting the
Minneapolis Zoo's Winter Monorail

00:02:06.496 --> 00:02:11.596
Ride, to this fish sculpture, made
from recycled plastic bread tabs.

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:15.786
&gt;&gt;Craig: Having the environment
as a core is a great foundation,

00:02:15.786 --> 00:02:17.556
because it's something that
everyone is connected with.

00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:20.986
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You can see that there's
a large amount of debris in here,

00:02:20.986 --> 00:02:22.626
which you would expect
in a [inaudible] pool.

00:02:23.036 --> 00:02:26.666
&gt;&gt;Craig: A lot of the students
are very involved in the outdoors.

00:02:26.836 --> 00:02:27.636
They go hiking.

00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:28.296
They go camping.

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:30.166
They have a woods in their backyard.

00:02:30.236 --> 00:02:33.456
So it's a connection that
they have with everything

00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:34.436
that they can build off of.

00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:36.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So that would be one
of the predators of the pond.

00:02:37.216 --> 00:02:39.386
&gt;&gt;Amanda: I can't learn
from a textbook.

00:02:39.436 --> 00:02:41.166
I can't concentrate.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:44.326
I just don't have the ability
to concentrate like that.

00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:47.866
And here, with the hands-on
activities that we do,

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:51.236
and the integration of
everything into our daily lives,

00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:54.166
it helps me observe the
information a lot better.

00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:55.506
&gt;&gt;Do guys see little holes in there?

00:02:55.506 --> 00:02:57.486
&gt;&gt;What do you think made those holes?

00:02:57.486 --> 00:02:57.626
&gt;&gt;Mice.

00:02:57.626 --> 00:02:57.806
&gt;&gt;Ants?

00:02:58.316 --> 00:02:59.916
&gt;&gt;Ants, What else?

00:03:00.176 --> 00:03:02.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The students get a
chance to apply what they've learned

00:03:02.936 --> 00:03:07.066
by doing community service work, like
explaining the function of ecosystems

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:08.586
to a group of first graders.

00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:13.586
&gt;&gt;No, fungus is more
like a mushroom-type.

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:15.206
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Involvement
with the community was one

00:03:15.206 --> 00:03:19.326
of the guiding principles of the
school when it was founded in 1995

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:22.356
in partnership with its
neighbor, the Minnesota Zoo.

00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:26.636
SES students are engaged in a
variety of activities at the zoo,

00:03:26.776 --> 00:03:29.686
from animal behavior studies
to theater performances.

00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:33.866
&gt;&gt;A zoo detective's job is
both intriguing and complex.

00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:36.146
&gt;&gt;Grant: They've been
performing on weekends out here,

00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:37.776
"They Mystery of the
Ravished Rainforest."

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:39.116
It's a half-hour kids' show.

00:03:39.396 --> 00:03:41.196
Very interactive, very fun.

00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:44.776
Just try to make it real
light, and hopefully get

00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:46.626
across an important message, which is

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:48.216
that rainforests are
worth conserving.

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:51.196
&gt;&gt;Go away, we don't want
any more humans here.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:52.746
Go away, get out of here!

00:03:52.746 --> 00:03:53.896
&gt;&gt;Ahhhh, Detective!

00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:56.086
&gt;&gt;Grant: I often find it fun
to have these kids come to me

00:03:56.086 --> 00:03:59.636
with their ideas of what they want to
do with the project, and then I try

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:02.876
to show them, "Okay, that's a great
idea, but let's see how it can work

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:04.326
in the real world, you know?"

00:04:04.626 --> 00:04:06.976
And I think that's what
the Zoo can do for them.

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:09.386
&gt;&gt;Lynda: You remember like a while
ago, there was like something

00:04:09.386 --> 00:04:10.496
that looked like a battery?

00:04:11.306 --> 00:04:13.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Lynda Staus
is studying the behavior

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:15.126
of the Zoo's Snow Monkeys, a project

00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:18.116
that earns her school credit
while providing a valuable service

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:18.396
to the Zoo.

00:04:18.396 --> 00:04:21.956
Lynda: For example, I'll
write down whether Niko,

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:24.396
our only male, is mating with anyone.

00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:26.636
I'll write that down, and
then I'll watch those girls

00:04:27.296 --> 00:04:30.986
to see whether they get bigger, or
they seem to be treated differently.

00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:34.576
Because zookeepers use that
information to tell whether

00:04:34.576 --> 00:04:36.016
or not they're going to be pregnant.

00:04:36.016 --> 00:04:38.536
&gt;&gt;Grant: We can provide them with
the resources, with the experts

00:04:38.606 --> 00:04:40.966
to help them kind of shape
their ideas and grow.

00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:43.546
And I really think that's,
you know, true education.

00:04:43.546 --> 00:04:45.016
That's how kids, you know, learn.

00:04:45.016 --> 00:04:47.416
&gt;&gt;Tom: You know you're going
to start at this point...

00:04:47.526 --> 00:04:50.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the nearby town of
Eagan, Tom Goodwin's students are

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:52.586
about to put their
knowledge of plant material

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:54.136
and trigonometry to the test.

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:57.226
&gt;&gt;Tom: And then from
there, you're going to go

00:04:57.306 --> 00:04:59.396
into your plot, and you know...

00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:02.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They would be working
in small teams to identify plants,

00:05:02.956 --> 00:05:06.956
and measure the height of trees
in a swatch of park land scheduled

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:08.396
for recreational development.

00:05:08.726 --> 00:05:12.226
&gt;&gt;Gregg: In any growing city,
which Eagan is, where you seem

00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:14.766
to always have more work than we
have staff to be able to do it,

00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:18.406
in my experience with the School
Environment of Sciences has been

00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:23.666
that they've always provided a real
top-notch, high-quality workload

00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:25.076
or data collection procedure.

00:05:25.476 --> 00:05:27.016
&gt;&gt;Student: Sixty, again.

00:05:27.136 --> 00:05:29.476
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: They're actually going
to use this information that we get.

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:32.486
It's not just going out and doing
a project, the teachers are going

00:05:32.486 --> 00:05:33.966
to grade it and that's it.

00:05:34.296 --> 00:05:37.416
It's something that the Eagan Parks
and Wildlife is going to be able

00:05:37.416 --> 00:05:38.386
to use for years to come.

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:39.406
&gt;&gt;Wait, two?

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.506
&gt;&gt;That's right here.

00:05:43.036 --> 00:05:45.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Goodwin feels
students gain much more than math

00:05:45.576 --> 00:05:48.046
and science skills working
on projects like this.

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:52.026
&gt;&gt;Thomas: What it does for kids is
gives them a great deal of confidence

00:05:52.026 --> 00:05:53.616
that they can do just about anything.

00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:55.236
They don't necessarily
get better grades,

00:05:55.616 --> 00:06:00.026
but they develop this sense
that this is worthwhile.

00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:03.256
And they also develop a sense
about how they want to live.

00:06:04.456 --> 00:06:05.836
And what they want to
do with their lives.

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:10.786
&gt;&gt;Thomas: So this is this
year's growth of this plant.

00:06:10.786 --> 00:06:10.853
&gt;&gt;Students: Oh!

00:06:10.853 --> 00:06:13.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The SES hands-on approach
to learning has caused Goodwin

00:06:13.516 --> 00:06:15.676
to redefine his role as teacher.

00:06:16.036 --> 00:06:17.216
&gt;&gt;Thomas: I'm a facilitator.

00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:18.106
I'm a helper.

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:18.816
I'm a coach.

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:21.516
My relationship with
them is much stronger.

00:06:21.976 --> 00:06:24.286
&gt;&gt;Thomas: You have some other
herbaceous plants like this one.

00:06:24.286 --> 00:06:24.606
&gt;&gt;Student: Dandelion.

00:06:25.196 --> 00:06:25.636
&gt;&gt;Thomas: Dandelion.

00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:26.496
And this one, do you know this one?

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:27.706
&gt;&gt;Student: Mullen.

00:06:28.116 --> 00:06:28.356
&gt;&gt;Thomas: Right!

00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:29.016
Mullen.

00:06:30.246 --> 00:06:30.826
&gt;&gt;Thomas: Their understanding

00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:33.686
of how the educational
process works is much stronger.

00:06:33.796 --> 00:06:37.136
Their commitment to the
process is much stronger.

00:06:37.326 --> 00:06:43.376
So that they come in here as
students, and they become learners.

00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:45.156
&gt;&gt;Student: What are
you doing for your IDP?

00:06:45.816 --> 00:06:46.396
&gt;&gt;Student: Site development.

00:06:47.096 --> 00:06:49.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: When they're not working
in the field, students are working

00:06:49.716 --> 00:06:52.586
in a unique schoolhouse,
designed from the ground

00:06:52.586 --> 00:06:54.416
up with the learner in mind.

00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:58.396
&gt;&gt;Dan: Typically, in a
school, you'll build boxes

00:06:58.396 --> 00:07:00.866
and then you decide what
to teach in the boxes.

00:07:01.106 --> 00:07:03.366
We had an opportunity to
design our entire program.

00:07:03.446 --> 00:07:05.486
&gt;&gt;Craig: If you're going to talk
about reworking the entire curriculum

00:07:05.486 --> 00:07:07.956
and moving large chunks around,
no, I'm not comfortable with that.

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:08.416
If you're...

00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:10.576
&gt;&gt;Dan: We talked about
how kids would learn best.

00:07:10.576 --> 00:07:14.146
So the whole focus was on student
learning and their learning needs.

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:17.106
We talked about some of the
learning episodes that would occur.

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:20.196
sometimes it would be larger
groups, sometimes smaller,

00:07:20.196 --> 00:07:22.826
or sometimes it would be
kids working in teams.

00:07:22.826 --> 00:07:26.016
And then once we fleshed out
our entire two-year program,

00:07:26.296 --> 00:07:29.346
then we went to the architect
and said, "We want a building

00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:33.626
that will meet our expectations for
how kids are going to learn best,

00:07:34.056 --> 00:07:35.686
and then design the
building to support it.

00:07:36.526 --> 00:07:39.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Renowned school
architect, Bruce Jilk, designed SES.

00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:43.716
&gt;&gt;Bruce: The organization of
our bricks and mortar does,

00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:45.526
in fact, influence our behaviors.

00:07:45.636 --> 00:07:48.036
And if you put 30 kids and a teacher

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:49.896
in a 900-square foot
room, guess what?

00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:52.506
The teacher is going to take control,
and is going to start lecturing.

00:07:52.946 --> 00:07:57.386
So we needed to break that
mold or model for this school.

00:07:57.956 --> 00:08:00.966
So just by the fact that
there aren't classrooms here.

00:08:01.636 --> 00:08:04.146
That the students, they're
organized into small groups,

00:08:04.576 --> 00:08:06.156
brings on a different behavior.

00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:09.466
And it's one that really is
designed to focus on the learner.

00:08:10.066 --> 00:08:13.096
&gt;&gt;Dan: The school is very much a
personalized learning environment.

00:08:13.096 --> 00:08:14.906
Each student has their
own workstation.

00:08:15.326 --> 00:08:17.736
There are pods of ten
students working together.

00:08:18.046 --> 00:08:22.206
And we use a house concept where
100 students are in a house

00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:25.296
with those same set of
teachers for the entire year.

00:08:25.716 --> 00:08:27.846
And so by creating that
sense of personalization,

00:08:27.846 --> 00:08:31.046
by having the flexibility of
space, we've really been able

00:08:31.076 --> 00:08:35.466
to have quite a variety of
learning that takes place.

00:08:35.466 --> 00:08:39.296
&gt;&gt;Student: Is this your manual
right here that you created?

00:08:39.296 --> 00:08:41.086
&gt;&gt;Student: This is the
beginning workings of the manual.

00:08:41.136 --> 00:08:42.346
It's called "The Safe
School Handbook."

00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:42.506
And...

00:08:42.866 --> 00:08:43.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the Forum Space,

00:08:43.926 --> 00:08:47.356
students share their individual
research projects with their peers

00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:51.016
and community members, some of whom
help grade their presentations.

00:08:51.016 --> 00:08:55.286
&gt;&gt;Student: Driving an SUV has a much
greater impact on the environment

00:08:55.286 --> 00:08:57.046
than driving most other
passenger cars.

00:08:57.526 --> 00:09:00.496
Much of this is due to standards
for SUVs that are less stringent

00:09:00.496 --> 00:09:02.126
than those of smaller passenger cars.

00:09:02.296 --> 00:09:04.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the
culmination of their studies,

00:09:04.396 --> 00:09:08.086
seniors deliver speeches on the
subjects of their final projects.

00:09:08.086 --> 00:09:11.436
&gt;&gt;Student: People putting too
many bad chemicals into the water,

00:09:11.436 --> 00:09:14.496
and just letting it go down, so
it just sits and poisons the fish.

00:09:14.726 --> 00:09:18.476
And through biological magnification,
the Tiger Heron is then poisoned,

00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:19.526
because it eats the fish.

00:09:19.816 --> 00:09:22.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Some report their
findings from research trips

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:26.256
to threatened ecosystems
from Alaska and Mexico.

00:09:26.256 --> 00:09:29.356
Others focus on issues that have
become their personal passion.

00:09:29.466 --> 00:09:30.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Our recreational use.

00:09:31.466 --> 00:09:34.046
&gt;&gt;Student: There's actually
230 endangered species

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:36.006
that live in our national forests.

00:09:36.426 --> 00:09:39.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But all of their work
reflects the pride and confidence

00:09:39.576 --> 00:09:43.206
that comes from putting
knowledge into action.

00:09:43.246 --> 00:09:45.706
&gt;&gt;Student: Write to someone in
government, and tell them that,

00:09:45.706 --> 00:09:47.126
"I don't want you to
be logging our forests.

00:09:47.126 --> 00:09:48.476
We need to protect this resource."

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:50.236
Sign a petition.

00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:51.936
&gt;&gt;Amanda: If you look
around at this school,

00:09:51.936 --> 00:09:54.046
you'll see so many
confident people walking

00:09:54.046 --> 00:09:57.006
around with their heads held high,
and they know what they want.

00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:01.736
And they're getting the
support that they need.

00:10:04.736 --> 00:10:07.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For more
