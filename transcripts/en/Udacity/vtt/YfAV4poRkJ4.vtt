00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.652
A kind of Epigenetics that interests psychologists involves modifying DNA

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:09.870
without changing the sequence. Molecular tags known as Methyl Groups get

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.950
attached to the DNA and once tagged this can signal for a gene to be turned

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.790
off. Or silenced regardless of the actual sequence.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.877
&gt;&gt; So this is an example in mice that was done a while back and it demonstrates

00:00:23.877 --> 00:00:29.815
the power of the environment on your genes. Two genetically identical strings

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:34.036
of mice from different mothers turned out looking very different because their

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:39.664
respective mothers had very different diets. Now one pregnant mother was fed a

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:44.420
diet rich in nutrients for things like methyl groups. The other mother was fed

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.370
a diet lacking nutrients for these methyl groups. The mother who had a diet

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.660
rich in nutrients for methyl groups gave rise to offspring that were obese and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.398
had yellow fur. Whereas the mother that had a diet lacking these nutrients had

00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:04.834
normal offspring that were non obese with brown fur. Now the amazing thing

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:11.246
about both of these mice is that they're genetically identical. The mother who

00:01:11.246 --> 00:01:15.258
was fed one diet rich in nutrients presumably was able to regulate gene

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:21.352
expression in a certain way that gave obese mice with yellow fur. The other

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:24.892
mother was fed a different diet which was alternatively effect the gene

00:01:24.892 --> 00:01:30.260
expression and resulted in a brown furred, non obese mouse. So importantly,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.880
these two mice are genetically identical, but they turned out appearance wise

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.004
very different. We refer to these as having the same genotype. But a slightly

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:46.370
different epigenome, and a very different appearance or phenotype.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.709
&gt;&gt; So although this is yet to be shown in humans, it demonstrates that genes are

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.370
not our destiny. Their expression is influenced by what we do and get exposed

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.400
to from our environment. So let's go to this quiz.
