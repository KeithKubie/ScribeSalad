00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.802
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.710
GARETH CHICK: Thank you.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.020
Cultures of fear.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.320
We're not in a culture
of fear in this--

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.890
an incredible organization.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.160
Are we?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.270
Let me tell you a little story,
which might at first seem

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.010
irrelevant to Google.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:32.479
In 2010, the aircraft that was
taking the Polish president

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.700
from Warsaw to Minsk--

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.030
I don't know quite why he
was wanting to do that trip--

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.180
it crashed, killing 96 people
including the Polish president.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.020
And the air accident
investigation report

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.950
blamed the pilots for trying to
land a plane in extraordinarily

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.100
bad weather conditions,
dangerously bad weather

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.180
conditions.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.080
But they also placed blame
upon the Air Chief Marshal,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.900
and they placed blame
upon the president.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.190
Because the voice
recorder clearly

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.890
records one of the pilots at
a moment of decision saying,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.130
he'll get mad.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.630
If we don't land this
plane, he'll get mad.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.530
And the report found that
the presence of the Air Chief

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.590
Marshal on the cockpit
at the moment when they

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.200
had to decide whether to land
the plane or abort because

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.920
of bad weather placed
psychological pressure

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.430
on trained professionals to go
against everything they knew.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.550
What were they so afraid of?

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.260
He'll get mad.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.270
The president at the
back of the plane

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.750
might even have been blissfully
unaware that this conversation

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.700
was taking place.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.550
And yet his name
was taken in vain.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.950
What were they so afraid of?

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.430
Now, you might say,
well, you know,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.340
that's a weird example
to talk about here.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.930
We are in the corporate world.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.960
You know, that
wouldn't play out here.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.040
Even if I was slightly
concerned about what

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.760
my boss might say if I did
or didn't do something,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.030
nobody's going to die.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.790
I'm not going to kill 96 people
if I make a wrong decision.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.610
Well, maybe we'll come
back to that in a moment.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.440
In 40 years in the
corporate world,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.520
I came to realize that the
corporate world has the three

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.450
conditions for abuse
to be systemic.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.080
And it's interesting, isn't
it, that abuse is a very, very

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.315
topical dynamic at the moment.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.130
And quite rightly so.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.930
Those three conditions
are we give power

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.200
to people over other people.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.610
We certainly do that
in the corporate world.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.130
And I don't really mind
how benign your manager is

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.190
or how loving or caring
they are, particularly

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.410
as we come up to par for
evaluation, what they think

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.050
and the power that they have
over us is definitely a factor.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.540
The second condition is fear.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.760
Corporations are
organized in hierarchies,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.450
and there are a number of levels
even in this wonderful company.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.070
And it was the hierarchy and
the fear of the hierarchy that

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.980
actually crashed the plane.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.840
The hierarchy was sat
at the back oblivious,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.370
and yet his name
was taken in vain.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.530
And how guilty are we
sometimes of thinking,

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.959
well, I would do that, because
it seems like the right thing

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.329
to do.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.890
But I'm not sure how that would
play out with Mountain View

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.840
or whoever it is that
we have this sort

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.120
of disembodied fear of.

00:04:32.535 --> 00:04:34.035
And the third
condition is secrecy--

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.570
things that are behaviors
that are not witnessed.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.030
Now in this organization,
again, lots of stuff

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.030
is done out in the open.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.770
But even if it's
out in the open,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.100
even if some of those
aberrant behaviors, who's

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.800
going to call them out?

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.050
When was the last time
you were in a meeting

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.570
where it was really
clear that there were

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.180
some inappropriate
behaviors in the room,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.075
and not one person put their
hand up and said, please don't

00:05:13.075 --> 00:05:13.950
talk to me like that?

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:21.790
Hmmm, I wonder why we allow
these things to happen.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.570
Chris mentioned
that in the book,

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.950
I talk about two
characters in particular.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.620
One of those I
call a corporapath.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.280
This is a person with
power over other people.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.260
They're not psychopaths.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.900
They're not even sociopaths.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.530
See them at home with their
families, and they're loving,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.270
and they have empathy, and
they're beautiful human beings.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.750
Put them under
pressure at work--

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.350
maybe for some very
stretching objectives,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.970
or maybe even some
unreasonable expectations--

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.010
and suddenly the
empathy leaves the room.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.610
And they start treating
people like, well, certainly,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.740
not like people.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.580
And that's OK, because those
behaviors are normalized.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.180
And we go along with it, because
we're in the corporate world.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.350
That's how people behave.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.040
That'd be odd.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.730
I wouldn't behave
like that at home,

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.920
but that seems to be the way
that things work around here.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.360
And if you're going
to have corporapaths,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.945
you also need the followers.

00:06:34.945 --> 00:06:36.960
And that will be the rest of us.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.270
And we become corporate
hostages, trapped

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:50.980
by all the positives, trapped
by the benefits, the equity,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.570
even the fear of having
a limited amount of time

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.270
on the CV.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.820
If some of you have been
here for-- if you have tenure

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.290
of a number of years--

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.600
you may have gone
through a process where

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.422
you got to a stage
and thought, actually,

00:07:06.422 --> 00:07:07.880
it would be really
good for me to--

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.270
I really could do
something else.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.780
Oh, hang on a second.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.230
What's it going to look like
if I go to another employer,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.230
and they say, oh only
two years at Google?

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.830
What was your problem?

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.550
Because it clearly
couldn't be the company.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.700
And the more we
become the hostage

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.340
because we have to have a denial
about what is happening to us,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.200
we come to love our abuser in
the corporate form of Stockholm

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.590
syndrome where we come to
say that we love our work.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.090
And we do until the moment
when things catch up

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.220
with us a little bit.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.180
I've coached more than
200 senior executives,

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.550
and I can't tell you
the number of times

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.890
I've had a senior
executive unload

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:05.020
for about 20 minutes on the
stress, and the pressure,

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:11.260
and the anxiety, and then
tell me, I love my job.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.890
And I'm always thinking, OK.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.010
And then I think, no, I
absolutely understand.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.360
You have to tell yourself that.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.840
Because when you're in
it, you have to be in it.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.870
And when you know something
isn't quite right,

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.170
you can't know it.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.510
It's called denial-- one of the
most powerful forces in nature.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.090
I have been a corporapath,
particularly in my early days.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.520
I was extremely arrogant.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.260
And I had, you know, these sort
of the high read on insights,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.530
and the ENTJ, and hard driving--

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.570
all those qualities
that we still

00:08:53.570 --> 00:09:00.080
seem to prize the most
in corporations, drive--

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.040
that means aggression.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.980
We don't call it aggression--

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:10.840
pace-- well, impatience
is another word for that.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.330
Intellect, intellectual rigor.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.170
We haven't got just
to know our numbers.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.110
We've got to deeply,
deeply know our numbers.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:28.497
And so we enter the madness
that is the corporate world.

00:09:28.497 --> 00:09:31.080
But we collude with each other,
and we normalize all behaviors

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.970
and, you know, there's lots of
perks, and there's the food,

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.480
and there's the autonomy,
and there's the training.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.880
Lovely.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.480
But what I realized
was that actually there

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.560
is a unique anxiety disorder.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.600
And we are all suffering
a mild or maybe

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.900
a slightly advanced form of this
anxiety disorder, me included.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.320
You would have thought I
would've worked it out by now.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.840
And I call it CTSD, Corporate
Traumatic Stress Disorder.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.840
So you will know PTSD,
Post-traumatic Stress Disorder,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.920
arrived on scene probably
about 20 years ago.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.160
We know far more now
about what happens

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.880
to the human brain
and the human body

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.550
when we go through a trauma.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.240
But of course, in
PTSD, it is linked

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.830
with a single violent
event, either a warfare

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:38.220
or a violent event
in the street.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.360
Now, we know there's no
violence going on in this room.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.760
There's no violence
going on in this office.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.700
But the corporate
world has a low level

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.100
of persistent,
consistent anxiety--

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.150
small trauma almost every
minute of every day.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:05.610
What time in the morning do
you check your first emails?

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.080
If it's 6:00 or
6:30 in the morning,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.320
you can be checking your
emails, and you will already

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:21.750
be starting to run an unnatural
level of two stress chemicals,

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.165
adrenaline and cortisol.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.770
Put a human being
under pressure,

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.500
and we perceive a threat.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.060
And instantly, we get a
big spike in a chemical

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.670
called adrenaline,
which is designed

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.320
to pump the blood around our
body in a very different way.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.320
Unfortunately, it
takes that blood away

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.440
from the thinking
part of my brain--

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.880
the part that is calm
and rational and the part

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.860
of my brain that can attach
me to my moral center

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.170
and regulate my emotions.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.770
And, under pressure,
that part of my brain

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.830
shuts off, because if
I'm in survival mode,

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.810
I don't need that part
of my brain to survive.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.450
I need my animal
instincts to survive.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.370
Some of the blood goes
to my arms and my legs,

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.020
because I might need to
run away and have a fight--

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.380
and cortisol, a stress hormone.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.680
Now, adrenaline will clear
the system fairly quickly.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.280
Cortisol stays in the system
for quite a long time.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.350
And cortisol is that
wonderful chemical--

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.910
not available online.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:44.950
If you're in the street,
and you get a near miss--

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.070
taxi driver or
something-- and it's

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.930
that moment where you get
that frisson of stress.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:56.920
And cortisol gives us
an intensity of focus.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.065
It actually slows down time.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.240
Which is why, when
you're under pressure,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.170
and you ask one of your guys
one of those beautiful questions

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.480
that stops them in
their tracks and makes

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:16.750
them think for three seconds.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.780
If you've got cortisol
banging around your system,

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.490
three seconds will
feel like a lifetime.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.200
And it is highly likely that
you will be the very next person

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.218
to speak.

00:13:28.218 --> 00:13:29.260
Answer your own question.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.380
It's always much quicker.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.150
And since we rarely ask
a question to which we

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.430
don't know the answer,
because actually

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.900
we're not really curious.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.430
We like to manipulate people.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.800
And we'll come onto
that maybe in a moment.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.320
And when that part of
the brain shuts down--

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.040
so 100,000 years ago,
adrenaline, cortisol, survival.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.580
Brilliant.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.430
Needed them.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.760
You know, spear,
mammoth, whatever

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.840
it was that was coming at me.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.630
And maybe 100,000 years
ago, couple of times

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.450
a day, I might
have a five minute

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.980
spike in those chemicals.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.900
I wonder what we, in
the corporate world,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.350
I wonder what our levels
are like that we are not

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.590
biologically designed.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.010
So we are rewiring
without even knowing it.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.960
And actually what we're
doing is we are inflaming

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.555
our brain with the-- because
the stress, those chemicals,

00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:33.430
they are quite toxic.

00:14:36.267 --> 00:14:38.100
But it's very interesting
thing about brain,

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.690
the brain doesn't feel pain.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:44.670
So our brains can get inflamed,
and we have absolutely no idea.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.510
If any of you in this
room have suffered

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.000
what you might have
described as a burn out

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.980
or getting close to--

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.600
and I think there are many,
many moments when we get pretty

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.310
close to an edge-- and you know,
we might have a glass of wine,

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.566
or we might have a--

00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:07.110
and if we've been married,
or we have a same life

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.898
partner that we've had
for a number of years,

00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:11.940
they've got used to the
fact that we're all sick,

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.920
you know, the first
three days or holiday,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.440
or we actually just sleep.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.840
What are we doing to our bodies?

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.030
We don't even think about
it, because it's normal.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.030
It's what everybody does
in the corporate world,

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.240
and we get incredibly well-paid.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.680
And we can't leave.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.930
Well, maybe, you know when
my stock options are a bit,

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.950
you know, maybe.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:41.890
So, a few years
ago, a very wise guy

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:46.510
introduced us to the concept
of emotional intelligence.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.220
Brilliant.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.990
And Daniel Goleman.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:53.090
And he said, it's really simple.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.380
There is IQ, and
that's fantastic.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.630
But we've overdone that a bit.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.670
What we need is really EQ.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.300
An emotional intelligence
is that very, very human--

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.520
like a higher level--

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:13.960
very human ability to have a
real sense of self-awareness.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.930
Since I am aware
of how I am feeling

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:22.000
and how I'm likely to react, I
have a chance to self regulate.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.120
So even if I'm in a
bit of fight or flight

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.375
and what I really want to do
is scream at you or smack you,

00:16:28.375 --> 00:16:31.990
I know my emotional
intelligence can [EXHALING],,

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:37.530
and I can actually
regulate my responses.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.360
But here's the thing.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.850
When there is no blood
in my neocortex--

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.910
the largest part of our brain--

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.310
when there's no blood there,
emotional intelligence

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.470
doesn't do me any
good whatsoever,

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.950
because emotional intelligence
is only available to me

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.590
when I'm calm,
when I can actually

00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:00.150
engage that rational part of my
brain, when I can attach myself

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.840
to my moral center, when I can
understand the emotions that

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.190
are happening to me.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.099
If I'm in fight or
flight, then it's

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.529
just fear, terror,
petrification.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:19.170
So we need a different
type of intelligence

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:24.030
to navigate this mad
world that we live in.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:30.550
We need corporate
emotional intelligence.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.450
And if you read
the book, there's

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.220
some stuff around what
the four pillars are.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.140
I won't spoil that.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.405
If I had an hour, I'd
bang on about those,

00:17:43.405 --> 00:17:45.030
but I want to talk
about something else

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.180
before we finish.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:59.150
Now, 2019, here we are.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.240
We're in crisis.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.800
In fact, there was a crisis
just about wherever we look--

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.255
crisis of politics.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.020
I can't even bring
myself to talk about it.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.493
In the UK, you have
your gilet jeune.

00:18:16.493 --> 00:18:17.910
There's always
something going on.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.280
And the world, you
know is migration.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:25.280
The world is in crisis.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:31.030
In fact, when you think
about what we now know,

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.190
we've known it for a long time.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:37.480
And now we cannot
escape knowing it.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:42.100
Climate change we are just
about at the point where we

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.040
could stop the worst excesses--

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.930
just about.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.300
I don't see any
necessarily signs

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.810
that we as a human species
we're about to do that,

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.500
but now we know.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.310
Amazing people
still some tonight.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.170
We know we're
destroying the planet.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:03.250
We know now that there is
a mass extinction going on.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:12.130
Even just two or three weeks
ago, reports that around 60%

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:16.040
of insect species are
close to extinction.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:21.240
The insects go, we go
very quickly afterwards.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:27.310
The soil, we are
infecting the soil.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.980
The oceans, we're in trouble.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.380
And here we are in
our corporate world,

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:42.220
and we know these things,
but it feels too big.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.160
What can I do?

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.600
I'm one person.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.590
What can I do
about these things?

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.785
Well I'll draw you a parallel.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.100
You see, I'm not
anti-corporation.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.470
Corporation has provided
me with my livelihood,

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.170
and I'm very grateful.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.660
I am a grateful
corporate citizen.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.420
I'm not a socialist.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.360
I have no desire to
overthrow capitalism.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.860
But it is corporatism that
has created those things.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:21.700
It is the separation of
ownership from responsibility

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.300
that has created the damage
we are doing to our planet.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.260
And we are at a tipping point.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.090
And we have to recognize
that our behaviors

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.890
as corporate citizens
have to change.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.370
And even if we have things
like the Google Walk

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.400
Out for Real Change and then
maybe other ones to come--

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:50.680
even if we have those
things, fantastic movements--

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.020
are corporate leaders,
are business leaders,

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.800
and are political leaders
going to act in time?

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.440
Well, we can't wait.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.430
Now, again, you say,
well, what can I do?

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.140
I'm one person.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.150
Well I'm going to draw the
inextricable link for you

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:13.480
between how we behave with
each other in inhuman ways,

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.730
unnatural ways.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.730
Here we are in our
corporate world.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.130
And that for me is
the exact parallel

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.230
of what we are
doing to our planet.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.640
And we are detached from that.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.720
So, in your possession,
you may have

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:37.870
a t-shirt that was actually
made by a 9-year-old girl

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.470
in Bangladesh.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.340
If you had to purchase it
from that 9-year-old girl,

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.580
you might have
changed your behavior.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.650
But it's very easy and
we'll buy lots of them.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.040
We all have a mobile phone.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.230
Every single mobile phone
has got incredibly rare earth

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.120
precious metals.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.850
Some 12-year-old boy,
with a gun to his back,

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:09.130
mined those metals in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.540
We know this, but
we're still going

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.190
to go out and buy the
latest iPhone or the latest.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.190
We're so divorced
from what's going on.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.890
So here's what we need to do.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.240
Because I'm not going to ask
you to go and change the world,

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.890
that would be fatuous.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.790
I'm certainly not
going to do that.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:33.310
I'm far too old and far too
lazy to even attempt that.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.040
What I'm going to ask you
to do is to go and change

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.960
your piece of the world.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.270
Because if we actually
started treating each other

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:49.930
like human beings again,
the world would change.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:54.830
That is a complete act of faith,
that statement, on my part.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.820
But I passionately
believe that to be true.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.130
And it starts even
with some of the things

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:04.675
that Chris was talking
about, the way we actually

00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:07.713
not just talk to each other,
the way we engage emotionally

00:23:07.713 --> 00:23:08.380
with each other.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.790
How many meetings do you go to?

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.280
How many theses do
you jump on one after

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.810
back to back, where actually
you are not emotionally engaged

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.610
with the person that
you are talking to?

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.390
You are in this
ludicrous transaction.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.830
But you know the crazy
thing is that's my phone.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.330
They obviously run
off pretty quick.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:32.372
I know what they've done.

00:23:32.372 --> 00:23:34.550
They thought, oh my god,
he's somewhere else.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:35.780
This is going to cost
me a lot of money.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.100
I'll put the phone
down immediately.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.100
So that's what happened.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.090
How we treat each other.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:47.810
When you ask
somebody a question,

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.350
do you actually want
to know the answer,

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.470
or are you trying to tell
them what the right answer is?

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.330
Do you really want
to listen to them

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.000
or does that just take too
long, and if, you know,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.710
they got to the point.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.190
These are the small
areas that really

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.230
make a difference for us.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:11.620
We are the first
generation that knows

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.540
we are destroying this planet.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.060
We're the first generation
that knows that.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.830
And we are the last generation
that can actually do anything

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.080
about it just about.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.430
Now, we have, thankfully--
so my kids are in their 30s.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:35.990
So we have Gen X,
Gen Y, millennials.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:44.260
I think I'm Gen A. And
thankfully, they think and feel

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.960
differently to my generation.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.830
Thank God that they do.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:57.620
But millennials are not great
at governing themselves.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.200
What they need is they
need some leadership.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.530
They need some coaching.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.950
And the wonderful thing about
coaching-- and of course,

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:11.030
I'm going to finish on a
passionate plea for you to be

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.210
better coaches--

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.550
the wonderful thing
about that is, even

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.090
in a moment where it's really
clear that the person that you

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.480
are engaging with has got
very high levels of adrenaline

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.760
and very high
levels of cortisol--

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.760
in which case, they are not
available to think rationally--

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.680
there's no point having
a fight with them.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.350
There's no point dismissing
them or taking it back off them

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.320
and doing it yourself.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.930
That's just going to
embed those behaviors.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:48.490
But one carefully chosen
curious open question,

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.640
and they have to
engage and they have

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.080
to start putting some blood back
in this beautiful neocortex.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.660
And the moment the blood
is back in the neocortex,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.450
they become human again.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:04.540
They are available
to engage with us

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.080
in a mission of curiosity.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.770
When we're under pressure, our
default mode is impatience.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:20.920
Our default mode is judgment,
because I mean fight or flight,

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.000
and you are the
cause of my threat.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.500
That's not going
to get us anywhere.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.875
Well, actually
where that gets us

00:26:27.875 --> 00:26:31.837
is over oceans choked with
plastic and all the nonsense.

00:26:31.837 --> 00:26:32.920
That's where that gets us.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.390
When we start to engage
with each other, when

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:45.860
we turn our default mode from
impatience into curiosity,

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.490
the most attractive
of human qualities.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:58.130
When we turn our default mode
of judgment into compassion,

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:02.050
then we will start changing
our part of the world.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.780
You see, I don't want
you to go out and rebel

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.410
against your company and
go out on the streets

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:11.486
and say, you know, our leaders
have got to listen to us, and--

00:27:11.486 --> 00:27:14.260
all right, you can.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.708
There's always a
cool thing to do.

00:27:16.708 --> 00:27:19.000
What I do want you to do is
I want you to go and change

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.980
your part of your world.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.580
And I want you to have a
little bit more courage,

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.260
because you know, there are
things around you at the moment

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:30.760
that you are not doing that you
know that you probably should.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:36.280
And for fear of a
consequence, a judgment,

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:41.560
we are so scared of what
people will think of us.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.830
The threat to our
egos these days

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:49.720
feels way bigger than any
mortal or physical threat

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.430
that we may have
faced in the past.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:56.560
And my brain cannot tell the
difference between a threat

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.110
to my physical being
and a threat to my ego.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.240
It just knows its threat.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:09.360
So go back and change
your part of the world.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:15.230
I was really
fortunate 34 years ago

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.890
to learn a
transformational lesson,

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.790
because I was absolutely a
controller and a manipulator.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.980
And I was really good at it.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.770
And I probably could have
stayed and maybe for a few years

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.090
before I got found out.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:35.150
And I learned the lesson
of changing my default mode

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:39.620
from impatience to curiosity.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:45.110
And I practiced
having a default mode.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.730
If somebody brought me a
piece of bad news or somebody

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.410
frustrated me
because I hadn't done

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.990
what they were supposed
to do or whatever it was,

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.920
I learned to smile.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.430
I learned to see that there
was a beautiful flawed genius

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.070
of a human being who
was actually in pain.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.790
And people, they won't tell
you the truth in that space.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.220
I could get anybody to
say yes in that space.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.600
It doesn't mean that
it's going to get done.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.930
But just having a
moment of compassion

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:22.040
and being curious,
suddenly, in seconds,

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.310
we have that human
connection back.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:26.640
Now we can do something
about changing

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.100
the way the world works.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.730
So good.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:36.860
I think it's time for some of
those fantastically beautifully

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:41.600
crafted open questions.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much
for this enlightening talk.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:50.690
I think that many of the
things that you told us--

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:52.910
our kind, I mean we know that.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.860
If we think about
it, we know that.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.610
GARETH CHICK: Yes.

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.250
AUDIENCE: But at the same time,
there is a process or something

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.740
that happened into our
mind that say my mind--

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.860
just to make an example--

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.790
that prevents us from
staying in listening mode,

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:12.410
from staying curious
instead of being impatient.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:16.080
So according to you,
what is a human being,

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.890
the element that
not does not allow

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:24.200
people that knows and want to
be open and in listening mode

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.190
to be there?

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.000
Is it fear?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.750
GARETH CHICK: Yes.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.520
You're right.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.130
Good.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.880
So the first thing
is to recognize it.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.640
Hang on a second.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.370
What is it that I
am feeling anxious?

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.130
What am I afraid
of at the moment?

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.650
Because in that moment, if you
ask yourself that question,

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:44.030
you will know exactly.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.390
And then you have a choice.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:50.872
Do I confront the fear,
or do I go with the fear?

00:30:50.872 --> 00:30:52.580
The crazy thing about
the corporate world

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.170
is that there is so
much fear around,

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.000
and there doesn't need to be.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.950
So I've coached so many execs
so, many leaders and managers,

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.115
who've said to me, well my boss
would never let me do that.

00:31:04.115 --> 00:31:05.990
Or I've got a meeting
coming up with my boss,

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:09.940
and I think they're
going to say this.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.945
On what evidence?

00:31:11.945 --> 00:31:13.820
And they go and they
have a fantastic meeting

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:14.990
with their boss.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:16.710
And I guess that
was a real surprise.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.385
And it still doesn't
seem to stop them.

00:31:18.385 --> 00:31:19.760
You know, when do
we actually get

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:24.780
to trust when our
boss says to us--

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:29.470
psychological safety-- please,
you know, take some risks.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.220
Go can break a few
things you know.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:38.100
And we think, yeah, ooohh, yeah,
but not sure they meant it.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:43.760
That is exactly the
same as he'll get mad.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.230
Exactly the same.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:50.420
So notice what you're
fearful of and take courage.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:55.640
And, if every single person
just went out this afternoon

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.030
and did one thing
that involved them

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:00.677
with a little bit
of courage, what's

00:32:00.677 --> 00:32:01.760
the worst that can happen?

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.013
Somebody gets a bit
miffed with you.

00:32:04.013 --> 00:32:05.430
Is that the worst
that can happen?

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.580
Nobody is going to die.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.190
Your rating is not going
to suddenly plummet.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.700
It feels like that sometimes.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.630
Yes.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:16.880
AUDIENCE: I'll have to read
the book for the pillars,

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.740
but in short, what advise
would you give to a colleague

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.160
or family member that's stuck
in a situation where [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.480
path, and it's--

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.547
GARETH CHICK: Yeah?

00:32:30.547 --> 00:32:32.630
SPEAKER 2: --rendering
their life quite miserable.

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:33.830
GARETH CHICK: Yes.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.930
SPEAKER 2: From a management
to manager standpoint

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.480
or from an infusion
standpoint, what would you

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.570
recommend that they do?

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:39.955
GARETH CHICK: OK.

00:32:39.955 --> 00:32:41.860
SPEAKER 2: --because
they can't quit the job.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.435
So that's more of a
long term solution.

00:32:44.435 --> 00:32:45.560
GARETH CHICK: That's right.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.970
Well, so notice actually this
is, in a sense, almost exactly

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.700
the same advice that you
would give to somebody

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.870
who was in a domestic
violence situation, somebody

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.130
who is being held hostage--

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.750
extreme language I know--

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.550
but the advice is the same.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:07.460
Because if you want to salvage
your health and your mental

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.240
well-being--

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.120
60% of people suffer some sort
of mental illness or episode

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:14.870
at work--

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:18.840
60%-- but here's the choice.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:24.710
You either have to leave,
or you have to overthrow.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.900
Whistleblowing is really rea--

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.820
I don't know that many
whistleblowers that are,

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.230
you know, glad they did it--

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.910
but it is an option.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.940
Or you have to endure.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.160
But if you're going
to endure, you

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.248
have to turn it into a positive.

00:33:42.248 --> 00:33:43.790
So the way to turn
it into a positive

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.590
is, OK, I'm working
for a corporapath.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.260
It's very unpleasant.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.400
I'm not dying.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.970
What am I learning here, and
for how long will I do this?

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.850
Because anybody can
put up with anything

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.420
for a short period of time.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:58.970
OK.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.620
I will do this for
another six months,

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.550
and then I will see where
I am and make a decision.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:07.010
See, you have to
help that person,

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.710
because leaving
probably, you know--

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:13.219
I mean at some point,
health has to come before.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:16.610
If it's a partner,
then one of the things

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.520
is they don't want
to let you down.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.777
If they were on their own,
they'd probably leave.

00:34:22.777 --> 00:34:24.110
But they don't want to let down.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:27.860
How many of you feel
obligated to carry

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:32.239
on earning what you are earning
maybe if your partner is either

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.530
at home and not
earning or has a--

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:39.290
yeah-- oh, the stories,
the fear that we

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:42.710
have of going into the unknown.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:45.630
Wow.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.449
We have to make a
positive choice.

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:49.870
Yeah.

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:52.620
AUDIENCE: I wonder-- so the
most things that you described

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.360
are on an individual
level, and we all

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.930
know that the only thing we
can change is ourselves first.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.860
But what could you do on
a more corporate level?

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.940
I mean, what could we do to
create organizations that

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.630
do not enforce those behaviors?

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:14.830
GARETH CHICK: So I really don't
want to be a harbinger of doom,

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:21.910
but so many things have been
tried over so many years.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:30.020
And corporatism has the most
beautiful survival instinct.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:35.740
So governments will change
legislation and say,

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.440
we'll regulate, and this
will bring the corporations

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.370
into line.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:43.510
And then armies-- anybody in
here a lawyer or an accountant

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:48.370
or married to a
lawyer or accountant?

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:49.120
Ah, what the hell?

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.060
I'll take the risk.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:55.520
The parasites who feed
off will just create,

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.040
because the
corporation will say,

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.045
well you know, if
we're regulated,

00:36:00.045 --> 00:36:05.600
that will cost us $15
million, or if we're regulated

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.790
or we might be fined.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:10.900
I mean, organizations
getting fined?

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.350
My word.

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:15.620
So it's worth paying
half a million euros

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.690
to get some legal and
accounting advice,

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.190
and we'll get around it.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.010
Every single thing, every
single regulation, people

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:23.420
can get around.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.880
Now, at some point, because
we're at a tipping point,

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.780
there may be a movement.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:34.670
There may be a revolution
of some kind maybe,

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:39.630
but there's nothing that we as
individuals can do about that.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.890
We can go on streets,
put on a yellow vest

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:46.850
or whatever the-- we
can do those things.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:50.635
But we can change our
piece of the world.

00:36:50.635 --> 00:36:51.400
We can.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:55.840
We can say, I'm not
going to do things

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.420
that I know that don't
feel right to me.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.220
I'm not going to
do them anymore.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.570
And the amazing thing
is that probably

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.130
will get positive
feedback when we

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:12.370
actually-- because our bosses
want us to be free of fear.

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.630
The crazy thing is--

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:17.440
I mean, I understand working
for an intimidating boss

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.370
when you anticipate an angry
reaction, that's a horrible,

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:24.730
and that is abusive.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.550
But it's even more
intimidating to work for a boss

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:33.130
that you love and see a look of
disappointment in their eyes.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.320
Oh my God, I can't have that.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.030
I can't dis--- yeah.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:41.000
And so we put a fear
around ourselves.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.440
The only thing we can
do is ask ourselves,

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:47.080
what's one thing I could
do this afternoon that

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.720
would be more
integral, that would

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.660
be more attached to my moral,
that would be more courageous

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.160
of me?

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.390
Go do it.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:38:00.120
And the world would do
what it's going to do.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.740
Don't think we should sound
fatalistic and yet I have.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.585
We have time for, oh, yes
just two or three more.

00:38:06.585 --> 00:38:07.396
Yeah.

00:38:07.396 --> 00:38:09.740
AUDIENCE: So can you tell
us more about the turning

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:13.370
point from a corporate path
to a compassionate person?

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:18.210
Is that someone else bringing
it to your attention?

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.960
GARETH CHICK: It was a
very interesting moment.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:28.130
So I was 29, and I was a CFO
of a public company in the UK.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.620
And I'd been a CFO for
public since I was 25--

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.637
the youngest youngest ever.

00:38:32.637 --> 00:38:34.970
I was the youngest ever this
and the youngest ever that.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.650
And I was married.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:38.070
I had two children.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.500
I had a four bedroom house.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:44.390
I mean, I was the
archetypal career driven--

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:47.180
I was a nightmare, really.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.470
I was.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:50.900
And my boss-- chief
exec at the time,

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.060
he was brilliant-- he
took me to one side

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.410
and gave me some
really tough feedback.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:39:03.690
And he said, you're good,
but you are about to fail.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.440
I'm going to send you
on a leadership course.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:11.320
I cannot tell you how
cynical I was when I--

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.820
It is part of the reason I do
the trainings and these moves.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.010
It's the part of the reason
I do the training now,

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.350
because I know what
it's like, and I

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:21.290
know how I was sitting in
training, thinking, come on,

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:24.170
yeah, I know all this, or
you don't know how busy I am.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:25.280
I would do all of that.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.100
He sent me on this course,
and I behaved very badly

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.470
on the first morning.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:33.980
I was cynical, and I was surly,
and I was looking at my watch,

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.663
and yeah, yeah, and we didn't
have email in those days.

00:39:36.663 --> 00:39:38.330
But I would have been
the one constantly

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.590
checking the phone, not
really engaged, and saying,

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:41.930
oh just, you know,
I'm really sorry,

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:43.690
but I've got to jump on
a call for half an hour.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:45.430
I'll come back, and
then it's an hour.

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.150
I would that would
have been that person.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:49.080
My instructor,
Walter Blackburn--

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.250
he's acknowledged in
the front of the book--

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:55.910
and he saw this, and
he took me to one side.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:58.310
He metaphorically stuck
his hand under my chin

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:03.640
and put me up against the wall
and said, you need to grow up,

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.310
or you need to go.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:09.360
But if you're going to stay
here, you need to get involved.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.040
I don't think anybody really
spoken to me like that before.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.460
He knew what he was doing.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:18.200
He knew how to do that
with me in a way that

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.520
would win my respect.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.940
That was a turning point,
because I threw myself in.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.310
And the reason I had
this crazy, you know,

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:29.300
full time CEO whatever and
part-time leadership trainer is

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:33.490
partly why my first marriage
didn't last that long-- well,

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.380
and I was a bit of an asshole--

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:42.200
that is why then I asked to go
and learn how to train others

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.310
with that course.

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:47.180
I became evangelistic
about coaching.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.300
It really taught me some
emotional intelligence,

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.710
and it taught me how to coach.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:55.820
It taught me that beautiful
transformational moment

00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:00.410
as a coach, when you
can have a person--

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:05.780
you can release all of that
potential, and ingenuity,

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.960
and humanity they
have, and they will

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.570
perform to an even higher
level, because that's

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:12.760
what they want to do.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.260
Yeah.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.530
It was transformational.

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:17.840
AUDIENCE: You talk
about people with drive.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.010
And you said, it's aggression.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:20.760
GARETH CHICK: Yes.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.360
AUDIENCE: Sound like
kind of picturing them

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.470
in a negative way.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.970
If we were--

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:25.803
GARETH CHICK: I was.

00:41:25.803 --> 00:41:29.690
AUDIENCE: --all more
human as you suggest,

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:32.500
do you think the corporations
would be more efficient or less

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.000
efficient?

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.720
GARETH CHICK: Absolutely
more efficient.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.510
I've had some
interesting conversations

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:41.870
with some senior Google leaders
about psychological safety,

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:43.730
for example.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.010
And every one of them says our
psychological safety really,

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.460
really important.

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.420
And when I asked
them to describe

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:55.340
what behaviors they
exhibit to actively create

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.320
psychological
safety, they struggle

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.860
to tell me those things.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.982
They make it sound really
great, but it goes on

00:42:03.982 --> 00:42:04.940
for about five minutes.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.760
And I have really no
idea what they've said,

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.700
because they haven't really
answered the question.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.270
And then I say how
do you measure it?

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.770
And they say, well, we have
this Google guy stand, you know,

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:16.440
whatever.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:16.940
OK.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.270
Which questions actually show me
that you have a psychologically

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:22.505
safe workforce?

00:42:22.505 --> 00:42:23.240
Ah, Well.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:29.570
So the reality is that
when we're on-- listen.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:34.430
You've got some fabulous
leaders, fabulous leaders,

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:36.200
some of the best in the world.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.730
But they are also human, and
therefore, under pressure, they

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:44.840
can flirt with some of those
corporapathic behaviors.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.580
And here's the issue.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.600
Under pressure, some
of those leaders

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.840
are found out occasionally,
because here's

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.870
what I think internally.

00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:05.120
It's coming up to the end
of Q1, we're short of quota.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:11.510
If I make people feel too safe,
then they'll go a bit soft.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:13.000
They will breathe
a sigh of relief.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.870
They will realize that
they're quite tired,

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:16.670
and that's my quota gone.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:21.770
So actually I can't have
people feeling too safe.

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:23.400
I don't want you
to feel threatened.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.990
I don't want them
to feel fearful.

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:28.550
Well, you can't have one or the
other, because you hold power.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:34.820
If I hold power, I don't need to
do anything to intimidate you,

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.320
because I have power.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.150
I have to massively
over index on that.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.960
So there are countless
examples I could give you

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.040
of where true psychological
safety delivers

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.240
phenomenal results, because
people, when they feel safe,

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.160
they get incredibly creative.

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.980
You don't hire dullards.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:59.240
You hire brilliantly
well-qualified people.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.170
All they want to do
is do fabulous work.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:04.790
That's all they want to do.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:06.470
Leave them to
their own devices--

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:08.210
bit of governance,
bit of coaching--

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.310
just wear them what we have
to do for the millennials--

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:13.110
and they will fly.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:15.242
We haven't begun to
see what people can do.

00:44:15.242 --> 00:44:17.700
Now, it's crazy thing to say--
and this organization that's

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.160
only 20 years old, there's
now 100,000 of you,

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.180
and you make $5 billion
every 10 minute.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.780
I understand that.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:29.310
But actually how long
will that continue?

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.290
You've got competitors
taking share of you

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.102
right, left, and center.

00:44:34.102 --> 00:44:36.920
I wonder.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.420
Thank you.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:37.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.070
Thank you Chris.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:40.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
