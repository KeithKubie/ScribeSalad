app with the Maps API but we have a
 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.229
app with the Maps API but we have a
whole slew of them and we all based this

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239
whole slew of them and we all based this
 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.479
whole slew of them and we all based this
on one common framework which we

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489
on one common framework which we
 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.250

using google api so we're using the same

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490
using google api so we're using the same
 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.690
using google api so we're using the same
environment same so if you if you go I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700
environment same so if you if you go I
 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.380
environment same so if you if you go I
mean yes as if you guys are documented

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390
mean yes as if you guys are documented
 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.630
mean yes as if you guys are documented
automatically and you have an API

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640
automatically and you have an API
 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.510

Explorer tool for rural api's as well as

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520
Explorer tool for rural api's as well as
 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.240
Explorer tool for rural api's as well as
for your own IP I that you want to push

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250
for your own IP I that you want to push
 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.870
for your own IP I that you want to push
so the other part is security so how do

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880
so the other part is security so how do
 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.450
so the other part is security so how do
you deal with ladder it is also a big

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460
you deal with ladder it is also a big
 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.600
you deal with ladder it is also a big
deal at Google I think it is it's

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610
deal at Google I think it is it's
 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.990
deal at Google I think it is it's
complicated to set up client library to

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000
complicated to set up client library to
 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.930
complicated to set up client library to
use the security using oh but we do it

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940
use the security using oh but we do it
 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.860
use the security using oh but we do it
and if you know how to read for for

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
and if you know how to read for for
 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.050

example accessing your calendar yeah

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060
example accessing your calendar yeah
 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.660
example accessing your calendar yeah
google api is for calendar you you are

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670
google api is for calendar you you are
 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.180
google api is for calendar you you are
using the same mechanism that we provide

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190
using the same mechanism that we provide
 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.220
using the same mechanism that we provide
for your application as well so

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230
for your application as well so
 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.590
for your application as well so
obviously your business OG can be fully

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600
obviously your business OG can be fully
 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.210
obviously your business OG can be fully
secure you can restrict for client IDs

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220
secure you can restrict for client IDs
 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.430
secure you can restrict for client IDs
for example so maybe not everybody in

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440
for example so maybe not everybody in
 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.080
for example so maybe not everybody in
the world can access your api because

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090
the world can access your api because
 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.210
the world can access your api because
you want to restrict maybe only for

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220
you want to restrict maybe only for
 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.850
you want to restrict maybe only for
android your Android application right

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860
android your Android application right
 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.850
android your Android application right
so we have all those layers of its

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860
so we have all those layers of its
 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.040
so we have all those layers of its
really an environment where your API

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050
really an environment where your API
 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.470
really an environment where your API
these fully managed you know n scales of

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480
these fully managed you know n scales of
 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.650
these fully managed you know n scales of

have any of that you could you could run
 

00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:18.029
have any of that you could you could run
so what if I have an application that

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039
so what if I have an application that
 

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.100
so what if I have an application that
runs on App Engine and i love the auto

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.110

aspect of App Engine but I have this

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:24.460
aspect of App Engine but I have this
 

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.749
aspect of App Engine but I have this
little piece of native code which I

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759
little piece of native code which I
 

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:29.760

have front and back ends and that is

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.300
