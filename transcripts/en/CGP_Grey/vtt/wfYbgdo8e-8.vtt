00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.780
Your brain is two brains.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.340
Two hemispheres each doing half the work of being you.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.980
Half your vision goes to each and half your movement directed by each.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.120
Right controls left

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.120
and left controls right.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.500
Your two brains co-ordinate through a wire of nerves, but

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.120
this wire can be cut, and was, for a time, used as an epilepsy treatment.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.920
After the cut, people seemed the same, though their brain was split in-twain.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.680
Except, some post-split patients described that while selecting their morning outfit with

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.660
right hand, left might come along to disagree.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.220
Actually, left hand might quite often disagree, which these split-brain patients found frustrating.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.260
What's happening?

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.180
To investigate, remember, right brain sees and controls one half, while

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.560
left brain controls and sees the other.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.560
But only left brain can speak.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.320
"Hello."

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.120
Because that's where the speech center is located.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.340
Right brain, without this, is mute.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.640
In normal brains, this doesn't matter because each half communicates across the wire with the other.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.060
But, split-brains can't, and thus, you can show just the right brain a word, ask the person:

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.020
"What did you see?",

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.500
and you'll hear: "Nothing."

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.940
Because, left speaking brain saw nothing.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.440
Meanwhile, right brain will use its hand to pick the object out of a pile hidden from left brain.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.520
This is deeply creepy.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.680
Ask "Why are you holding the object?" and speaking left brain will make up a

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.080
plausible sounding, but totally wrong, reason.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.000
"I always wanted to learn how to solve one of these."

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.500
Left brain isn't lying; it's just doing what brains do:

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.980
creating a story that explains its past actions to its current self, a behavior which does rather cast doubt

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.100
onto the notion of free will (but that's a story for another time).

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.940
Creating reasons for why it does things is just something

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.960
left brains do.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.220
It happens in normal, healthy humans all the time, and if you think about it closely, you

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.160
know you've done this.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.100
Back to experiments.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.020
Give right brain an object, ask the person "What's in your hand?" and they won't be able to say.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.940
"I'm not holding anything."

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.320
And, when asked to draw, a split-brain can draw two separate objects

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.120
simultaneously, with each hand, in a way unsplit-brains find challenging.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.640
These experiments on split-brain patients are deeply unsettling

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.820
because they really point in the direction of a mute separate... intelligence...

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.940
Something...

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.500
Living in the skull.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.940
You can even ask questions of a split-brain and get disagreement on the answer.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.800
So, if your brain is split, who is the 'you' in this situation?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.220
From the outside, it's tempting to think of the part of the brain that's speaking as the person, but

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.940
something is hearing and answering questions.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.500
And, though right brain can't speak, it does understand faces, which left brain can't.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.300
If this is you, you don't know who your friends and family  are in a crowd.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.040
This act of cutting exposes two minds in one head, and the talking mind

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.240
doesn't know there's someone else in the house.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.600
The left brain can describe the situation it's in, but nonetheless will constantly be surprised by

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.000
right brain's actions and explain them away.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.180
There's a question to be asked here:

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.480
Why, after separation, does right brain not totally freak out, but instead plays

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.580
along helpfully, answering questions, and listening to left-brain's dumb stories about what's happening.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.640
- It's the best pony... I don't know.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.780
- Speculation time...

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.400
But, one answer is the cutting doesn't make right brain a separate... intelligence... consciousness... person?

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.480
but rather it has always been. In normal people, perhaps right brain rose up as a companion without a choice.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.740
Feeling at first somewhat equal partners, but then, as speech develops that it can't participate in, that

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.900
increasingly becomes the central point of life, it resigns to mutely co-ordinate with left brain.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.900
At this moment, in your normal head, there are two of you watching this video:

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.060
one having a 'mind = blown' moment, and the other mentally rolling its eye at the obviousness of it all.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.140
In split-brains, right doesn't freak out because not a whole lot has really changed.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.200
You might not agree, and maybe arguing right now at why it can't be possible, exactly as we would expect

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.880
talking left brain to do.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.620
Speculation aside, split-brain patients show, at the very least, that in the mind, there is a separate...

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.100
something that can hear and understand and respond, given the right circumstances.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.160
Your brain isn't entirely yours.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.480
Who is you?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.120
You is two.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.460
[soft music]

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.980
[Grey's voice morphing into Kurzgesagt's voice] But we can go deeper.  You are many.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.400
[Kurzgesagt's voice] The pile of meat that's your body is made up of trillions of tiny individuals that have a life of their own.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.640
[Kurzgesagt's voice] So, at which point do the many become one?

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.680
[Kurzgesagt's voice] What makes lots of tiny things you?

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.540
[Grey's voice] Seriously. If you haven't checked out Kurzgesagt, then you don't know what you're missing.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.320
Kurgaset?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.680
Kurtzgaset?

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.700
I never know.
