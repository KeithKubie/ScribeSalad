TRACE DOMINGUEZ: Hey guys
Trace here for Secret Trips.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.000
We're at the
Farnborough Air Show

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.270
where they've been N the newest
in plane technology all week.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.790
But without the
legacy of aircraft,

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.760
the legacy of aerospace,
we wouldn't be out there.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.867
So we need to remember
these old planes

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:16.950
and how cool they are too.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.570
In order to respect
the power and ingenuity

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.300
of modern-day aircraft,
you have to look

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.830
to the past, the early
pioneering flying

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.600
machines of cloth and
wood, the sleek metal

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.800
planes that pushed the limits
of where humans can venture.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.826
The failures, the successes--
each one an important piece

00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:40.200
of the puzzle that
has brought us

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.800
to where we are today, which
is why many have worked

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.040
to preserve these airplanes--
like Tracey Curtis Taylor who

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.160
restored and flies a
classic Boeing-Stearman.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.780
She took me on a
tour of her airplane

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.370
and gave me a little
insight on why

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.830
vintage planes, like her Spirit
of Artemis, are so special.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.820
There must be just
something about these planes

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.690
versus-- we're at Farnborough.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.240
So there's new
planes everywhere,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.390
and they're showing off
the newest technology.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.166
But, it just feels
different, I imagine,

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.290
to fly something like this.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.998
TRACEY CURTIS TAYLOR:
Well, actually it's

00:01:10.998 --> 00:01:13.716
chalk and cheese with the
original pioneering flying.

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:15.840
But what you're seeing here
is a handmade airplane.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.060
This is a wood and
fabric old biplane.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.730
And it's just classic
1920s technology.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.770
Everybody calls
this real flying.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.220
So, again, to take
an airplane like this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.040
around the world flying the
rivers, the lakes, the shore

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.340
lines, at low level, this
is probably the best flying

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.310
adventure in the world.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.268
And it's very rare now.

00:01:34.268 --> 00:01:36.199
This is a bit of a dying art.

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:38.240
TRACE DOMINGUEZ: And that
may be the perfect word

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.980
to describe these
planes, art-- the way

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.840
they're shaped, the way they
fly, the way they sound.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.130
But it's also more than that.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.630
It's about what these
restored airplanes represent

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.897
and their place in history.

00:01:48.897 --> 00:01:50.730
Obviously you're very
passionate about this.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.090
So when you bring
a plane like this

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.370
out to a show like this,
what's the thinking?

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.340
What are you trying to
do by bringing it here?

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.160
TRACEY CURTIS
TAYLOR: Well, I think

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.640
it's rather lovely, because
it's this juxtaposition

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.265
of old and new.

00:02:03.265 --> 00:02:05.270
And I think this
generation needs

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.875
to be reminded that civil
aviation was based, really,

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:13.180
on people like me getting
into wooden fabric airplanes.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.455
These pioneers back
in the 20s and 30s,

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:19.335
these were daring, dashing,
very brilliant individuals who

00:02:19.335 --> 00:02:20.990
were really pushing
the boundaries,

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.500
taking enormous personal risks,
but out there to prove it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.190
could be done.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.490
And these were the early days.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.653
This is when aviation
was very new, very fresh.

00:02:29.653 --> 00:02:33.930
And the whole world was
just fascinated and thrilled

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.084
by the idea of flight.

00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:45.330
TRACE DOMINGUEZ: Walking
around the Farnborough airshow,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.180
it's clear the world is
still fascinated by flight.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.040
And, yes, it is
partly the excitement

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.010
of seeing a jet fly by
at unfathomable speeds,

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.520
to look at the newest,
biggest, and fastest,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.340
to think about the
next step in aerospace.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.500
But the past will continue
to be an important part

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.540
of the present.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.180
Vintage planes
will continue to be

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.540
salvaged, restored, remembered,
presented, and, of course,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.230
flown.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.420
And in Tracy's mind, flying
them should be a requirement.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.878
TRACEY CURTIS
TAYLOR: I'd just like

00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:15.800
to see an element of training
where people, the students,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.510
the pilots of the future
still get a chance

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.705
to fly airplanes like this.

00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:22.630
But I have young students coming
and looking at the cockpit

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.120
here and just saying, we
don't know how you fly this.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.536
TRACE DOMINGUEZ: And I think
keeping them around like this

00:03:27.536 --> 00:03:29.720
and getting people to be
able to come and see them

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.680
is probably part of that, right.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.660
TRACEY CURTIS TAYLOR: Oh,
it's really important.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.620
TRACE DOMINGUEZ:
And with that, Tracy

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.170
took me on a tour of her
historic Boeing-Stearman,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.100
a one-time military
training plane that

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.910
retired as a crop duster before
taking Tracy across continents

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.411
and oceans.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.285
TRACEY CURTIS TAYLOR:
This is a 1942 Lycoming

00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:45.950
engine, 300-horsepower.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.130
It's got a variable
pitch propeller,

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.380
so I can change the angle
of the propeller blades--

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.150
TRACE DOMINGUEZ: Oh, wow.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.566
TRACEY CURTIS TAYLOR: --for
when I'm climbing or cruising.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.730
The fuel is all up
in the top wing.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.327
But I've had extra fuel tanks
put in, so on either side

00:03:58.327 --> 00:03:59.701
there are fill-up
tanks, and I've

00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:01.944
got about six hours
endurance here.

00:04:01.944 --> 00:04:03.020
This is wood and fabric.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.849
There's four different
types of wood

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.390
used in the construction
of the wing.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.470
And all the ribbing
and stitching,

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.810
they're all hand-stitched.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.720
TRACE DOMINGUEZ: Yeah,
you can see that.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.320
TRACEY CURTIS TAYLOR: So
there's hundreds of man-hours

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.630
that have gone into the
making of this airplane.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.130
The undercarriage-- this is a
real tractor of an airplane.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.040
This is what makes
it just so versatile.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.568
All these tensioning
in the wires

00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:23.701
they should all strike
a different note.

00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:25.200
TRACE DOMINGUEZ:
Oh, wow, so you can

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.260
hear them and know whether--

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.566
TRACEY CURTIS
TAYLOR: Yeah, I do.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:26.720
Yeah, I do.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.761
TRACE DOMINGUEZ: --or not
they're the right type.

00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:29.612
Can I pluck this?

00:04:29.612 --> 00:04:31.001
[PLUCKING]

00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:32.100
Oh, that's great.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.930
I'm just impressed by
how much engineering

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.929
goes into building something
that then comes out

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:37.950
to be just such a simple,
beautiful machine.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.700
TRACEY CURTIS TAYLOR:
That's the old bird.

00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:45.550
TRACE DOMINGUEZ: Planes
like the Spirit of Artemis

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.133
are important.

00:04:46.133 --> 00:04:49.146
They are a snapshot to the
past and an inspiration

00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:49.770
for the future.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:50.105
TRACEY CURTIS
TAYLOR: And they're

00:04:50.105 --> 00:04:51.658
just so beautiful to look at.

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:55.406
People just get so enthused
by the romance and adventure

00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:55.906
of it.

00:04:55.906 --> 00:04:57.330
TRACE DOMINGUEZ:
I'm there, for sure.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.455
TRACEY CURTIS TAYLOR: I
wouldn't buy anything else.

00:05:09.636 --> 00:05:11.260
TRACE DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you for watching

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.130
and make sure to
