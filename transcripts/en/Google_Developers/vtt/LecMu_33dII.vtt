00:00:06.142 --> 00:00:08.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: Today I'm
meeting with Fatima Otori

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.080
to talk about Google
Cloud Launcher

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.880
and how I could get my site into
the cloud in less time than it

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.670
takes to order a tall Americano.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.271
Fatima, so you work on
Google Cloud Launcher.

00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:19.270
FATIMA OTORI: Yes, I do.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.160
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Tell us all about it.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.910
What does it do?

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.368
FATIMA OTORI: Google
Cloud Launcher

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:25.710
is Google's implementation
of a software marketplace.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.210
And what that means is it's
really an online store for VMs.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.619
So these are VMs that run
on top of Google Cloud

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.360
Platform and host
or represent some

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.810
of the popular
applications that you,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.090
as an individual developer,
or even businesses,

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.145
can come on there and create
solutions for what they need.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.520
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So for example,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.761
if I want to build a
website with WordPress,

00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:48.510
it's going to give me
everything for that?

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.634
FATIMA OTORI: Yes, exactly.

00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:51.100
So in Cloud Launcher
today, we're

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.760
hosting a number of
software packages.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.570
Popular like WordPress,
and then other ones

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.214
that are more
enterprise related.

00:00:57.214 --> 00:00:58.630
And so you can go
on there and you

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.140
can find a WordPress VM
that's really, essentially,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.460
been preconfigured for you.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.630
And so within a
few clicks, you can

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.840
be up and running with
your own personal website.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: So that
can be pretty complex, right?

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.820
There's the virtual machine
with it's operating system,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.403
and you're going to
have the language,

00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:16.540
like PHP, the database, the
software, and all the bits

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.620
to link it all together.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.260
And that can be done with
one click type launch?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.010
FATIMA OTORI: Yes.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.840
So the advantage for
Launcher is exactly

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.280
to take away that complexity
from the end user.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.610
And so when these VMs
are packaged and supplied

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.350
by our third party providers,
they take care of all that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.850
for you.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.210
So they come preconfigured
with the OS, the database,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.000
and any other
application dependencies

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.210
that you would need.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.830
So if you're running
WordPress, your MySQL instance

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.950
is already preconfigured
in that VM.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.670
And so for you as an end
user, you can really get up

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.400
and running within a few clicks.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.500
You do have the flexibility to
pick the size of your VM, which

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.170
is the size of your machine,
based on how much you

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.680
think your workload will be.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.840
But within a few
clicks, you can deploy

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.187
and you can have a WordPress
site up and running.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.770
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That is really cool.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.580
Because I've built a few
WordPress sites in my time,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.260
and it's all that plumbing and
all that getting stuff to work.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.259
It's worth it in the end,
because it's terrific,

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.870
but it's a lot of fiddlings.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.703
FATIMA OTORI: It is.

00:02:11.703 --> 00:02:14.160
And Cloud Launcher is really
the easiest way for end users

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.570
to explore Google
Cloud Platform.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.612
And for that reason.

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:18.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.730
So can I put you on the
spot and ask you to demo it?

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.729
FATIMA OTORI: Of course.

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.540
That's why I brought my laptop.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.380
LAURENCE MORONEY:
You came prepared.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.630
FATIMA OTORI: I came prepared.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.470
So let me just log into
my machine right now.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.440
And so if you can see, I'm
just going to easily access

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.910
the Cloud Launcher site by going
to cloud.google.com/launcher.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.280
That brings you to
our cloud store.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.450
As you can see, we're featuring
a number of popular packages

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.034
up top.

00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:43.700
But if you know what
you're looking for,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.480
like WordPress, we also have
a search bar where you can go

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.960
and type in WordPress.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.396
And you can see your different
options for WordPress.

00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:52.270
And so here you have
three different options.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.440
One for running just a
single website, and then

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.480
a multi-site WordPress instance.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.304
And so you're free
to select either one.

00:03:00.304 --> 00:03:02.220
LAURENCE MORONEY: Well,
I'm not popular enough

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.900
to have a multi-site.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.870
So I think I'll just
stick with the single one.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.953
FATIMA OTORI: That's fine.

00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:08.810
OK, so I'm going to select
the single site WordPress VM.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.050
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.591
FATIMA OTORI: As we
mentioned before,

00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:12.380
you can see on the
right-hand side here

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.980
what's contained in this VM.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.310
So it tells you what
operating system is included.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.310
It also gives you information
about the database

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.740
that's been preconfigured.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.400
The one that I selected
is an open source version

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.590
of WordPress-- so
WordPress is open source--

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.882
and so there's no pricing
attached to the image itself.

00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:27.881
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:30.680
FATIMA OTORI: Of course, there
is still the underlying compute

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.520
costs, and so--

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.910
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's why we're

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.080
asked to pick the
different machine size.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.996
FATIMA OTORI: Exactly.

00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:37.299
And so we give you an estimate
of pricing here as well.

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.006
FATIMA OTORI: As
you'll see on the site,

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:43.450
we now have commercial solutions
on Cloud Launcher where

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.054
there is a cost for
licensing those things.

00:03:46.054 --> 00:03:48.470
LAURENCE MORONEY: And I assume
some operating systems also

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.640
have a cost
associated with them--

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.430
FATIMA OTORI: Oh, that's true.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: --and that
would be included there.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.350
OK.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.850
Really neat.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.976
So let's build a WordPress.

00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:53.766
FATIMA OTORI: Yeah.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.620
And so as you can
see, you scroll down.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.400
And really what's
contained on this site

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.210
is tutorials and documentations
on how to get started.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.760
But if you're
comfortable with that,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.430
you can simply click
this button that

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.050
says Launch on Compute Engine.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.480
And so we've done that.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.234
And it's opening up
my Developer console.

00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:12.150
LAURENCE MORONEY: Associate
it with a project.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.066
FATIMA OTORI: Exactly.

00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:16.720
And so I'll just go and
pick a project of mine.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.220
And so--

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: I like
the icon, the little rocket.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.089
FATIMA OTORI: Oh, yes.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.690
We thought that was cute.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.070
And so now, before I hit
the button to deploy,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.455
if I want to give my
deployment a new name, I can.

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:32.410
I select the zone that I want
my instance to be spun up on.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.670
And my machine size,
I have flexibility

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.782
to select that as well.

00:04:36.782 --> 00:04:40.687
I'll just go ahead and
pick a more sizable image.

00:04:40.687 --> 00:04:43.270
LAURENCE MORONEY: Because you're
going to have a popular site.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.730
FATIMA OTORI: Yes, of course.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.120
And then I also have
my choice of disk.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.607
I'll leave it as is.

00:04:49.607 --> 00:04:51.690
And then you have some
networking firewall options

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.030
as well, which I won't
change at the time.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.800
So I go ahead and click Deploy.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.785
And give that a few
minutes to pop up.

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:05.650
Cloud Launcher now supports
Deployment Manager internally.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.050
And so what this
allows you to do

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.700
is to be able to save
any configuration

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.970
of your environment
that you've created,

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.180
and use that template anywhere
else on Google Cloud Platform.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.100
Also, if you're
doing more than just

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.220
deploying single
VM instance, you

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.550
can easily manage it
through this config UI

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.547
to specify how many instances of
a particular solution you want.

00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:26.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: And now
it's just creating everything,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.200
right?

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.650
FATIMA OTORI: Yes.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.300
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Setting up the VM,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.133
setting up the-- I see
the firewall on the--

00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:31.025
FATIMA OTORI: Yes.

00:05:31.025 --> 00:05:32.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.971
FATIMA OTORI: So while
that is spinning up,

00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:37.940
I just want to go point out
some of the other commercial

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.880
solutions that we have
available on Launcher.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.750
So I'll click Enterprise
DB, which is our Enterprise

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.060
Postgres option in Launcher.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.580
And I just wanted to point out,
so this one is not open source.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.570
It actually has a
price attached to it.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.910
But just as you saw, you can see
the breakdown of the pricing.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.759
And so this is actually
strong for our users

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.300
because they want to know what
they're paying for before they

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.130
actually invest.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.960
LAURENCE MORONEY: Help you
to budget up front, right?

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.876
FATIMA OTORI: Exactly.

00:06:07.876 --> 00:06:11.540
And with this solution, you
can get full documentation

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.820
and tutorials of how to use
this particular solution.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.180
And you also have a direct
link to our partner support.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.350
And so if you want
to call support,

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.730
here's a link for you to do so.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.960
FATIMA OTORI: And so
it's up and running.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.270
And I'll just go ahead and
actually just go to the site

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.464
itself.

00:06:29.464 --> 00:06:30.130
And here you go.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.499
Your blog is up and running.

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:33.790
Of course, you have the Admin
console if you want to go

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.180
and actually publish
content or design your blog

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.014
however you want it.

00:06:37.014 --> 00:06:38.596
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Really from nothing,

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:40.890
you have a full
WordPress-based infrastructure

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.124
built in just a few minutes.

00:06:42.124 --> 00:06:43.040
FATIMA OTORI: Exactly.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.250
LAURENCE MORONEY: So this
is great stuff for me

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.420
as a developer, but what
if I'm an enterprise?

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.995
What if I have a lot of
these things to deploy?

00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:50.020
Is there an offering?

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.800
FATIMA OTORI: Actually,
that's a very good question,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.340
because traditionally,
of course,

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.580
developers are always
chomping at the bit

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.880
to see what's the
latest and greatest.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.320
But you know,
surprisingly, we're

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.600
seeing that enterprises are
coming to or taking advantage

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.910
of marketplace such
as Cloud Launcher

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.910
to test out your new solutions.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.710
Not only to test,
but also when they

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.890
do get ready to deploy
something in production,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.920
they can do that right from
the Cloud Launcher today.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.040
And so today in Cloud Launcher,
we are hosting just single VMs,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.614
but we have now
Deployment Manager.

00:07:23.614 --> 00:07:25.030
And so think of
Deployment Manager

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.760
as the enabler to deploying
many, many instances

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.350
versus just that one.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.220
Which is what enterprises
are looking for.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.037
Not only deployment, being able
to manage it centrally as well.

00:07:36.037 --> 00:07:37.620
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And it's a great way

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.905
to test a new software
stack without investing

00:07:39.905 --> 00:07:41.030
in all the hardware, right?

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.850
FATIMA OTORI: That's
exactly right.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.402
And we see enterprises taking
advantage of that as well.

00:07:44.402 --> 00:07:45.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.280
Interesting.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.270
So where do you fit into
all of this, Fatima?

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.340
What do you do here at Google?

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.131
FATIMA OTORI: Yeah.

00:07:50.131 --> 00:07:53.140
So I work on a team called
the Google Cloud Partner Team.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.790
And our main job,
our sole job, is

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.460
to bring the best
of breed partners

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.310
to Google Cloud Platform
to enable our end users

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.400
freedom of choice.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.345
I work primarily
with the partners

00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:06.980
that we onboard onto
the Cloud Launcher.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.760
And we do everything from
verifying these packages,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.530
making sure that
they're up-to-date

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.170
and they are what
they say-- they

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.742
do what they say they will
do on Google Cloud Platform.

00:08:15.742 --> 00:08:17.700
So we work with partners
to bring that solution

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.050
to the store, but then we also
help them spread their message,

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.370
and what the right way
to use the solution

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.860
is to the end user.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: Actually, you
bring up an interesting point,

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.305
because when you're
saying it's like you want

00:08:28.305 --> 00:08:30.050
to verify that it's
the right thing,

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.450
like if I'm getting WordPress,
that really is WordPress.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.640
But what also then
happens, like if I--

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.164
we've now just built a
WordPress site together.

00:08:37.164 --> 00:08:39.080
What happens then when
WordPress gets updated?

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.442
Do I need to go and
start fiddling to update?

00:08:41.442 --> 00:08:43.150
FATIMA OTORI: No,
that's a good question.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.340
And I think this is something
that separates the experience

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.370
that users get from
using Cloud Launcher

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.640
versus some other marketplaces
they may know out there.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.820
And so going back to what we
do as a Cloud Platform Partner

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.450
Team, all the partners
that we bring on board,

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.980
we make sure that it's not just
a transactional relationship,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.480
right?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.530
The images they provide
for us in the store,

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.920
we make sure that when they
do have an update on there,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.190
they notify Google.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.370
I like to use the
analogy of an app store.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.172
Today when you go to an app
store, you download an app.

00:09:12.172 --> 00:09:13.380
You install it on your phone.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.160
When there are updates,
you get push notification.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.891
FATIMA OTORI: Same
thing on Cloud Launcher.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:22.440
We make sure that our partners
are able to adequately notify

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.270
any of the users who's using
their solution on Cloud

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.030
Launcher.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.900
And so this is the
support mechanism

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.460
that we've built
into Cloud Launcher.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:30.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: Very cool.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.969
So yeah, because like if
I'm building something,

00:09:32.969 --> 00:09:35.285
I've got multiple pieces
of software in the stack.

00:09:35.285 --> 00:09:37.660
There's the operating system,
the language, the database,

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.030
the software tool itself.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.280
And any of these can have
security patches, and that--

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.446
FATIMA OTORI: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:42.446 --> 00:09:46.110
That's one of the
main, if I could say,

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.400
disadvantages of using
some software marketplaces,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.980
because traditionally, what
we've seen is that people go

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.500
and they deploy software.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.309
The first version is great.

00:09:56.309 --> 00:09:58.600
And they're happy, and their
project is up and running.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.414
But pretty soon, security
vulnerabilities pop up

00:10:01.414 --> 00:10:02.580
and they don't get notified.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.990
And so essentially,
we say from the second

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.730
they deploy that software,
it's essentially dead, right?

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.670
And we're trying to avoid that
problem with Cloud Launcher.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.200
And so they would
get automatic updates

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.659
if there's any change to the
solution that they're running.

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:16.741
LAURENCE MORONEY: So yeah.

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.940
If I'm an IT admin and
I've got hundreds of sites

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.874
that I'm looking after, one
personal WordPress site is one

00:10:21.874 --> 00:10:23.540
thing, but if I've
got hundreds of them,

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.340
I need to know which
ones are working,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.360
which ones need updates.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.555
And so you're pushing
updates about that to me.

00:10:28.555 --> 00:10:29.680
FATIMA OTORI: Yes, exactly.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.610
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's really cool.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.910
How would I get
started if I want

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.120
to build my own
WordPress instead

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.360
of having you do it for me?

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.520
FATIMA OTORI: You can go up
to cloud.google.com/launcher

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.620
and create your
own Google account.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.050
And you have free will
to use what you see there

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.300
in the Cloud Store.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.258
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:10:44.258 --> 00:10:46.570
So cloud.google.com/launcher.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.961
So go check it out now.

00:10:47.961 --> 00:10:49.960
Maybe you'll build a
wonderful site on WordPress

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.360
or on something else.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.550
So please let us know if
you've any questions for me

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.960
or if you've any
questions for Fatima.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.250
Let us know on the
comments below.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.830
And we'd love to
see what you build.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.572
Thank you.
