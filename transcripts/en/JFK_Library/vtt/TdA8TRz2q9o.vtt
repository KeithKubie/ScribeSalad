00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:02.157
- One of my favorite quotes,

00:00:02.157 --> 00:00:04.908
and I have it framed on the
mantelpiece in our house,

00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:09.075
they all see it, they all know
it, is from Jonathan Swift.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.487
Who said, "May you live
all the days of your life."

00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:18.374
Live every day.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.065
Live all the days of your life.

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:23.237
That's what matters.

00:00:23.237 --> 00:00:27.028
Getting the most out of
life, while you're alive.

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.153
But get up and do things.

00:00:29.153 --> 00:00:30.840
Accomplish something.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.115
Make the world a little
better, every day if you can,

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:37.083
in some small way or other.

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:39.910
Help other people who need help.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.743
Be kind.

00:00:43.108 --> 00:00:44.191
Have empathy.

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:48.873
Put yourself in the other person's place.

00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:51.524
And try not ever to be boring.

00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:53.402
(audience laughs)

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:56.130
It's not fair to be boring!

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.713
It's unkind to your
friends or your family.
