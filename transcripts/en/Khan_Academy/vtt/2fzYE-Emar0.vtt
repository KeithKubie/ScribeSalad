00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.160
We're now on problem number 4
from the Normal Distribution

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.504
chapter from ck12.org's
FlexBook on AP Statistics.

00:00:10.504 --> 00:00:12.170
You can go to their
site to download it.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.660
It's all for free.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.830
So problem number 4, and
it's, at least in my mind,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.010
pretty good practice.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.500
For a normal, or a standard
normal distribution,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.570
place the following in order
from smallest to largest.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.035
So let's see, percentage of
data below 1, negative 1.

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:28.600
OK.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.470
Let's draw our standard
normal distribution.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.230
So a standard
normal distribution

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.230
is one where the
mean is-- sorry,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.850
I drew the standard
deviation-- is

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.350
one where the mean, mu for
mean, is where the mean is

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.940
equal to 0, and the standard
deviation is equal to 1.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.540
So let me draw that standard
normal distribution.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.590
Let's see, so let me draw
the axis right like that.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.245
Let me see if I can draw
a nice-looking bell curve.

00:00:59.245 --> 00:01:02.030
So there's the bell
curve right there.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.290
You get the idea.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.920
And this is a standard normal
distribution, so the mean,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.310
or you can kind view the
center point right here.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.110
It's not skewed.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.990
This says the mean is
going to be 0 right there,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.440
and the standard deviation is 1.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.120
So if we go 1 standard
deviation to the right,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.939
that is going to be 1.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.480
If you go 2 standard
deviations, it's

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.800
going to be 2, 3 standard
deviations, 3, just like that.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.540
1 standard deviation to the
left is going to be minus 1.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.580
2 standard deviations
to the left

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.290
will be minus 2, and
so on, and so forth.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.660
Minus 3 will be 3 standard
deviations to the left

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.680
because the standard
deviation is 1.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.900
So let's see if we can
answer this question.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.460
So what's the percentage
of data below 1?

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.560
Part a, that's this
stuff right here.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.967
So everything below 1, so
it's all of-- well, not

00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:56.300
just that little center portion.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.540
It keeps going.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.464
Everything below 1,
percentage of data below 1.

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:02.880
So this is another
situation where

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.080
we should use the
empirical rule.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.970
Never hurts to
get more practice.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.200
Empirical rule, or
maybe the better way

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.190
to remember the empirical rule
is just the 68, 95, 99.7 rule.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.089
And I call that a
better way because it

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:21.380
essentially gives you the rule.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.530
These are just the
numbers that you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.840
have to essentially memorize.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.867
And if you have a calculator
or a normal distribution table,

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:27.950
you don't have to do this.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.510
But sometimes in
class, or people

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.360
want you to estimate
percentages,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.619
and so you can impress people
if you can do this in your head.

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:36.910
So let's see if we can use
the empirical rule to answer

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.850
this question, the area under
the bell curve all the way up

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.710
to 1, or everything
to the left of 1.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.380
So the empirical rule tells
us that this middle area

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.550
between 1 standard
deviation to the left

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.280
and 1 standard deviation to the
right, that right there is 68%.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.030
We saw that in the
previous video as well.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.010
That's what the
empirical rule tells us.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.690
Now, if that's 68%, we
saw in the last video

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.380
that everything else
combined, it all

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.300
has to add up to 1 or to 100%,
that this left-hand tail-- let

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.030
me draw it a little
bit-- this part

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.380
right here plus this part
right here has to add up,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.220
when you add it to 68, has
to add up to 1 or to 100%.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.150
So those two combined are 32%.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.300
32 plus 68 is 100.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.670
Now, this is symmetrical.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.400
These two things
are the exact same.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.090
So if they add up to 32,
this right here is 16%,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.575
and this right here is 16%.

00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:35.200
Now, the question,
they want us to know

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.741
the area of everything--
let me do it

00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:39.860
in a new color--
everything less than 1,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.080
the percentage of data
below 1, so everything

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.650
to the left of this point.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.070
So it's the 68%.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.370
It's right there,
so it's 68%, which

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.860
is this middle area within
1 standard deviation,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.080
plus this left
branch right there.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.840
So 68 plus 16%, which is what?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.660
That's equal to 84%.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.715
So part a is 84%.

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:05.090
They're going to want us to
put this in order eventually,

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.710
but it's good to just
solve because that's really

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.293
the hard part.

00:04:07.293 --> 00:04:10.000
Once we know the numbers,
ordering is pretty easy.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.080
Part b, the percentage
of data below minus 1.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.480
So minus 1 is right there.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.760
So they really just want
us to figure out this area

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.070
right here, the percentage
of data below minus 1.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.310
Well, that's going to be 16%.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.690
We just figured that out.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.360
And you could have already
known just without even knowing

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.920
the empirical, just looking
at a normal distribution,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.469
that this entire area, that
part b is a subset of part a,

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:36.010
so it's going to be
a smaller number.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.920
So if you just have
to order things,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.390
you could have made
that intuition,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.122
but it's good to do practice
with the empirical rule.

00:04:43.122 --> 00:04:45.080
Now part c, they want to
know, what's the mean?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.371
Well, that's the easiest thing.

00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:48.670
The mean of a standard
normal distribution,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.710
by definition, is 0.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.120
So number c is 0.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.190
d, the standard deviation.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.580
Well, by definition,
the standard deviation

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.350
for the standard normal
distribution is 1.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.990
So this is 1 right here.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.740
This is easier than I
thought it would be.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.320
Part e, the percentage
of data above 2.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.050
So they want the
percentage of data above 2.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.239
So we know from the
68, 95, 99.7 rule

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:21.780
that if we want to
know how much data

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.480
is within 2 standard
deviations-- so let

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.580
me do it in a new color.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.440
Let me do it in a more
vibrant color, green.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.617
If we're looking from
this point to this point--

00:05:33.617 --> 00:05:35.450
so it's within 2 standard
deviations, right,

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.654
the standard
deviation here is 1--

00:05:37.654 --> 00:05:39.570
if we're looking within
2 standard deviations,

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.530
that whole area right there,
by the empirical rule, is 95%,

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.570
within 2 standard deviations.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.770
This is 95%.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.710
Which tells us that
everything else combined--

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.780
so if you take
this yellow portion

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.260
right here and
this yellow portion

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.680
right here, so everything
beyond 2 standard deviations

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.920
in either direction-- that
has to be the remainder.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.420
So you know everything
in the middle

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.930
was 95 within 2
standard deviations.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.370
So that has to be 5%, if you
add that tail and that tail

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.640
together, everything to
the left and right of 2

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.160
standard deviations.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.360
Well, I've made the
argument before, everything

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.110
is symmetrical.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.750
This and this are equal.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.280
So this right here
is 2 and 1/2%,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.322
and this right here
is also 2 and 1/2%.

00:06:24.322 --> 00:06:25.780
So they're asking
us the percentage

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.090
of data above 2, that's this
tail, just this tail right

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.950
here, the percentage of data
more than 2 standard deviations

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.200
away from the mean.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.660
So that's 2 and 1/2%.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.790
Let me do it in a darker
color-- 2 and 1/2%.

00:06:40.134 --> 00:06:41.800
Now, they're asking
us, let's see, place

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.140
the following in order
from smallest to largest.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.890
So there's a little
bit of ambiguity here.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.700
Because if they're saying the
percentage of data below 1,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.250
do they want us to
say, well, it's 84%.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.700
So should we consider
the answer to part a, 84?

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.240
Or should we consider-- if
they said the fraction of data

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.562
below 1, I would say 0.84.

00:07:01.562 --> 00:07:03.520
So it depends on how they
want to interpret it.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.103
Same way here.

00:07:04.103 --> 00:07:07.690
The percentage of data below
minus 1, I could say the answer

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.350
is 16.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.840
16 is the percentage
below minus 1.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.760
But the actual number, if
I said the fraction of data

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.620
below minus 1, I would say 0.16.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.120
So this actually would be very
different in how we order it.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.036
Similarly, if someone
me asked me the percent,

00:07:21.036 --> 00:07:22.530
I'd say, oh, that's 2.5.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.560
But the actual number is 0.025.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.182
That's the actual fraction
or the actual decimal.

00:07:28.182 --> 00:07:29.890
So I mean, this is
just ordering numbers,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.310
so I shouldn't fixate
on this too much.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.860
But let's just say that
they're going with the decimal.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.980
So if we wanted
to do it that way,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.680
they want to do it from smallest
to largest, the smallest

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.330
number we have here is c, right?

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.620
That's 0.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.920
And then the next smallest
is e, which is 0.025.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.540
Then the next smallest
is b, which is 0.16.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.160
And then the next one after
that is a, which is 0.84.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.840
And then the largest would
be the standard deviation, d.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.299
So the answer is c, e, b, a , d.

00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:04.090
And obviously, the
order would be different

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.910
if the answer to this,
instead of saying it's 0.84,

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.970
if you said it was 84 because
it's asking for the percentage.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.179
So a little bit of ambiguity.

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:10.969
If we had a question
like this on the exam,

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:12.690
I would clarify that
with the teacher.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.310
But hopefully you
found this useful.
