ALEX LEVICH: I'm
Alex Levich, and I'm

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:09.600
a product manager at Google,
leading one of the areas

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.940
in Android platform.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.645
Today we are joined by
Sabrina Ellis, product manager

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:15.270
and director at Google.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.270
Welcome, Sabrina.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.930
SABRINA ELLIS: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.530
ALEX LEVICH: Tell
us a little bit

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.180
about yourself and
your background.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.263
SABRINA ELLIS: I am director
of product management

00:00:22.263 --> 00:00:25.260
on the Android team at
Google, and the areas

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.320
that I'm responsible for
include Android apps, location,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.940
and context.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.262
And just recently, I took
over the Google store.

00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:33.220
ALEX LEVICH: Excellent.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.200
Sabrina, tell us all about your
take on product management.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.732
What is that role about?

00:00:37.732 --> 00:00:39.190
SABRINA ELLIS: A
product manager, I

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.910
think the main role is really
about bringing together

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.650
all the different parts of
a team to launch a product.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.530
You know, one key element is
really understanding the user.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.500
And another is to
take that knowledge

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.970
and communicate it to the team.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.150
So you're bringing together the
design team, the engineering

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.620
team, and then all
the way through when

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.700
you're moving into launch with
the QA team and the launch

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.519
team, and all of those aspects.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.200
And a lot of the role
of product manager

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.710
is to bring those
groups together,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.620
so that you can launch
a successful product.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.340
ALEX LEVICH: What does it
mean to actually bring things

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.610
together, to launch products?

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.890
What do people actually
do in this role?

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.240
SABRINA ELLIS: So it starts
from just the concept.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.730
Who are we building this for?

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.860
And really making that clear to
everybody that's on the team,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.680
really thinking about that user,
what are their needs, how do we

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.994
fit into their lives.

00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:28.910
I think that's the first
step of really trying

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.951
to communicate that and
make sure that everyone's

00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:33.280
aligned on those concepts.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.770
And then from there,
it is saying, so how

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.660
is it that we want to build
the best product for them?

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.350
And that can mean, let's
bring together the engineers.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.710
Let's think about where
it is that we want to go.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.930
Let's work with the
designers to say,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.070
if this is the user
that we want, how is it

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.910
that we would design the
best user interface for them?

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.700
With all of those
things, how do we

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.750
build a product, how
do we build a road map,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.666
and then make sure that
we're getting the best

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.333
product out to them
as soon as possible?

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.166
ALEX LEVICH: That sounds
really interesting,

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.090
but also challenging.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.280
What's challenging about it?

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.780
Tell us.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.154
SABRINA ELLIS: I think one of
the most challenging things

00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:07.340
is in general in the
product management role,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.000
the people are not
reporting to you.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.580
So you have this role, and
you have this responsibility,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.310
like I said, where you
are bringing together all

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.190
the ideas of what users want.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.680
You want to highlight
what the priorities are,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.930
what we're all moving towards.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.730
You want to make sure that
everyone is aligned on a road

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.470
map, but you actually
don't have the authority

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.010
of any of these people
potentially reporting to you.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.580
So a lot of it is about
influencing other people.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.930
It's really talking about why
are these the right things?

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.720
Why is it that this is what we
want to build for the users?

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.874
Why is this the right
road map for us to follow?

00:02:38.874 --> 00:02:40.790
And making sure that
you've thought it through

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.873
and convincing everyone
that this is the direction

00:02:42.873 --> 00:02:43.990
you want to move towards.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.384
ALEX LEVICH: So it's a
lot about communication.

00:02:46.384 --> 00:02:48.300
SABRINA ELLIS: It's a
ton about communication.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.300
That's a huge amount of the job.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.520
It's about influencing
other people.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.690
And you know, I like
to say that sometimes I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.630
get the most amount of work
done in the salad bar line.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.860
But you've got to figure
out what your own style is

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.692
and how you can convince people.

00:03:01.692 --> 00:03:03.150
ALEX LEVICH: And
food is important.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.770
SABRINA ELLIS: Food
is also important.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.570
And we are lucky that at
Google, they do feed us.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.407
ALEX LEVICH: Indeed.

00:03:08.407 --> 00:03:09.990
Tell us about what's
exciting for you.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.350
What gets you up in the
morning, when you go to work?

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.600
SABRINA ELLIS: I mentioned,
I think, being passionate.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.810
I think that's one of
the key elements of being

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.059
a successful product manager.

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.100
I think you want to be
passionate about the space

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.350
that you're working in.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.280
For me, it is technology.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.420
It is the potential of
taking that technology

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.580
and bringing it to large
parts of the society

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.540
and actually being able
to change their lives.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.840
ALEX LEVICH: Sabrina,
what about now?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.548
Are you working on
anything in particular

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:38.010
that really gets you excited?

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.720
SABRINA ELLIS: So right now,
one of the projects that I'm

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.070
leading is called Google Fit.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.664
We just launched last fall.

00:03:42.664 --> 00:03:43.580
ALEX LEVICH: Congrats.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.430
SABRINA ELLIS: And-- thank you.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.040
And that's a project where I
think we have a big opportunity

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.790
to really change people's
lives, hundreds of millions

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.300
of people's lives, in fact.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.170
Right now, we know
people carry their phones

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.000
with them every day.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.330
We know that we also
have the opportunity

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.890
to take those phones that
they're already carrying,

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.400
take the sensors
that are in them,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.610
and make those into
fitness devices

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.880
without them having
to spend more money,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.800
or really change their habits.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.880
So with that data, we hope that
we can help people understand

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.649
their own fitness
and how they might

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.630
make small tweaks
in order to improve

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.860
their overall well-being.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.120
And what gets me
up is we can really

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.940
help improve the lives of
almost a billion people.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.690
And I think that
potential is something

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.009
that's just really exciting.

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:30.800
ALEX LEVICH: It is.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.410
It's actually already
changing my life,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.230
because I want to do more and
more steps using my Android

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.200
watch.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.840
SABRINA ELLIS:
That's great, yeah.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.310
ALEX LEVICH: True story.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.840
SABRINA ELLIS: I will
admit, I feel a lot of guilt

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.190
as well when I see my stats
at the end of the day.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.730
ALEX LEVICH: Well, thank
you, Sabrina, for joining us.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.120
It was a pleasure having you.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.730
SABRINA ELLIS: Thank you
so much for having me here.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.730
ALEX LEVICH: And thanks,
everyone, for watching.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.510
This is product management
with Alex Levich.
