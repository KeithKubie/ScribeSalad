00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.200
What number could
replace this weird circle

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.946
with an x symbol
looking thing below?

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:08.570
And over here, they
have this equation.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.430
They say 8 plus 4 is equal
to 4 plus weird circle

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.240
with the x thing.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.270
And what they're really
wanting us to appreciate

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.530
is that, look, 8 plus 4 is the
exact same thing as 4 plus 8.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.390
That's the commutative
law of addition,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.230
which is just a very fancy way
of saying that, well, 8 plus 4

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.870
is the same thing as 4 plus 8.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.640
It doesn't matter which number
comes before the addition sign

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.530
and which one comes after.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.770
So 8 plus 4 is the
same thing as 4 plus 8.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.135
This little thing could be
replaced by the number 8.

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:42.010
Let's do another one.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.120
What number could replace
this little-- looks

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.650
almost like a cross--
below, or it looks almost

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.940
like a dagger or something.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.210
10 plus 4 in parentheses
plus 3, and then they

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.470
have something plus 4 plus 3.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.930
So it looks like
they're wanting us

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.590
to realize that
it doesn't matter

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.950
if we do the 10 plus
4 first or whether we

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.970
do the 4 plus 3 first.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.730
So if we just took this
statement right over here

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.340
and changed the
parentheses so that we

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.117
add the 4 plus 3 first--
so they're doing here--

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:16.950
this number right over
here could be the 10.

00:01:19.772 --> 00:01:21.980
And this right over here is
just the associative law,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.938
or the associative law
of addition, or the fact

00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:25.190
that addition is associative.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.950
It doesn't matter if you
add the 10 plus 4 first

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.060
and then you add the 3, or
you add the 4 plus 3 first

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.190
and then you add the 10.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.620
So this could easily be the 10.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.710
Let's check our answer.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.900
Let's do another one.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.250
What could replace this
little-- almost looks

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.167
like what you'd see in
a Do Not Smoking sign

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:45.250
if there was a cigarette
behind it, so this little

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.970
slash between the inside
of a circle below.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.020
So 9 times 6.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.280
Well, multiplication
is also commutative.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.030
9 times 6 is the exact
same thing as 6 times 9,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.525
so this thing could be a 9.

00:01:57.525 --> 00:02:00.370
It could be replaced with a 9.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.040
I guess I'm all
out of questions.
