00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.040
Introduction

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.170
Visual effects have come a long way since
Bruce the shark made production on Jaws a

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.050
living hell for Steven Spielberg.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.750
Thanks to the advent of CGI, filmmakers can
do just about anything they imagine.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.720
This has led to space ships and creatures
that look more photorealistic than ever, and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.440
some viewers have trouble telling if what
they’re looking at is real or digital.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.800
There’s no shortage of great examples of
these techniques, but not everyone is capable

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.320
of knocking it out of the park.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.820
Sometimes we watch a scene and wonder what
the director was thinking when he approved

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.820
the effects.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.820
Here are 10 shockingly bad uses of CGI in
famous movies.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.410
X-Men Origins: Wolverine

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.480
This film is one of the most maligned in the
comic book genre for several factors, including

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.470
an apparently rushed post-production.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.600
One of the defining aspects of Wolverine is
his claws, and fans love it when Logan brings

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.600
them out.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.480
In this prequel though, moviegoers were angered
by what they saw.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.640
After receiving his adamantium skeleton, Wolverine
examines his new metal claws, and they are

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.640
painful to look at.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.650
They’re so obviously cartoonish, they look
like something out of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.310
Considering that the claws looked more realistic
nine years earlier in the first X-Men, this

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.220
is inexcusable.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.380
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.580
Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy
was noteworthy for its extensive use of practical

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.310
effects, but the director’s Hobbit trilogy
leaned extensively on CGI.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.150
Arguably, he went too far in a few places.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.180
The climactic fight sequence in Battle of
the Five Armies includes a scene where Legolas

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.050
basically defies the laws of physics as he
runs up a tower that has been knocked over

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.050
by a troll.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.750
It’s so ridiculous that even the Myth Busters
had to come out and prove it couldn’t actually

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.750
happen.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.990
We’re all for suspending disbelief in movies,
but some things have to be grounded for us

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.360
to buy in.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.100
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part
2

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.310
For all the advancements in CGI, it’s still
very difficult to realistically animate a

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.810
human being’s face.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.991
The uncanny valley is something that few filmmakers
have conquered, and the people behind the

00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.470
last Twilight movie failed miserably.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.280
When Bella first meets her new baby, the infant’s
face is so blatantly digital that it sticks

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.629
out like a sore thumb.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.420
It’s extremely disorientating, especially
when juxtaposed with the real actors on set.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.469
One has to wonder why the director decided
a CGI face on a robot baby was the right way

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:23.010
to go, instead of getting an actual child
to use for the scene.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.389
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal
Skull

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.499
Like so many blockbusters of its era, the
original Indiana Jones trilogy pioneered some

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.930
amazing practical visual effects, but Steven
Spielberg couldn’t resist the temptations

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.980
of CGI for the fourth installment.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.290
Fans knew things were off from the start,
when a digital gopher popped his head up in

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.290
the first scene.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.370
For many, this was a bad omen that Crystal
Skull would rely too much on digital technology

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.370
as opposed to the old school techniques that
made its predecessors memorable.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.840
It was an odd choice and seemed to serve no
real purpose.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.220
A real gopher, or even an animatronic one,
might have led to better results.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.220
Green Lantern

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.680
As we’ve said many times before, getting
a superhero’s costume right for his or her

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.110
big screen adaptation is a priority.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.230
Martin Campbell went in a very interesting
direction while making Green Lantern: he decided

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.480
the whole suit should be CGI.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.139
While some comic book blockbusters will digitally
augment small sections – like a cape – this

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.719
was unprecedented and came under intense scrutiny
by fans.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.499
The costume did not look very good on the
big screen, and even Ryan Reynolds had to

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:23.980
be disappointed by the results.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.699
How else can you explain the jab at the Green
Lantern costume in Deadpool?

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:31.340
Hopefully for the reboot, WB makes a real
costume.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.459
The Matrix Reloaded

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.489
The original Matrix film was one of the groundbreaking
achievements in visual effects with its bullet

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.189
time, but the sequels could not replicate
that success.

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.389
One sequence in particular that was criticized
was Neo’s fight against a swarm of Agent

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.389
Smiths.

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.470
Some felt that the effects looked fake and
cartoonish, a disappointment considering the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.010
standard set by the first one.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.180
A theory floating around is that the CGI is
intentionally bad because it’s meant to

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.599
represent the Matrix itself crashing but we
doubt that was the Wachowskis’ intention

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.809
when they shot the scene.

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:04.069
They just overdid it and audiences didn’t
respond to it.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.370
The Mummy Returns

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.450
Dwayne Johnson is one of the most beloved
action stars today, but there was a time when

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.949
audiences laughed at the Rock on screen.

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.199
It technically wasn’t his fault, but his
appearance as the Scorpion King in the Mummy

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.680
Returns is almost comically bad.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.419
The scene features truly horrendous CGI, to
the point where it looks like a video game.

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.510
The Scorpion King is so obviously digital,
one has to wonder if any effort was put into

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.510
his design.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.700
Perhaps the filmmakers should have looked
for another way to bring this character to

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.560
life, since CGI was definitely not the answer.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.610
Fantastic Four

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.890
This film had a lot of problems on its path
to the big screen, so some slight errors could

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.890
be forgiven.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.250
That said, some of the CGI on display definitely
does not clear the bar many expect in 2015.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.680
In one sequence, the Thing throws a tank that
immediately disappears in an explosion, without

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.400
any trace of the vehicle left.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.920
A careful examination of certain scenes also
shows that portions of the digitally inserted

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.410
background has been copied and pasted throughout
the frame, creating a sloppy look for what

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.730
should be a visually stunning film.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.760
Badly rendered effects were the least of this
movie’s problems, but they’re still glaring

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.040
issues.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.040
Air Force One

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.920
For the most part, this 1990s action flick
is highly entertaining, and it features one

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.440
of the best one-liners in cinema.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.350
Still, even its biggest fans have to admit
that there’s one scene in particular that

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.250
isn’t all that great: the plane crash.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.140
It hardly looks like something that belongs
in a big Hollywood blockbuster, as the airplane

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.980
looks exceptionally fake.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.640
CGI was still relatively new when Air Force
One was made, but if Jurassic Park could bring

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.670
dinosaurs back, it’s possible to realistically
animate a plane.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.940
Or, they could have used a miniature and shot
for scale.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.050
That usually works as well.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.050
King Kong

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.030
Peter Jackson’s remake of this classic was
obviously a visual marvel, but there was one

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.920
section where the special effects weren’t
all that special.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.940
When the film crew arrives on Skull Island
and explores, they’re forced to run for

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.400
their lives as they’re caught in the middle
of a dinosaur stampede.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.280
Audiences should have been going for a white-knuckle
thrill ride, but many were taken out of the

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.870
movie by poor CGI.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.850
In some shots, you can clearly tell that the
actors are running in front of a green screen,

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.220
with all the creatures added into the background.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.820
Viewers knew that the dinosaurs weren’t
real, but that doesn’t excuse this.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.820
Conclusion

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.240
Those are just some instances of bad CGI in
popular films.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.470
