00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here I have written six possible JavaScript statements.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I ask you which are valid stmt according to our grammar.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
That is, if you start from the statement nonterminal,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which of these six can you derive using all the rules that we've seen in our grammar so far.

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is the happy-fun quiz.
