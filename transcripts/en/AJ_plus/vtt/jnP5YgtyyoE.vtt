00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.240
President Trump: "We’re not letting them in, but they’re trying to flood our country.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.480
The nation faces a major threat, but it’s not the one President Donald Trump is talking about.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.360
What is the biggest threat to the United States right now?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.800
Heidi Beirich: Well, I think on the terrorism front, it’s white supremacists. More people have

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.680
been killed by white supremacists since 9/11 than by people who believe

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.520
these kinds of extremist twisted forms of Islam.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:35.560
In 2006, there were six incidents of terror-related violence on U.S. soil. In 2017 that number was 65.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.560
That’s nearly a 1,000% increase in a decade and most of those are the result of far-right violence.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.240
The last few years alone have given us several high-profile examples ...

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.160
like the Pittsburgh synagogue attack ...

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.240
the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville that saw a woman killed ...

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.720
and the Charleston Church massacre.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.840
Jason Downard: That's our major goal, is we want an all-white nation. We want, you know, 'cause

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.800
we believe we're the superior race. We believe that we were here first.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.480
This display of violence has been decades in the making

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.280
and for years, some have been trying to warn us about this very moment.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.440
Hey fam. I’m Imaeyen. In part one of our three-part series, we're taking a look at the explosion of far-right

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.120
extremism, and looking at what, if anything, the government has done to combat it.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.720
You will not replace us! You will not replace us!

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.000
This is America.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.400
White power!

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.120
Scenes like these have become more commonplace because groups like these are more prevalent.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.840
The United States is in the middle of a surge of far-right violence.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.560
Two-thirds of politically-motivated violent attacks in 2017 were tied to far right-wing ideologies.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.960
It’s the increase in these types of attacks that interests Heidi Beirich.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.360
She’s an expert on extremism, and for years has been studying the growth of

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.160
right-wing violence in the U.S. And we’ve agreed not to disclose her location for safety.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.280
Heidi Beirich: Usually far-right extremism is exemplified by two things: Either extreme anti-government positions,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.560
and by that I don't mean like low taxes, I mean literally opposed to sort of the federal government

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.440
and the idea that exists. And then as you get more radical on the far-right, you start having notions of white

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.360
supremacy and racism [becomes] part of the thinking.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.520
Globally the number of attacks dropped between 2014 to 2017, but recently the United States has seen

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.600
a surge in what’s been called “terror-related violence” by the Global Terrorism Database.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.960
And Beirich says the far-right increase happening in the U.S. right now is also occurring in some European nations

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.320
because of a commonality all these countries share.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.640
Where you're seeing far-right movements increase is where you have a white population that feels under threat

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.960
by growing minority or immigrant populations. And so the problem with

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.280
white supremacist terrorism isn't going to go away.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.800
Most of the 65 ideologically extreme incidents that happened in 2017 were linked to anti-government,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.080
fascist, anti-Muslim, homophobic, anti-Semitic, or anti-immigrant motivations ...

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.600
like the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia where a driver rammed a car into a crowd of

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.080
counter-protesters, killing anti-racism protester Heather Heyer.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.000
That rally included members of the alt-right, neo-Nazis and white nationalists. And right now we’re about to

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.720
meet the man who tried to warn the country about this far-right swell way before it even happened.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.560
Daryl Johnson is the man who told the U.S. government it should brace for a resurgence of right-wing violence

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.400
all the way back in 2009.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.040
Daryl Johnson: You know, on the Republican side, there was absolutely no interest in listening to what we

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.560
had to say, which I thought was sad. And what I find staggering is that, you know, I'm a conservative, I'm

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.680
a Republican, and yet I could call out this threat for what it is.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.680
So, Johnson foresaw this. But what made him predict it?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.720
President Obama: I, Barack Hussein Obama do solemnly swear ...

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.400
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts: That I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully ...

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.320
Johnson: But It wasn't until we had the 2008 election that we saw a resurgence in these groups. We had

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.880
the first time African American president, which really agitated a lot of the racist groups.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.000
This was kind of their worst nightmare come true. And then we also had the economic downturn in ‘08 which

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.840
provided fertile ground for a lot of people to join anti-government groups.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.400
Johnson was so worried about a rise in right-wing extremism, he testified before Congress in 2012.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.040
His testimony came in a post-9/11 nation when the U.S. government focused heavily on

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.080
Al Qaeda.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.040
For Johnson this wasn’t some partisan issue. He was a third-generation Republican

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.360
trying to highlight what he saw as a security threat.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.040
Johnson: Eight members of the Hutaree, an extremist militia in Michigan that were acquitted

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.640
this year of plotting to kill police officers and planting bombs at their funerals, had an arsenal of

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.920
weapons at their disposal that was larger than all 230 plus Muslim plotters and attackers charged in the U.S.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.440
since 9/11 combined.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.800
The reward the government gave Johnson and his team was retracting their report and dismantling the team that

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.800
created it.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.760
For decades, the U.S. government has poured money into programs to fight what it calls “violent extremists”

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.360
and “terrorism.” But those are terms which it doesn’t even apply consistently.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.320
Here’s President Trump talking about a mass shooting a white man committed that killed 26 people in

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.640
Sutherland Springs, Texas in November 2017.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.640
Trump: I think that mental health is your problem here. This was a very - based on preliminary reports - very

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.240
deranged individual with a lot of problems over a long period of time.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.880
And here he is talking about allegedly, religiously-motivated violence.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:26.120
Trump: We’re also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism. (applause)

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.320
Most of the governmental programs have focused almost entirely on Muslims, not only stigmatizing

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.360
that group, but also paying very little attention to what the statistics show is the actual threat.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.240
White far-right violence, which often doesn’t earn the label of “terrorism” or “extremism,” hasn’t been

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.240
the government’s priority.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.520
But you don’t have to take my word for it. Take a look at how the nation spends its money.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.560
We don’t really know how much the country has spent on its so-called "Global War on Terror" because the U.S.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.040
doesn’t have an accurate accounting of the funds.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:05.600
But one report estimates that from 2002 to 2017, the U.S. government spent $2.8 trillion on wars

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:13.600
in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Even as funding declined in 2017 from previous levels, the government still

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.760
spent $175 billion that year.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.200
While the nation was shelling out all that money on what it says was countering foreign threats to America,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:33.680
the rate of right-wing domestic attacks increased nearly sixfold from the 2000s to the 2010s.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.440
What did you recommend in your testimony that the government should do?

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.480
Johnson: I recommended that they look at domestic terrorism definition that's codified in our laws because

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.240
right now it's a, it doesn't really fit the definition of what domestic terrorism is.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.880
So that leads to confusion.  I also recommended that we need to have federal dollars devoted to training

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.120
state and local law enforcement on these types of threats.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.640
But to this day, really nothing that I recommended has been implemented.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.720
And there’s something else that’s happened since Johnson has given his congressional testimony

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.480
that's fueled the rise of far-right hate.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.800
Downard: If I was still in the movement, I would be doing what everybody else doing it too. I'd be voting

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.240
for Trump because he's saying all the right stuff.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.720
Jason Downard is a former neo-Nazi who became involved with the group when he was convicted for

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.920
his role in a 2009 drive-by shooting.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.560
Now that you have somebody like Donald Trump, it’s about what he's saying, and he's the

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.320
president of the United States of America. So, you get these neo-Nazis like,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.640
‘Oooh ... we have this president who’s pretty much given us the OK to do whatever the hell we want.'

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.880
He’s not the only one who thinks President Trump bears some responsibility

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.360
for the current wave of far-right fanaticism.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:54.080
He sort of activated them in a way that they hadn't been before. And this is sort of the tragedy of the Trump era.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.080
Critics have skewered Trump for failing to respond clearly and firmly to far-right violence.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.760
Here's what he said after that deadly attack in Charlottesville.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.960
Trump: I think there’s blame on both sides.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.880
You look at both sides, I think there's blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.880
you don’t have any doubt about it either!

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.800
He’s also identified as a nationalist, which some see as a wink and a nod to those who call themselves

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.800
white nationalists.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.640
So, anti-racist critics find it difficult to believe Trump’s being sincere when he says ...

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.880
Trump: We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.600
Instead of putting the government's focus on the right’s growing extremism, Trump’s then-Attorney General Jeff

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.960
Sessions made it a mission to crack down on so-called Black identity extremists.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:50.160
Beirich: This business with Black identity extremists is a classic example of where the federal government under

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.080
Trump is focusing on something that doesn't exist. And the report that was leaked

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.680
that talked about this issue and talked about how there’s a rising threat from Black identity extremists

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.960
basically has no factual backing.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.200
The FBI even did a 12-page report on so-called "Black identity extremist" groups

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.840
it says were targeting law enforcement.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.600
Here’s what they didn’t do a report on ...

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.440
Rep. Bass: “Has the FBI done a report on white identity extremists that are likely motivated to target law

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.440
enforcement officers. Is there such a report?”
Sessions: “I’m not aware of that.”

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:26.960
Meanwhile, far-right groups like the sovereign citizens, actually have targeted law enforcement.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.960
Johnson: They have a significant threat to law enforcement, especially during traffic stops and other

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.840
unplanned encounters because a lot of these groups look at law enforcement as kind of being the foot

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.320
soldiers of a tyrannical government. They view a law enforcement

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.640
as kind of like the government intrusion on their lives.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.040
This administration’s pursuit of so-called “Black identity extremism”

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:53.400
has drawn comparisons to J. Edgar Hoover’s infamous COINTELPRO. It was a covert action

00:10:53.400 --> 00:11:00.840
program that relied on infiltration, dirty tricks, and even violence to neutralize dissidents like Martin Luther King,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.840
Jr. and the Black Panthers.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.960
Trump’s response to far-right extremism is set against this historically-blemished backdrop.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:17.280
Beririch: What is the FBI pursuing in terms of domestic terrorism?  Nobody knows. Like, we don't know. Are

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:24.400
there a thousand open cases on this topic? We have no information. So it's really hard to say the government

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.960
should be doing ‘x’ if we don't even know what the government's been doing.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.040
And then there’s the fact the Trump administration nixed a grant to fund a group

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.040
fighting far-right violence.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:40.200
In the waning days of his presidency, Barack Obama awarded $10 million to 31 groups

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.440
countering violent extremism. Only one of those organizations was focused on

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.760
far-right extremism, Life After Hate.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:55.920
Then Donald Trump took office. His administration re-evaluated all the grants. He ended up giving out only 12

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:02.000
and didn’t dole out the $400,000 grant previously earmarked for Life After Hate.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.800
The distorted narrative of far-right extremism has deep roots within the birth of this nation.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:14.080
Beirich: Well, the country was founded on the idea of racial supremacy. One thing that's interesting is a lot

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:20.000
of the white supremacists who are active in the United States today, really what they ask for when they want

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.840
a white homeland, they're hearkening back to a period that was real, right? Where white men made all the decisions

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.360
and you know, pretty much made life horrible for the rest of the populations in the United States.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.120
But if we’re really looking to understand the growth and effect of far-right extremism in our society today,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.720
we've got to take a look at our past.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:47.400
And we don’t have to travel too far back.
Going back to the decade of Doc Martens and

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.400
dial up is far enough.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:13:06.360
Water Resources Board meeting: ... elements that I have to receive information regarding. (sound of explosion)

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:12.560
Reporter: Holy cow! About a third of the building has been blown away. (sirens)

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.560
Dennis Purifoy: Everything went totally dark

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.880
and I was knocked out of my chair. That seemed to all happen at once.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:25.640
Right-wing hatred is the cause of the deadliest act of domestic political violence in U.S. history.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:30.440
And the face of the attack wasn’t the one Americans initially searched for.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:35.440
Timothy McVeigh: Well, am I pure evil? Am I the face of terror sitting here in front of you?

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.400
So what happens when far-right violence meets an unprepared government?

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:49.240
The federal government of the United States must take full responsibility for Oklahoma City.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.100
Hey, fam. Thanks so much for watching. Don't forget to like, share and subscribe.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.940
And be sure to stay tuned next week when we release part two of our series.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.520
We're headed to Oklahoma City. I hope to see you there.
