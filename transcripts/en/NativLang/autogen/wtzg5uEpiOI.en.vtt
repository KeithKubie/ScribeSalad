00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.140
 A rich civilization that was once spread over Italy has founded old cities and perhaps has us 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.520
 words left as "person" and "Rome" and even the alphabet. 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.100
 The Romans? 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.700
 No, no, not them. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.949
 I mean a former people whose language was almost lost to us. 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.000
 Almost ... but not entirely. 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.620
 Let me take you to Egypt in the mid-nineteenth century. 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.180
 A European traveler is touring the city, and now he is shopping for a souvenir. 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.041
 Roaming the streets he finds the perfect bargain: a sarcophagus with the mummy 

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:42.390
 still packed inside. 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.520
 He drags it back to Vienna and sets it up as a scary showpiece in his house. 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.859
 After his death it is donated to a museum where something strange is found. 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.039
 The bandages of the mummy are filled with letters. 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.289
 And not a few letters. 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.200
 A whole book. 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.129
 An enigmatic book. 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.500
 It was not an Egyptian at all. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.330
 The ink reads inscriptions from Italy made by an ancient civilization such as the Romans 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.500
 called Etrusci or Tusci. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.640
 Today we still call their native Tuscany (Truscani). 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.620
 And now this mummy was wrapped here in the longest Etruscan text ever seen. 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.790
 It was expensive, but this linen book had a problem. 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.070
 A problem that it shared with thousands of others Etruscan inscriptions: the language seemed 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.560
 in no other language. 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.980
 Mysterious ... but deciphered. 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.200
 These letters go from right to left, but turn them around and you will see them in fact 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.100
 our letters are. 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.070
 Look, the famous story goes that the ABCs are scattered from the Phoenicians, to Greece, to 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.720
 Italy, where Rome inherited them. 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.940
 However, we miss a part: it was the Etruscans who distributed the alphabet in Italy. 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.300
 It seems that Greek alphabet that they have inherited had too many sounds for them. 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.930
 Etruscans did fine with voiceless p, t, k, but they did not need the voting b, d, g. 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.000
 In an inscription they even wrote the word "Greece" as "Creice". 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.530
 This is why the Romans, when they borrowed the alphabet, originally made the C statements as well as both 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.700
 k as g. 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.170
 Looking at the Greek alphabet, it should only make the sound "g". 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.090
 In my video about Latin letters this is why we have met an annoyed Roman who has added a tail 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.200
 to that C to make our letter G. 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.700
 But Etruscan did use sounds that are harder to distinguish. 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.760
 Prepare your ears: p, t, k versus ph, th, kh. 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.000
 Such as phersu, mask, a word that lives on in the heart of the English vocabulary. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.900
 Old reports tell us that they also missed the vowel "o". 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.760
 Or, from a linguistic point of view, we would say that they do not distinguish between you and you. 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.980
 If we believe the claim that the name Rome comes from the Etruscans, is an interesting example 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.500
 the word Ruma. 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.210
 So letters were missing in this book, but letters were also added. 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.230
 Like this remarkable eight-looking symbol, previously written as / v / plus / h /. 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.400
 The Romans cut away the H and left us the F. So this is a / f /. 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.340
 Etruscans also had many letters for s sounds, but only used two at a time, one that suggests 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.600
 that they were distinguished from sh. 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.780
 But what do these letters mean? 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:43.590
 The answers are in an old dictionary written by the last person who spoke Etruscan, Emperor Claudius! 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.930
 Whose work has been lost. 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.640
 No dictionaries. 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.200
 No grammars. 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.990
 And many discoveries, frustratingly enough, have never led to an Etruscan Rosetta stone 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.400
 The experts turned to "guesswork": words pull out of the text and guess. 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.400
 Is this by chance Indo-European? 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.240
 No, clearly Semitic! 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.200
 Wait, it's just like Basque! 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.569
 No, no, Hungarian! 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.600
 with the belly full of this vicious circle, Etruscologists have taken a new path. 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.400
 Do not extract words from artifacts; let them in. 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.460
 Then try out combinations like a code without a key. 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.040
 Look at every inscription in its context. 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.000
 Combine different meanings in different contexts until you 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.780
 finds meanings that unlock every text. 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.590
 It was brutal power, but this "Combinatory technique" slowly produced results. 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.100
 We have a glimpse of a real language with real Grammar. 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.230
 It had singular and plural nouns: "clan", "clenar", "ais", "aiser". 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.600
 There were case ends, such as nominative -e at Creice. 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.050
 pronouns such as mi, mini. 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.680
 And verb forms: "tur" had a past tense "turuce". 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.600
 We have uncovered a language that sounds dynamic and changeable. 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.920
 Vowels became easier with time. 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.889
 The hero Ajax was once Aivas but later became Eivas or Evas. 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:20.000
 The word for the gods, the highest Etruscan concern, was plaintiff and later plaintiff. 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.220
 They used core consonants where we would expect vowels: lautn. 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.720
 Or maybe weak vowels, such as Atlnta. 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.810
 These shattered Etruscan words suggest that language was undergoing a major shift. 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.290
 After centuries of writing, inscriptions started to leave out vowels after the first consonant 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:47.250
 The Etruscan name for itself was once Rasenna but Rasna became, and in one inscription 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.200
 a Latin word is divided into preśnts. 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.920
 It is an important indication that Etruscan words started with a heavy accent on their first syllable: 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.639
 not / ra'senna / but / 'rasenna /. 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.139
 Comparing translations and pronunciations yielded even more results. 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:11.550
 Take quasi-bilingual, these inscribed Etruscan artifacts with a Latin or Greek Doppelgänger. 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:18.430
 My favorite are 'talking objects', aristocratic gifts that speak for themselves: mini muluvanice 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.600
 Laris Velχanas. 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.199
 It is very quirky, but it is plausible when we find out that objects talk that way 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.900
 in Latin and Greek and Venetian. 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.230
 We even found hints of a context for the language itself, a language that is so different 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.680
 from his neighbors. 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.360
 A fascinating stone from the Greek island of Lemnos is surrounded by a soldier 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.270
 by letters and words that really resemble Etruscan. 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.910
 Is this a lost sister language? 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.610
 A dialect? 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.370
 Perhaps Etruscan was not so alone. 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.200
 Did it belong to a larger family of Tyrrhenian languages? 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.230
 The language of that linen book is still mysterious. 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:05.470
 We do not know how this text ended up in Egypt, but thanks to all this work we can say it 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.400
 is a kind of ritual calendar. 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:15.630
 And sometimes we can follow whole lines of text: "celi huθiś zaθrumiś flerχva 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.400
 neθunsl śucri θezric ". 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.200
 It's almost like if you close your eyes I can take you back to the days of fluent Etruscan, 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.800
 but ask how you can say a simple yes or no and we are lost again. 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.100
 Hang around and subscribe for language.
