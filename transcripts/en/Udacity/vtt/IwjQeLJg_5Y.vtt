00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this unit, we learned how to specify tokens using regular expressions.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We could break down HTML and JavaScript into words,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the smallest unit of meaning.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In the next part of this class, we're going to learn how to combine those words--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
combine those tokens into sentences, into utterances that are starting to make sense.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We're going to check them using rules of syntax, just like the rules we have

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in natural languages.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's an exciting time, and it's a necessary part on our way to making an interpreter

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
for HTML and JavaScript a web browser.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I hope you'll join me for our next unit.
