00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.900
So interesting.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.710
So, I'm wondering whether this,
if we have a C that is aspecific,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.980
which is to say the probability that I
get it right if it's one kind of thing

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.630
versus the probability I get it right if
it's some other kind of thing, we can

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.379
probably generalize that C to having
a different C for each of the actions.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we could.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.000
I don't want to, but we could.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.765
Actually, I think the more likely case
in some sense is a weird one that seems

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.860
counter-intuitive, which is not for
every action to have a different C.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.710
But what's the probability that
I would say something is right,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.610
versus the probability I
would say something is wrong?

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.470
Those don't have to be
the same probability.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.990
This C actually represents the
probability that the label I give you is

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.530
correct, but
there are actually more possibilities.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.230
There can be,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.740
there's a difference between a false
positive and a false negative.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.280
&gt;&gt; Got it
&gt;&gt; So,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.240
we're treating it as if there's only two
cases here, but there's actually four.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.940
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's fair.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.574
&gt;&gt; But no one wants to do that.

00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:53.697
So, the last thing I'll say about this
before I move on to my last slide is

00:00:53.697 --> 00:00:56.277
notice that I've acted as if
there's only two cases here.

00:00:56.277 --> 00:01:00.201
There's the case where any policy can be
optimal, and then, there's a case where

00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:03.960
only one can be optimal, but
there's actually spaces in between here.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.272
So, you could imagine a case where
you might say, well, there can

00:01:08.272 --> 00:01:12.979
be more than one optimal policy but
it's more likely there's only one.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.742
It's slightly less likely
that there are two.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:19.100
It's slightly less likely that there
are three and so on and so forth.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.819
And you can have a prior over any
of the combinations of actions

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.830
being optimal and
that prior need not be uniformed.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.447
And in fact, even here,

00:01:29.447 --> 00:01:34.607
we're actually assuming a distribution
over all the possible two to the N minus

00:01:34.607 --> 00:01:39.630
one policies in such a way that each
action independently is equally likely.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.830
You could set things up so that, yeah,
sure, it may be the case that there's

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.690
more than one optimal policy, but
A alone is much more likely than A and

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.430
B which is even more likely than A,
B, and C and so on and so forth.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.130
&gt;&gt; Does that make things much
hairier in terms of the formulas?

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.690
&gt;&gt; Much hairier.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.400
I mean the reason we end up with
something that's this simple over here,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.350
and this simple in the general case, and
this simple in the only one case is that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.740
we get to eliminate
all the common priors.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.290
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.120
&gt;&gt; And if we can't eliminate it,
we gotta carry them around with us.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.870
&gt;&gt; Neat.
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.830
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's cool.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.002
Now, does this tell us what to do also
if we have a prior that some action is

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:15.538
correct, because, let's say, we've
been learning for a while like, yeah,

00:02:15.538 --> 00:02:17.670
that really seems like
the right thing to do, and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.657
then the human is telling
us something else.

00:02:19.657 --> 00:02:23.730
Can we factor in the information that
we've gotten from our own experience?

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.810
&gt;&gt; That is exactly what I was going to
bring up next, so why don't I do that?

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.540
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
