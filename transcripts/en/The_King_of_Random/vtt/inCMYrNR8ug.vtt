00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.924
In today's video,

00:00:00.924 --> 00:00:04.160
we're going to see what happens
if we take our DIY sandblaster,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.400
and use it on a steak.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.460
We might try it
with salt as well.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.100
[Music]

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.460
We recently showed you
how to make a DIY sandblaster,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.140
and today, we're going
to see what happens

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.940
if we sandblast this piece
of steak here.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.501
So here's the basic idea.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:24.994
We are going to sandblast
our steak first,

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:26.028
raw, then cooked,

00:00:26.028 --> 00:00:29.312
and then if it works out,
we're gonna try it with salt.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:39.100
[Music]

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.840
What is it?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.218
It's lighter fluid
and it's cold out so...

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.620
Are you sure it's not water?

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.420
[Music]

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.400
Guys, it's under 60 degrees.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.220
I am unhappy.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.080
This makes me happy.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.900
I'm a witch, I cannot burn.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.980
[Music]

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.900
All right, that looks

00:01:02.908 --> 00:01:05.810
like it should be big enough
to cover most of that steak.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.700
So I'm just going to try
cutting a star shape out,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.300
and we're going to use
that as a stencil

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.188
as we sandblasting.

00:01:11.188 --> 00:01:13.250
We're going to see
if it really does anything

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.205
to the steak or not.

00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:14.920
So again,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.640
because this was
a DIY sandblaster,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.100
we did file in that hole.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.020
So we're just going
to add that bottle.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.980
[Music]

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.603
So when your sandblasting
and your etching,

00:01:30.603 --> 00:01:31.754
let's see glass,

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:33.992
it's usually only
at about 30 PSI.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.140
I believe the wood was 90.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.600
So what are we using
for the the steak?

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.480
[muffled voice]

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.160
Cool.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.240
Let's start low,
and then try higher.

00:01:43.992 --> 00:01:45.502
So we're going to start low,

00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:47.502
and we're going
to work our way up.

00:01:47.502 --> 00:01:53.800
[Music]

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.520
I got all the personal
protection equipment on.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.420
Let's try sandblasting a steak.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:13.040
[Music]

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.280
It is really stuck on there.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.520
That--

00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:20.112
That sand is quite well stuck
into the steak, I think.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.740
I think, at this point,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.650
you're not going
to get an indentation.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.054
I think you're just going
to get a charred star where the

00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:29.345
where the sand is.

00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:30.235
It's possible.

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:31.061
Let's try it,

00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:34.200
like let's crank the PSI up,
and try it like a hundred.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:51.360
[Music]

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.300
What did you do?

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.700
Oh my gosh.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.180
All right.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.140
A hundred PSI.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.340
That's what it will do
to your skin.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.282
It turns out at 100 PSI

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.500
and 40 PSI do very different
things in a sandblaster.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.860
That is pulverized.

00:03:15.312 --> 00:03:16.450
Now, maybe at 30,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.366
it would just bounce off your
skin and sting a little bit.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.850
But don't do it at a hundred.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.340
That was pretty nuts,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.740
watching it just carve
into the steak,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.842
and we want to do it again.

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:27.350
We're going to try and catch it
in a little bit of slow motion,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.580
and see how much
that's really digging in there,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.440
because that seemed insane.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.427
Do you think we
can cut it in half?

00:03:33.427 --> 00:03:34.300
I bet we could.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.020
Let's try it.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:47.260
[Music]

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.700
Yeah, there's steak
on the camera lens.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.860
That's cool.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.240
We've hit a steak with sand,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.498
and now, we want to see
what happens if we use something

00:03:56.498 --> 00:03:58.914
that won't destroy our teeth
and be completely inedible.

00:03:58.914 --> 00:04:01.550
So we're going to try pouring
some salt into our sandblaster,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.200
and see if that has
the same effect.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.860
[Music]

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.120
I've never tried
saltblasting anything before,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.900
so I don't know what
it's abrasive power is.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.600
So real quick,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.067
I'm just going to try hitting
a piece of glass with it,

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:17.162
and see if it etches
that the way the sand does.

00:04:17.162 --> 00:04:21.540
[Music]

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.400
Nope.

00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:23.902
Nothing.

00:04:25.502 --> 00:04:26.850
So salt is not nearly

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.650
as hard as the sand we were
using as an abrassive before,

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.870
so it does not etch
the glass the same way

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.900
that the sand does.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.900
I still think it's going
to get through the steak.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.980
It's not even salty.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.200
We saw what the salt
did to glass.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.900
I don't think this is going
to do nearly as much damage

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.652
as it did with the sand,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.920
but I do think it's going
to tenderize the meat,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.540
maybe just a little.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:05:00.460
[Music]

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.800
That seemed to tear
into it more,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.820
even though it's
at the lower PSI.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.700
Yeah.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.280
How strange?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.360
[Music]

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.500
There you go.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.740
[Music]

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.200
So at 40 PSI,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.400
it really does just seem
to stick onto the surface.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.852
It doesn't carve into it.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.140
60, it started going
in a little bit,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.250
and we saw what a hundred did
with sand, now,

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.319
I think we want to try
a hundred of salt

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:30.350
on the other side of this.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.700
It's already chewed up
a little bit from the 60.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.102
I'm gonna chew it up a lot.

00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:45.820
[Music]

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.860
So...

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.400
Oh no.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.650
Steaks are sometimes tenderized
by like little knives going in,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.351
and cutting up some
of the fibers.

00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:57.727
I think we may have found
a different way to go

00:05:57.727 --> 00:05:58.611
about doing that.

00:05:58.611 --> 00:05:59.247
This is...

00:05:59.247 --> 00:06:01.600
This is a new way
to make ground beef.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.401
Just about.

00:06:02.401 --> 00:06:04.460
Oh boy, that's exciting.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.040
That is just shredded.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.520
Look at that texture.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.280
Let's throw this on the grill.

00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:10.100
I wonder if it's
gonna be any good.

00:06:10.112 --> 00:06:11.727
Yeah, let's find out.

00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:26.840
[Music]

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.340
All right.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.020
So now we've ripped
up a few steaks,

00:06:29.028 --> 00:06:30.939
some with salt,
some with sand.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.914
None are looking really tasty.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.956
So let's make some edible ones.

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:38.182
The one we shredded
with salt might still be good,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.816
but we don't know yet.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.000
It's still cooking.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.760
We'll try it.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.940
We're going to try using
a few different kinds of things.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.809
We've got some different
kinds of seasoning.

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:49.230
We've got some garlic salt,
some steak dust that we,

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.750
I think will mix with some salt,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.172
and we're going to try
a medium PSI, maybe

00:06:53.172 --> 00:06:56.917
the 60 that was sort of tearing
into the steak a little bit,

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:58.250
but not shredding it.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.040
I like it.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.440
So the first mix

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.040
that we're going to try is
just simple garlic salt.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.440
Should be pretty good.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:18.700
[Music]

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.900
Oh, I can taste
the garlic in the air.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.060
All right, so we have tenderized
the garlic salt steak.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.620
Let's throw it on the grill.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.900
This is the piece of steak
that we shredded with salt.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.750
On the other side,

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.220
you can see it's
completely toe up.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.653
This piece of steak
has nothing on it yet.

00:07:36.653 --> 00:07:39.241
We're going to see what happens
if we salt blast it

00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:40.742
after it's completed cooking.

00:07:40.772 --> 00:07:41.950
Similarly to the other piece

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.280
of steak that we're going
to try sandblasting cooked.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.640
All right.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.559
I think we've got
some other flavors we can try.

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:49.750
Yeah, let's do it.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.755
Now, this is like a fine powder.

00:07:51.755 --> 00:07:53.950
So we are keeping
the salt in there,

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.300
just so we've got something

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.341
that's going to be
a little bit stronger.

00:07:57.341 --> 00:07:59.358
Also, can we throw
this one on the grill?

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.440
That's the one we cut
in half with sand.

00:08:01.444 --> 00:08:04.600
So yes, we just have to make
sure we don't eat it afterward.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.717
Challenge accepted.

00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:06.829
No, don't eat that.

00:08:06.829 --> 00:08:09.300
Your teeth will be gone
and your happiness.

00:08:09.326 --> 00:08:10.779
My dad's a dentist.

00:08:10.832 --> 00:08:11.632
All right.

00:08:11.632 --> 00:08:13.750
We're going to go
for about 80 PSI.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.852
A hundred shreds it.

00:08:15.852 --> 00:08:17.900
60 barely gets
into it a little bit.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.940
40 just decorates the surface.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.400
Let's try 80.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.030
I think 80 is a little high.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:30.820
To the grill?

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.660
One more for the grill.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.100
Guys, there's nothing
better than eating Science.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.440
And for those of you
who are saying we're just doing

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.400
this experiment as
an excuse to eat steak,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.180
not only,

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.280
but like I mean partly.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.520
Mostly.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.091
While Nate finishes
cooking these,

00:08:48.091 --> 00:08:49.550
I'm going to go ahead and see

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.050
if I can salt blast
a cooked steak,

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.620
and see if we can cut
that in half, too.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:07.540
[Music]

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.040
That was with salt.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:17.280
[Music]

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.920
This is so salty.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.140
It's good though.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:21.700
All right.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.940
So this is sand steaks.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.360
We're not going
to eat these ones

00:09:25.371 --> 00:09:26.992
because they're covered in sand.

00:09:26.992 --> 00:09:29.550
This one, we're going
to now sandblast,

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.020
even though it's been cooked.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:40.000
[Music]

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.350
All right, let's take a look
at what we've made here.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.371
So this plate...

00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:45.350
Oh, with an exacto knife on it.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.426
Oh, there you go.

00:09:46.426 --> 00:09:49.180
This plate is entirely
non-edible at this point.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.340
Well, okay.

00:09:50.347 --> 00:09:52.179
So that, was any of the salt,

00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:54.149
there's a salt--
&gt;&gt; This is all sand.

00:09:54.149 --> 00:09:54.950
Okay.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.661
These two are
what we sandblasted

00:09:57.661 --> 00:09:59.200
before we cook them.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.658
That's right.

00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:01.350
And we just cooked them to see
what would happen.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.663
And then we sandblasted
this one afterwards.

00:10:03.663 --> 00:10:04.799
After we cooked it.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:06.592
Yes, and it did shred into it.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.580
Although not quite as easily
as it shredded into this one.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.020
And then these two,

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.032
the bigger pieces
here, we've got...

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.460
This is garlic salt.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.360
Yours is the one--
&gt;&gt; Steak dust.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.480
Steak dust.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.460
So this one,
we cooked first,

00:10:19.475 --> 00:10:20.747
and then we salt blasted,

00:10:20.747 --> 00:10:23.700
and this one was actually salt
blasted before we cooked it.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.100
Correct.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.780
It's probably way too salty.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.940
Yeah, we're not going
to eat that one.

00:10:26.948 --> 00:10:28.650
I think we need
to taste everything.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.050
See how it-- I am curious
about these ones,

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.062
because like we did use
quite a bit of salt

00:10:34.062 --> 00:10:35.616
and garlic flavoring,

00:10:35.616 --> 00:10:37.385
like being sprayed down

00:10:37.385 --> 00:10:41.220
into them that may not be
a great way to make steak.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.080
Let's see.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.500
[Music]

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.800
Slightly overcooked.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.300
That is...

00:10:51.906 --> 00:10:53.368
That is very salty.

00:10:54.282 --> 00:10:55.082
Oh boy.

00:10:55.082 --> 00:10:55.900
Is that ever?

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.348
I'm going to try the one
that we hit with 100 PSI

00:10:59.348 --> 00:11:00.713
and like chewed up.

00:11:00.713 --> 00:11:01.072
Wait.

00:11:01.072 --> 00:11:01.572
Wait.

00:11:01.572 --> 00:11:03.616
I'm trying this too.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.160
We go down together.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.260
Oh my gosh.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.080
There is no flavor except salt.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.920
And now you get to watch
10 minutes of us eating steak.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:24.500
[Music]

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.480
I don't really recommend you use
sandblaster on your steak.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.040
It's not a good way to get
a nice even distribution.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.611
Just sprinkle some on.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.340
Works way better.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.160
Yeah.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.660
Guys, that's all for today.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.860
But there's always more
for you to see.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.240
That box up at the top
will take you to our last video.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.060
You should go check that out.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.240
The other box will show you

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.040
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.855
And if you haven't subscribed
to the channel yet,

00:11:43.855 --> 00:11:44.984
hit this bomb to get
in the club,

00:11:44.984 --> 00:11:46.551
and that way, you'll
never miss out on the fun.

00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:47.540
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.657
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.600
Talk to you then.
