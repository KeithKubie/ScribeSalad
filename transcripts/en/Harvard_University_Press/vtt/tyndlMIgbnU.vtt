00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.100
Can we escape who we are?

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.060
I think of myself as an artist making drawings,
even when the charcoal is replaced by a spoken

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:17.120
word or by an ink word, where we are led by
a line, in this case by an ink line, a kind of

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.080
lapidary thinking and drawing, an embroidery
of words and lines.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:32.661
To bring us to some new image, to some new
sentence, and then to take this all back,

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:36.770
all the potential taken back.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.590
All the potential returned into the pen, the
barrel of the pen refilled, the pen becoming

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.200
again a loaded weapon full of every other
thought that is yet to be expressed.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.940
But understanding that as each word is said,
it cuts off all the possibility of other thoughts.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.550
Can a drawing escape where it is going?

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.410
When it begins, when one is circling the studio,
everything is possible.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.470
There's a new sheet of paper, all the energy is
waiting in one's arm ready to make the decision.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.500
But as it lands, as it gets ready to land,
all that potential gets limited, gets coalesced,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.200
and it becomes... a coffee pot.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.480
Launched again, a new sheet of paper, new
possibilities, and while the shards are in

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.960
the air there's the, it's possible for, for,
it's possible for anything to arrive.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.880
But what comes?

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.900
Another coffee pot.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.369
There's a question of can we better than we
are, can we be other than we are.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.490
There's the hope for something new to arrive,
that this time, this time, this time there

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.590
will be something different.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.579
But what comes... a typewriter.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.910
Trying for something new in what will happen.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.780
Can we stop the redaction of all potentiality?

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.250
And in the end we are reduced to making ourselves
as a self portrait.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:18.400
A self portrait as a rhinoceros, a self portrait
as a typewriter, a self portrait as a coffee pot,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.200
a self portrait as a megaphone.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.260
All that we wish we could be.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.930
And then there is a torschluss-panik, the
fear that with each decision that is made,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.760
with the final arrival of the image, all other
images are cut out, the door to other possibilities

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.599
closes behind us, and we turn in panic to
the sound of that door.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.439
And what would we wish for?

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:55.019
I mean, for the shards, for once, to land as
a phrase in the subjunctive, in French ultramarine?

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.549
For a diagram of a galaxy in cobalt violet?

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.959
For a gryphon, for a baby sphinx in one's
arms?

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.319
For a clear line of sight from the history
of Greek slavery to the complexities of the

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.589
political situation we are in now?

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:15.809
We'd wish for a painting of peonies by Robert
Motherwell, in rose madder alizarin.

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:22.360
For the design of a new escapement for a watch.
For just one unqualified, unguarded, declarative

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.569
certainty.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:31.239
But even as these possible ideas emerge, they
become so limited, so small, and the gap between

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.870
that part of us which feels all that we should
be gets larger and larger, and the only safe

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.000
space is the edge, the margins, of the circle.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:53.000
