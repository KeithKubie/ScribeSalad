00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.490
We all want of course to be happy

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:09.960
But the strange thing about being properly happy is that it's a state that requires us to learn and regularly

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.649
practice a slightly odd sounding related skill

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.440
knowing how to be sad

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.890
Everyday a lot of stuff happens to us which is in one way or another pretty hurtful

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.920
Someone doesn't call someone says no a project isn't going to work out

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.040
You'd think we then just spontaneously feel sad for a bit and that would be the end of it

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.939
But that's not ,it seems,how many of us actually work.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.349
Frequently our minds which are squeamish by Nature

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.789
Rigorously shut out unfortunate negative feelings and go into a state of what psychologists called denial

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.779
Where difficult but true information is refused access

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.538
We may as a result of burying our feelings develop a number of symptoms

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.548
We can't sleep, bits of our bodies start a twitch, we develop an addiction

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.689
Or there's another option

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.879
We become extremely surely not happy as such

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.779
But brittle and insistent in a fake kind of upbeatness , the sort of happiness that can't tolerate any

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.560
sadness

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.229
Here's a couple Ben and Freya. There's a lot of sadness in Freya

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.860
But she's learned not to let any of it in to consciousness

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.969
So she's often extremely cheery and rather bad at picking up on other people's need to be sad

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.148
Let's watch a little film about these people

00:01:42.148 --> 00:01:44.148
ah,what's wrong with you, looking all gloom?

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.899
Nothing to be gloom about, it's the weekend!

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.379
[what] should we do this weekend party party was it's all Friday Friday gotta get down on Friday

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.780
[we] love that don't you know what I think about the other day you're so good at karaoke. [I] love it when you do karaoke

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.679
Saturday night and I like the way you move yeah

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.929
You don't know you're ticklish around in here. You can [whisper] [all] open

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.688
We need to be sympathetic the origins of jolliness are pretty painful

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.419
They're often to do with having had a parent or early caregiver who for one reason or another

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.539
Couldn't tolerate problems or any difficulties

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.849
They were perhaps depressed or otherwise

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.989
Fragile so quite early on the manically jolly person got into the role of being an upbeat cheerleader

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.649
Not because they were but because they had to be

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.280
Pain is of course horrible thing to feel

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.429
But because it is a part of our reality we need to have the courage to allow it to work its way

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.289
Properly through our system. We need to learn to feel the pain of our lives authentically

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.799
Before it's joys can feel real as well

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.439
Pushing problems aside is deeply tempting but our pleasures will only feel authentic

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.469
when we've first given the pain all the space it truly deserves in our lives

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.819
