it's incredible later on I learned that
it was a cicada and that they come out

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020
it was a cicada and that they come out
 

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.110
it was a cicada and that they come out
periodically either every seven or every

one of those and I went to the library
 

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.590
one of those and I went to the library
and I wrote up all this stuff about

cicadas I have no idea why I did that
 

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.210
cicadas I have no idea why I did that
but I did it and of course I had three

in any case to me it was indicative of
 

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.360
in any case to me it was indicative of
my interest in science but of course I

undergraduate and decided to go to
 

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.050
undergraduate and decided to go to
graduate school in science which is what

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.060
graduate school in science which is what
 

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.290
graduate school in science which is what
I did and that led to me sort of to the

told you I had was in nature so when I
 

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.230
told you I had was in nature so when I
approached science I wanted to somehow

my wife they were going to go out and do

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800
my wife they were going to go out and do
 

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.590
my wife they were going to go out and do
this research and I decided since I was

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600
this research and I decided since I was
 

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.000
this research and I decided since I was
a geneticist I'm going to figure out a

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.010
a geneticist I'm going to figure out a
 

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.700
a geneticist I'm going to figure out a
way to integrate my interest in genetics

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:19.710
way to integrate my interest in genetics
 

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.360
way to integrate my interest in genetics
into this project and and I went out as

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.370
into this project and and I went out as
 

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.100
into this project and and I went out as
well and we live there along with

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.110
well and we live there along with
 

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.810
well and we live there along with
several other people for a number of

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820
several other people for a number of
 

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:32.480
several other people for a number of
years so what I would I went out to do

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:32.490
years so what I would I went out to do
 

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.730
years so what I would I went out to do
something and I'm going to tell you give

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740
something and I'm going to tell you give
 

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.610
something and I'm going to tell you give
you the punchline first and this is

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620
you the punchline first and this is
 

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.600
you the punchline first and this is
really important if you want to be a

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:38.610
really important if you want to be a
 

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.730
really important if you want to be a
scientist I went out and spent two years

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:40.740
scientist I went out and spent two years
 

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.220
scientist I went out and spent two years
doing research to prove something that I

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:43.230
doing research to prove something that I
 

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.040
doing research to prove something that I
ended up not proving I failed to prove

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.050
ended up not proving I failed to prove
 

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.310
ended up not proving I failed to prove
this in fact what everyone said was true

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320
this in fact what everyone said was true
 

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.830
this in fact what everyone said was true
was true and I was wrong and that's

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:51.840
was true and I was wrong and that's
 

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.920
was true and I was wrong and that's
really important to confront because

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:54.930
really important to confront because
 

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.660
really important to confront because
that happens over and over again when

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:56.670
that happens over and over again when
 

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.270
that happens over and over again when
you do science so this is what we call

00:10:59.270 --> 00:10:59.280
you do science so this is what we call
 

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.590
you do science so this is what we call
jelly bean genetics because the

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600
jelly bean genetics because the
 

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.770
jelly bean genetics because the
prevailing theory at that time i work an

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:03.780
prevailing theory at that time i work an
 

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.390
prevailing theory at that time i work an
area called population genetics that is

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:05.400
area called population genetics that is
 

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.160
area called population genetics that is
how or how is genetic variation

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:07.170
how or how is genetic variation
 

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.600
how or how is genetic variation
distributed in populations and why

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:09.610
distributed in populations and why
 

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.190
distributed in populations and why
okay the prevailing theory was that

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200
okay the prevailing theory was that
 

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.780
okay the prevailing theory was that
genes basically spread throughout a

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:12.790
genes basically spread throughout a
 

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.329
genes basically spread throughout a
population in a random fashion so it

00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:15.339
population in a random fashion so it
 

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:16.800
population in a random fashion so it
would be like if you closed your eyes

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:16.810
would be like if you closed your eyes
 

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.150
would be like if you closed your eyes
and just stuck your hand in the

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160
and just stuck your hand in the
 

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.829
and just stuck your hand in the
jellybean jar and pulled out a jellybean

00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839
jellybean jar and pulled out a jellybean
 

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.690
jellybean jar and pulled out a jellybean
well if you look at the one on the Left

you'll see nine of them are red and one

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.190
you'll see nine of them are red and one
 

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.699
you'll see nine of them are red and one
is yellow so your chance of getting a

is yellow so your chance of getting a
 

00:11:26.709 --> 00:11:29.040
is yellow so your chance of getting a
red one is ninety percent right and

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.050
red one is ninety percent right and
 

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.019
red one is ninety percent right and
that's basically what the theory was it

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:31.029
that's basically what the theory was it
 

00:11:31.029 --> 00:11:32.579
that's basically what the theory was it
is whatever the frequency of the genes

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:32.589
is whatever the frequency of the genes
 

00:11:32.589 --> 00:11:34.530
is whatever the frequency of the genes
are in the population that's what will

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:34.540
are in the population that's what will
 

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.680
are in the population that's what will
be sampled from in creating the next

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:37.690
be sampled from in creating the next
 

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.139
be sampled from in creating the next
generation and that's it and that's how

00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:40.149
generation and that's it and that's how
 

00:11:40.149 --> 00:11:42.030

it will proceed just now I couldn't

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040
it will proceed just now I couldn't
 

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.530
it will proceed just now I couldn't
believe that that was true and the

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:43.540
believe that that was true and the
 

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.460
believe that that was true and the
reason I couldn't believe is true

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:44.470
reason I couldn't believe is true
 

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.990
reason I couldn't believe is true
because when you look at how monkeys are

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000
because when you look at how monkeys are
 

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.790
because when you look at how monkeys are
organized they're socially organized

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800

leave the group they're born into they

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:58.060
leave the group they're born into they
 

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.400
leave the group they're born into they
stay in that group their whole life and

stay in that group their whole life and
 

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.900
stay in that group their whole life and
their daughters do and their

their daughters do and their
 

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.750
their daughters do and their

said it can't be random because they're

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:05.260
said it can't be random because they're
 

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.170
said it can't be random because they're
not moving so every group can't be a

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:07.180
not moving so every group can't be a
 

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.759

moving the males on the other hand are

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:11.890
moving the males on the other hand are
 

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.550
moving the males on the other hand are
dispersing all over and there is a

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560
dispersing all over and there is a
 

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.680
dispersing all over and there is a
skewed sex ratio so there are many many

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:16.690
skewed sex ratio so there are many many
 

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.540
skewed sex ratio so there are many many
more females at adulthood than there are

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:18.550
more females at adulthood than there are
 

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.250
more females at adulthood than there are
males even though at Birth that's not

males even though at Birth that's not
 

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.990
males even though at Birth that's not
true because what do males do they

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000
true because what do males do they
 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.120
true because what do males do they
engage in risky behavior and they die

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.130
engage in risky behavior and they die
 

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.610
engage in risky behavior and they die
right they get injured and they die

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:26.620
right they get injured and they die
 

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.009
right they get injured and they die
that's not that different from humans

00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:29.019
that's not that different from humans
 

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:31.620
that's not that different from humans
right adolescent males engage in very

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:31.630
right adolescent males engage in very
 

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.180
right adolescent males engage in very
risky behavior and often get themselves

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.190

there's a dominance hierarchy if they

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:47.410
there's a dominance hierarchy if they
 

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.840
there's a dominance hierarchy if they
get beat up and run off they don't

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:48.850

actually mate with females and so

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:50.620
actually mate with females and so
 

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.439
actually mate with females and so
there's a lot of variability so I looked

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:52.449
there's a lot of variability so I looked
 

00:12:52.449 --> 00:12:54.030
there's a lot of variability so I looked
at all this and I said it can't be jelly

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040

ecologically very interesting area okay
 

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.009
ecologically very interesting area okay
so we did genetics the hard way because

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:46.019
so we did genetics the hard way because
 

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:47.810
so we did genetics the hard way because
we couldn't do it the way you can do now

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820
we couldn't do it the way you can do now

DNA you want we couldn't do that then we
 

00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:59.090
DNA you want we couldn't do that then we
had to actually get blood samples so we

00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100
had to actually get blood samples so we
 

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.220
had to actually get blood samples so we
had to trap these animals take blood

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:01.230
had to trap these animals take blood
 

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.230
had to trap these animals take blood
samples we had to do it in a in a very

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240

up only get whole groups at once take

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:09.300
up only get whole groups at once take
 

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.879
up only get whole groups at once take
the whole group back to their home range

00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:10.889
the whole group back to their home range
 

00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:12.860
the whole group back to their home range
and release them all at once everything

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:12.870
and release them all at once everything
 

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.329
and release them all at once everything
had to be done and I can actually say

00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:14.339
had to be done and I can actually say
 

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:16.819
had to be done and I can actually say
that about 500 trappings we never lost

00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:16.829
that about 500 trappings we never lost
 

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:18.410
that about 500 trappings we never lost
an animal's so I'm really pleased that

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420
an animal's so I'm really pleased that
 

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.329
an animal's so I'm really pleased that
we that happened and all the groups were

00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339
we that happened and all the groups were
 

00:14:20.339 --> 00:14:22.639
we that happened and all the groups were
fine after we released them but anyway

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:22.649
fine after we released them but anyway
 

00:14:22.649 --> 00:14:25.160
fine after we released them but anyway
it was very very tough work so what did

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:25.170
it was very very tough work so what did

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.430
right then that pie which represents the
total amount of genetic diversity in

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440
total amount of genetic diversity in
 

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.650
total amount of genetic diversity in
this area that we worked in that pie

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660
this area that we worked in that pie
 

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.670
this area that we worked in that pie
right most of it right should be of that

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680
right most of it right should be of that
 

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.340
right most of it right should be of that
stippled type okay when you see a pie

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:49.350
stippled type okay when you see a pie
 

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.629
stippled type okay when you see a pie
where most of it is stupid like that

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639
where most of it is stupid like that
 

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:52.370
where most of it is stupid like that
that means genes are basically Luke

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380
that means genes are basically Luke
 

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.170
that means genes are basically Luke
being distributed around the population

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180
being distributed around the population
 

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.150
being distributed around the population
at random it means that all the genetic

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160
at random it means that all the genetic
 

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.250
at random it means that all the genetic
variation in the area can be found in

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260
variation in the area can be found in
 

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.809
variation in the area can be found in
every single one of these social groups

00:14:59.809 --> 00:14:59.819
every single one of these social groups
 

00:14:59.819 --> 00:15:01.460
every single one of these social groups
because it's just moving over the

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:01.470
because it's just moving over the
 

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.199
because it's just moving over the
landscape and that's what you see and

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:03.209
landscape and that's what you see and
 

00:15:03.209 --> 00:15:05.360
landscape and that's what you see and
only four percent of that variation

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:05.370
only four percent of that variation
 

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.920
only four percent of that variation
actually is made up of differences

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:06.930
actually is made up of differences
 

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.139
actually is made up of differences
between groups which is tiny this is

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:09.149
between groups which is tiny this is
 

00:15:09.149 --> 00:15:11.389
between groups which is tiny this is
essentially random I was wrong it is

00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399
essentially random I was wrong it is
 

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:14.990
essentially random I was wrong it is
jellybean genetics okay but I still

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000
jellybean genetics okay but I still
 

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.309
jellybean genetics okay but I still
couldn't believe that that was I mean I

00:15:16.309 --> 00:15:16.319
couldn't believe that that was I mean I
 

00:15:16.319 --> 00:15:17.720
couldn't believe that that was I mean I
didn't come all this way to find out

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:17.730
didn't come all this way to find out
 

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.350
didn't come all this way to find out
that I was wrong so we looked at samples

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360
that I was wrong so we looked at samples
 

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.639
that I was wrong so we looked at samples
from other areas you see those different

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:22.649
from other areas you see those different
 

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:23.900
from other areas you see those different
letters of sampling other parts of the

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:23.910
letters of sampling other parts of the
 

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.030
letters of sampling other parts of the
range and we looked at it at different

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040
range and we looked at it at different
 

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.710
range and we looked at it at different
levels the one I just showed you is in

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720
levels the one I just showed you is in
 

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.360
levels the one I just showed you is in
the upper left then we looked at

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:29.370
the upper left then we looked at
 

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.790
the upper left then we looked at
differences between local populations

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800
differences between local populations
 

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.610
differences between local populations
within the region

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:32.620
within the region
 

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.840
within the region
which is the one in the upper right

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:33.850
which is the one in the upper right
 

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.060
which is the one in the upper right
again most of the circle is stiffel

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.070
again most of the circle is stiffel
 

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:37.770
again most of the circle is stiffel
which means the genes are being randomly

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:37.780
which means the genes are being randomly
 

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.140
which means the genes are being randomly
stood over an even larger area than we

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:40.150
stood over an even larger area than we
 

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.260
stood over an even larger area than we
thought a whole region then we looked at

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:43.270
thought a whole region then we looked at
 

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.680
thought a whole region then we looked at
regions within this range of the species

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:45.690
regions within this range of the species
 

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.240
regions within this range of the species
most of the genetic variation in the

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.250
most of the genetic variation in the
 

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.490
most of the genetic variation in the
entire species can be found in little

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:50.500
entire species can be found in little
 

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.070
entire species can be found in little
social groups or in local populations

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:53.080
social groups or in local populations
 

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.590
social groups or in local populations
showing you it is just completely random

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600
showing you it is just completely random
 

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.500
showing you it is just completely random
the way the genetic variation going I

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:57.510
the way the genetic variation going I
 

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.390
the way the genetic variation going I
still wasn't satisfied as I said I

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:00.400
still wasn't satisfied as I said I
 

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.970
still wasn't satisfied as I said I
didn't come all this way to be wrong so

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:02.980
didn't come all this way to be wrong so
 

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.820
didn't come all this way to be wrong so
I looked at other species again the same

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:05.830
I looked at other species again the same
 

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.750
I looked at other species again the same
thing I'm still wrong okay now the

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:09.760
thing I'm still wrong okay now the
 

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.640
thing I'm still wrong okay now the
reason for this probably is because of

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:11.650
reason for this probably is because of
 

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.650
reason for this probably is because of
these dispersing males because males

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:13.660
these dispersing males because males
 

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.020
these dispersing males because males
leave the group they're born into when

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.030
leave the group they're born into when
 

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.300
leave the group they're born into when
they become sexually mature and they may

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:18.310
they become sexually mature and they may
 

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.920
they become sexually mature and they may
go to multiple groups over the course of

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:19.930
go to multiple groups over the course of
 

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.050
go to multiple groups over the course of
their lifetime so imagine the landscape

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:22.060
their lifetime so imagine the landscape
 

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.400
their lifetime so imagine the landscape
where these males are moving around and

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:23.410
where these males are moving around and
 

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:24.600
where these males are moving around and
what are they doing they're leaving

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.610
what are they doing they're leaving
 

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.270
what are they doing they're leaving
their genes wherever they go okay so

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:27.280
their genes wherever they go okay so
 

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.280
their genes wherever they go okay so
that's why this thing is when you look

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:29.290
that's why this thing is when you look
 

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.840
that's why this thing is when you look
at a genetic variation that's

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:30.850
at a genetic variation that's
 

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.120
at a genetic variation that's
contributed by both parents meaning what

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.130
contributed by both parents meaning what
 

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.700
contributed by both parents meaning what
we have in our nuclear genome right all

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:35.710
we have in our nuclear genome right all
 

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.070
we have in our nuclear genome right all
those chromosomes there's so much coming

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:38.080
those chromosomes there's so much coming
 

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.300
those chromosomes there's so much coming
in from the male's that it's

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:39.310
in from the male's that it's
 

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.860
in from the male's that it's
overwhelming the fact that the females

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:40.870
overwhelming the fact that the females
 

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.990
overwhelming the fact that the females
are not moving around and is giving this

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000
are not moving around and is giving this
 

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.970
are not moving around and is giving this
basically a random distribution of

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:44.980
basically a random distribution of
 

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.710
basically a random distribution of
genetic variation that's the explanation

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720
genetic variation that's the explanation
 

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.530
genetic variation that's the explanation
but still females are not moving around

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:49.540
but still females are not moving around
 

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.720
but still females are not moving around
so I said I've got to find the signature

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:51.730
so I said I've got to find the signature
 

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.910
so I said I've got to find the signature
the genetic signature for females not

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920
the genetic signature for females not
 

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.260
the genetic signature for females not
moving around it's got to be there

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:55.270
moving around it's got to be there
 

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.560
moving around it's got to be there
somewhere and where was it well this is

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:58.570
somewhere and where was it well this is
 

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.540
somewhere and where was it well this is
a again a little hard to see this is

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:00.550
a again a little hard to see this is
 

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.640
a again a little hard to see this is
another species of macaque monkey you

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:02.650
another species of macaque monkey you
 

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.110
another species of macaque monkey you
see the the mother and them in the

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120
see the the mother and them in the
 

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.190
see the the mother and them in the
middle and then you'll see a bunch of

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:05.200
middle and then you'll see a bunch of
 

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.510
middle and then you'll see a bunch of
different offspring of different ages

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:06.520
different offspring of different ages
 

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.010
different offspring of different ages
that's what you see when you look at

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:08.020
that's what you see when you look at
 

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.570
that's what you see when you look at
social groups there'll be a series of

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:09.580
social groups there'll be a series of
 

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.670
social groups there'll be a series of
adult males and then you'll see their

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:11.680
adult males and then you'll see their
 

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.440
adult males and then you'll see their
offspring mostly their female offspring

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:13.450
offspring mostly their female offspring
 

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.030
offspring mostly their female offspring
because the male offspring move off once

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:15.040
because the male offspring move off once
 

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.900
because the male offspring move off once
they become mature right so what I

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:18.910
they become mature right so what I
 

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.060
they become mature right so what I
looked at was I tried to find something

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.070
looked at was I tried to find something
 

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:22.830
looked at was I tried to find something
that is inherited through the maternal

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:22.840
that is inherited through the maternal
 

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.870
that is inherited through the maternal
line now I don't know how many of you

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880
line now I don't know how many of you
 

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.400
line now I don't know how many of you
know this you probably should know this

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:26.410
know this you probably should know this
 

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.200
know this you probably should know this
from your high school biology classes

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:28.210
from your high school biology classes
 

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.300
from your high school biology classes
that we have two different genomes in

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:30.310
that we have two different genomes in
 

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.940
that we have two different genomes in
our cells we have the genome we normally

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:32.950
our cells we have the genome we normally
 

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.410
our cells we have the genome we normally
talk about which are the chromosomes in

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:34.420
talk about which are the chromosomes in
 

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.180
talk about which are the chromosomes in
the nucleus of the cell but we have this

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:36.190
the nucleus of the cell but we have this
 

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.520
the nucleus of the cell but we have this
other genome in these little energy

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:38.530
other genome in these little energy
 

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.380
other genome in these little energy
producing factories called mitochondria

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:40.390
producing factories called mitochondria
 

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.510
producing factories called mitochondria
in ourselves and they have their own DNA

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520
in ourselves and they have their own DNA
 

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.760
in ourselves and they have their own DNA
and that DNA is that circular loop of

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:45.770
and that DNA is that circular loop of
 

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:49.470
and that DNA is that circular loop of
DNA you see on the right side very small

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480
DNA you see on the right side very small
 

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.050
DNA you see on the right side very small
but a good signature why is it a good

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:53.060
but a good signature why is it a good
 

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.770
but a good signature why is it a good
signature because everybody in here is a

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:56.780
signature because everybody in here is a
 

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.140
signature because everybody in here is a
clone of their mother went with respect

00:17:59.140 --> 00:17:59.150
clone of their mother went with respect
 

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.450
clone of their mother went with respect
to mitochondrial DNA because you get the

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:01.460
to mitochondrial DNA because you get the
 

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.340
to mitochondrial DNA because you get the
mitochondrial DNA from the cytoplasm of

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:03.350
mitochondrial DNA from the cytoplasm of
 

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.350
mitochondrial DNA from the cytoplasm of
the egg there are some mitochondria in

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360
the egg there are some mitochondria in
 

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.640
the egg there are some mitochondria in
the sperm but they never get

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:06.650
the sperm but they never get
 

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.740
the sperm but they never get
incorporated into the fertilized egg so

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:08.750
incorporated into the fertilized egg so
 

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.480
incorporated into the fertilized egg so
all you have are copies of the

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:10.490
all you have are copies of the
 

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.180
all you have are copies of the
mitochondria any of your mother okay so

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:13.190
mitochondria any of your mother okay so
 

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.130
mitochondria any of your mother okay so
I said now if I look at something that

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:15.140
I said now if I look at something that
 

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.630
I said now if I look at something that
is strictly maternally inherited I'm

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640
is strictly maternally inherited I'm
 

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.640
is strictly maternally inherited I'm
going to have to pick up a signature of

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:18.650
going to have to pick up a signature of
 

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.840
going to have to pick up a signature of
the fact that females are not moving

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:19.850
the fact that females are not moving
 

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.220
the fact that females are not moving
around because males are not

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:21.230
around because males are not
 

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.720
around because males are not
contributing to that I'm going to get

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:22.730
contributing to that I'm going to get
 

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.930
contributing to that I'm going to get
this right and I did fantastic so

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:25.940
this right and I did fantastic so
 

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.760
this right and I did fantastic so
instead of the pie on the left which is

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:27.770
instead of the pie on the left which is
 

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.290
instead of the pie on the left which is
the nuclear variation where you find in

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:29.300
the nuclear variation where you find in
 

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.330
the nuclear variation where you find in
the chromosomes being mostly stippled

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:31.340
the chromosomes being mostly stippled
 

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.070
the chromosomes being mostly stippled
you can see there's only a small amount

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080
you can see there's only a small amount
 

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.950
you can see there's only a small amount
of it is stippled on the right pi and

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960
of it is stippled on the right pi and
 

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.230
of it is stippled on the right pi and
that is that's the amount of variation

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240
that is that's the amount of variation
 

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.330
that is that's the amount of variation
that shared among groups and populations

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:40.340
that shared among groups and populations
 

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.150
that shared among groups and populations
and the black part is the mounted a

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:43.160
and the black part is the mounted a
 

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.850
and the black part is the mounted a
total variation that's unique and why is

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:45.860
total variation that's unique and why is
 

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.770
total variation that's unique and why is
it unique because the females are born

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:47.780
it unique because the females are born
 

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:48.880
it unique because the females are born
in a group they have a particular

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:48.890
in a group they have a particular
 

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.640
in a group they have a particular
mitochondrial genetic makeup and they

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:51.650
mitochondrial genetic makeup and they
 

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.860
mitochondrial genetic makeup and they
never leave that group they stay in that

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:53.870
never leave that group they stay in that
 

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.210
never leave that group they stay in that
group their whole life their daughters

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:55.220
group their whole life their daughters
 

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.590
group their whole life their daughters
stay in that group their granddaughters

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600
stay in that group their granddaughters
 

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.360
stay in that group their granddaughters
stay in that group and so you can see

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:58.370
stay in that group and so you can see
 

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.360
stay in that group and so you can see
that it becomes highly specialized or

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:01.370
that it becomes highly specialized or
 

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.970
that it becomes highly specialized or
highly localized in each little area and

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:03.980
highly localized in each little area and
 

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.350
highly localized in each little area and
there are big differences between the

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360
there are big differences between the
 

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.890
there are big differences between the
areas where as the nuclear variation is

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:07.900
areas where as the nuclear variation is
 

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.080
areas where as the nuclear variation is
pretty much homogenized across the

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:11.090
pretty much homogenized across the
 

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.240
pretty much homogenized across the
landscape so I did actually find this

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:13.250
landscape so I did actually find this
 

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.460
landscape so I did actually find this
and what it did was so I was completely

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:15.470
and what it did was so I was completely
 

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.090
and what it did was so I was completely
failed in my original experiment natural

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:19.100
failed in my original experiment natural
 

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.980
failed in my original experiment natural
experiment but it forced me to go and

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:20.990
experiment but it forced me to go and
 

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.210
experiment but it forced me to go and
take a look at this and i found this

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:22.220
take a look at this and i found this
 

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.270
take a look at this and i found this
signature of this the way in which

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280
signature of this the way in which
 

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.490
signature of this the way in which
females are organized in populations it

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:27.500
females are organized in populations it
 

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.380
females are organized in populations it
led me to look more at mitochondrial DNA

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:29.390
led me to look more at mitochondrial DNA
 

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.120
led me to look more at mitochondrial DNA
i don't have time to go into it but

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.130
i don't have time to go into it but
 

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.830
i don't have time to go into it but
mitochondrial DNA has become a very very

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840
mitochondrial DNA has become a very very
 

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.840
mitochondrial DNA has become a very very
important tool in evolutionary genetics

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:34.850
important tool in evolutionary genetics
 

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.090
important tool in evolutionary genetics
and it led me to do a lot of research on

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:37.100
and it led me to do a lot of research on
 

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.340
and it led me to do a lot of research on
that and how it works out not only in

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:39.350
that and how it works out not only in
 

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.100
that and how it works out not only in
populations at the present but how it

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:42.110
populations at the present but how it
 

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.380
populations at the present but how it
plays itself out over time and the fact

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:44.390
plays itself out over time and the fact
 

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.970
plays itself out over time and the fact
that when you reconstruct evolutionary

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:45.980
that when you reconstruct evolutionary
 

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.010
that when you reconstruct evolutionary
history using mitochondrial DNA you get

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:48.020
history using mitochondrial DNA you get
 

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.570
history using mitochondrial DNA you get
a very different picture than when you

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:49.580
a very different picture than when you
 

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.250
a very different picture than when you
use nuclear DNA and what you're getting

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:51.260
use nuclear DNA and what you're getting
 

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.100
use nuclear DNA and what you're getting
is two snapshots and you can also use

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:54.110
is two snapshots and you can also use
 

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.870
is two snapshots and you can also use
y-chromosome DNA that only comes through

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880
y-chromosome DNA that only comes through
 

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.820
y-chromosome DNA that only comes through
the maternal line you get three snaps

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:57.830
the maternal line you get three snaps
 

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.710
the maternal line you get three snaps
you get these three snapshots of what

00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720
you get these three snapshots of what
 

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.480
you get these three snapshots of what
happened over evolutionary time in any

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:01.490
happened over evolutionary time in any
 

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.250
happened over evolutionary time in any
given point and you put those three

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:03.260
given point and you put those three
 

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.509
given point and you put those three
snapshots together and you get a real

00:20:04.509 --> 00:20:04.519
snapshots together and you get a real
 

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:07.090
snapshots together and you get a real
story whereas if you just used one you'd

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:07.100
story whereas if you just used one you'd
 

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.950
story whereas if you just used one you'd
only get what I would say is a bias

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960
only get what I would say is a bias
 

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.659
only get what I would say is a bias
story so this was a lot of fun and I

00:20:13.659 --> 00:20:13.669
story so this was a lot of fun and I
 

00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:15.490
story so this was a lot of fun and I
decided I would work on all these other

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:15.500
decided I would work on all these other
 

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.289
decided I would work on all these other
kinds of monkeys and I started working

00:20:17.289 --> 00:20:17.299
kinds of monkeys and I started working
 

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:19.210
kinds of monkeys and I started working
on Apes and all kinds of other primates

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:19.220
on Apes and all kinds of other primates
 

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.669
on Apes and all kinds of other primates
and doing the same kind of work and then

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679
and doing the same kind of work and then
 

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.980
and doing the same kind of work and then
while I was happily going about doing

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:23.990
while I was happily going about doing
 

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.289
while I was happily going about doing
this this was in nineteen this would be

00:20:26.289 --> 00:20:26.299
this this was in nineteen this would be
 

00:20:26.299 --> 00:20:30.669
this this was in nineteen this would be
1986 now if you see that circle that

00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:30.679
1986 now if you see that circle that
 

00:20:30.679 --> 00:20:32.409
1986 now if you see that circle that
just popped up on the slide did everyone

00:20:32.409 --> 00:20:32.419
just popped up on the slide did everyone
 

00:20:32.419 --> 00:20:34.330
just popped up on the slide did everyone
see that over in the lower left corner I

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:34.340
see that over in the lower left corner I
 

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.490
see that over in the lower left corner I
was doing work on the island of Sri

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:36.500
was doing work on the island of Sri
 

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.049
was doing work on the island of Sri
Lanka there's everyone knows Sri Lanka

00:20:38.049 --> 00:20:38.059
Lanka there's everyone knows Sri Lanka
 

00:20:38.059 --> 00:20:41.080
Lanka there's everyone knows Sri Lanka
it's off the South the southern coast of

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:41.090
it's off the South the southern coast of
 

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.840
it's off the South the southern coast of
the peninsula India and I was doing work

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:43.850
the peninsula India and I was doing work
 

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.909
the peninsula India and I was doing work
in Sri Lanka right as the Civil War was

00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919
in Sri Lanka right as the Civil War was
 

00:20:47.919 --> 00:20:50.320
in Sri Lanka right as the Civil War was
going into full steam which was

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:50.330
going into full steam which was
 

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.360
going into full steam which was
interesting in and of itself I have many

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:52.370
interesting in and of itself I have many
 

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:56.519
interesting in and of itself I have many
stories about that that I could tell and

00:20:56.519 --> 00:20:56.529
stories about that that I could tell and
 

00:20:56.529 --> 00:20:58.450
stories about that that I could tell and
something happened and the thing that

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:58.460
something happened and the thing that
 

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.639
something happened and the thing that
happened actually changed the course of

00:21:00.639 --> 00:21:00.649
happened actually changed the course of
 

00:21:00.649 --> 00:21:05.169
happened actually changed the course of
my research life completely and probably

00:21:05.169 --> 00:21:05.179
my research life completely and probably
 

00:21:05.179 --> 00:21:06.870
my research life completely and probably
changed the course of my life completely

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880
changed the course of my life completely
 

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.820
changed the course of my life completely
so I was driving down the road we had

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:09.830
so I was driving down the road we had
 

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.289
so I was driving down the road we had
all the provisions we needed we were

00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:11.299
all the provisions we needed we were
 

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:13.029
all the provisions we needed we were
often a relatively remote area we were

00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039
often a relatively remote area we were
 

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.200
often a relatively remote area we were
working on a different species of

it slowly
 

00:22:11.389 --> 00:22:13.539
it slowly
it's off to the forest but very very

00:22:13.539 --> 00:22:13.549
it's off to the forest but very very
 

00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:15.129
it's off to the forest but very very
slowly near perceptively and they're

you start asking did we just see an
 

00:22:18.589 --> 00:22:20.739
you start asking did we just see an
elephant but we did see an omen this was

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:20.749
elephant but we did see an omen this was
 

00:22:20.749 --> 00:22:22.329

spectacular me I this was a really
 

00:22:22.339 --> 00:22:24.519
spectacular me I this was a really
really great I told you I really like

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:24.529
really great I told you I really like
 

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:26.709
really great I told you I really like
nature so you can imagine I thought this

00:22:26.709 --> 00:22:26.719
nature so you can imagine I thought this
 

00:22:26.719 --> 00:22:29.709
nature so you can imagine I thought this
was an incredible moment so we go up to

00:22:29.709 --> 00:22:29.719
was an incredible moment so we go up to
 

00:22:29.719 --> 00:22:31.810
was an incredible moment so we go up to
the research site we spend two months

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:31.820
the research site we spend two months
 

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.519
the research site we spend two months
there we're running out of things I

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:33.529
there we're running out of things I
 

00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:35.589
there we're running out of things I
decided to drive back and I drive back

00:22:35.589 --> 00:22:35.599
decided to drive back and I drive back
 

00:22:35.599 --> 00:22:38.589
decided to drive back and I drive back
and that's the area that we I just

00:22:38.589 --> 00:22:38.599
and that's the area that we I just
 

00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:39.909
and that's the area that we I just
showed you that's what the area looks

00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919
showed you that's what the area looks
 

00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:41.529
showed you that's what the area looks
like and if you can't see because it

00:22:41.529 --> 00:22:41.539
like and if you can't see because it

sort of faded the entire forest was

00:22:43.749 --> 00:22:43.759
sort of faded the entire forest was
 

00:22:43.759 --> 00:22:45.789
sort of faded the entire forest was
burned to the ground completely burned

00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799
burned to the ground completely burned
 

00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:46.959
burned to the ground completely burned
to the ground there were no animals

00:22:46.959 --> 00:22:46.969
to the ground there were no animals
 

00:22:46.969 --> 00:22:48.729
to the ground there were no animals
there were no birds and no elephants i

00:22:48.729 --> 00:22:48.739
there were no birds and no elephants i
 

00:22:48.739 --> 00:22:49.930
there were no birds and no elephants i
think was just had been completely

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:49.940

cleared for a big development project

00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:51.799
cleared for a big development project
 

00:22:51.799 --> 00:22:54.069

that forest were they were were gone so

00:22:54.069 --> 00:22:54.079
that forest were they were were gone so
 

00:22:54.079 --> 00:22:56.560
that forest were they were were gone so
i suddenly struck me that i could

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:56.570
i suddenly struck me that i could
 

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.959
i suddenly struck me that i could
continue going on studying these various

00:22:58.959 --> 00:22:58.969
continue going on studying these various
 

00:22:58.969 --> 00:23:01.029
continue going on studying these various
species and having a lot of fun and

00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039
species and having a lot of fun and
 

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:02.409

traveling to really cool places around

00:23:02.409 --> 00:23:02.419
traveling to really cool places around
 

00:23:02.419 --> 00:23:04.479
traveling to really cool places around
the world but at some point they would

00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:04.489
the world but at some point they would
 

00:23:04.489 --> 00:23:07.180
the world but at some point they would
all be gone or greatly diminished or i

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:07.190
all be gone or greatly diminished or i
 

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:11.469
all be gone or greatly diminished or i
could try to use my science perhaps to

00:23:11.469 --> 00:23:11.479
could try to use my science perhaps to
 

00:23:11.479 --> 00:23:14.139
could try to use my science perhaps to
do something about the fact that all of

00:23:14.139 --> 00:23:14.149
do something about the fact that all of
 

00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:15.729
do something about the fact that all of
these species and their habitats were

00:23:15.729 --> 00:23:15.739
these species and their habitats were
 

00:23:15.739 --> 00:23:17.349
these species and their habitats were
disappearing or really their habitats

00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:17.359
disappearing or really their habitats
 

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:20.169
disappearing or really their habitats
and then the species we disappear so

00:23:20.169 --> 00:23:20.179
and then the species we disappear so
 

00:23:20.179 --> 00:23:21.849
and then the species we disappear so
this was a real game changer for me and

00:23:21.849 --> 00:23:21.859
this was a real game changer for me and
 

00:23:21.859 --> 00:23:25.209
this was a real game changer for me and
so then i became more of an applied

00:23:25.209 --> 00:23:25.219
so then i became more of an applied
 

00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:27.519
so then i became more of an applied
scientist although the problem i have is

00:23:27.519 --> 00:23:27.529
scientist although the problem i have is
 

00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:31.659
scientist although the problem i have is
i never drop anything so then I just

00:23:31.659 --> 00:23:31.669
i never drop anything so then I just
 

00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:33.430
i never drop anything so then I just
kept my basic science going and now i've

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440
kept my basic science going and now i've
 

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.259
kept my basic science going and now i've
added applied science to it you'll see

00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:35.269
added applied science to it you'll see
 

00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:37.539
added applied science to it you'll see
and then i'll add more things on to and

00:23:37.539 --> 00:23:37.549
and then i'll add more things on to and
 

00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:40.719
and then i'll add more things on to and
what i did was i came down in altitude

00:23:40.719 --> 00:23:40.729
what i did was i came down in altitude
 

00:23:40.729 --> 00:23:43.269
what i did was i came down in altitude
instead of being in it at high altitude

00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279
instead of being in it at high altitude
 

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:45.339
instead of being in it at high altitude
or in very dry forest I went to low

00:23:45.339 --> 00:23:45.349
or in very dry forest I went to low
 

00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:47.289
or in very dry forest I went to low
altitudes and very wet forest which were

00:23:47.289 --> 00:23:47.299
altitudes and very wet forest which were
 

00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:49.329
altitudes and very wet forest which were
areas under really extreme pressure

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:49.339
areas under really extreme pressure
 

00:23:49.339 --> 00:23:51.969
areas under really extreme pressure
where lots of habitat was disappearing

00:23:51.969 --> 00:23:51.979
where lots of habitat was disappearing
 

00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:54.999
where lots of habitat was disappearing
very very quickly this is a picture in

00:23:54.999 --> 00:23:55.009
very very quickly this is a picture in
 

00:23:55.009 --> 00:23:57.009
very very quickly this is a picture in
Sumatra this forest is actually gone

00:23:57.009 --> 00:23:57.019
Sumatra this forest is actually gone
 

00:23:57.019 --> 00:24:00.789
Sumatra this forest is actually gone
it's not there anymore so these forests

00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799
it's not there anymore so these forests
 

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:03.159
it's not there anymore so these forests
I'll talk about deforestation later and

00:24:03.159 --> 00:24:03.169
I'll talk about deforestation later and
 

00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:04.599
I'll talk about deforestation later and
I started studying all kinds i branched

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:04.609
I started studying all kinds i branched
 

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:06.879
I started studying all kinds i branched
out I didn't just work on primates but I

00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:06.889
out I didn't just work on primates but I
 

00:24:06.889 --> 00:24:08.289
out I didn't just work on primates but I
started working on all kinds of other

00:24:08.289 --> 00:24:08.299
started working on all kinds of other
 

00:24:08.299 --> 00:24:12.879
started working on all kinds of other
vertebrates in these forests so I'll

00:24:12.879 --> 00:24:12.889
vertebrates in these forests so I'll
 

00:24:12.889 --> 00:24:15.430
vertebrates in these forests so I'll
give you an example of how you take the

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440
give you an example of how you take the
 

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.379
give you an example of how you take the
science of genetics and apply it to a

00:24:17.379 --> 00:24:17.389
science of genetics and apply it to a
 

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:20.109
science of genetics and apply it to a
real problem so this is the manga topaz

00:24:20.109 --> 00:24:20.119
real problem so this is the manga topaz
 

00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:21.879
real problem so this is the manga topaz
the job in rhino that lives in Southeast

00:24:21.879 --> 00:24:21.889
the job in rhino that lives in Southeast
 

00:24:21.889 --> 00:24:24.159
the job in rhino that lives in Southeast
Asia it's probably it is the most

00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:24.169
Asia it's probably it is the most
 

00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:25.320
Asia it's probably it is the most
endangered large

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:25.330
endangered large
 

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.000
endangered large
amal in the world they are probably

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.010
amal in the world they are probably
 

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:30.330
amal in the world they are probably
somewhere in their region of 70 to 80 of

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:30.340
somewhere in their region of 70 to 80 of
 

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.400
somewhere in their region of 70 to 80 of
them left in the wild there are none in

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:32.410
them left in the wild there are none in
 

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:36.000
them left in the wild there are none in
captivity okay so it's a species really

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.010
captivity okay so it's a species really
 

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.730
captivity okay so it's a species really
on the brink and I'm going to talk about

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:38.740
on the brink and I'm going to talk about
 

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.470
on the brink and I'm going to talk about
molecular evolutionary tree building

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480
molecular evolutionary tree building
 

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.940
molecular evolutionary tree building
that is building evolutionary trees

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:41.950
that is building evolutionary trees
 

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.610
that is building evolutionary trees
using molecular data okay so there's the

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:44.620
using molecular data okay so there's the
 

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.260
using molecular data okay so there's the
Javan rhinoceros you see it has a single

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:46.270
Javan rhinoceros you see it has a single
 

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:49.050
Javan rhinoceros you see it has a single
horn at the end just one horn some of

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:49.060
horn at the end just one horn some of
 

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.700
horn at the end just one horn some of
the Rhinos the ones in Africa for

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:50.710
the Rhinos the ones in Africa for
 

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.480
the Rhinos the ones in Africa for
instance have two horns and this is a

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:54.490
instance have two horns and this is a
 

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.610
instance have two horns and this is a
very rare photo in that the photo is of

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:56.620
very rare photo in that the photo is of
 

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.740
very rare photo in that the photo is of
the animal out during the day it's rare

00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:58.750
the animal out during the day it's rare
 

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.180
the animal out during the day it's rare
that job and rhinos will come out during

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:00.190
that job and rhinos will come out during
 

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.160
that job and rhinos will come out during
the day and I'll explain why in a little

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:02.170
the day and I'll explain why in a little
 

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.760
the day and I'll explain why in a little
bit okay so many people believe that the

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:05.770
bit okay so many people believe that the
 

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.160
bit okay so many people believe that the
javan rhino that was just a subspecies

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:08.170
javan rhino that was just a subspecies
 

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.990
javan rhino that was just a subspecies
of the other one horn Rhino which you

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000
of the other one horn Rhino which you
 

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.180
of the other one horn Rhino which you
can see over on the left sometimes

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:12.190
can see over on the left sometimes
 

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.470
can see over on the left sometimes
called the greater one-horned rhino or

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480
called the greater one-horned rhino or
 

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.440
called the greater one-horned rhino or
the Indian Rhino okay and we wanted to

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:16.450
the Indian Rhino okay and we wanted to
 

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:17.940
the Indian Rhino okay and we wanted to
find out whether that was true because

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:17.950
find out whether that was true because
 

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.500
find out whether that was true because
if it's just a subspecies and they're

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:19.510
if it's just a subspecies and they're
 

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.360
if it's just a subspecies and they're
very few individuals left you might not

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:21.370
very few individuals left you might not
 

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.190
very few individuals left you might not
put so much time and effort into it and

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200
put so much time and effort into it and
 

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.690
put so much time and effort into it and
you might put more time and effort into

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:24.700
you might put more time and effort into
 

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.450
you might put more time and effort into
those other populations that you see in

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:27.460
those other populations that you see in
 

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.850
those other populations that you see in
Nepal and India because they're larger

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:29.860
Nepal and India because they're larger
 

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.940
Nepal and India because they're larger
and they're more viable okay so we used

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:32.950
and they're more viable okay so we used
 

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.100
and they're more viable okay so we used
molecules to reconstruct an evolutionary

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.110
molecules to reconstruct an evolutionary
 

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.780
molecules to reconstruct an evolutionary
tree and that's basically a tree of

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:36.790
tree and that's basically a tree of
 

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.390
tree and that's basically a tree of
relationships and as you can see where

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:39.400
relationships and as you can see where
 

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.820
relationships and as you can see where
the red circle is the one on top which

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:41.830
the red circle is the one on top which
 

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.040
the red circle is the one on top which
says rhinoceros unicornis that's the

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.050
says rhinoceros unicornis that's the
 

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.380
says rhinoceros unicornis that's the
bigger one and the one on the bottom

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:46.390
bigger one and the one on the bottom
 

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.080
bigger one and the one on the bottom
that's the job in run sunday ACCA's okay

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:49.090
that's the job in run sunday ACCA's okay
 

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:50.850
that's the job in run sunday ACCA's okay
now if you look along the branch as

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:50.860
now if you look along the branch as
 

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.890
now if you look along the branch as
you'll see numbers if you add those two

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:52.900
you'll see numbers if you add those two
 

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.410
you'll see numbers if you add those two
numbers up 52 and 53 it tells you how

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:55.420
numbers up 52 and 53 it tells you how
 

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.120
numbers up 52 and 53 it tells you how
much evolutionary divergence there has

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.130
much evolutionary divergence there has
 

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.130
much evolutionary divergence there has
been how many nucleotides in the DNA

00:25:59.130 --> 00:25:59.140
been how many nucleotides in the DNA
 

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.200
been how many nucleotides in the DNA
have changed since they shared a common

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.210
have changed since they shared a common
 

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.330
have changed since they shared a common
ancestor in the particular genes that we

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:03.340
ancestor in the particular genes that we
 

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.830
ancestor in the particular genes that we
were looking at and you'll see it's a

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840
were looking at and you'll see it's a
 

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.930
were looking at and you'll see it's a
hundred and five now people said that

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:06.940
hundred and five now people said that
 

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.820
hundred and five now people said that
they were subspecies of one species well

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:08.830
they were subspecies of one species well
 

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.290
they were subspecies of one species well
this is interesting was interesting to

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:10.300
this is interesting was interesting to
 

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.300
this is interesting was interesting to
us because if you look down here and you

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:12.310
us because if you look down here and you
 

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.900
us because if you look down here and you
add 42 and 69 right you get a hundred

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:15.910
add 42 and 69 right you get a hundred
 

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.940
add 42 and 69 right you get a hundred
and eleven so there are only 111

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:17.950
and eleven so there are only 111
 

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.220
and eleven so there are only 111
differences between the white rhino and

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:20.230
differences between the white rhino and
 

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.200
differences between the white rhino and
the black rhino of Africa and those are

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:22.210
the black rhino of Africa and those are
 

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:23.640
the black rhino of Africa and those are
not considered two separate species

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:23.650
not considered two separate species
 

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.350
not considered two separate species
they're considered in two separate

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360
they're considered in two separate
 

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.630
they're considered in two separate
general two different general which is a

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.640
general two different general which is a
 

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.320
general two different general which is a
very very significant evolutionary

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:31.330
very very significant evolutionary
 

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.270
very very significant evolutionary
difference in order to say they're in

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:33.280
difference in order to say they're in
 

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.610
difference in order to say they're in
each and a different genus okay where's

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:35.620
each and a different genus okay where's
 

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.020
each and a different genus okay where's
the ones on top which are just as

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.030
the ones on top which are just as
 

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.490
the ones on top which are just as
different we're thought to be subspecies

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:38.500
different we're thought to be subspecies
 

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.060
different we're thought to be subspecies
of the same

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:39.070
of the same
 

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.310
of the same
species so we reported this back the

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320
species so we reported this back the
 

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.409
species so we reported this back the
saying this is clearly not true these

00:26:43.409 --> 00:26:43.419
saying this is clearly not true these
 

00:26:43.419 --> 00:26:45.659
saying this is clearly not true these
are at least separate species if not

00:26:45.659 --> 00:26:45.669
are at least separate species if not
 

00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:49.039
are at least separate species if not
each and a separate genus and have had

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:49.049
each and a separate genus and have had
 

00:26:49.049 --> 00:26:51.840
each and a separate genus and have had
their own evolutionary history separated

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:51.850
their own evolutionary history separated
 

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.759
their own evolutionary history separated
from the other for a very long period of

00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:53.769
from the other for a very long period of
 

00:26:53.769 --> 00:26:57.690
from the other for a very long period of
time okay so in the language that we use

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:57.700
time okay so in the language that we use
 

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.870
time okay so in the language that we use
we said these two groups of organisms

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880
we said these two groups of organisms
 

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.019
we said these two groups of organisms
are evolutionarily significant units you

00:27:04.019 --> 00:27:04.029
are evolutionarily significant units you
 

00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:06.060
are evolutionarily significant units you
might call them species or gender or

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:06.070
might call them species or gender or
 

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.490
might call them species or gender or
whatever okay we're just calling them

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:08.500
whatever okay we're just calling them
 

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.860
whatever okay we're just calling them
evolutionary significant units then we

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:10.870
evolutionary significant units then we
 

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.240
evolutionary significant units then we
thought well we're going to look at the

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:12.250
thought well we're going to look at the
 

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:13.529
thought well we're going to look at the
Javan run because there are two

00:27:13.529 --> 00:27:13.539
Javan run because there are two
 

00:27:13.539 --> 00:27:15.570
Javan run because there are two
populations one in Vietnam and one in

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:15.580
populations one in Vietnam and one in
 

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.060
populations one in Vietnam and one in
the island of Java you can see them

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.070
the island of Java you can see them
 

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.590
the island of Java you can see them
there now you see the one on the left

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600
there now you see the one on the left
 

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.360
there now you see the one on the left
that picture is a picture that was taken

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:21.370
that picture is a picture that was taken
 

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:26.100
that picture is a picture that was taken
with a photo camera trap and the recent

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:26.110
with a photo camera trap and the recent
 

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.690
with a photo camera trap and the recent
second with a camera trap which is a

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:27.700
second with a camera trap which is a
 

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.039
second with a camera trap which is a
beam of light and when the animal

00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:29.049
beam of light and when the animal
 

00:27:29.049 --> 00:27:30.299
beam of light and when the animal
crosses the beam of light the camera

00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:30.309
crosses the beam of light the camera
 

00:27:30.309 --> 00:27:32.789
crosses the beam of light the camera
flashes a picture the reason is that

00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799
flashes a picture the reason is that
 

00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:35.100
flashes a picture the reason is that
almost all of these animals not by

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:35.110
almost all of these animals not by
 

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.570
almost all of these animals not by
nature not by their evolutionary history

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:36.580
nature not by their evolutionary history
 

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.509
nature not by their evolutionary history
but because of strong selection by the

00:27:39.509 --> 00:27:39.519
but because of strong selection by the
 

00:27:39.519 --> 00:27:42.240
but because of strong selection by the
human population are nocturnal they only

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:42.250
human population are nocturnal they only
 

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.799
human population are nocturnal they only
come out at night because the ones that

00:27:43.799 --> 00:27:43.809
come out at night because the ones that
 

00:27:43.809 --> 00:27:46.110
come out at night because the ones that
came out there in a day got shot ok so

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120
came out there in a day got shot ok so
 

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.749
came out there in a day got shot ok so
you strongly select for individuals that

00:27:48.749 --> 00:27:48.759
you strongly select for individuals that
 

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:50.639
you strongly select for individuals that
will only come out at night and so the

00:27:50.639 --> 00:27:50.649
will only come out at night and so the
 

00:27:50.649 --> 00:27:51.930
will only come out at night and so the
only way to find out whether there is

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:51.940
only way to find out whether there is
 

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.940
only way to find out whether there is
the set up a camera trap have them cross

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:53.950
the set up a camera trap have them cross
 

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.320
the set up a camera trap have them cross
this beam and take a picture of it

this beam and take a picture of it
 

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:56.970
this beam and take a picture of it
otherwise you'd never know they're there

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:56.980
otherwise you'd never know they're there

otherwise you'd never know they're there
I mean I've worked in the National Park

00:27:58.889 --> 00:27:58.899
I mean I've worked in the National Park
 

00:27:58.899 --> 00:28:01.499
I mean I've worked in the National Park
in Indonesia where they they are you

John cool on national park and there are
Park guards who have been there for

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.210
Park guards who have been there for
 

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.669
Park guards who have been there for
years and have never seen a job in rhino

00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679
years and have never seen a job in rhino
 

00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:08.249
years and have never seen a job in rhino
soon as you put our camera traps bingo

00:28:08.249 --> 00:28:08.259
soon as you put our camera traps bingo
 

00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:09.860
soon as you put our camera traps bingo
the next night you find job and rhinos

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:09.870
the next night you find job and rhinos
 

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.990
the next night you find job and rhinos
okay in any case these are the two

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000
okay in any case these are the two
 

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.879
okay in any case these are the two
populations in cat lock in Vietnam and

00:28:14.879 --> 00:28:14.889
populations in cat lock in Vietnam and
 

00:28:14.889 --> 00:28:17.669
populations in cat lock in Vietnam and
anuj on coolin in the island of Java and

00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679
anuj on coolin in the island of Java and
 

00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:19.409
anuj on coolin in the island of Java and
we wanted to look at the differences and

00:28:19.409 --> 00:28:19.419
we wanted to look at the differences and
 

00:28:19.419 --> 00:28:21.740
we wanted to look at the differences and
indeed if you look at again add up the

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:21.750
indeed if you look at again add up the
 

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.810
indeed if you look at again add up the
numbers on the branches you'll see that

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:24.820
numbers on the branches you'll see that
 

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.409
numbers on the branches you'll see that
these are just as different as these two

00:28:28.409 --> 00:28:28.419
these are just as different as these two
 

00:28:28.419 --> 00:28:31.350
these are just as different as these two
subspecies are a black rhino and those

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360
subspecies are a black rhino and those
 

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.970
subspecies are a black rhino and those
two subspecies of black rhino have had

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:32.980
two subspecies of black rhino have had
 

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.680
two subspecies of black rhino have had
so many millions of dollars poured into

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:34.690
so many millions of dollars poured into
 

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:35.820
so many millions of dollars poured into
their conservation because they're

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:35.830
their conservation because they're
 

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.369
their conservation because they're
separate subspecies and yet no one ever

00:28:38.369 --> 00:28:38.379
separate subspecies and yet no one ever
 

00:28:38.379 --> 00:28:39.779
separate subspecies and yet no one ever
thought to look at these and when we

00:28:39.779 --> 00:28:39.789
thought to look at these and when we
 

00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:40.980
thought to look at these and when we
looked at them we found out that they

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:40.990
looked at them we found out that they
 

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:42.899
looked at them we found out that they
were just as different and really

00:28:42.899 --> 00:28:42.909
were just as different and really
 

00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:44.759
were just as different and really
required each of them requiring their

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:44.769
required each of them requiring their
 

00:28:44.769 --> 00:28:46.230
required each of them requiring their
own separate management and their own

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240
own separate management and their own
 

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.570
own separate management and their own
separate investment and so you'll see we

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:48.580
separate investment and so you'll see we
 

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.250
separate investment and so you'll see we
use this other term mu which is a

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:50.260
use this other term mu which is a
 

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.600
use this other term mu which is a
management unit and we define these two

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:52.610
management unit and we define these two
 

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.539
management unit and we define these two
units in Vietnam and John kula in Java

00:28:55.539 --> 00:28:55.549

blew it was such an enormous explosion

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:53.290
blew it was such an enormous explosion
 

00:29:53.290 --> 00:30:00.100
blew it was such an enormous explosion
that actually it covered the atmosphere

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:00.110
that actually it covered the atmosphere
 

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.230
that actually it covered the atmosphere
with a layer of dust that blocked out

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240
with a layer of dust that blocked out
 

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.940
with a layer of dust that blocked out
that block out the Sun but diminished

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:03.950
that block out the Sun but diminished
 

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:05.919
that block out the Sun but diminished
the rays of the Sun so much so that it

00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:05.929
the rays of the Sun so much so that it
 

00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:08.100
the rays of the Sun so much so that it
actually snowed in Boston and July

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:08.110
actually snowed in Boston and July
 

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:11.830
actually snowed in Boston and July
that's how cool it was ok the sound of

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840
that's how cool it was ok the sound of
 

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.930
that's how cool it was ok the sound of
this was heard and the effects of this

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:13.940
this was heard and the effects of this
 

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.090
this was heard and the effects of this
were heard in Europe and this is

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:16.100
were heard in Europe and this is
 

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.740
were heard in Europe and this is
happening on the island of Java so you

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:17.750
happening on the island of Java so you
 

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.780
happening on the island of Java so you
can get a sense it caused the tsunami

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:19.790
can get a sense it caused the tsunami
 

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:24.010
can get a sense it caused the tsunami
just like the tsunami that that we had

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:24.020
just like the tsunami that that we had
 

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.750
just like the tsunami that that we had
recently in the Indian Ocean hitting

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760
recently in the Indian Ocean hitting
 

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.730
recently in the Indian Ocean hitting
exactly the same places because the

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:27.740
exactly the same places because the
 

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.760
exactly the same places because the
entire volcano collapsed into the ocean

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:30.770
entire volcano collapsed into the ocean
 

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.190
entire volcano collapsed into the ocean
causing this huge reverberating waves

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200
causing this huge reverberating waves
 

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.520
causing this huge reverberating waves
going out hit exactly the same places in

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:35.530
going out hit exactly the same places in
 

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:39.340
going out hit exactly the same places in
Indonesia in India in Sri Lanka the only

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:39.350
Indonesia in India in Sri Lanka the only
 

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:41.080
Indonesia in India in Sri Lanka the only
difference was the population was very

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.090
difference was the population was very
 

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.720
difference was the population was very
small at that time and people were not

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:43.730
small at that time and people were not
 

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.940
small at that time and people were not
living along the coast because that was

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:45.950
living along the coast because that was
 

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:47.380
living along the coast because that was
not a good place to live everyone knew

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:47.390
not a good place to live everyone knew
 

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.240
not a good place to live everyone knew
that and so the number of deaths were

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:49.250
that and so the number of deaths were
 

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.090
that and so the number of deaths were
actually fairly minimal but essentially

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:52.100
actually fairly minimal but essentially
 

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.620
actually fairly minimal but essentially
happened now what concerns me about

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:53.630
happened now what concerns me about
 

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.690
happened now what concerns me about
having most of the job and runs is

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:55.700
having most of the job and runs is
 

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.070
having most of the job and runs is
ninety percent of job and rhinos there

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:57.080
ninety percent of job and rhinos there
 

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.890
ninety percent of job and rhinos there
is this picture right here if you look

00:30:59.890 --> 00:30:59.900
is this picture right here if you look
 

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.570
is this picture right here if you look
at that picture closely you'll see it

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:01.580
at that picture closely you'll see it
 

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.180
at that picture closely you'll see it
looks like a volcano and that's what it

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:04.190
looks like a volcano and that's what it
 

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.280
looks like a volcano and that's what it
is this is called anak Krakatau

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:06.290
is this is called anak Krakatau
 

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.590
is this is called anak Krakatau
on that crocodile means son of Krakatau

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:08.600
on that crocodile means son of Krakatau
 

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.630
on that crocodile means son of Krakatau
and what's happening is that fault line

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640
and what's happening is that fault line
 

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.550
and what's happening is that fault line
is still there and so it's just growing

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:12.560
is still there and so it's just growing
 

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.710
is still there and so it's just growing
back up and it's growing back up quickly

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720
back up and it's growing back up quickly
 

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.590
back up and it's growing back up quickly
at about one foot a month that grows

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600
at about one foot a month that grows
 

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.600
at about one foot a month that grows
that peak you see is growing about one

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:19.610
that peak you see is growing about one
 

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.120
that peak you see is growing about one
foot a month okay now eventually that's

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.130
foot a month okay now eventually that's
 

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.090
foot a month okay now eventually that's

rhinos are in that basket right there
 

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.500
rhinos are in that basket right there
that's it for the job in right now so we

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:29.510
that's it for the job in right now so we
 

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.270
that's it for the job in right now so we
have made we've said this is a very

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:31.280
have made we've said this is a very
 

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.130
have made we've said this is a very
important management unit of the job and

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:33.140
important management unit of the job and
 

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.170
important management unit of the job and
rhinos the most important one and that

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:35.180
rhinos the most important one and that
 

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.000
rhinos the most important one and that
you have to disperse these animals into

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.010
you have to disperse these animals into
 

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.880
you have to disperse these animals into
other areas find other suitable habitat

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:39.890
other areas find other suitable habitat
 

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:41.470
other areas find other suitable habitat
disperse them into other areas there are

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480
disperse them into other areas there are
 

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.290
disperse them into other areas there are
other genetic reasons for doing that so

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:44.300
other genetic reasons for doing that so
 

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.150
other genetic reasons for doing that so
that's that's basically how we're using

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:46.160
that's that's basically how we're using
 

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.670
that's that's basically how we're using
genetics to try to develop management

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:48.680
genetics to try to develop management
 

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:54.040

plans for species okay okay but then I

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:54.050
plans for species okay okay but then I
 

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:58.540
plans for species okay okay but then I
realized that you how many species there

00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:58.550
realized that you how many species there
 

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.180
realized that you how many species there
are there are millions of species there

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:01.190
are there are millions of species there

don't really don't want more than one of
 

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.420
don't really don't want more than one of
me but we sort of do the things I do you

the people there isn't the money it's
 

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.130
the people there isn't the money it's
not going to happen so we have to begin

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:18.140
not going to happen so we have to begin
 

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.140
not going to happen so we have to begin
to think about how we're going to attack

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:20.150
to think about how we're going to attack
 

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.120

some of these issues on a much much

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:22.130
some of these issues on a much much
 

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:25.810
some of these issues on a much much
larger scale so then I added another

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:25.820
larger scale so then I added another
 

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.700
larger scale so then I added another
layer which I call citizen scientist

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:27.710
layer which I call citizen scientist
 

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.040

what we argued was that nature was the
 

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:51.649
what we argued was that nature was the
infrastructure and that all of those

00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:51.659
infrastructure and that all of those
 

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:53.510

which we do right they all actually are
 

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.859
which we do right they all actually are
related to the nature and the condition

related to the nature and the condition
 

00:35:00.869 --> 00:35:02.750
related to the nature and the condition
that nature is in and if you translate

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760
that nature is in and if you translate

the other problems you see are symptoms
of a core disease and the core disease

of a core disease and the core disease
 

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:17.120
of a core disease and the core disease
is the decline of nature that's the core

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:17.130
is the decline of nature that's the core
 

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.099

what medicine does all the time is
 

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.070
what medicine does all the time is
attack symptoms but if you asked any

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:25.080
attack symptoms but if you asked any
 

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.870

public health specialist they will tell

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880
public health specialist they will tell
 

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.820
public health specialist they will tell
you that is a very expensive way of

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:28.830
you that is a very expensive way of
 

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:31.240
you that is a very expensive way of
going about dealing with a problem

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:31.250
going about dealing with a problem
 

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:33.680

prevention is much cheaper

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:33.690
prevention is much cheaper
 

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:37.220
prevention is much cheaper
dealing with symptoms so how do we

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:37.230
dealing with symptoms so how do we
 

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.569
dealing with symptoms so how do we
achieve environment sustainability i'll

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579
achieve environment sustainability i'll

argue about what the cause of this is
 

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.980

happening because you can measure it
 

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.609

those are going up over time this is a
 

00:36:00.359 --> 00:36:03.410
those are going up over time this is a

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420
period I'm really looking at the period
 

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.270

been going up for a much longer period

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720
been going up for a much longer period
 

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.750
been going up for a much longer period
of time than that we've also seen

the world uses hectares so it's two and
 

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:07.360
the world uses hectares so it's two and
a half acres so if a hectare forest is

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:07.370
a half acres so if a hectare forest is
 

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.130

forty tons of carbon but we measure
 

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:25.270
forty tons of carbon but we measure
what's going to happen as co2 so we have

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280
what's going to happen as co2 so we have
 

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.640
what's going to happen as co2 so we have
to add two molecules of oxygen to that

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:27.650
to add two molecules of oxygen to that
 

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:33.490
to add two molecules of oxygen to that
and we have to create co2 and that means

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:33.500
and we have to create co2 and that means
 

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.200
and we have to create co2 and that means
if you remember your chemistry that

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:35.210
if you remember your chemistry that
 

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.970
if you remember your chemistry that
means oxygen is a little heavier than

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:36.980
means oxygen is a little heavier than
 

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.860
means oxygen is a little heavier than
carbon so in fact it's not three times

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:38.870
carbon so in fact it's not three times
 

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:40.780
carbon so in fact it's not three times
the amount it's three point six seven

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:40.790
the amount it's three point six seven
 

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.640
the amount it's three point six seven
times the amount so it means there's

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:42.650
times the amount so it means there's
 

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:44.770
times the amount so it means there's
about 500 27 or 50 tons of co2

you get emissions reduction units that

00:42:55.089 --> 00:42:55.099
you get emissions reduction units that

the co2 and in order for them to reduce
 

00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:10.990
the co2 and in order for them to reduce
their co2 it's very expensive to refit

their Factory so what they can do is
 

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.859
their Factory so what they can do is
they can buy your reductions instead of

more detail but what we did was we

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:23.030
more detail but what we did was we
 

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:24.609
more detail but what we did was we
brought the science into this and said

00:43:24.609 --> 00:43:24.619
brought the science into this and said
 

00:43:24.619 --> 00:43:25.810
brought the science into this and said
look let's look at what we're trying to

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:25.820
look let's look at what we're trying to
 

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.300
look let's look at what we're trying to
do scientifically okay let's integrate

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:28.310
do scientifically okay let's integrate
 

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.940
do scientifically okay let's integrate
this into economics and policy and let's

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:30.950
this into economics and policy and let's
 

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:32.980
this into economics and policy and let's
create a policy that's going to provide

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:32.990
create a policy that's going to provide
 

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:35.680
create a policy that's going to provide
an economic incentive for forest owners

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:35.690
an economic incentive for forest owners
 

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:38.500
an economic incentive for forest owners
not to cut their forests to ask far zone

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:38.510
not to cut their forests to ask far zone
 

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:40.270
not to cut their forests to ask far zone
is not to cut their forests for the good

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.280
is not to cut their forests for the good
 

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.670
is not to cut their forests for the good
of humankind is going to work as well as

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680
of humankind is going to work as well as
 

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.349
of humankind is going to work as well as
everything else you ask people to do for

00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:44.359
everything else you ask people to do for
 

00:43:44.359 --> 00:43:46.470
everything else you ask people to do for
the good of humankind mean not at all

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480
the good of humankind mean not at all
 

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.210
the good of humankind mean not at all
okay but if you can provide an economic

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:49.220
okay but if you can provide an economic
 

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.579
okay but if you can provide an economic
incentive then in fact you can get

00:43:51.579 --> 00:43:51.589
incentive then in fact you can get
 

00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:52.690
incentive then in fact you can get
something done and that's what we're

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:52.700
something done and that's what we're
 

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.490
something done and that's what we're
trying to do here and this is just

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:54.500
trying to do here and this is just
 

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.079
trying to do here and this is just
showing the kinds of costs you have to

00:43:56.079 --> 00:43:56.089
showing the kinds of costs you have to
 

00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:57.670
showing the kinds of costs you have to
these are the opportunity costs that

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680
these are the opportunity costs that
 

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.040
these are the opportunity costs that
you're forgoing if you do soybeans or

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:00.050
you're forgoing if you do soybeans or
 

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:01.750
you're forgoing if you do soybeans or
ranching or all that and that's what

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760
ranching or all that and that's what
 

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.490
ranching or all that and that's what
we're trying to match so I looked up

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:03.500
we're trying to match so I looked up
 

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.450
we're trying to match so I looked up
today on price carbon which is a website

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:07.460
today on price carbon which is a website
 

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.339
today on price carbon which is a website
that has the price of these emission

00:44:09.339 --> 00:44:09.349
that has the price of these emission
 

00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:11.109
that has the price of these emission
reduction units and today emission

00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119
reduction units and today emission
 

00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:12.280
reduction units and today emission
reduction unit will actually it was

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:12.290
reduction unit will actually it was
 

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.290

friday was worth twenty one dollars and

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:14.300
friday was worth twenty one dollars and
 

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.130
friday was worth twenty one dollars and
seventy cents so now think about a

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:17.140
seventy cents so now think about a
 

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:21.970
seventy cents so now think about a

don't use it as a phone but you can do
 

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.410
don't use it as a phone but you can do
your calculation and you'll see that

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420
your calculation and you'll see that
 

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.050
your calculation and you'll see that
it's actually quite a bit of money per

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060
it's actually quite a bit of money per
 

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.570
it's actually quite a bit of money per
hectare now imagine if you own 10,000

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:35.580

who threw my counterparts in Colombia

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920
who threw my counterparts in Colombia
 

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.500
who threw my counterparts in Colombia
who have a hundred thousand hectares

who have a hundred thousand hectares
 

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.230
who have a hundred thousand hectares
okay now you're talking about a real

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240
okay now you're talking about a real
 

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.450
okay now you're talking about a real
economic incentive not to cut the forest

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:53.460
economic incentive not to cut the forest
 

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.840
economic incentive not to cut the forest
n and when you don't cut the forest down

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:56.850
n and when you don't cut the forest down
 

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:58.190
n and when you don't cut the forest down
you're not emitting co2 into the

00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200
you're not emitting co2 into the
 

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.800
you're not emitting co2 into the
atmosphere and you're not losing the

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:00.810
atmosphere and you're not losing the
 

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:02.360
atmosphere and you're not losing the
forest and all the services that it

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:02.370
forest and all the services that it
 

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.550
forest and all the services that it
supplies soil stabilization and

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560
supplies soil stabilization and
 

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.170
supplies soil stabilization and
everything else that it supplies all

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180
everything else that it supplies all
 

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.490
everything else that it supplies all

nothing it's a roundoff error 20 billion
dollars and that would cut tropical

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:50.190
dollars and that would cut tropical
