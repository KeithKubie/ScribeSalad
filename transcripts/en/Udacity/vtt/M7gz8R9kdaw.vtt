00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.350
&gt;&gt; All right. So, I'm going to highlight this

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.970
logical test. And delete it. Is that okay?

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.670
&gt;&gt; Yup. And, insert the field.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.500
&gt;&gt; Okay. So in this case, I'm checking if ticket type, which is way down

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.228
here, is equal to VIP.

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:18.740
&gt;&gt; In quotes.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.240
&gt;&gt; In quotes. And the quotes are for?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.580
&gt;&gt; because it's a string.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.280
&gt;&gt; String. So just some text.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.080
So if the ticket type is VIP, and the total spent

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.974
is 100 times the number of tickets sold, which is a field.

00:00:34.974 --> 00:00:40.320
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And then the value, false, let's say, you know, is $50 for, so

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.380
it'd be the exact same thing, but it would be 50 times the tickets purchased.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100
&gt;&gt; And you don't have to go through inserting the field that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.730
way, you can just type it out, or copy and paste it.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.390
&gt;&gt; Can I like, hit enter

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.510
here, and make it a little neater? I don't know,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.970
it's hard for me to keep this all in line.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.330
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.850
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this should work, let's

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.620
check syntax. Uh-oh. Field type, field ticket

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.524
type C is a picklist field. Picklist

00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:06.540
fields are only supported in certain functions.
