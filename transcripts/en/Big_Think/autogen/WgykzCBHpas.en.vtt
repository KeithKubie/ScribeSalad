side you know China now really is a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
side you know China now really is a
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.000
side you know China now really is a
capitalist system with a tremendous

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
capitalist system with a tremendous
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.639
capitalist system with a tremendous
amount of economic freedom and this has

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649

for the countries to cooperate
 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.690
for the countries to cooperate
harmoniously and I think I me so I think

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.890

on the American side there's a little

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900
on the American side there's a little
 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.179
on the American side there's a little

bit of a little bit of a
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.880
bit of a little bit of a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
democracy and personally I think in the
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.719
democracy and personally I think in the
long run there's a pretty close

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
long run there's a pretty close
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520
long run there's a pretty close
relationship between capitalism and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
relationship between capitalism and
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.770
relationship between capitalism and
democracy but the long run is pretty

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780
democracy but the long run is pretty
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.399
democracy but the long run is pretty
long and over 20 30 years I think you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
long and over 20 30 years I think you
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.719
long and over 20 30 years I think you
can develop a pretty well functioning

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
can develop a pretty well functioning
 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.390
can develop a pretty well functioning
capitalist system under a one-party

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
capitalist system under a one-party
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.730
capitalist system under a one-party
system and I'm not sure Americans fully

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
system and I'm not sure Americans fully
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.710
system and I'm not sure Americans fully
