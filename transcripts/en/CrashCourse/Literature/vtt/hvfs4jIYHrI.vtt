00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
Hi I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Literature
and today we're discussing Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man,

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.660
which is not the H.G. Wells novel from 1897,
THE Invisible Man.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.040
That's a different book. This one came out in
1952, won the national book award that year.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.960
And it's less about science experiments gone
wrong, more about racial prejudice in America.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.760
The other way you can tell the difference
between them is that Invisible Man is better.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.040
And today we're going to talk about why Invisible
Man is such an important American novel.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:34.820
[Theme Music]

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.380
So David Denby writing in the New Yorker said:

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.060
"Whatever else it is, the book is an intricately
wrought structure of myth and symbol,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.969
a novel devoted to initiations, rites of passages,
testing, annihilation and rebirth...

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.100
(Ellison) struggled to define a black culture
as something precious but indissolubly linked
to white culture â€“

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.320
a task always difficult and always controversial."

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.020
And Invisible Man was published at a time when
racial attitudes in the United States were in flux.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.360
I mean, there was a growing sense that racial
inequality and segregation that had been the
norm for centuries was about to change.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.500
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.700
Invisible Man was published not long after
the end of World War II, in which 1 million African
Americans had served, all in segregated units.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.460
And many of these soldiers felt that segregation
conflicted with the US's espoused ideas of equality.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.440
African Americans were fighting in Europe
at least partially for racial equality,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.020
and they were returning home to a country
where they weren't afforded equal rights.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.600
And this dissonance is part of what led African
Americans to demand equal rights as citizens of
the country for which they had risked their lives.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.250
Shortly before Ellison began writing the book, the Pittsburgh Courier started its "Double V" campaign, calling for democracy: Victory at Home!, Victory Abroad!

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.080
The idea was that black citizens should
support the war effort and that they also deserved
to be supported in their own country.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.790
The campaign featured photos of black and
white people together, emphasizing that equality was
good for the war effort and good for the country.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.140
The Supreme Court's Brown vs. Board of Education decision wouldn't happen until two years after the publication of Invisible Man,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.400
and the 1964 Civil Rights Act
took another 12 years.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.320
By then, Invisible Man was a famous book and
an important voice in the Civil Rights Movement, 
but it remains so today.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.700
Invisible Man was a product of its time and place,
but it also sprung from Ellison's personal experiences.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.260
He was born in 1913 and grew up in poverty.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.260
He attended the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and met Langston Hughes and Richard Wright one summer in New York while working to earn money for school.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.200
Wright encouraged him to become a writer,
and Ellison spent the next seven years crafting
Invisible Man.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.960
He said, "When I was a kid, I read...novels...and
always, I was the hero. I identified with the hero.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.300
Literature is integrated.
And I'm not just talking about color, race.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.180
I'm talking about the power of literature
to make us recognize again and again the
wholeness of human experience."

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.320
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.920
So the essential failure that made segregation
possible was the failure by white people to understand
African Americans as fully human.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.000
And when Ellison talks about the wholeness
of human experience, that's one of the things he
gives his unnamed narrator in Invisible Man.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.460
The narrator is a black man on a quest to
find his true self while facing racism and
disrespect from all sides.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.020
We follow him from his childhood in the south
where he's awarded a scholarship to the state's
black college.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.930
But he gets expelled from college in his junior
year and he goes to New York City to find work,
and then his workplace explodes.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.580
During his recovery he happens upon an eviction.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.800
This elderly couple's possessions are being
roughly moved out onto the street, and he
speaks on their behalf.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.300
And this leads to a job with an organization
called The Brotherhood, where he briefly feels
that he's found his place in the world.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.660
But the Brotherhood also doesn't work out
for him and he becomes disillusioned.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.680
His friend from the organization is then shot
by the police.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.720
And now it's time for the Open Letter.
An open letter to police shootings:

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.080
Hello, Police Shootings.
It's me, John Green.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.840
It's been 64 years since Invisible Man was
published.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.500
In 1952, as in today, African American men
were disproportionately likely to be injured
or killed in interactions with police.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.020
That isn't a political statement,
or a subject for debate;

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.700
I actually made a video about this talking about
the immense amounts of data on the subject.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.120
The difference between then and now, and I
do live in hope that there is a difference,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.980
is that today those shootings are much
more visible.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.760
64 years after the publication of Invisible
Man, systemic racism remains a very real
part of American life.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.519
That's part of why the book continues to feel
so relevant;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.340
it reminds us that all people everywhere
have the right not to be invisible, to develop
their own identities, and to be respected.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.940
Best wishes, John Green.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.880
But to get back to the story, near the end
of the book, a riot breaks out.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.340
Our narrator is grazed by a bullet and joins in with a band of looters, ultimately helping them burn down the tenement apartment building where most of them live.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.820
He finds himself running from a group of young
men and he falls through an open manhole where he
decides to stop fighting and remain underground.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.620
So in the 1952 review of the book, Orville
Prescott wrote of Ellison,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.030
"He is not interested in literal realistic
truth, but in an emotional, atmospheric truth

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.860
which he drives home with violence, writing
about grotesquely violent situations.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.860
With gruesome power he has given 'Invisible
Man' the frenzied tension of a nightmare."

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.720
And like a nightmare, Invisible Man isn't only
about what happens, it's also about how it feels.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.960
The story is structured as a series of episodes,
and in each of these episodes we see the narrator
become more and more disillusioned.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.320
Like before being awarded a college scholarship
he's first made to participate in a fight, a "Battle
Royale" with other boys from his school.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.600
He worries that the dignity of his speech
accepting the scholarship will be compromised
and he has to deliver it with a mouth full of blood.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.220
Nathaniel Rich describes the scene as "a masterpiece
of storytelling, transfixing and indelible.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.620
But it is also the purest expression of Ellison's
argument:

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:40.760
a race stripped of volition and dignity, 
divided against itself, callously exploited,
rendered both invisible and blind."

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.860
Later when he's expelled from college, he's
surprised to find the headmaster, who he always
admires, scolding him saying,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.200
"You don't even know the difference between the
way things are and the way they're supposed to be."

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:59.020
The narrator is astonished to hear the headmaster
imply that he would sacrifice anything, including
others' lives, to hold onto his position in power.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.600
And then in the Brotherhood he again feels
like he's found a place to belong, where he
can be successful,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:13.360
but as he takes on a position of leadership, he gets an anonymous note in the mail, telling him to be careful not to go too fast and risk upsetting people who don't want to see a black person succeed.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.200
This is something civil rights activists heard
again and again in the 1950's and 60's:

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.720
"Go slow!
Let's not make too much change!"

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:27.180
And when the narrator sets the warning aside, he finds himself undermined and he's eventually abandoned by the Brotherhood which leads to the bloody and destructive riot.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.260
At every turn, the narrator finds that the
things he believes in most deeply turn out
to be not what they seem.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.360
And in each of these situations and in others,
the narrator's invisibility is made apparent.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.920
The people in power disregard his humanity
and they turn their backs on him or the things
he cares about.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:50.080
And throughout the novel, Ellison uses
imagery that invokes vision to help reinforce
these ideas of invisibility and lack of insight.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.060
The boys wear blindfolds during their Battle
Royale.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.180
A speaker at the college who praises the founder
of the school turns out to be blind.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:04.260
And Brother Jack, the leader of the Brotherhood
is revealed to have a glass eye just as he and the
narrator start to express their conflicting views.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.740
And when the narrator obstructs his own vision
using dark glasses, he's mistaken for another
person altogether â€“

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.080
a man named Rinehart who's been using
his own invisibility to create several different
personas in Harlem.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.560
And much of this experience of
invisibility has to do with race, and people's
perceptions and prejudices.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:28.200
The narrator's search for a strategy to escape prejudice leads him on this path through many other characters who believe that they've found the solution.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.740
And that if everybody, including the narrator, would
just follow their lead everything would be fixed.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.750
Like, his grandfather advocates that he should:

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.720
"...overcome 'em with yeses, undermine 'em
with grins, agree 'em to death and destruction..."

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.860
and in that process diminishing himself before
white people he'll somehow achieve equality.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:50.000
The headmaster believes the solution lies
in modeling your behavior on white people
who've achieved power;

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.840
he thinks that's how he's become powerful.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.440
And then there's Ras the Exhorter who
thinks destruction of whites is the key for
black people to gain their freedom.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.780
Our invisible narrator doesn't find a viable
path in any of these options.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:08.780
Through all his experiences and disillusionments,
the narrator begins to understand that he needs
to develop his own identity and beliefs,

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:17.360
and that he'll be of no help to himself or his
community if he prescribes one path to freedom
for all people, or blindly follow someone else's path.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.910
In the end he comes around to the idea that
understanding who we are as individuals is
what enables us to move forward.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.300
This is reinforced brilliantly in the Epilogue.
The narrator says:

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:31.270
"When one is invisible, he finds such problems
as good and evil, honesty and dishonesty,

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:37.760
of such shifting shapes that he confuses one
with the other, depending on who happens to
be looking through him at the time.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.400
Well now I've been trying to look through
myself and there's a risk in it.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:49.780
I was pulled this way and that for longer than
I can remember and my problem was that I always
tried to go in everyone's way but my own.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:54.120
So after years of trying to adopt the opinion
of others, I finally rebelled.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.000
I am an invisible man."

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.540
The critique Nathaniel Rich wrote:

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.640
"Ellison's hero discovers his own identity
through a process of negation.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:08.660
Disenchanted and Disenchanted and sickened
by his experiences in society, he comes to realize
the cruel extent of his powerlessness.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.840
The only escape available to him appears
in the form of a manhole, through which he
escapes underground.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.200
An invisible man canâ€™t be a college president,
or a business leader, or a politician.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.940
But at least he is spared the indignities
of an oppressed class.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.780
If you canâ€™t see him, he might be anywhere.
He might be everywhere."

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:33.740
But then again, at the end of the book, the
narrator is planning to emerge from his hibernation
and to take his place among society once again.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.340
In the cellar, alone, he has found himself.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:44.080
And while he's unsure of what his place in the
social order will be, he recognizes that he can't
make the impact he wants to, from underground.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.360
His final words to us are: "Who knows but
that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?"

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.020
And indeed, parts of his story are universal.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:57.520
It's up to us to find ourselves and to carry
our responsibilities to improve the social
order in which we live.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.340
But it's the phrase "lower frequencies" in
that sentence that's always stuck with me.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:07.620
Ellison here has made into a great American
hero a character who in most great American
novels would play a bit part.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.020
Ellison said later of the novel:

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:16.220
"The hero's invisibility is not a matter of
being seen, but a refusal to run the risk of
his own humanity, which involves guilt.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.660
This is not an attack upon white society!

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.100
It is what the hero refuses to do in each
section which leads to further action.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:30.120
He must assert and achieve his own humanity;
he cannot run with the pack and do this â€“ this
is the reason for all the reversals."

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.900
And by telling his individual story, the Invisible
Man brings light and visibility to many stories.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.880
