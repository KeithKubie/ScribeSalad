2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.580
<v 1>How good are you at learning languages? Solving puzzles, thinking logically,</v>

3
00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:08.950
and putting pieces together? Well,

4
00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:13.600
this summer there's a competition where you can find out and know it has nothing

5
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:16.240
to do with the World Cup, mostly

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.963
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

7
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.600
[inaudible].

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.780
<v 1>Every once in awhile I talk myself into learning a new language.</v>

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.640
Before I know it,

10
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:36.600
I'm checking out some course from the library that has me solving problems like

11
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:40.380
this. What do you mean scow?

12
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.350
Say what you are now feelings. What is it?

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.470
What do you say? Um,

14
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.310
what do your ex say? Oh, good job.

15
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.150
But when you get linguists and mathematicians together,

16
00:00:57.151 --> 00:01:00.390
problems look a little different. They're more like this.

17
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.330
The sentences on the left are in Zulu.

18
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.210
The translations are somewhere on the right.

19
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600
Can you match them before your eyes glaze over and start rolling back into your

20
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:12.720
skull?

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.200
Let me tell you that everything you need to solve that problem is right there in

22
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.160
front of your face.

23
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.080
That's the idea behind the international linguistics Olympiad coming up this

24
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.080
July where this would be one of the easy problems from Basque to bar codes,

25
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.750
bizarre notations to unfamiliar accounting systems,

26
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.960
all kinds of problems that are up for grabs, and it really,

27
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.710
no expertise is ever required other than your own smarts.

28
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.510
Oh, leave a comment to let me know how you guys do.

29
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.620
In the meantime,

30
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.220
I'm off to put some hard work into my regular programming for all you thoughtful

31
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:57.810
folks who stick around and hit the subscribe button. Stay happy,

32
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.210
keep those neurons firing and thanks for learning with me.
