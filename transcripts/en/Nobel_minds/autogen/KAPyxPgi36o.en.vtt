down this way yeah so I guess what
 

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.439
down this way yeah so I guess what
really is worrying about the case that

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:51.449
really is worrying about the case that
 

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:52.910
really is worrying about the case that
you are making is that we have this new

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920
you are making is that we have this new
 

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.460
you are making is that we have this new
technology on one hand and on the other

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:55.470
technology on one hand and on the other
 

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.519
technology on one hand and on the other
hand is this economic incentives it's I

00:11:58.519 --> 00:11:58.529
hand is this economic incentives it's I
 

00:11:58.529 --> 00:12:00.350
hand is this economic incentives it's I
mean this basically comes down to the

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360

for as long as possible to get their
 

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:11.210
for as long as possible to get their
data and so as you say there's no evil

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.220
data and so as you say there's no evil
 

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.670
data and so as you say there's no evil
scheme behind it it's just feeding into

the loop of correct
you know profit maximization and there's

00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:18.329
you know profit maximization and there's
 

00:12:18.329 --> 00:12:21.199
you know profit maximization and there's
nothing wrong with that but how do you

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:21.209
nothing wrong with that but how do you
 

00:12:21.209 --> 00:12:23.630
