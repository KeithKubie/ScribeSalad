00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Vsauce, Kevin here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.501
On November 15th, 1912,
an innocent family

00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:09.072
moved into a large, rambling house
with narrow windows

00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:12.485
seemingly incapable
of welcoming the sun's rays.

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:16.572
Soon after, the sound
of a door slamming shut by itself

00:00:16.572 --> 00:00:20.194
and footsteps inside the walls
terrified the parents.

00:00:20.194 --> 00:00:23.677
The children heard voices—
someone, or something,

00:00:23.677 --> 00:00:26.834
called out from beyond,
and all of the plants

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:28.834
withered and died.

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:33.266
This house truly was haunted
by carbon monoxide.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.071
The furnace was broken,
filling the entire home

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:39.275
with poisonous gas,
causing headaches, dizziness,

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:42.642
and auditory hallucinations,
but not ghosts.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.964
What the FAK?

00:00:44.964 --> 00:00:48.284
The facts and knowledge
on (not so) real ghosts.

00:00:48.284 --> 00:00:51.953
A legendary ghost ship known
as the Flying Dutchman

00:00:51.953 --> 00:00:55.714
roamed the waters, collecting the souls
of those who died at sea.

00:00:55.714 --> 00:00:59.425
Witnessing the phantom vessel
sailing the sky above the water

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:04.138
was an omen of doom—
a sign you'd never see land again.

00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:08.759
What sailors were actually seeing, however,
was a superior mirage effect

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.848
known as Fata Morgana.

00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:13.704
Light reflecting off cold water
can be bent

00:01:13.704 --> 00:01:16.723
by an unusual layer
of warm air above,

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:20.136
making a normal ship look
like a ghostly, glowing ship

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:24.060
that's sailing inside a wave
or flying over the sea.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.427
Reports of poltergeist activity
often reveal themselves

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:30.074
to be the work
of kids throwing household objects

00:01:30.074 --> 00:01:33.766
when their parents aren't looking,
and purported haunted hotels

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:38.265
have been busted having employees perform
many not-so-paranormal activities,

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.634
such as flicking the lights
on and off.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:44.372
But in 1973,
the Knocking Ghost of Boise

00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:47.646
baffled police and frightened a woman
and her daughter.

00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:50.316
The ghost
could successfully answer questions,

00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:52.336
like how many people
were in the room,

00:01:52.336 --> 00:01:54.495
by rapping on the floorboards,

00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:58.164
a knock so forceful
the officers felt the vibration

00:01:58.164 --> 00:02:00.164
in the soles of their shoes.

00:02:00.164 --> 00:02:02.854
They couldn't explain the ghost
in the crawl space.

00:02:02.854 --> 00:02:06.221
A news team came to investigate
and noticed the ghost

00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:10.052
only knocked when the woman stood
in a certain peculiar way.

00:02:10.052 --> 00:02:13.860
When confronted, she admitted
an abnormal condition in her ankle

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.320
caused a loud knocking sound
when she flexed her leg muscle.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.012
The mystery of the knocking ghost
was just a messed up ankle.

00:02:21.012 --> 00:02:24.448
Bloody Mary is a legend
whereby staring into a mirror

00:02:24.448 --> 00:02:27.815
in a room lit only by candlelight
and repeating the name

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:30.090
will summon her apparition.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.941
Originally, this ritual was performed
by a young woman

00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:35.496
hoping to see the face
of her future husband,

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:40.255
and if she saw a skull instead,
it meant she would die before being married.

00:02:40.255 --> 00:02:42.995
Staring into a mirror
in a dimly-lit room

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:47.059
can cause the Caputo Effect,
or strange face illusion,

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.654
which distorts
our face-specific interpretation system,

00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:54.044
really making it look
like another face is in the mirror.

00:02:54.044 --> 00:02:56.645
But whether you think
it's your future husband

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:59.362
or Queen Mary the First
is up to you.

00:02:59.362 --> 00:03:02.775
The science
behind understanding haunt events

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:05.909
that don't have logical explanations,
like a bum ankle

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.346
or an optical illusion,
is currently not so clear cut.

00:03:09.346 --> 00:03:13.038
We know that magnetic fields
can cause hallucinations

00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:17.008
that result in rushes of fear
and experiencing apparitions.

00:03:17.008 --> 00:03:20.277
This has led to the suggestion
that haunted locations

00:03:20.277 --> 00:03:23.272
may actually contain
anomalous magnetic fields,

00:03:23.272 --> 00:03:25.339
which induce hallucinations,

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:27.498
thereby causing haunt events.

00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:30.679
But a lot more research is needed
to prove this theory.

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:35.065
Psychologist Richard Wiseman suggests
infrasonic vibrations

00:03:35.065 --> 00:03:37.085
as a cause for ghost sightings.

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:40.614
Infrasound is lower in frequency
than human hearing,

00:03:40.614 --> 00:03:43.006
but can be felt
in parts of the body.

00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:45.838
For instance, it can cause
an eyeball to resonate,

00:03:45.838 --> 00:03:48.346
making it appear
like a mysterious object

00:03:48.346 --> 00:03:52.641
is floating in your periphery,
but when you turn to look, it's gone.

00:03:52.641 --> 00:03:57.726
An infrasound around 19 hertz
can cause feelings of fear and shivering.

00:03:57.726 --> 00:04:00.722
But even so, magnetic fields
and infrasound

00:04:00.722 --> 00:04:04.762
are external triggers
creating unknown sights and sounds

00:04:04.762 --> 00:04:08.825
that human brains may then interpret
as coming from the supernatural,

00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:13.190
because we're obsessed
with giving agency to the unexplained,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.929
seeing human-like behavior
in meaningless stimuli.

00:04:16.929 --> 00:04:19.970
Psychologists in the 1940s
set up an experiment

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.339
in which they showed people
a meaningless cartoon

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:25.979
of a large triangle, small triangle,
and circle

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.999
moving in and out of a box.

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:31.366
Instantly, people created detailed stories
about the shapes,

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:34.501
such as the circle being in love
with the little triangle,

00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:38.216
with the big triangle trying
to steal the circle away,

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:41.815
constructing a meaning
for something devoid of one.

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:45.530
So with illusions, gas leaks,
and inaudible sound waves,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.129
will science eventually bust
all of the ghosts,

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.005
or just leave us alone in the dark
with whatever is left out there?

00:04:54.005 --> 00:04:57.766
And as always,
thanks for watching.
