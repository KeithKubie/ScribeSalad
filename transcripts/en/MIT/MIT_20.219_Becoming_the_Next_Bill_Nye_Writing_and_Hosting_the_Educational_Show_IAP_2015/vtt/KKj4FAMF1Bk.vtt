MALE SPEAKER: Really
good really good.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.509
Yeah.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:10.300
Very, very excited.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.641
I have like three
most useful things,

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:21.140
so I don't know
what that counts as.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.540
But I think you have first
thing you have preparation.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.670
I learned a lot about
the preparation process

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.880
in the video, which I previously
didn't actually consider.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.880
I used to think of people
with their shaky cameras.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.810
Then actually have an idea
of what they're doing.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.530
But most of the time they
probably had a storyboard.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.620
And it's not like by accident.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.120
And then eventually it
becomes the idea of iteration.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.830
So you have to keep
trying different scenes.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.400
Many, many takes.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.410
It never came to my mind.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.010
And lastly, you have to
have the passion for this.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.820
Because you would
do a lot of takes.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.970
You will be pretty
sleepy after a while,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.860
but you love what you've done.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.770
And I'm kind of excited
to show what I have.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.960
I guess the hardest part
is there's so much content,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.325
and there's a lot of
technical stuff there.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.880
I wish I knew more
about the Creative Suite

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.960
and the software.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.060
So I guess I was limited
in that department.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.390
But other than that, I think
the preparation part gives me

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.220
the background.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.810
It helps me to do a lot
of different things.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.310
Yeah.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.590
Thank you.
