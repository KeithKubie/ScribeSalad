00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's one way to answer this question.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We have our two variable definitions.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We can print out the distance light travels in one cycle

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
by dividing the speed of light by cycles per second using the variables.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
When we run that, we see the result is 0.11.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's 0.11 m or 11 cm.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Another way to solve this that might be better would be to introduce another variable.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Instead of just printing the result, we can store it in a variable.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We'll call it "cycle&amp;#95;distance".

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now when we run it, there's no result.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We haven't printed that out yet, but we've stored it in a variable.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now we can print out the result of cycle&amp;#95;distance,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which gives us the 0.11 m.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
If we want the results in centimeters--

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
well, since we've already stored the result in meters in a variable,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we can compute that by just multiplying that by 100.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now we get the result in centimeters.
