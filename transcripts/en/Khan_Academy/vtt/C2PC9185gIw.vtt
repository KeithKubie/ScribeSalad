00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.870
I've talked a lot about the idea
that eigenvectors could

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.650
make for good bases or
good basis vectors.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.610
So let's explore that idea
a little bit more.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.230
Let's say I have some
transformation.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.310
Let's say it's a transformation
from Rn to Rn,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.010
and it can be represented
by the matrix, A.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.340
So the transformation of x
is equal to the n-by-n

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.520
matrix, A times x.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.830
Now let's say that we have
n linearly independent

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.430
eigenvectors of A.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.320
And this isn't always going to
be the case, but it can often

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.940
be the case.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.370
It's definitely possible.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.460
Let's assume that A has
n linearly independent

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.710
eigenvectors.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.980
So I'm going to call them v1,
v2, all the way through vn.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.450
Now, n linearly independent
vectors in Rn can definitely

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.610
be a basis for Rn.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.980
We've seen that multiple
times.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.510
And what I want to show you in
this video is that this makes

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.410
a particularly good basis
for this transformation.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.970
So let's explore that.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.140
So the transformation of each of
these vectors-- I'll write

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.240
it over here.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.250
The transformation of vector 1
is equal to A times vector 1

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.130
and since vector 1 is an
eigenvector of A, that's going

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.040
to be equal to some eigenvalue
lambda 1 times vector 1.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.300
We could do that for
all of them.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.430
The transformation of vector 2
is equal to A times v2, which

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.550
is equal to some eigenvalue
lambda 2 times v2.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.120
And I'm just going to skip all
of them and just go straight

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.960
to the nth one.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.850
We have n of these
eigenvectors.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.900
You might have a lot more.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.630
We're just assuming that A
has at least n linearly

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.750
independent eigenvectors.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.785
In general, you could take
scaled up versions of these

00:02:08.785 --> 00:02:10.780
and they'll also be
eigenvectors.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.640
Let's see, so the transformation
of vn is going

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.040
to be equal to A times vn.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.860
And because these are all
eigenvectors, A times vn is

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.580
just going to be lambda n,
some eigenvalue times the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.810
vector, vn.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.820
Now, what are these
also equal to?

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.910
Well, this is equal to, and this
is probably going to be

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.360
unbelievably obvious to you, but
this is the same thing as

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.210
lambda 1 times vn plus 0
times v2 plus all the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.760
way to 0 times vn.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.440
And this right here is going to
be 0 times v1 plus lambda 2

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.010
times v2 plus all the way,
0 times all of the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.660
other vectors vn.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.170
And then this guy down here,
this is going to be 0 times v1

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.940
plus 0 times v2 plus 0 times
all of these basis vectors,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.240
these eigenvectors, but
lambda n times vn.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.060
This is almost stunningly
obvious, right?

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.400
I just rewrote this as this plus
a bunch of zero vectors.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.110
But the reason why I wrote that
is, because in a second,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.410
we're going to take this as a
basis and we're going to find

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.860
coordinates with respect to that
basis, and so this guy's

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.180
coordinates will be lambda 1,
0, 0, because that's the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.050
coefficients on our
basis vectors.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.620
So let's do that.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.760
So let's say that we define
this as some basis.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.775
So B is equal to the set of--
actually, I don't even have to

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:41.780
write it that way.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.990
Let's say I say that B,
I have some basis B,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.330
that's equal to that.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.710
What I want to show you is that
when I do a change of

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.260
basis-- we've seen this before--
in my standard

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.380
coordinates or in coordinates
with respect to the standard

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.520
basis, you give me some vector
in Rn, I'm going to multiply

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.130
it times A, and you're
going to have the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.600
transformation of it.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.130
It's also going to be in Rn.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.705
Now, we know we can do
a change of basis.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.370
And in a change of basis, if you
want to go that way, you

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.610
multiply by C inverse, which
is-- remember, the change of

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.529
basis matrix C, if you want to
go in this direction, you

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:19.950
multiply by C.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.640
The change of basis matrix is
just a matrix with all of

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.920
these vectors as columns.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.430
It's very easy to construct.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.890
But if you change your basis
from x to our new basis, you

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.810
multiply it by the
inverse of that.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.070
We've seen that multiple
times.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.210
If they're all orthonormal, then
this is the same thing as

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.930
a transpose.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.600
We can't assume that, though.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.800
And so this is going to
be x in our new basis.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.810
And if we want to find some
transformation, if we want to

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.810
find the transformation matrix
for T with respect to our new

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.970
basis, it's going to
be some matrix D.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.510
And if you multiply D times x,
you're going to get this guy,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.670
but you're going to get the B
representation of that guy.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.900
The transformation of the vector
x is B representation.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.620
And if we want to go back and
forth between that guy and

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.880
that guy, if we want to go in
this direction, you can

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.030
multiply this times C, and
you'll just get the

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.300
transformation of x.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.580
And if you want to go in that
direction, you could multiply

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.580
by the inverse of your change
of basis matrix.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.110
We've seen this multiple
times already.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.340
But what I've claimed or I've
kind of hinted at is that if I

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.960
have a basis that's defined by
eigenvectors of A, that this

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.910
will be a very nice matrix,
that this might be the

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.860
coordinate system that you want
to operate in, especially

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.410
if you're going to apply
this matrix a lot.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.230
If you're going to do this
transformation on a lot of

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.080
different things, you're going
to do it over and over and

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.100
over again, maybe to the same
set, then it maybe is worth

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.070
the overhead to do the
conversion and just use this

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.350
as your coordinate system.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.660
So let's see that this will
actually be a nice-looking,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.700
easy-to-compute-with and
actually diagonal matrix.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.060
So we know that the
transformation-- what is the

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.850
transformation of-- let's
write this in a bunch of

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.790
different formats.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.700
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.590
So if I wanted to write the
transformation of v1 in B

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.410
coordinates, what would it be?

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.710
It's just going to be equal to--
well, these are the basis

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.380
vectors, right?

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.010
So it's the coefficient
on the basis vectors.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.110
So it's going to be equal to
lambda 1, and then there's a

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.710
bunch of zeroes.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.846
It's lambda 1 times v1 plus 0
times v2 plus 0 times v3, all

00:06:34.846 --> 00:06:37.160
the way to 0 times vn.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.520
That's what it's equal to.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.200
But it's also equal to D, and
we can write D like this.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.250
D is also a transformation
between Rn and Rn, just a

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.210
different coordinate system.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.120
So D is going to just be a bunch
of column vectors d1,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.790
d2, all the way through dn
times-- this is the same thing

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.680
as D times our B representation

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.030
of the vector v1.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.720
But what is our B
representation

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.140
of the vector v1?

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:10.490
Well, the vector, v1 is just 1
times v1 plus 0 times v2 plus

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:17.360
0 times v3 all the way
to 0 times vn.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.970
v1 is a basis vector.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.900
That's just 1 times itself plus
0 times everything else.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.240
So this is what its
representation is in the B

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.490
coordinate system.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.350
Now, what is this going
to be equal to?

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.370
And we've seen this before.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.010
This is all a bit of review.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.800
I might even be boring you.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.420
This is just equal to 1 times
d1 plus 0 times d2 plus 0

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.570
times all the other columns.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.270
This is just equal to d1.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.985
So just like that, we have our
first column of our matrix D.

00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:44.970
We could just keep doing that.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.300
I'll do it multiple times.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:55.810
The transformation of v2 in our
new coordinate system with

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.200
respect to our new basis is
going to be equal to-- well,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.380
we know what the transformation
of v2 is.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:10.330
It's 0 times v1 plus lambda 2
times v2 and then plus 0 times

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.580
everything else.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:19.920
And that's the same thing as D,
d1, d2, all the way through

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.240
dn times our B representation
of vector 2.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.910
Well, vector 2 is one of
the basis vectors.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.669
It's just 0 times v1 plus 1
times v2 plus 0 times v3 all

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.864
the way, the rest is 0.

00:08:33.864 --> 00:08:35.760
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.539
This is 0 times d1 plus
1 times d2 and 0 times

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:44.550
everything else, so
it's equal to d2.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.860
I think you get the
general idea.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.450
I'll do it one more time
just to really

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.380
hammer the point home.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.880
The transformation of the nth
basis vector, which is also an

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.690
eigenvector of our original
matrix A or of our

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.030
transformation in standard
coordinates, in B coordinates,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.710
is going to be equal to what?

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.370
Well, we wrote it
right up here.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.110
It's going to be a
bunch of zeroes.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.530
It's 0 times all of these guys
plus lambda n times vn.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:20.580
And this is going to be this guy
d1, d2, all the way to dn

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.930
times the B representation of
the nth basis vector, which is

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.740
just 0 times v1, 0 times v2
and 0 times all of them,

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.970
except for 1 times vn.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.790
And so this is going to be equal
to 0 times d1 plus 0

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.210
times d2 plus 0 times all
of these guys all the

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.520
way to 1 times dn.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.570
So that's going to
be equal to dn.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.810
And just like that, we know what
our transformation matrix

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.310
is going to look like with
respect to this new basis,

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.880
where this basis was defined or
it's made up of n linearly

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.730
independent eigenvectors of
our original matrix A.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.560
So what does D look like?

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.700
Our matrix D is going to look
like-- its first column is

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.170
right there.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.490
We figured that one out.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.440
Lambda 1, and then we just
have a bunch of zeroes.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.640
Its second column
is right here.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.920
d2 is equal to this.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.040
It's 0, lambda 2, and then
a bunch of zeroes.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.610
And then this is in
general the case.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.010
The nth column is going to have
a zero everywhere except

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:24.700
along the diagonal.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.985
It's going to be lambda n.

00:10:25.985 --> 00:10:28.620
It's going to be the eigenvalue
for the nth

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.210
eigenvector.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.180
And so the diagonal is going to
look-- you're going to have

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.510
lambda 3 all the way
down to lambda n.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.890
And our nth column is lambda n
with just a bunch of zeroes

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.560
everywhere.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.130
So D, when we picked-- this
is a neat result.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:51.990
If A has n linearly independent
eigenvectors, and

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.500
this isn't always the case,
but we can figure out that

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.380
eigenvectors and say, hey, I can
take a collection of n of

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.970
these that are linearly
independent, then those will

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.350
be a basis for Rn.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:07.930
n linearly independent vectors
in Rn are a basis for Rn.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.080
But when you use that basis,
when you use the linearly

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.320
independent eigenvectors of A
as a basis, we call this an

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.570
eigenbasis.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:26.310
The transformation matrix with
respect to that eigenbasis, it

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.220
becomes a very, very
nice matrix.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.230
This is super easy
to multiply.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.050
It's super easy to invert.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.370
It's super easy to take
the determinant of.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.330
We've seen it multiple times.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.900
It just has a ton of
neat properties.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.820
It's just a good basis
to be dealing with.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.030
So that's kind of the
big takeaway.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.780
In all of linear algebra, we did
all this stuff with spaces

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.670
and vectors and all of that,
but in general, vectors are

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:55.100
abstract representations
of real world things.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.010
You could represent a vector
as the stock returns or it

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.540
could be a vector of weather
in a certain part of the

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.730
country, and you can create
these spaces based on the

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.440
number of dimensions
and all of that.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.090
And then you're going to
have transformations.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.690
Sometimes, like when we learn
about Markov chains, your

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.780
transformations are essentially
what's the

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:15.910
probability after one time
increment that something state

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.980
will change to something else,
then you'll want to apply that

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.230
matrix many, many, many, many
times to see what the stable

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.520
state is for a lot of things.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.660
And I know I'm not explaining
any of this to you well, but I

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.370
wanted to tell you that all of
linear algebra is really just

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.140
a very general way to solve a
whole universe of problems.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.730
And what's useful about this is
you can have transformation

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.390
matrices that define
these functions

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.680
essentially on data sets.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.260
And what we've learned now is
that when you look at the

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.130
eigenvectors and the
eigenvalues, you can change

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.640
your bases so that you can solve
your problems in much

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.360
simpler ways.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.950
And I know it's all very
abstract right now, but you

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.560
now have the toolkit, and the
rest of your life, you have to

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.300
figure out how to apply this
toolkit to specific problems

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:04.510
in probability or statistics or
finance or modeling weather

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.960
systems or who knows
what else.
