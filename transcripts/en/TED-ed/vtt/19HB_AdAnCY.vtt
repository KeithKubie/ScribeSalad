00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:09.174
My name is Melissa Perez.

00:00:09.174 --> 00:00:12.564
I was born and raised in the Bronx, New York City,

00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:14.578
but my parents are Mexican.

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:18.485
Two years ago, graduating high school

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.675
was not even in my plans.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:24.423
I was doing horribly in school.

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:31.730
Going to a school that has metal detectors is stressful.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.595
You have to stand in line 25 minutes to an hour.

00:00:37.947 --> 00:00:40.507
I would only go in third period

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:41.950
and come out fourth.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.008
I went third period

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.214
because I knew they didn't take attendance first and second.

00:00:46.214 --> 00:00:48.177
So, basically, if you were going third period,

00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:50.348
they would mark you present for the whole day.

00:00:50.348 --> 00:00:52.859
I just wasn't interested in school.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.140
Then, when I was 17,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.079
I gave birth to my daughter, Madeline.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.084
Getting pregnant changed my approach tremendously.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:07.114
I thought, "I'm pregnant, I don't have a diploma.

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:09.144
So what I am I going to be working the rest of my life?

00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:10.659
$7.25 an hour?

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.042
No! I have to graduate and go to college."

00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:20.939
Being a mom, still going to high school is, ummm,

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.286
overwhelming, I would say, at the beginning,

00:01:24.286 --> 00:01:27.811
but I had this math teacher who encouraged me

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:30.320
to go on with school.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.719
She always said that she saw something in me.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.125
She was like, "I know there's something inside you there

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.294
that wants to fight for it."

00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:39.716
She always pushes me,

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:42.627
she always gives me the hard questions

00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:46.002
because she knows that my favorite subject is math.

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:47.205
She's always like, "Melissa, figure this out.

00:01:47.205 --> 00:01:48.501
Melissa, figure that out."

00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:49.638
And I'm like, "Okay, okay."

00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:50.304
I like that about her

00:01:50.304 --> 00:01:52.353
because she always tends to push me.

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:55.870
Thelma is the first teacher

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.013
that has treated me,

00:01:58.013 --> 00:01:59.271
you know,

00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:00.883
I guess, special.

00:02:02.098 --> 00:02:05.421
After I had my baby, I got my head into the game

00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:07.323
and I passed my classes.

00:02:07.323 --> 00:02:10.159
Being a mom at a young age

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.259
either makes you or breaks you,

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.330
but, in my case, it made me.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.472
It made me have a total different visual for my future.

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:23.469
I am the first person in my family

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:29.727
to graduate from high school.
