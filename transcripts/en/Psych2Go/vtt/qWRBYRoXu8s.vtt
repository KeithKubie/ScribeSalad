00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
(intro)

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we all make mistakes from time to time

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.400
and nobody is perfect so learning how to

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.740
give an effective apology is a useful tool

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.680
apologizing can rebuild trust or

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.940
even repair a strained relationship

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.740
one : Regret

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.019
it's important to start your apology by

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.180
clearly conveying your regret over your

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.460
behavior acknowledge the pain

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.470
disappointment or inconvenience you

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.110
caused and having empathy towards the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.120
person you've heard

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.620
two : Responsibilities

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.809
this means owning up to your mistake and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.149
taking the blame except complete

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.280
responsibility for what you did in the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.680
consequences of your actions for your

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.170
apology to be effective you can't try to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.270
shift the blame to someone else

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.520
which brings us to

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.020
three : Make no excuses

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.660
its natural to want to make excuses for

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.210
your actions when apologizing but it may

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.940
come off as insincere on the other hand

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.710
by taking responsibility for your

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.500
actions without making excuses you will

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.450
likely gain respect and forgiveness from

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.320
the person you're apologizing to

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.980
Four : Remedy

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.880
offer a way to make up for the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.400
damage you've caused this can be done in

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.860
a number of ways such as promising not

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.570
to do it again we're paying for any

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.250
physical damage you caused

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.000
Five : Requests for forgiveness

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.380
make it a point to ask

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.740
for forgiveness

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.960
this may seem obvious but you have to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.549
make sure that the person you're

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.829
apologizing to knows that you want to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.280
gain their forgiveness not just relieve

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.580
yourself of any kill you feel

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.180
keep intention and attitude in mind when

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.850
you're apologizing coming across as

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.960
insincere will lower your chances of being forgiven

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.030
it's important that you reflect on what

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.280
you've done wrong and truly feel sorry

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.110
for what you did before attempting to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.369
apologize

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.500
try putting yourself in the shoes of the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.420
person you're apologizing to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.000
would you be upset if you were them?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.100
What would you want to hear as far as an apology goes?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.640
also don't forget that intention and

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.979
attitude can be translated non-verbally

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.120
as well through eye contact

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.360
facial expressions and body language

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.040
take some time to think about the last

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.379
time you apologize to someone or someone

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.659
else apologize to you do you think it

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:23.830
was effective
