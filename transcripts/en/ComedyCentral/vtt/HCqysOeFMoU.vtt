00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.770
And now it's time
for tonight's #HashtagWars.

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:05.739
(cheering)

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.246
Please welcome
this week's sponsor

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.315
that I am legally bound
to introduce right now,

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.984
Mr. Donald Trump.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.952
-♪
-(cheering)

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.723
It's my birthday.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.658
-It's not your birthday.
-It's my birthday, too.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.193
It is definitely
not your birthday.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.328
I want to sing,
♪ Deutschland, Deutschland

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:31.098
-♪ Uber alles. -No, it's not
your birthday. Stop singing.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.400
Stop it.
It's not your birthday.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.335
This is our...

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:38.305
Let someone else have a moment.
Let someone else have a moment.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.307
I have every moment.
I buy all the moments.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.642
-All right, fine.
-(laughter)

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.144
This is our second-to-last night
with Donald Trump.

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:46.446
Uh, we wanted--
next week it'll all be over--

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.148
uh, we wanted
a chance to discuss

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:49.516
the truly important issues
with him,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.552
as he is running for President
of the United States,

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:53.820
so that is why tonight's hashtag
is HowIWillFixEverything.

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:56.089
All right? Very educational.
Examples might include:

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:58.292
increasing funding for Zika
and other dangerous diseases;

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.360
-No. -or: deal with North
Korea's burgeoning nuclear...

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.129
-What do you mean, no?
-Unbelievable. Hold it.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.664
I'm sorry, Chip.
Hold it right there.

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.098
Wha... It's the hashtag!

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:08.402
Listen to me, Chip Sajak.
I'll fix America right now

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.404
by changing that stupid hashtag.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:12.472
-It's a very thought-provoking
hashtag. -No, it's not.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:14.808
I want to prove
that I can do Internet puns

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.910
better than anybody--
especially your panel

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:18.745
of aging baristas here.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:21.515
(laughter, groaning)

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:25.652
Tonight's hashtag
is something truly dumb.

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.654
Hashtag #FishTV.

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:29.623
FishT... We can't do...
That's ridiculous!

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:33.193
You're like a...
an extra-large baby in a tie.

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:35.562
I would hate myself, then,
'cause I hate babies.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:38.031
I grind them up and then
snort them like cocaine.

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:40.667
All right, that's enough,
that's enough. That is...

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:42.970
The hashtag is #FishTV, I guess.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:44.972
What are... what
would examples of that be?

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:47.074
Examples may include:
<i>Golden Gills;</i>

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.842
or: <i>Don't Trust the Beach</i>

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:50.811
<i>-in Apartment 23. </i>
-(scattered laughter)

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.080
-Isn't that funny?
-Well, the crowd loved it.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.516
-(laughter) -So I guess
I have to put 60 seconds

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.217
on the clock, and begin.

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:58.852
-Johnny.
<i>-To Catch a Predator,</i>

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.587

-Yes, points.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:04.224
-It's Artemis's turn.
-Excuse me.

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:06.360
You don't even have a buzzer.
You don't even have a buzzer.

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:07.594
-Excuse me.
-What?

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:09.730
<i>-Blubber, She Wrote. </i>
-All right, fine.

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:11.431
(laughter)

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.468
-Artemis. -Uh,
<i>The Fellatio with Matt Lauer.</i>

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.203

-TRUMP: Excuse me.
-What?

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.318
-Excuse me. Excuse me. -Why
didn't you just get a butter?

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.853
You paid
for the whole (bleep) show.

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.755
-You couldn't buy a buzzer?
-I got a buzzer

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:36.290
<i>and</i> a butter, Chip.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:37.891
-You son of a bitch.
-And let me tell you,

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:40.194
I got the butter somewhere
you don't want to know about.

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:43.030
Let me tell you,
I binge-watch this.

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:44.398
<i>Sturgeon Things.</i>

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.632

Uh, Cheryl.
