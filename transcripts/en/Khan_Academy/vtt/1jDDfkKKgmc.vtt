00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.030
What I want to do in this
video is revisit a little bit

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.210
of what we know
about pi, and really

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.960
how we measure
angles in radians.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.550
And then think about
whether pi is necessarily

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.510
the best number to be
paying attention to.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.900
So let's think a little
bit about what I just said.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.610
So pi, we know, is
defined-- and I'll

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.900
write defined as a
triple equal sign,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.560
I guess you could call it
that way-- pi is defined

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.720
as the ratio of the
circumference of a circle

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.009
to its diameter, which is
the same thing as the ratio

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.390
of the circumference of the
circle to two times the radius.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.060
And from that, we get all
these interesting formulas

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.270
that you get in geometry
class that, hey, if you

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.130
have the radius and you want
to calculate the circumference,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.400
multiply both sides of this
definition, or this equation,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.100
by two times the radius.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.660
And you get two times
the radius times

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.090
pi is equal to
the circumference,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.210
or more familiarly, it
would be circumference

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.985
is equal to 2 pi r.

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:06.610
This is one of those
fundamental things

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.790
that you learn early
on in your career

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.060
and you use it to find
circumferences, usually,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.750
or figure out radiuses if
you know circumference.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.490
And from that comes how we
measure our angles in radians

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.100
once we get to
trigonometry class.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.310
And just as a review here,
let me draw myself a circle.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.280
Let me draw myself
a better circle.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.000
So there is my--
it'll do the job.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.910
And here is the
positive x-axis, and let

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.220
me make some angle here.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.760
I'll make the angle
kind of obvious

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.140
just so that it-- so
let me make this angle.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.176
And the way that
we measure angles,

00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:49.550
when we talk about
radians, we're

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.600
really talking about
the angle subtended

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.500
by something of a
certain arc length.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.405
And we measure the
arc length in-- well,

00:01:56.405 --> 00:01:57.780
the way I like to
think about it,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.170
is the angle is in radians
and the arc length itself

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.507
is in radiuses, which
isn't really a word.

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:05.840
But that's how I think about it.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.770
How many radiuses
is this arc length

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.080
that subtends the
angle in radians?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.380
So let me show you
what I'm talking about.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.600
So this arc length right
here, if the radius

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.540
is r, what is the length
of this arc length?

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.090
Well, we know from
basic geometry

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.830
the entire
circumference over here

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.730
is going to be 2 pi r, right?

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.710
This entire
circumference, that's

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.420
really by definition,
this entire circumference

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.850
is going to be 2 pi r.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.580
So what is just this
arc length here?

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.210
And I'm assuming this is
a fourth of the circle.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.100
So it's going to
be 2 pi r over 4.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.940
So this arc length
over here is going

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.650
to be 2 pi r over 4, which is
the same thing as pi over 2 r.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.700
Or you could say this
is the same thing

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.430
as pi over 2 radiuses.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.734
One of those-- you
know, not a real word,

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:07.400
but that's how I like
to think about it.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.920
Or you could say it subtends
an angle of pi over 2 radians.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.710
So over here, theta
is pi over 2 radians.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.900
And so really, when you're
measuring angles in radians,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.420
it's really you're saying,
OK, that angle subtended

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.340
by an arc that has a length of
how many radiusi, or I don't

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.442
even know what the
plural of radius is.

00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:35.090
Actually, I think it's
radii but it's fun

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.575
to try to say radiuses.

00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:38.700
Radii, actually let me do
that just so no one says,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.790
Sal, you're teaching people the
wrong plural form of radius.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.170
Radii.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.290
So this arc length
is pi over 2 radii

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.590
and it subtends an angle
of pi over 2 radians.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.940
We could do another
one just for the sake

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.850
of making the point clear.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.780
If you went all the
way around the circle

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.100
and you got back to the
positive x-axis here,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.240
what is the arc length?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.000
Well now, all of a
sudden the arc length

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.310
is the entire circumference
of the circle.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.420
It would be 2 pi r, which is
the same thing as 2 pi radii.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.260
And we would say that the angle
subtended by this arc length,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.770
the angle that we
care about going

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.700
all the way around the
circle, is 2 pi radians.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.170
And so, out of this
comes all of the things

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.810
that we know about how to
graph trigonometric functions

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.100
or at least how we measure
the graph on the x-axis.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.640
And I'll also touch on
Euler's formula, which

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.520
is the most beautiful formula,
I think, in all of mathematics.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.910
And let's visit those right
now, just to remind ourselves

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.260
of how pi fits in
to all of that.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.510
So if I think about our
trigonometric functions.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.530
Remember, if this was-- so
on trigonometric functions,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.750
we assume we have
a unit circle here.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.615
So in the trig functions, this
is the unit circle definition

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:03.490
of the trig function.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.530
So this is a nice
review of all of that.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.080
You assume you have a unit
circle, a circle of radius 1.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.510
And then the trig
functions are defined as,

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.020
for any angle you have
here, for any angle, theta,

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.660
cosine of theta is how
far you have to move in--

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.780
or the x-coordinate of the
point along the arc that

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.080
subtends this angle.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.870
So that's cosine of theta.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.785
And then sine of theta is
the y value of that point.

00:05:38.302 --> 00:05:39.260
Let me make that clear.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:46.310
Cosine of theta is the x value,
sine of theta is the y value.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.210
And so if you were to graph
one of these functions,

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.380
and I'll just do sine of
theta for convenience.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.640
But you could try it
with cosine of theta.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.520
So let's graph sine of theta.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.840
Let's do one revolution
of sine of theta.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.840
And we tend to label
it-- so let's do sine.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.896
When the angle is 0,
sine of theta is 0.

00:06:05.896 --> 00:06:08.020
Let me draw the x- and
y-axis just so you remember.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.065
This is the y-axis and
this is the x-axis.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.630
So when the angle is 0, we're
right here on the unit circle.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.860
The y value there is 0.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.440
So sine of theta is going
to be right like that.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.160
Let me draw it like this.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.110
So this is our
theta, and this is--

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.590
I'm going to graph sine
of theta along the y-axis.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.610
So we'll say y is equal to
sine of theta in this graph

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.670
that I'm drawing
right over here.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.730
And then we could
do-- well, I'll

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.200
just do the simple points here.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.830
And then if we
make the angle go--

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.440
if we did it in
degrees, 90 degrees,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.880
or if we do it in radians,
pi over 2 radians.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.280
What is sine of theta?

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.461
Well, now it is 1.

00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:53.460
This is the unit circle.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.480
It has a radius 1.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.740
So when theta is equal to pi
over 2, then sine of theta

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.460
is equal to 1.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.282
So if this is 1 right here,
sine of theta is equal to 1.

00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:12.060
If theta-- and then if we
go 180 degrees or halfway

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.580
around the circle--
theta is now equal to pi.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.320
Let me do this in
a color, orange.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.070
I have already used orange.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.630
Theta is now equal to pi.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.230
When theta is equal to pi, the
y value of this point right

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.770
here is once again 0.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.860
So we go back to 0.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.350
Remember, we're talking
about sine of theta.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.400
And then we can go
all the way down here,

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.320
where you can see
there's 270 degrees.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:46.780
Or you could view this
as 3 pi over 2 radians.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.610
So this is in
radians, this axis.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.010
So 3 pi over 2
radians, sine of theta

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.549
is the y-coordinate on the
unit circle right over here.

00:07:56.549 --> 00:07:57.840
So it's going to be negative 1.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.320
So this is negative 1.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.370
And then finally, when you go
all the way around the circle,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:12.840
you've gone 2 pi radians, and
you're back where you began.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.710
And the sine of theta,
or the y-coordinate,

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.710
is now 0 once again.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.590
And if you connect the dots, or
if you'd plotted more points,

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.880
you would see a sine
curve over just the part

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.875
that we've graphed
right over here.

00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:26.125
So that's another application.

00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:27.280
You say hey, Sal,
where is this going?

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.120
Well I'm showing you--
I'm reminding you

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.619
of all of these
things because we're

00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:34.549
going to revisit it with a
different number other than pi.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:37.380
And so I want to do
one last visit with pi.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.980
You say, look, pi is powerful
because-- or one of the reasons

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.570
why pi seems to have some
type of mystical power,

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.090
and we've shown this in
the calculus playlist--

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:51.550
is Euler's formula,
that e to the i theta

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.710
is equal to cosine of
theta plus i sine of theta.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.370
This, by itself,
is just a crazy--

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.410
it's just one of those
mind boggling formulas.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.680
But it sometimes looks
even more mind boggling

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.090
when you put pi in for theta
because then, from Euler's

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.880
formula, you would
get e to the i pi

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.510
is equal to-- well,
what's cosine of pi?

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.840
Cosine of pi is negative 1.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.630
And then sine of pi is 0.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.860
So 0 times i.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.010
So you get this formula,
which is pretty profound,

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.730
and then you say,
OK, if I want to put

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.700
all of the fundamental numbers
together in one formula,

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.790
I can add 1 to
both sides of this.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:35.750
And you get e to the i
pi plus 1 is equal to 0.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.920
Sometimes this is called Euler's
Identity, the most beautiful

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.230
formula or equation
in all of mathematics.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.490
And it is pretty profound.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.790
You have all of the fundamental
numbers in one equation.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:50.620
e, i, pi, 1, 0, although
for my aesthetic taste

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.250
it would have been even
more powerful if this

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.264
was a 1 right over here.

00:09:54.264 --> 00:09:55.680
Because then this
would have said,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.880
look, e to the i pi,
this bizarre thing,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.590
would have equaled unity.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.130
That would have been super
duper profound to me.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.540
It seems a little bit of a
hack to add 1 to both sides

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.820
and say, oh, look,
now I have 0 here.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.100
But this is pretty darn good.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.770
But with that, I'm
going to make-- well,

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.020
I'm not going to argue for it.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.740
I'm going to show an
argument for another number,

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.410
a number different than pi.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.160
And I want to make it clear
that these ideas are not my own.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.390
It comes from--
well, it's inspired

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.410
by-- many people are on this
movement now, the Tau Movement,

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.490
but these are kind
of the people that

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.050
gave me the thinking on this.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.629
And the first is Robert
Palais on "Pi is Wrong."

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:39.670
And he doesn't argue that
pi is calculated wrong.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.880
He still agrees that it is
the ratio of the circumference

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.330
to the diameter of a
circle that is 3.14159.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.540
But what he's saying is
that we're paying attention

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.900
to the wrong number.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.570
And also, you have Michael
Hartl, "The Tau Manifesto."

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.940
All of this is available online.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.545
And what they argue for
is a number called tau,

00:10:57.545 --> 00:10:59.530
or what they call tau.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.090
And they define tau, and it's
a very simple change from pi.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.030
They define tau not as the
ratio of the circumference

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.520
the diameter, or the ratio of
the circumference to 2 times

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.340
the radius.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.980
They say, hey, wouldn't
it be natural to define

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.990
some number, the ratio of the
circumference to the radius?

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.930
And as you see here, this
pi is just one half times

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.020
this over here, right?

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.250
Circumference over 2 r, this
the same thing as one half times

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.550
circumference over r.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.850
So pi is just half of tau.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:34.020
Or another way to think about it
is that tau is just 2 times pi.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.802
Or, and I'm sure
you probably don't

00:11:36.802 --> 00:11:38.760
have this memorized,
because you're like, wait,

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.770
I spent all my
life memorizing pi,

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:46.680
but it's 6.283185 and keeps
going on and on and on,

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.640
never repeating just like pi.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.570
It's 2 times pi.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.090
And so you're
saying, hey Sal, pi

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.760
has been around for
millennia, really.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.437
Why mess with such a
fundamental number,

00:11:59.437 --> 00:12:01.270
especially when you
just spent all this time

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.320
showing how profound it is?

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.900
And the argument
that they'd make,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.800
and it seems like a
pretty good argument,

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.880
is that actually things seem
a little bit more elegant when

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.160
you pay attention to this number
instead of half of this number,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.460
when you pay attention to tau.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.920
And to see that, let's revisit
everything that we did here.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.720
Now, all of a sudden, if
you pay attention to 2 pi,

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.850
as opposed to pi.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.630
Or we should call it--
if you pay attention

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.130
to tau instead of tau over 2.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.090
What is this angle
that we did in magenta?

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.490
Well first of all, let's
think about this formula right

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:36.990
over here.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.360
What is the circumference
in terms of the radius?

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.026
Well, now we could
say the circumference

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:43.500
is equal to tau times
the radius because tau

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.096
is the same thing as 2 pi.

00:12:45.096 --> 00:12:47.470
So it makes that formula a
little bit neater, although it

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.240
does make the pi r squared
a little bit messier.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.720
So you could argue
both sides of that.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.850
But it makes the measure of
radians much more intuitive

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.180
because you could say that
this is pi over 2 radians,

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.870
or you could say that this
is pi over 2 radians is

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.810
the same thing as to
tau over 4 radians.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.190
And where did I get that from?

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.760
Remember, if you go all the
way around the circle, that

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.640
is the circumference.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.389
The arc length would
be the circumference.

00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:18.010
It would be tau
radii, or it would

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.991
be to tau radians would be the
angle subtended by that arc

00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:22.490
length.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.980
It would be tau radians.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.109
All the way around
is tau radians.

00:13:26.109 --> 00:13:27.400
So that by itself is intuitive.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.670
One revolution is
one tau radians.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.630
If you go only one
fourth of that,

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.470
it's going to be tau
over four radians.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.260
So the reason why
tau is more intuitive

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.297
here is because it
immediately-- you

00:13:39.297 --> 00:13:40.880
don't have to do
this weird conversion

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.130
where you saying, oh, divide
by 2, multiply by 2, all that.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.152
You're just like, look, however
many radians in terms of tau,

00:13:47.152 --> 00:13:48.860
that's really how many
revolutions you've

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.670
gone around the circle.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.970
And so, if you've gone
one fourth around,

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.420
that's tau over four radians.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.460
If you've gone halfway around,
that'd be tau over two radians.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.580
If you go 3/4 around that'd be
three tau over four radians.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.750
If you go all the way around
that would be tau radians.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.640
If someone tells you that
they have an angle of 10 tau

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.487
radians, you'd go
around exactly 10 times.

00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:14.820
It would be much more intuitive.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.220
You wouldn't have to do this
little mental math, converting,

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.040
saying, do I multiply
or divide by 2

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.040
when I convert to
radians in terms of pi?

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.870
No, when you do it in terms of
tau radians, it's just natural.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.080
One revolution is
one tau radians.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.680
So that makes-- and it makes
a sine function over here.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.214
Instead of writing
pi over 2-- well,

00:14:33.214 --> 00:14:34.630
when you look at
a graph like this

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.220
you're like, where was
this on the unit circle?

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.803
Was this one fourth
around the circle?

00:14:37.803 --> 00:14:38.617
Was this one half?

00:14:38.617 --> 00:14:40.700
And this is actually one
fourth around the circle,

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.557
right over here?

00:14:41.557 --> 00:14:43.640
But now it becomes obvious
if you write it in tau.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.380
Pi over 2 is the same
thing as to tau over 4.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.510
Pi is the same thing
as to tau over 2.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:15:02.300
3 pi over 2 is 3 pi-- oh,
sorry, 3 tau over 4, 3/4 tau.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.200
And then one revolution is tau.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.010
And then immediately, now
when you look at it this way,

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.250
you know exactly where you
are in the unit circle.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.750
You're one fourth
around the unit circle,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.333
you're halfway around
the unit circle,

00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:14.390
you're 3/4 of the way
around the unit circle.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.290
And then you're all the
way around the unit circle.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.030
And so the last thing
that I think the strong pi

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.100
defenders would say
is well, look Sal,

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.330
you just pointed out one of
the most beautiful identities

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.300
or formulas in mathematics.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.670
How does tau hold up to this?

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.380
Well, let's just try it
out and see what happens.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:41.490
So if we take e to the i tau,
that will give us cosine of tau

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.520
plus i sine of tau.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.210
And once again, let's just
think about what this is.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:51.580
Tau radians means we've gone all
the way around the unit circle.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.570
So cosine of tau--
remember, we're

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.290
back at the beginning
of the unit circle

00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:01.200
right over here-- so cosine of
tau is going to be equal to 1.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.115
And then sine of
tau is equal to 0.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:14.430
So e to the i tau is equal to 1.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.230
And I'll leave it
up to you to decide

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:20.970
which one seems to be more
aesthetically profound.
