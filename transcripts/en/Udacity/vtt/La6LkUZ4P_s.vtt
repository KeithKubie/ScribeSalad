00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's how this works as a protocol--we have two participants.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We'll call Alice the generator--that means she is going to make the circuit,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and Bob the evaluator--that means he's going to evaluate the circuit.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
At the beginning of the protocol, they've agreed on some circuit they want to evaluate.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For this to be interesting would be much larger than that.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It takes inputs from both Bob and from Alice.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Alice is going to generate a garble table for each one of these logic gates in the circuit,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and send the garbled circuit to Bob.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
She is also going to send her input values, but because they're

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
random nonces Bob can't tell what they mean.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Bob's going to evaluate the circuit using the garbled circuit protocol

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
decrypting one entry from each of these.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
At the end of this, Bob's going to get some output values.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then they're going to do something to turn that into the semantic value,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
which possibly Bob receives, possibly Alice receives.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We can design the protocol either way.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I am not going to talk about that final step of how you turn the encrypted values

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
at the end of the circuit into meaningful values.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We'll leave that as a question for your exam.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But there is one more question that I do need to talk about.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That's the question of how does Bob obtain his inputs to the circuit.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
To evaluate these tables, Bob needs to have both Alice's inputs and his inputs.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Here are the choices. Bob could generate them himself.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
He could ask Alice to provide his inputs.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
He could ask Alice for both possible values for all these wire labels,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and then select the right one corresponding to his inputs.

00:01:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Or none of these possibilities actually work.
