China doesn't have it so the my first

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760
China doesn't have it so the my first
 

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.590
China doesn't have it so the my first
point about China then is that

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600
point about China then is that
 

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.900
point about China then is that

that is rooted in geography and the
 

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.070
that is rooted in geography and the
second point is that it has designed a

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080
second point is that it has designed a
 

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.909
second point is that it has designed a
strategy to get out of that insecurity

00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919
strategy to get out of that insecurity
 

00:21:53.919 --> 00:21:56.730
strategy to get out of that insecurity
that depends upon interdependence it is

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:56.740
that depends upon interdependence it is
 

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.539
that depends upon interdependence it is

interdependence and that interdependence
is very very deep and constraining for

constraining on all of them and I think
 

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.430
constraining on all of them and I think
the primary point I want to make is not

markets that the Chinese policymakers
 

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.330
markets that the Chinese policymakers
have to deal with and of course they're

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:55.340
have to deal with and of course they're
 

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.250
have to deal with and of course they're
inter interdependent in so many other

inter interdependent in so many other
 

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:02.710
inter interdependent in so many other
ways so I present this to my class about

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720
ways so I present this to my class about
 

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.920
ways so I present this to my class about
these two big facts of Chinese foreign

friedberg debate and that I like to

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:14.450
friedberg debate and that I like to
 

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.800
friedberg debate and that I like to
divide it up into two parts now and the

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:17.810
divide it up into two parts now and the
 

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:21.220
divide it up into two parts now and the
future because you know we all we don't

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:21.230
future because you know we all we don't
 

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.530
future because you know we all we don't
know the future so we have to separate

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:23.540
know the future so we have to separate
 

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.570
know the future so we have to separate
that out and make it a subject of

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:25.580
that out and make it a subject of
 

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.910
that out and make it a subject of
speculation but we all we know is now

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:27.920
speculation but we all we know is now
 

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.840
speculation but we all we know is now
and I think what we can say about now is

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:31.850
and I think what we can say about now is
 

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:35.620
and I think what we can say about now is
that now the Chinese rise of China has

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:35.630

with a mix of benefit and loss but it
 

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.760
with a mix of benefit and loss but it
seems to me that up until today or as of

the Chinese economy can really support
 

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:25.020
the Chinese economy can really support
innovation and all these things so

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:25.030
innovation and all these things so
 

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.089
innovation and all these things so
there's so much questioning about that

00:34:27.089 --> 00:34:27.099
there's so much questioning about that
 

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:29.880
there's so much questioning about that
also so

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:29.890
also so
 

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:33.570
also so
it seems like the Chinese economy may

kind of a political crisis any of those
kinds of scenarios could answer our

kinds of scenarios could answer our
 

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.910
kinds of scenarios could answer our
question about the Chinese threat by

00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:47.920
question about the Chinese threat by
 

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.630
question about the Chinese threat by
setting back this threat slowing the

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:51.640
setting back this threat slowing the
 

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.780
setting back this threat slowing the

the last twenty or so more 30 years
 

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:07.950
the last twenty or so more 30 years
could even produce a different kind of

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960
could even produce a different kind of
 

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.260
could even produce a different kind of
Chinese threat if I'm not saying this is

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:10.270
Chinese threat if I'm not saying this is
 

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.170
Chinese threat if I'm not saying this is
likely but if the Chinese system really

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:13.180
likely but if the Chinese system really
 

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.810
likely but if the Chinese system really
entered a deep crisis and and began to

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:15.820
entered a deep crisis and and began to
 

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.020
entered a deep crisis and and began to
in some way collapse there was a book

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:19.030
in some way collapse there was a book
 

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.540
in some way collapse there was a book
published to about ten years ago called

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:21.550
published to about ten years ago called
 

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:24.390
published to about ten years ago called
the coming collapse of China what the

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400
the coming collapse of China what the
 

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.470
the coming collapse of China what the
collapse of China would look like is

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480
collapse of China would look like is
 

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.000
collapse of China would look like is
there are so many forms that it could

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.010
there are so many forms that it could
 

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.950
there are so many forms that it could
take we don't have time to discuss it

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960
take we don't have time to discuss it
 

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.560
take we don't have time to discuss it
but if it was something like that it

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:34.570
but if it was something like that it
 

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:37.590
but if it was something like that it
would be that would actually be bad for

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:37.600
would be that would actually be bad for
 

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.420
would be that would actually be bad for
the outside world because of the

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:39.430
the outside world because of the
 

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:44.340
the outside world because of the
vastness of this political system so so

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:44.350
vastness of this political system so so
 

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.620
vastness of this political system so so
the idea that China in the future would

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:46.630
the idea that China in the future would
 

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.840
the idea that China in the future would
become a threat partly depends on the

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:48.850
become a threat partly depends on the
 

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.450
become a threat partly depends on the
internal trajectory of China which is

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:51.460
internal trajectory of China which is
 

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.780
internal trajectory of China which is
very questionable and then the second

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:54.790
very questionable and then the second
 

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.520
very questionable and then the second
thing that it depends on i think is

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:56.530
thing that it depends on i think is
 

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:00.410
thing that it depends on i think is
really the the west and and whether we

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420
really the the west and and whether we
 

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:08.220
really the the west and and whether we
collapse or decline and and also upon

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:08.230
collapse or decline and and also upon
 

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.650
collapse or decline and and also upon
the policies that we adopt toward China

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:10.660
the policies that we adopt toward China
 

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:14.550
the policies that we adopt toward China
so I always tell people the best China

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560
so I always tell people the best China
 

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.980
so I always tell people the best China
policy for the United States is a good

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:16.990
policy for the United States is a good
 

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:20.820
policy for the United States is a good
US policy we should fix our problems

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:20.830
US policy we should fix our problems
 

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:23.640
US policy we should fix our problems

I don't see a threat to that either but
 

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:56.320
I don't see a threat to that either but
it's very important and and I think that
