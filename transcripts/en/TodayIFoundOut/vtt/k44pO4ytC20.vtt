00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:09.170
Why Does Coffee Make You Poop

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.700
As any barista beginning their 5am shift will
tell you, a morning cup of coffee is essential

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.520
for a chipper attitude and a healthy psyche!

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.730
The dilemma some have is that right after
you indulge- it hits you.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.430
The #2 train is about to arrive and you don’t
want to be stuck in traffic when it does!

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.439
In fact, coffee’s effect on the colon is
on par with eating around a 1000 calorie meal.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.330
It’s also interesting to note that the reaction
is not volume or temperature dependent.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.140
Women are more susceptible to these effects
than men (53% for women and 19% for men).

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.910
And of those affected, 58% reported the reaction
would only occur if they had not already evacuated

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.490
their bowels, and 52% state the reaction only
occurs in the morning.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.130
So what’s going on here?

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.050
A commonly touted theory is that the caffeine
inside of coffee is the culprit.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.570
After all, caffeine’s effects on your gastrointestinal
tract have been known for quite some time.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.100
More specifically, one theory about the exact
mechanisms that may be causing this concerns

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.390
how caffeine stimulates your central nervous
system- stimulating your sympathetic nervous

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.579
system (your fight or flight nervous system)
with the net result being the constriction

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.270
of your blood vessels.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.670
Normally responsive to low oxygen levels,
a grouping of cells called chemoreceptors

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.259
can get stimulated by this constriction.

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.590
Indirectly, this will have a response affecting
your Vagus nerve.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.899
The Vagus nerve can stimulate part of your
parasympathetic nervous system (your rest-and-digest

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.060
nervous system) which increases the rhythmic
contractions within the colon.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.249
Thus, taking in caffeine may result in an
increase in your gastric motility, known as

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:48.249
peristalsis.

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:53.200
(In layman’s terms, essentially a wavelike
contracting and relaxing of the muscles forcing

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.100
the contents of your digestive system to move
their way through towards your backside.)

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.100
However, the “caffeine causes you to poop
after drinking coffee” idea has since been

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.619
debunked for several reasons.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.209
To begin with, caffeine will usually begin
its stirring effects about 15 minutes after

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.260
ingestion.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.840
Those effects will continue for several hours,
with its half-life at around 5-6 hours on

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840
average.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.569
Why is this important here?

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.040
One study specifically looked at the colon’s
response to coffee by placing an anal probe

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.739
(FOR SCIENCE!!!) in the large intestines of
those who had an increase in peristalsis from

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:27.739
it.

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.599
Coffee’s crappy affects were shown to begin
within 4 minutes after ingestion, and the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.819
increase in peristalsis remained for only
approximately 30 minutes.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.370
These time-frames do not support caffeine
being this particular promoter-of-poop.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.470
The caffeine-cause was further debunked when
it was shown that increased peristalsis did

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.750
not happen with other caffeinated beverages,
but would happen with decaffeinated coffee.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.569
So if it’s not the caffeine, what in the
coffee is causing the urge to defecate in

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:55.830
some people?

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.989
While it hasn’t been definitively proven
yet, the leading theory behind coffee’s

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.129
boost in productivity of your waste management
system is a combination of several hormonal

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.040
and neural mechanisms, some known and likely
some as yet unknown.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.360
The known include a rise in acid production
within your stomach and the release of the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.769
two hormones, Gastrin and Cholecystokinin,
which have something of a laxative effect.

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.459
To begin with, coffee is relatively acidic,
specifically having a pH between 4.5 and 6.

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.580
(And for reference in case you’ve forgotten
your high school chemistry, 7 is neutral.)

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.510
In fact, there have been over 40 types of
acids found in roasted coffee.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.810
These can be broken down into three groups:
aliphatic, alicyclic carboxylic and phenolic,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:39.879
and chlorogenic.

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.860
Importantly, chlorogenic acid will also promote
increased acid production by your stomach,

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.200
elevating the acidic environment.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.780
In healthy people, this acid-bath will aid
in the digestion of proteins and fats.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.239
The stomach responds to the acid production
by moving its contents more quickly into your

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.849
small intestine.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.190
Increased acid levels will also trigger the
release of gastrin and cholecystokinin, which

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.180
provokes the aforementioned peristalsis.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.170
Gastrin is produced when the body senses the
presence of food in the stomach, or your Vagus

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.360
nerve gets stimulated by one of your senses,
like taste or smell, in response to food.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.209
Its release causes several reactions within
the body.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.120
The gastroesophageal sphincter will constrict,
keeping the food in your stomach, not allowing

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.160
it back up into your esophagus.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.669
It increases the motility of your digestive
tract and gall bladder, in preparation for

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.870
foods arrival into the small intestine.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.690
Simultaneously, it will relax the valve between
your small intestine and colon, called your

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.690
ileocecal valve.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.070
This will allow the food already in your small
intestine to move-on to the large intestine.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.970
Finally, it increases peristalsis throughout
the entire digestive system.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.210
The overall result of gastrin is essentially-
out with the old, in with the new!

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.990
Cholecystokinin, while similar in structure
to gastrin, functions differently, causing

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.110
other reactions.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.180
It’s also released in response to food being
introduced to the stomach.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.669
It stimulates your gall bladder to release
bile into the intestines, which helps digest

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.669
fats.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.560
This could be why people who have painful
gallstones often choose to avoid coffee.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.240
It also stimulates pancreatic juices, helping
to break down large food particles into molecules

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.960
that can be absorbed by the body.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.729
Cholecystokinin has also been shown to stimulate
your hypothalamus, signaling the body that

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:19.729
it’s had enough food.

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.910
It’s thought this is one of the mechanisms
giving coffee its appetite suppression effect.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.169
All this said, just because these are probably
the main influences on your coffee induced

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.080
BM, it is still thought that there are probably
other things going on as well.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.139
This is because there are over a thousand
chemical compounds found within coffee, and

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.099
many can affect the gastrointestinal system.

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.830
The digestive tract is also extremely complex
and still not fully understood.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.199
For instance, the morphine-like compounds
found in coffee called exorphins attach to

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.950
opiate receptors located throughout your body.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.979
There are four known types of these- delta,
kappa, mu, and the very boringly-named, Opiod-receptor-like-1

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:58.979
(ORL1).

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:04.490
All of these receptors are known to affect
peristalsis in some way.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.580
However, it should be noted that most tend
to have the opposite effect as coffee- they

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.050
usually cause constipation.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.139
So why is this being considered as a contributor?

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.690
The debate arises because there are so many
different reactions that can take place, depending

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.470
on which specific type of opioid receptor
gets stimulated.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.650
It also matters at what point in the signaling
process of neurons you stimulate the receptor.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.330
As one researcher put it, “The GI motor
effects of opioids are complex because, depending

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.220
on whether interruption of excitatory or inhibitory
neural pathways prevails, muscle relaxation

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.000
or spasm will be observed.”

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.890
When you combine the complex nature of opioids
with the fact there haven’t been many studies

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:49.500
specifically identifying the regulatory properties
of ORL1, you begin to understand the obstacles

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.780
facing researchers.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.610
For instance, it’s known that ORL1 reacts
more quickly than the other opioid receptors,

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.330
seeing results after only 2 minutes of exposure
to an agonist.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.289
This makes it a tempting receptor to look
at given the time-frames associated with your

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.360
distal colon’s reaction to coffee.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.030
In the end (pun intended), given the extremely
complex nature of the human digestive system

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.401
and the multitude of compounds found in coffee,
it will take a significant amount of additional

00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:20.280
research to nail down all the contributing
factors in coffee making some people defecate.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.780
But as I finish my morning cup of Joe, I would
like to thank all those brave individuals

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:29.340
to date who have voluntarily had an anal probe
inserted FOR SCIENCE!!! to give us an idea

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.020
of some of the mechanisms involved here, as
well as safely rule out others we previously

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:52.240
hypothesized might be contributors.
