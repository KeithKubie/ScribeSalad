00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.089
In a July, 2014 survey,
Google asked app developers

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:05.880
around the world to
share their experiences

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.430
about the mobile app
development process.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.810
Nearly a third told us that
the most challenging area was

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.580
growing their
audience, and a quarter

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.960
said monetization
proved to be difficult.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.690
Developers felt that these two
areas had the fewest resources

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.360
and support.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.290
This course will hopefully
help developers solve for this.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.880
Ads are an effective and easy
way to monetize your app.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.440
In fact, ads are
the most common way

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.330
to make money from apps today.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.374
Let's dive in and
review the ecosystem,

00:00:30.374 --> 00:00:32.790
taking a look at the players
in the market and the metrics

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.842
you'll use to
measure your success.

00:00:34.842 --> 00:00:36.550
The three players in
the advertising game

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.600
are users, advertisers,
and publishers.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.650
Users are basically
you and me, the people

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.707
who use apps every day.

00:00:44.707 --> 00:00:47.040
Advertisers want to reach
users, promoting their product

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.340
or brand.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.780
Publishers offer
advertisers their inventory,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.920
space for ads within
their apps, allowing

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.070
them to connect with
the right users.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.830
Ideally, an advertising
network strives

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.955
to balance the needs of
each of these three players

00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:00.830
for a win-win-win.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.940
Now, let's explore each
player's role a bit

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.379
further, starting with the user.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.310
As we say in Google, focus on
users and the rest will follow.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.090
Users are a key component
of the mobile app ecosystem.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.770
They're the ones
engaging with apps

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.490
and are really the center
of this whole app universe.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.450
As a mobile app
developer, you constantly

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.540
want to grow, connecting
with more users who

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.040
are likely to enjoy your app.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.810
Advertising is a great way
for you to do just that.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.520
You have many channels available
to reach your ideal audience

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.480
and acquire new
users with Google,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.020
including Search, Display,
YouTube and Google Play.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.770
Before diving into
placing ads, you

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.505
want to identify your goals.

00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:39.529
Do you want to focus on
increasing downloads?

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:41.320
Well, then get more
people around the world

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.445
to download your app
using app installs.

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:47.130
Do you want to focus on
re-engaging or existing users?

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.580
Look at deeplinking to specific
screens within your mobile app.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.740
Do you want to get noticed
by a mobile audience?

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.560
You can show ads
for your website

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.890
exclusively in mobile apps.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.960
No matter what your
goals with advertising,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.760
it's important to reach a large
audience on a global scale,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.040
showing ads that are
relevant to the user.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.900
They'll be happy, and your
revenue will show for it.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.650
Let's look at the
advertiser's perspective.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.270
Advertisers want to place
their ads in high quality

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.192
applications and reach
the right audience.

00:02:15.192 --> 00:02:16.650
The increasing
amount of time users

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.700
spend in apps provides
a valuable opportunity

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.170
for advertisers.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.330
A window of engaged time
to reach out and promote

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.640
their offerings.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.430
But to be successful,
advertisers

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.020
must put the needs of
the mobile user first.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.290
At Google, we believe
at the best ad unit

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.370
is the one that gets
the interest of the user

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.750
while providing a
positive experience.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.800
We invest a lot of resources to
offer a smart ads platform that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.440
can target users at the right
place at the right moment

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.230
with the right message.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.142
This gives advertisers
the best opportunity

00:02:45.142 --> 00:02:46.850
to present their
message in a way that is

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.990
going to resonate with users.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.040
So just how does an advertiser
gauge success on mobile?

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.700
Here are some metrics that
are typically important.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.930
Cost per install, or CPI.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.420
This is a fixed bid or rate
paid when an app is installed.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.900
In other words, what it
costs to acquire a new user.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.340
Value of impressions.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.920
Impressions are the units
used to display an ad.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.030
These vary in value depending
on the ad format and network.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.070
For example, a text ad will
have less impact or value

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.530
than an interactive banner
ad or homepage takeover.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.550
Click through rate, or CTR.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.150
This is the ratio
of clicks on an ad

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.000
to its number of impressions.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.854
The idea behind CTR is that
the more relevant an ad is,

00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:27.020
the more clicks it will get.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.820
So successful ads generally
have a higher CTR.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.030
To calculate CTR, take
the number of clicks

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.290
that an ad receives divided
by the number of times

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.470
the ad is shown.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.630
For example, if you had 5
clicks and 1,000 impressions,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.070
then your CTR would be 0.5%.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.380
Cost per click, or CPC.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.450
This is the amount paid for
a single click on an ad.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.680
Most advertisers use this
as their pricing model

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.260
since they are only charged
when a user clicks on their ad,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.110
rather than paying
simply to show their ad.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.720
Cost per 1,000 impressions.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.480
Referred to as CPM.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.650
This is the cost incurred for
showing an ad 1,000 times.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.130
CPM is typically used
for building awareness,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.890
which is achieved by
simply showing the ad.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.770
Keeping in mind the user and
the advertiser perspectives,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.550
let's move on to
the publisher side.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.386
First things first, what
exactly is a publisher?

00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:16.760
A publisher is
simply a developer

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.843
who has a mobile app that
they want to monetizing.

00:04:18.843 --> 00:04:21.079
In this instance, this is you.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.570
As a publisher, you'll
monetize by selling ad space

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.595
within your app to advertisers.

00:04:25.595 --> 00:04:27.220
Advertisers pay for
this valuable space

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.011
so they can show ads
to users while they're

00:04:29.011 --> 00:04:30.680
engaging with your app.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.820
To maximize earnings,
it's important for you,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.570
as a publisher, to
continually grow your audience

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.810
and keep users
engaged with your app.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.130
This makes your ad space
more valuable to advertisers.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.100
Here are some additional terms
that you should be aware of.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.250
Ad request.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.600
An ad request is counted
whenever your site requests

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.140
an ad to be displayed.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.202
Fill rate.

00:04:50.202 --> 00:04:51.910
This is the number of
impressions divided

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.395
by the number of ad requests.

00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:55.270
The goal is to have a
high fill rate, meaning

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.000
that your app is
showing a lot of ads,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.330
providing you with more revenue.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.640
eCPM.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.620
eCPM refers to the
estimated income

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.610
you'll see by showing 1,000
impressions in your app.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.030
This estimation is based on
the historical performance

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.080
and is proven with RPM, the
actual amount of revenue

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.700
earned per 1,000 impressions.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.610
Average ad revenue per user.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.190
This is the revenue
earned from ads

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.900
divided by the total number of
users who were served the ads.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.560
In other words, it's
the average value

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.890
of each user to
your bottom line.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.244
While there are many mobile
ad networks out there today,

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.160
you should look carefully
at their fill rates,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.620
eCPMs, latency, like how
quickly the ad loads,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.730
and the quality of
the ads they show.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.172
With ads being the most common
form of app monetization,

00:05:37.172 --> 00:05:38.880
it makes sense that
the space is thriving

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.880
from all points of view--
the users, the advertisers,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.874
and you, the publisher.

00:05:43.874 --> 00:05:45.790
Ad serving networks
provide a variety of tools

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.220
to keep the app ecosystem
booming, giving users

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.310
positive, relevant
experiences, advertisers

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.820
the means to promote their
offerings, and developers a way

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.640
to earn money on their app.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.560
Thanks for watching.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.643
