Kenny:<i> I think there's been a
 big trend in expeditions</i>

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.138
<i>that are geared towards science</i>

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.341
<i> that's also geared
 towards conservation.</i>

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.844
<i> I can rationalize, you
 know, why I take risks</i>

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.313
<i> for scientific reasons,
for conservation reasons.</i>

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:15.615
<i>But, I would be lying to you.</i>

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.818
<i> It's just amazing to
 get into these places.</i>

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.722 line:0%
( audience applause )

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.457 line:0%
I regularly get asked
for some of these trips

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:27.426
"Why do you keep going on
these sorts of expeditions?

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:28.695
Why do you keep going on them?"

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.997
And it's clichÃ©, but this
is why we go on them.

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.133
<i>We go to these amazing places</i>

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.769
<i> from a aesthetic and
 cultural standpoint.</i>

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.004
<i> And I got to go all
 around the world</i>

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.973
<i> I used to work as--
 in commercial diving.</i>

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.742
<i>So I was sent to remote areas,
which is sort of my specialty.</i>

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:45.278
It's just, you realize
that we're living

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:48.581
in a different kind of world and
you're just drawn in to them.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.983
And then... all of a sudden,
you're jerked out of that world

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:53.986 line:0%
and you end up, you know,
like this.

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:54.854
( audience laughter )

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.590
And the irony of this
particular accident

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.692
<i> which is, I had
 been diving all day</i>

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.493
in one of the deepest
known caves in the world.

00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:03.596
Six hundred and sixty three
feet deep and we were doing...

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.498
what objectively,
is pretty risky diving.

00:01:06.498 --> 00:01:09.869
And after three days of working
in this hole in the Bahamas

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.071
I climbed up on the roof
of a three story building

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:14.273
to take a picture of a rare
tree that was blooming

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:15.408
and I fell off the roof.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.477
( audience laughter )

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:21.080
So, you know,
our objective versus subjective

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.118
risk assessment is not,
you know, not so great.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:27.320
In the beginning,
I was motivated by adventure.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.023
I wasn't motivated by these
more rational excuses

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:32.058
and I was never kind of

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.260
analytically motivated
as a child.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.163
<i>You can see, I think that's
my high school report card.</i>

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:41.100
Yeah, so my analytical
skills were, you know

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.237
somewhat under-developed,
to put it nicely.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:48.508
-( audience laughter )
-( Kenny laughs )

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:51.878
Alright. There's some
kids in the audience...

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:54.413
Hey, come talk to me after.

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:57.250
But, I was motivated
by other things.

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:00.453
( audience laughter )

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:03.722
Actually, that's... the
real cover from 2015 issue

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:05.391
<i> that I just found
 out before the show</i>

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.327
<i> that was one of the top
selling off the shelf covers.</i>

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.396
My only explanation is
that I think the stoners

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.264
must have kept buying
it over and over.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:13.299
( audience laughter )

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.101
They didn't remember
that they bought it.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:19.772
But, anyway.
But, I was very much motivated

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.974
<i>by the ocean and surfing and...</i>

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:24.677
<i>I actually tried to get into
the Navy and the Coast Guard.</i>

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.714
And I kept doing the
psychological test and it said

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:30.016
"Unfit for vertical
chain of command."

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:30.850
( audience laughter )

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.718
It's like, kinda
stuck in my head.

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:35.488
But, I did end up going
to school in California

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:39.892
on and off at UC Santa Barbara,
mostly motivated by the surfing.

00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:43.296
<i>But, I was really into the ocean
and anything to with adventure.</i>

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.364
<i> I ended up getting jobs
 in the film industry</i>

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:48.034
doing stunts and
coordinating stunts and...

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.935
And that, you know,
I found out, oh wow!

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:52.338
You can make a
living off of adventure.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.807
<i>But it was, once I started
 getting into the diving</i>

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:58.077
<i>that's what opened up really,
the world of science to me.</i>

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:01.947
<i>You go into this insignificant,
 tiny little muddy hole</i>

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:03.415
<i>and you realize, beneath my feet</i>

00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:06.085
<i>is this whole other world
 that's unexplored.</i>

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.520
And, my realization of this

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.490
and the increase in some
of my diving skills

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.392
coincided with me
meeting Wes Skiles.

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:17.029
<i> And he really guided me,
 as a mentor</i>

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.198
<i> as a friend,
 when I was 19 years old</i>

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:23.402
into what the world of
professional diving was like.

00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:27.240
And he was the photographer
on our expedition

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.874
<i> to The Blue Holes
 of the Bahamas.</i>

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:31.944
<i> That was a cover story
 in August of 2010.</i>

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:33.279
<i>And that's a shot, you can see</i>

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.715
<i> there's four divers in
 that picture, actually.</i>

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:41.420
And Wes, in this tragic irony,
he died just a few days

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.290
before the magazine with
his cover shot came out.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.728
And... it was devastating
to all of us, but it's--

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.263
To me, being up here
is very much also

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:53.766
telling my friend's stories.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.802
And it's not just Wes,
who've passed away

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:59.371
in expedition
related activities.

00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:00.840
It hits close to home as well.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.075
This was from one of my...

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.242
I have a little boy,
his name's Lincoln

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.410
and this was in kindergarten.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.611
That is not his handwriting.

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:07.313
<i>It's like a free association,
 I guess.</i>

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:10.782
<i>So, when he came up with sad, it
kind of rubs your nose in it.</i>

00:04:10.782 --> 00:04:12.317
<i>You know, it hits home and...</i>

00:04:12.317 --> 00:04:14.420
It's this battle in my own brain

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.688
of what's worth it
and what's not.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.556
And every once in a while
it just gets too much and

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:20.926
at some point, 20 years ago,
I went back to school

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:24.564
because I felt like,
okay I need something

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:25.831
a more substantial career.

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:27.166
I'm very interested
in the science

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:33.005
this mix of ecology along with,
with human behavior.

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:35.408
And that's how I ended up in
Environmental Anthropology.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.111
And I was only in school for
less that two semesters

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.711
when I get this
letter in the mail

00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:41.914
from some of you may
know Doctor Bill Stone

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:44.450
he's an explorer
and an innovator

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.118
<i> inviting me to join the</i>

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:48.020
<i>United States deep caving team.</i>

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.889
<i>And this is where we went.</i>

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.025
<i>So, it was in Southern Mexico,
 in Oaxaca</i>

00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:54.960
<i> in what's called the
 Huautla plateau.</i>

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.962
And we all drove
there independently

00:04:56.962 --> 00:05:00.600
and we were set to meet at a
certain date, it was pre-GPS.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.369
So, actually, that's the
map that we were given

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:04.804
saying where to go.
( laughing )

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:05.971
You know, "Don't be late!"

00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:07.173
( audience laughter )

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.340
"Bring your money."

00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:11.444
But, you know, we're driving
through the lowland jungle

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:13.579
and you come around the corner
and this is what you see.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.849
<i> This massively uplifted
 limestone plateau</i>

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.784
<i> and the cave entrance
 we were gonna work on</i>

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:20.787
<i>was at the top of this plateau.</i>

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:23.656
<i> And that's the view
 from the cave entrance.</i>

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:26.091
<i> And the mouth of the
 cave is quite small</i>

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:28.527
<i> but it creates a
 giant micro-climate</i>

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:30.162
<i> because of different
temperatures and pressures.</i>

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.965
<i> This is the entrance,
 so you drop down...</i>

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.366
<i>I think, you can see the person.</i>

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:37.036
<i>And so here's the cave system.</i>

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:40.273
<i> So, you have the jungle
 drop I just mentioned.</i>

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.474
<i>You start doing day trips</i>

00:05:42.474 --> 00:05:44.310
<i> where you're dropping
 all the equipment.</i>

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.214
<i>You're dragging everything by
rope, it's a very vertical cave.</i>

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:50.349
<i> And when you have enough
 equipment at the depot</i>

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.118
<i>you stop making day trips and
you start living underground.</i>

00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:55.588
<i> So, Camp Three was
 our main base camp</i>

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:58.424
<i> Camp Five was where we
 would start the diving.</i>

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:01.394
But, you can send only two
people at a time to Camp Five

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:02.962
because the area
was really small

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:04.697
and you're hanging
over the water.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:07.466
So, most of the activity
was at Camp Three.

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:09.502
<i> And you're going
 down and down and...</i>

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:11.737
<i> Some of these drops are
 a few hundred meters.</i>

00:06:11.737 --> 00:06:13.940
<i> Really, you're
 confined to the dark</i>

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.375
<i>and you're stuck with people,
some of whom, you really love</i>

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.210
<i> and some of whom...
 well, you know.</i>

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.246
<i>And then, from there you really</i>

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:22.814
<i> keep going down
 and keep going down</i>

00:06:22.814 --> 00:06:24.851
<i>and you go through these canyons</i>

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:27.919
<i> that are just amazing
with crystal clear water.</i>

00:06:28.453 --> 00:06:30.723
<i> You get to roaring
 waterfalls and</i>

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.692
<i> you can't even hear
 yourself think.</i>

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:36.629
And in fact, Camp Five was at
one of these roaring waterfalls.

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.332
And so, we used to wear
balaclavas and earplugs.

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:42.601
<i>And I ended up down at Camp Five</i>

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:45.004
<i>with my very good friend,
 Ian Rolland.</i>

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:47.706
And he... he and I were kind
of the team pranksters.

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:49.341
So, Ian and I really teamed up.

00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:53.278
We were the two youngest and
we really got along very well.

00:06:53.278 --> 00:06:55.381
So, when we were down there,
it was our turn

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:59.217
we were lower on the totem
pole to get a chance to dive

00:06:59.217 --> 00:07:02.821
and the other team... the other
team members hadn't had luck

00:07:02.821 --> 00:07:06.793
at cracking the sump, cracking
this underwater passageway

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:09.495
full of some tight
restrictions and you can't see

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:14.833
more than about... really about
what's in front of your hand.

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:19.238
And so, I got to dive
first and I went on.

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.773
This is... this gives you a
good sense of the machine.

00:07:21.773 --> 00:07:23.475
<i>It's two redundant rebreathers</i>

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:24.510
<i> that you're wearing
 on your back.</i>

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.346
<i>There's about ten valves that
you're constantly changing.</i>

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:28.414
<i> There's two computers</i>

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:30.715
<i> that you're constantly
 monitoring and changing.</i>

00:07:30.715 --> 00:07:32.218
So, it's a--
it was a complex

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:34.554
very experimental
system at the time.

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:36.989
And then, you're also
doing all the cave diving

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.925
which is running a
constant guideline

00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:42.395
tons of other caving
related equipment.

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:45.397
So, Ian and I were down
there and it was really...

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:48.334
probably, that time was the most
fun I'd ever had in my life.

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:49.902
Everything was going
like clockwork

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:52.671
we'd been working together
for two or three months

00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:54.573
we traded jokes,
we didn't even have to

00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:56.174
finish each other's sentences.

00:07:56.174 --> 00:07:57.809
I mean,
we were quite close.

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:01.747
And I made it pretty
far on the first dive

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:04.684
I got through what had,
apparently been stopping people.

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:07.520
And... made it far,
came back excited.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.854
We fixed up the rebreather

00:08:08.854 --> 00:08:10.556
because we were sharing
one rebreather

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:12.391
and then Ian took off.

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:15.561
And... he made it a little
bit further and he said

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:17.730
"I think it might
be sloping up."

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.298
And then came back
and then I went

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:21.467
and I actually made it all
the way through the sump

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:26.705
and came up into a big air
bell with a big giant sandbar.

00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:30.643
And I... literally, felt like
I was on another planet.

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:33.012
It had this
otherworldly feeling,

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:34.780
this otherworldly silence.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.183
And I was so excited and Ian was
a better dry caver than me.

00:08:38.183 --> 00:08:39.885
So, I wanted to get back, it was

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:42.588
little less than half
a mile swim back.

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:46.792
So, I made it back to Camp Five
and... "This is it. We did it."

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:50.129
And Ian took off on
the next dive and...

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:52.197
he took off,
I remember he had his helmet

00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:54.100
and he had his kid's
teddy bear...

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:57.903
taped onto his helmet or tie
wrapped onto his helmet.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.207
And, you know, we had it said,
if he's not back in six hours...

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.211
literally, the words were
"call the cavalry".

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.446
And two hours go by

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.948
I was expecting him at
about three or four hours.

00:09:09.948 --> 00:09:13.319
Five hours, six hours and...
no Ian.

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:19.691
So I... I left the hot pot of
tea, a light, a pulley system

00:09:19.691 --> 00:09:21.594
so you could get yourself
out of the water

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:24.429
and I headed back a few
hours up to Camp Three.

00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:27.133
I got there at about one in the
morning and woke everyone up

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:29.168
and said,
"We have to go on a rescue."

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:31.537
Ian was probably the...
one of the most experienced

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:35.207
with this machine and...
But, he also was a diabetic.

00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:37.409
So, there was a
question in my mind

00:09:37.409 --> 00:09:39.979
was he having some kind
of diabetic incident.

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:43.482
And... I got into quite
a fight with the team.

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:47.786
But, to make a very,
very long horrific story, short

00:09:47.786 --> 00:09:52.124
I ended up going back down,
making the dive

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:55.094
and found Ian on the other
side of the sandbar

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:57.930
back in the water where he
had started diving again

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.699
with a cave diving reel
with a line in his hand.

00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:02.033
And I found him at the bottom

00:10:02.033 --> 00:10:05.571
with just the reel right out
of his hand, very peacefully.

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:09.775
So, it was... you know,
all of a sudden to go

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.977
from the highest high
to the lowest low

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:14.146
you can imagine...
in about the lowest point

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:17.916
you can ever imagine literally,
was devastating.

00:10:17.916 --> 00:10:19.584
You have to block
that out of your mind

00:10:19.584 --> 00:10:22.654
and I made my way
back to Camp Five

00:10:22.654 --> 00:10:24.456
where Bill was waiting for me.

00:10:24.456 --> 00:10:28.694
And... it took six days to get
Ian back out to the surface.

00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:33.499
And it ended up, I was, ended up
being underground for 21 days.

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:37.303
And that's what it looks like,
after 21 days underground.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.506
<i>But, when we came out and
we came out with Ian's body</i>

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:44.009
<i> the Mazatec village...
and I'll never forget this</i>

00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:46.078
<i>and I'm still forever grateful.</i>

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:50.115
<i> They had carved out
 steps in the cornfields</i>

00:10:50.115 --> 00:10:52.818
<i>and the whole village came
in and accompanied us out.</i>

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:56.221
<i>And we went right into the
 local, small cathedral.</i>

00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:58.223
<i> Where we--
it was really a combination</i>

00:10:58.223 --> 00:11:01.527
<i>of an indigenous religion
 along with catholicism.</i>

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:05.131
And had an extremely moving
ceremony, right there.

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:08.834
And... it was...

00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:12.671
I don't have to tell you how
it was. You get the idea.

00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:15.407
But, for me I was,
I don't even know

00:11:15.407 --> 00:11:17.909
I hadn't slept for days and days

00:11:17.909 --> 00:11:20.979
and ended up the National
Geographic film team

00:11:20.979 --> 00:11:22.848
with my friend Wes,
had just gotten down there

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:24.483
a couple days before

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:28.086
<i> and somehow, we decided
 to go back into the cave</i>

00:11:28.086 --> 00:11:31.556
<i>for a few days and just kind of
try to get a grip on things.</i>

00:11:31.556 --> 00:11:33.758
<i>We got caught in a flash flood</i>

00:11:33.758 --> 00:11:35.427
and ended up getting
trapped for four days.

00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:37.730
It ripped all of
our rigging out.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.700
We ended up having to ration
food and lighting stuff.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.635
By the way, if you ever
are short on things

00:11:43.635 --> 00:11:45.771
and have to ration, don't
tell anyone you're rationing.

00:11:46.338 --> 00:11:48.874
They just... it creates
instant hoarders.

00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:50.676
( audience laughter )

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:53.044
But, we got out of there
and at the end of that

00:11:53.044 --> 00:11:56.548
I was really... I was done
and I left the expedition.

00:11:56.548 --> 00:11:58.950
And Bill was very
gracious in that.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.687
In fact,
most of the expedition was gone.

00:12:02.687 --> 00:12:04.723
But, Bill and Barbara am Ende

00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:06.691
who was one of the leaders
on the expedition.

00:12:06.691 --> 00:12:08.693
She and Bill decided to go on

00:12:08.693 --> 00:12:10.562
and they did what
was in my opinion

00:12:10.562 --> 00:12:14.800
one of the most audacious
exploration feats.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.403
So, Ian and I had stopped
at that deepest point.

00:12:18.403 --> 00:12:21.974
<i>They went by themselves, all
the way to that furthest point</i>

00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:24.276
<i> which at the time, was
 the deepest point known.</i>

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:27.179
And there was no chance of
anyone ever rescuing them.

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:29.815
That's them at the deepest
point, right there.

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:33.985
<i>And this was in the 1995 issue
 of National Geographic.</i>

00:12:33.985 --> 00:12:36.655
<i> And here's a picture
 of my friend, Ian.</i>

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:39.992
<i>And... you know, I kept in touch
with his family over the years.</i>

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:41.326
And his wife remarried

00:12:41.326 --> 00:12:43.128
someone from the same
mountain rescue team.

00:12:43.128 --> 00:12:46.265
But, this is his two year old,
Connor, now.

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:50.002
<i>Who's become a British caver, a
very well known British caver.</i>

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:53.305
<i> And we hadn't met for...
 he's now 24 years old</i>

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:56.207
<i> and he came to Florida,
 two weeks ago.</i>

00:12:56.207 --> 00:12:58.143
<i>So, we spent ten days together</i>

00:12:58.143 --> 00:13:00.045
<i>traveling around Florida,
 diving together.</i>

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:02.781
So, I mean, as hard as it is
for me to tell this story

00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:06.251
it's... kind of in a strange
way it's come full circle.

00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:08.854
And it was--
we had a really great,

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.389
great time together.
