00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:01.468
- [Teacher] I'm now
going to give an overview

00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:04.514
on the beginnings of Islam.

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:07.192
And regardless of whether you are a part

00:00:07.192 --> 00:00:11.619
of an Islamic culture, you
are a practicing Muslim,

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.649
or you believe in the Islamic traditions,

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:16.971
it's valuable to learn about
the beginnings of Islam

00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:20.984
because, today, nearly one-fourth
of the world's population

00:00:20.984 --> 00:00:22.939
either is a practicing Muslim

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.272
or has grown up in an Islamic tradition.

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:30.671
Now, the beginnings of
Islam really are centered

00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:33.046
on the life and the revelations

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:36.429
of the Muslim prophet, Muhammad.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.471
Now, the term, Islam, means surrender

00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:42.401
and, as we'll see, a lot of
the revelations of Muhammad

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.784
are about surrendering to God,

00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:48.852
about the oneness of God,
about not worshiping idols.

00:00:48.852 --> 00:00:52.314
And to put Muhammad in
perspective, on a timeline,

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:55.621
I have other significant
biblical figures, here,

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:57.583
and these are important
not just to get a reference

00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:00.857
towards Christianity and Judaism,

00:01:00.857 --> 00:01:03.179
but because, according
to Islamic tradition,

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.789
Islam is built on top of the teachings

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.956
of Abraham, or the teachings
of Moses and the Torah,

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.477
and the teachings of Jesus.

00:01:13.477 --> 00:01:16.658
Muslims believe that the
Quran is the Final Testament,

00:01:16.658 --> 00:01:17.658
so to speak.

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:20.641
To get some context,

00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:24.344
Muhammad was born is 6th Century Arabia,

00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:27.212
and 6th Century Arabia
was an interesting place.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:28.802
In many other videos, we've talked

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:31.461
about various empires
around the Mediterranean,

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:34.294
around the Mesopotamia and Persia.

00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:37.997
And even on this map,
in the time of Muhammad,

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.065
you see significant empires,

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.691
the Byzantine Empire,
the Eastern Roman Empire.

00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:43.619
You have Sasanid Persia.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.144
But Arabia was never really consolidated,

00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:50.515
or ruled, by a formal, or most of Arabia,

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:54.017
by a formal government or a formal empire.

00:01:54.017 --> 00:01:56.842
The rule of law in most of Arabia,

00:01:56.842 --> 00:01:59.582
and the world in which
Muhammad was born into,

00:01:59.582 --> 00:02:03.960
was a tribal world
where you were protected

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.897
by your tribe and it was really the laws

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:11.108
of vendetta and revenge that
kept certain things in check,

00:02:11.108 --> 00:02:15.275
but also would lead to a lot
of wars and a lot of violence.

00:02:16.138 --> 00:02:18.425
And within Arabia, there were many folks

00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:21.583
who are Bedouins, who were nomadic people,

00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:23.383
who traveled through the desert

00:02:23.383 --> 00:02:28.003
allowing their livestock to
graze on whatever suitable land

00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:30.209
they found, but you
also had settled people

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.800
in places like Mecca.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.437
You had people who'd settled
and started agriculture

00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:35.863
around oases.

00:02:35.863 --> 00:02:39.555
Remember, most of the Arabian
Peninsula is really desert.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:42.645
And, Muhammad was born into a fairly,

00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:45.685
or a very prominent family in Mecca.

00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:48.100
He was born to the Quraysh tribe,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.396
and the Quraysh tribe was
essentially in control of Mecca,

00:02:52.396 --> 00:02:55.779
and Mecca was a very
powerful city to control

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.780
because it was a religious
center for the region.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.715
This is the Kaaba, which exists today,

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:06.292
and is the center of Islamic worship.

00:03:06.292 --> 00:03:09.351
And, at the time, it
housed hundreds of idols

00:03:09.351 --> 00:03:12.537
which were important to the
various tribes and people

00:03:12.537 --> 00:03:14.507
of Arabia at the time.

00:03:14.507 --> 00:03:16.632
And so, you can imagine
as they did the pilgrimage

00:03:16.632 --> 00:03:19.372
towards Mecca to worship their idols,

00:03:19.372 --> 00:03:24.248
it also benefited the economy
of Mecca in a significant way.

00:03:24.248 --> 00:03:26.616
And not only was Muhammad
born into this powerful tribe,

00:03:26.616 --> 00:03:28.857
he was born into one of
the most powerful clans

00:03:28.857 --> 00:03:29.960
within that tribe,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.849
and within one of the most
powerful houses within that clan.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.543
But even though he was born
into this very powerful family,

00:03:36.543 --> 00:03:41.280
clan, and tribe, his early
life was quite difficult.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.123
His father died right before he was born.

00:03:45.123 --> 00:03:48.675
His mother dies at the
age of six years old,

00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:51.050
and, then, his grandfather,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.294
who then takes custody of him,

00:03:54.294 --> 00:03:58.461
and by most accounts, he
doesn't get a lot of privileges.

00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:00.784
When you're a member of a tribe,

00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:02.665
you're essentially orphaned.

00:04:02.665 --> 00:04:05.880
The tribe is doing, essentially,
just the base necessities

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.380
to keep you alive.

00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:11.117
But then his grandfather dies
when he is eight years old,

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:13.439
and he becomes, he goes under the custody

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.982
of his uncle, Abu Talib.

00:04:15.982 --> 00:04:20.394
Now, as he grows older,
he does learn a skill.

00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:22.925
He essentially becomes a merchant.

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:26.524
He goes on trading journeys
with his uncle, Abu Talib,

00:04:26.524 --> 00:04:28.904
to places like Syria.

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:32.619
And, as he does that,
according to Islamic tradition,

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:35.440
he gets a very favorable reputation.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.620
He gets these titles like,
Al-Amin, the trustworthy one,

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.282
or Al-Sadiq, the truthful.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:46.354
Now, he continues doing
that until the age of 25.

00:04:46.354 --> 00:04:49.581
At 25 years old, something
very interesting happens.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:54.133
A very wealthy widow, arguably
one of the wealthiest people

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:58.242
in all of Mecca, who runs
a vast trading enterprise,

00:04:58.242 --> 00:05:00.204
Khadija, who is 40 years old,

00:05:00.204 --> 00:05:02.410
she employs Muhammad and, apparently,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.860
is so impressed by his honesty,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.610
by his ability to be trustworthy,

00:05:09.454 --> 00:05:11.823
that she propose to him,

00:05:11.823 --> 00:05:13.946
and, remember, she's 40.

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:16.885
This would be her third
marriage, and he is 25,

00:05:16.885 --> 00:05:19.659
and he accepts the proposal.

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.562
Now, this is significant because
as we'll see in this video

00:05:22.562 --> 00:05:26.486
and the next, Khadija is the
first one to follow Muhammad,

00:05:26.486 --> 00:05:29.586
or believe in Muhammad's revelations.

00:05:29.586 --> 00:05:33.429
So, he continues to work with his wife,

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:36.215
arguably work for his wife,

00:05:36.215 --> 00:05:40.357
and, then, in 610, he's now 40 years old,

00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:42.274
he is praying in a cave

00:05:43.465 --> 00:05:45.956
on the outskirts of Mecca,

00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:48.243
and while he's praying, he is purported

00:05:48.243 --> 00:05:51.250
to get his first revelation from God,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.909
according to Islamic traditions.

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.076
And that first revelation,

00:05:57.237 --> 00:06:00.399
and this is the mountain where
it is purported to happen,

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:02.489
the Mountain of Light, Jabal an-Nour.

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:04.532
This is the cave, Cave Hira.

00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:07.968
The first revelation is,
"Proclaim, in the name of thy Lord

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:10.139
"and Cherisher, Who created man,

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.589
"out of a clot of congealed blood.

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.155
"Proclaim, and thy Lord is most bountiful,

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:16.664
"who taught by the pen,

00:06:16.664 --> 00:06:20.426
"taught man that which he knew not."

00:06:20.426 --> 00:06:23.886
And so Muhammad, according
to Islamic accounts,

00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:26.790
he's kind of very concerned by this.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.866
He does not view himself as a preacher.

00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:31.363
He does not view himself as someone

00:06:31.363 --> 00:06:34.924
who should be a prophet,
and he goes to Khadija,

00:06:34.924 --> 00:06:37.500
and he's worried, and Khadija takes him

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.186
to her Christian cousin,
who reassures Muhammad,

00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:43.460
who tells Muhammad that he
believes that he is a prophet

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.502
in the tradition of Abraham and Moses.

00:06:46.502 --> 00:06:48.963
And so, that, to some degree,

00:06:48.963 --> 00:06:50.716
makes Muhammad feel a little bit better,

00:06:50.716 --> 00:06:53.294
and he doesn't have some
revelations for awhile,

00:06:53.294 --> 00:06:54.861
and he becomes concerned.

00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:56.370
But then, he eventually starts

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.530
to have many, many revelations,

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.608
but he keeps it to himself, at first.

00:07:00.608 --> 00:07:02.617
But, roughly three years later, he starts

00:07:02.617 --> 00:07:05.275
to publicly preach these revelations.

00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:07.319
So, these revelations which really talk

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.002
about the oneness of God.

00:07:10.002 --> 00:07:11.986
There's no God but God.

00:07:11.986 --> 00:07:15.132
It's very appealing especially to some

00:07:15.132 --> 00:07:17.582
of the economically lower strata,

00:07:17.582 --> 00:07:18.882
but you could also imagine,

00:07:18.882 --> 00:07:23.049
it's very, very threatening
to the establishment of Mecca.

00:07:24.118 --> 00:07:27.195
You have to remember, the
establishment of Mecca,

00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:31.028
it revolves around the
worship of these idols,

00:07:32.025 --> 00:07:34.927
and now you have this
guy of the Quraysh tribe,

00:07:34.927 --> 00:07:37.737
the tribe that worships Hubal,

00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:39.550
the tribe that is in charge of Mecca,

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.638
that benefits from all these people

00:07:41.638 --> 00:07:43.240
worshiping these various idols.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.864
He's know saying that,
"Idol worship is a sin."

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:48.151
He's saying that there's not God but God,

00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:51.239
that all of these idols are false idols.

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:54.258
And so, the Quraysh tribe,
Muhammad's own tribe,

00:07:54.258 --> 00:07:57.985
begins to significantly
persecute the early Muslims.

00:07:57.985 --> 00:08:01.386
So much so, that many of
the early Muslims have

00:08:01.386 --> 00:08:05.682
to migrate from Mecca
to the Kingdom of Axum,

00:08:05.682 --> 00:08:07.075
which was ruled by a Christian king,

00:08:07.075 --> 00:08:10.523
who protects them the Quraysh tribe.

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:14.656
This is now modern-day
Ethopia, or Eritrea.

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:18.823
And so, things are not going
well for these early Muslims.

00:08:21.177 --> 00:08:23.116
They're being targeted
by the Quraysh tribe.

00:08:23.116 --> 00:08:24.107
They're being killed.

00:08:24.107 --> 00:08:25.468
They're being tortured.

00:08:25.468 --> 00:08:27.964
And then, things get
even worse for Muhammad.

00:08:27.964 --> 00:08:32.469
In 619, you have the death
of his wife, Khadija.

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:35.487
And, just to get a sense
of how powerful Khadija was

00:08:35.487 --> 00:08:39.841
to Muhammad, we have
this quote that we get

00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:42.999
from the Hadith, which are
accounts of Muhammad's life

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:45.332
and sayings, and it tell us,

00:08:46.729 --> 00:08:49.456
"God Almighty never
granted me anyone better

00:08:49.456 --> 00:08:50.905
"in this life than her.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.320
"She accepted me when people rejected me,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.816
"she believed in me
when people doubted me,

00:08:55.816 --> 00:08:58.905
"she shared her wealth with
me when people deprived me,

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:01.946
"and God granted me
children only through her."

00:09:01.946 --> 00:09:06.277
This is, once again,
according to the sayings

00:09:06.277 --> 00:09:08.195
or the life of Muhammad

00:09:08.195 --> 00:09:12.109
as accounted for by one of the Hadith.

00:09:12.109 --> 00:09:13.553
And not only did his wife,

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.018
who up to that time was his only wife,

00:09:16.018 --> 00:09:17.771
die and was a significant figure,

00:09:17.771 --> 00:09:21.904
but in that same year,
his uncle also dies.

00:09:21.904 --> 00:09:24.342
So, you can imagine this year, 619,

00:09:24.342 --> 00:09:26.060
often referred to as the Year of Sorrows,

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.835
it's a fairly low point for Muhammad.

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:30.147
He's been preaching for about,

00:09:30.147 --> 00:09:31.958
or he's been getting these revelations

00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.826
and preaching for around nine years, now,
