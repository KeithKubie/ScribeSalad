00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.500
 Most people think that miscellaneous products are more difficult to eat than famous brands, poor quality or less effective. 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.790
 But big brands are usually more expensive 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.490
 Are there really different brands and big brands? 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.020
 In terms of food, there are many companies that produce miscellaneous products. 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.039
 In fact, many big brand manufacturers have spare capacity 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.090
 Production of branded products in 2007, Peter Pan brand peanut butter 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.100
 Was found to contain Salmonella and was recovered and destroyed 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.590
 At the same time, Walmart's own brand Great Value was also removed. 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.629
 The next time I go to the supermarket to buy things, compare the nutrition signs of the brand and big brand products. 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.570
 Even if they don't look exactly the same, they are even identical 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.100
 But you may be able to feel a little bit similar to them. 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.789
 According to the study, the brand is 30% cheaper than the big brand. 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.320
 In addition, many large livelihood items, like sugar or salt, are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.420
 In the case of salt, it is also called sodium chloride, and its composition is only two elements on the elemental table - 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.909
 How big is the difference between a brand and a big brand? 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.460
 Maybe their tastes taste different? The gorgeous packaging of the product may have an impact. 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.700
 In one study, college students were asked to help them test the coffee score 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.170
 As a result, even if the coffee is the same, they still think of a coffee package with a beautifully wrapped sugar packet, a cream ball and a silver tray. 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.720
 Better than a coffee combination in a plastic cup filled with sugar and creamer. 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.509
 This illustrates the placebo effect (meaning that although the patient receives an ineffective treatment, it is expected or believed to be effective, and the symptoms of the patient are relieved.) 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.490
 Greatly influenced the evaluation of coffee 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.259
 But in terms of medicines, there are different brands and big brands of medicines must be the same. 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.700
 For example, Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.729
 Used to treat headaches, fever, mild pain 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.060
 Ibuprofen is also sold under the name Advil or Nurofen 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.009
 Even if the name is different, the same two hundred milligrams of ibuprofen, the safety, efficacy and usage are the same. 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.229
 The brand of drugs has undergone a series of tests to verify its bioequivalence with the big brands. 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.940
 The only possible difference between drugs in different brands is the additives in the drug. 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.569
 For example, starch, gelatin, spices and pigments 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.290
 So even if the drugs are not identical, the effect is the same. 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.180
 In fact, people prefer to use drugs that are branded. 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.140
 Because they are usually cheaper 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.940
 Of course, there are some drugs that require special doses and need to use a specific brand. 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.790
 In this case, the doctor will assist 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.310
 However, people still have doubts about the brand. 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.550
 In one study, subjects were given a false painkiller and received a microshock 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.590
 When they were told that the price of painkillers was very good, only 61% felt pain relief 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.849
 But when they were told that the asking price was 2.5 yuan, 85.4 percent felt pain relief. 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.819
 Finally, whether in food, medicine or otherwise 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.569
 Miscellaneous cards can be, but are not absolutely identical to, big brands 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:16.190
 So save the money and buy something special. 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.140
 In the secondary channel AsapTHOUGHT 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.650
 We also took another experimental film to see if everyone can judge the difference between the brand and the big brand through the trial. 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.660
