00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.480
What I want to do in this video
is to actually use a

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.320
graphing calculator, get some
experience on the calculator

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.310
itself, for graphing some of
these quadratics and actually

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.540
figuring out the roots
visually by

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.030
looking at those graphs.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.410
So the first equation I want to
find the x-intercept for is

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:25.880
y is equal to negative 3x
squared plus 4x minus 1.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.875
So we're just going to go
straight to the calculator.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:31.850
We'll get our TI-85 out here.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.160
And there are obviously better
things you can use, especially

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.020
on your computer, that are going
to be much more visually

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.400
interesting and in color and
even faster, but many of us

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.380
have a TI-85 at our disposal.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.180
The TI-85 hasn't changed much
actually since I was in high

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.710
school, or the TI-83 or whatever
else there is out

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.690
there, TI-92.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.210
And this at least will give you
a sense of how to use it,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.040
because this is what you have,
and how to analyze the graph

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.370
once you are able to graph it.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.000
So let's-- I already turned it
on-- so let's input this graph

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.160
right here.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.555
So we click on GRAPH and then
we'll click on-- this F1 tells

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:10.070
us to pick this option right
here, this y of x, right?

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.670
So they're saying y is a
function of x, y is indeed a

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.980
function of x.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.140
So let's click there, and then
that's going to be negative

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.150
3x-- let's see where
is the variable--

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.390
there's the x variable.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:31.330
x squared plus 4x, minus 1.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.890
There is our function.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.580
Now let's graph it.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.530
So we want to pick this
choice up here.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.390
So to pick this second choice--
so notice, if you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.110
want to pick any of these
choices on the bottom row, you

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.630
can just punch in
these numbers.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.960
But if you want to pick the
choice that's above, you could

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.040
press 2nd, and then press that,
and then 2nd tells you

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.500
to pick the thing that's
right above that.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.390
so I'll pick the thing in
the yellow, essentially.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.150
So I'll do 2nd.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.340
And I'm selecting the
GRAPH option.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.520
When I was in high school, this
was all very fancy stuff,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.260
but now compared to pretty much
most cell phones, this is

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.050
pretty archaic.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.150
But it gets the job done.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.940
Now, let's zoom in, because
I really can't see

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.430
the 0's that well.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.100
So let me zoom here.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.660
I like to use the box, we zoom
in on a certain area that I

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.195
can define.

00:02:22.195 --> 00:02:25.420
So, I'll select the box, and
then I select where I want to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.390
start the box for using
the arrow keys.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.660
Press ENTER, that tells it to
start the box, and then I can

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.820
zoom in using the box.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.130
I define the box, and
when I have a box I

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.890
like, I press ENTER.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.670
And it'll redefine the range
of x and y values that it

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.050
calculates the graphing
function.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.500
Now, I want to figure out what
these x-intercepts are.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.330
So I'm going to use the
trace function.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.620
And the trace function
is just going to

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.820
walk along this graph.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.550
So let me hit 2nd, trace.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.450
And now I'm walking along this
graph as I go to the right.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.800
It just increments
the x-value.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.590
We're getting closer and closer
to y is equal to 0.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.810
And it looks like it happens
right at about 1.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.120
Right as I cross 1, I'm crossing
y is equal to 0.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.260
y is a very small positive
number here, and then it goes

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.040
to becoming a less small, but
still a small negative number,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.220
right as we cross 1.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.100
I'm going to evaluate it
directly at x is equal to 1.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.560
But, I think that's a pretty
good approximation, and we can

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.350
even try it out in
our equation.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.490
Let's try it out.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.860
If x is equal to 1-- let
me write it this way.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.960
y of 1, if we write y is a
function of 1, this is going

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.680
to be equal to negative 3 times
1 squared, plus 4 times

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.200
1, minus 1.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.350
So this is equal to negative
3 plus 4, minus 1,

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.550
which is indeed 0.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.710
So the point x is equal to 1, y
is equal to 0 is definitely

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.320
on the graph, and this is
one of our x-intercepts.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.250
Let's see if we can figure out
the other one using our

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.310
calculator.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.230
So let's see, we need to figure
out this other point

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.720
right here.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.839
Let's get the zoom box going.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.730
Actually, let's try just
to trace there.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.650
Scrolling all the way.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.950
And it looks like it's
around 0.33.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.040
I suspect it's close to 1/3,
but let me zoom in a little

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.490
bit better.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.770
So let me click GRAPH again,
and click on zoom.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.320
I'm going to use
the box again.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.840
And then let me do the top left
corner of the bottom, and

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.240
zoom in really narrowly on
that point right there.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.015
Really, really zoom in.

00:04:49.015 --> 00:04:51.640
So it's around 0.33 that
I want to zoom in.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.970
So that's going to be the
beginning of my box, and let

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:02.390
me go right below the y-axis and
then go right above 0.33.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.640
And so it's really
zoomed in on that

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.500
y-intercept right there.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.900
So now if I trace it, I really
should be able to figure out

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.720
what that value is.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.950
So let me do 2nd, and trace,
and keep scrolling.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.600
So it's a little bit
more than 0.33.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.410
It looks like it's really
approaching

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.980
0.3333333, which is 1/3.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.520
It looks like it's
0.3 repeating.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.730
Then we're getting to very,
very small y-values.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.750
So it looks like 1/3, so let's
try out 1/3 and see if we got

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.390
the right answer.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:43.500
So, if we have y of 1/3 is equal
to negative 3 times 1/3

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.800
squared, plus 4, times
1/3, minus 1.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.910
This is equal to-- negative 3
times 1/9 is negative 1/3.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.540
This is plus 4/3, and then
minus 1 or negative 1,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.780
depending on how you view it,
it's the same thing as

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.420
minus 3 over 3.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.180
So this is going to be negative
1 plus 4, minus 3,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.480
all of that over 3,
which is indeed 0.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.690
So we also have the
x-intercept.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.310
x is equal to 1/3,
y is equal to 0.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.620
Let's do another one.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:32.270
Let's say we have y is
equal to 1/2x squared

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.890
minus 2x, plus 3.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.470
Let's see if we can get its
roots, or the 0's, of this

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.870
equation, where it intersects
the x-axis.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.390
So let's get our calculator
back.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.900
And we're going to have to
zoom out of this thing.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.140
So let me do zoom.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.770
I think I can just use
the previous zoom.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.900
Well, the previous zoom
is still a little bit

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.890
not too zoomed in.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.095
Let me just do the previous
zoom before that.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.800
And then, I'll do another
zoom-- oh, it just keeps

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.480
alternating between the zooms,
so maybe I have to clear out.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.490
I am not an expert at this.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.510
All right.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.700
So let me just input
my new graph.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.900
So it's 1/2x squared.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:29.470
I could write that as 0.5x
squared minus 2x, plus 3.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.740
And then I want to graph this.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.100
Oh, so it's on that super-zoomed
in version, so

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.350
let me zoom out.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.390
There you go, zoom standard,
that resets it.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.960
There you go.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.380
That's all I had to do,
the standard zoom.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.420
So you see.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.770
Let's see, where does it
intersect the x-axis?

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.490
Well, it doesn't intersect
the x-axis.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.160
It just goes down here,
then keeps going up.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.720
So this quadratic function
right here will have no

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.160
x-intercepts.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.900
I mean, you can see it
graphically here.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.020
It does not intersect
the x-axis.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:16.240
So, if you were trying to
solve the equation 1/2x

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.250
squared minus 2x, plus 3 is
equal to 0, what you're

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.880
essentially trying to do is say,
what x-values give me y

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.160
is equal to 0 here?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.950
We just graphed it, it never
intersected the x-axis.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.410
It just did something
like this.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.750
It never equaled y
is equal to 0.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:38.100
So this right here will have
no real solutions.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.419
And I use the word real in
the mathematical sense.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.929
There no real number
solutions.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.970
We'll see, not too far off in
the future, that there are

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:52.860
things called complex numbers,
and those can be solutions to

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.170
quadratics that don't intersect
the x-axis, at least

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.900
in kind of the real domain.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.300
Now let's do one
more of these.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:09.480
Let's say we have x squared plus
6x, plus 9 is equal to 0.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.520
And we should actually be able
to factor this in our head.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.280
What two numbers add up to
6 and when you multiply

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.025
them you get 9?

00:09:16.025 --> 00:09:17.470
It probably jumps out
of your head.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.610
It's 3 and 3.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:24.960
So this is x plus 3, times
x plus 3 is equal to 0.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.770
Or-- and we just have to use
one of these-- x plus 3 is

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.270
equal to 0.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.550
Subtract 3 from both sides.
x is equal to negative 3.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.310
So this has one 0.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.930
So how do you think this is
going to look if it only

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.950
intersects the x-axis at
exactly one point?

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.710
Well, the best guess is is that
that one point is going

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.260
to be the vertex.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.010
So let's graph it just to
verify for ourselves.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.750
So let me to clear this one
out, and we have x squared

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:04.590
plus 6x, plus 9.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.580
And we want to graph it.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.630
And there you go.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.840
The vertex is right at x is
equal to negative 3, y is

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.260
equal to 0.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.990
It just hits it right
over there.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.150
So our intuition was correct.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.610
And just as a bit of review--
and I should have pointed this

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.910
out when I was showing you the
other graphs-- notice, this

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.190
has a positive coefficient
on x-squared.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.820
It is upward-opening.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.360
The second problem we did also
had a positive coefficient.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.830
It didn't intersect the x-axis,
but it was also

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:33.800
upward-opening.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.960
And if you rewind this video to
the very first problem we

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.400
did, you saw it had a negative
coefficient, and it also had a

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.310
downward-opening parabola, or
downward-opening u-shape.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.440
Well, anyway, hopefully you
found this little practice

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.800
with the graphing calculator
helpful.
