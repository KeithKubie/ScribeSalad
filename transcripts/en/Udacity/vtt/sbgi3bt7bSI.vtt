00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, the answer is complexity matters sometimes.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Sometimes in the project there is a correlation

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
between some complexity metric and the real number of bugs.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But very frequently there isn't.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Then in every project there is some other complexity metric

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that correlates, so it might just as well be random.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So, no. Complexity is not related to bugs as found in production code.
