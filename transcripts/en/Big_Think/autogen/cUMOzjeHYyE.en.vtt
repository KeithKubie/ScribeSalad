for his evil deeds he shouldn't be
 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.900
for his evil deeds he shouldn't be
punished certainly yeah he's just the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910
punished certainly yeah he's just the
 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.839
punished certainly yeah he's just the
victim of his circumstances

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849

Dennett might object that this is just

Dennett might object that this is just

Dennett might object that this is just
an intuition pumping that we shouldn't

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
an intuition pumping that we shouldn't
 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.720
an intuition pumping that we shouldn't
take it seriously yes it's not that it's

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730
take it seriously yes it's not that it's
 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.490
take it seriously yes it's not that it's

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500
an intuition pump the intuition pumps
 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.890
an intuition pump the intuition pumps
could be good it's a it's a bad

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900
could be good it's a it's a bad
 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.220
could be good it's a it's a bad

might be critical of their intuition

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299
might be critical of their intuition
 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.630
might be critical of their intuition
pump they go ahead and do it anyway so

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640
pump they go ahead and do it anyway so
 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.390
pump they go ahead and do it anyway so
let me now turn the knobs on this

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400
let me now turn the knobs on this
 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.520
let me now turn the knobs on this
intuition pump and we'll see what we can

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530
intuition pump and we'll see what we can
 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.979
intuition pump and we'll see what we can
make of it first they say the fact that

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989
make of it first they say the fact that
 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.550
make of it first they say the fact that
this this person was created by evil

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560
this this person was created by evil
 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.530
this this person was created by evil
scientists with evil intent that's

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540
scientists with evil intent that's
 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.559
scientists with evil intent that's
irrelevant to the example really so all

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569
irrelevant to the example really so all
 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.729
irrelevant to the example really so all
right so let's get rid of them we'll

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739
right so let's get rid of them we'll
 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.590
right so let's get rid of them we'll
turn that in the haben so and in

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600
turn that in the haben so and in
 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.830
turn that in the haben so and in
different environment produces a human

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840
different environment produces a human
 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.410
different environment produces a human
being who they say by design is set out

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420
being who they say by design is set out
 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.080
being who they say by design is set out
on uh sort of anti-social trajectory

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090
on uh sort of anti-social trajectory
 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.150
on uh sort of anti-social trajectory
well but we can get rid of that by

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160
well but we can get rid of that by
 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.819
well but we can get rid of that by
design too because if it's an

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829
design too because if it's an
 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.470
design too because if it's an
indifferent environment then there's no

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480
indifferent environment then there's no
 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.740
indifferent environment then there's no
intent on this so we now we've got this

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750
intent on this so we now we've got this
 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.430
intent on this so we now we've got this
an indifferent environment happens to

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440
an indifferent environment happens to
 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.129
an indifferent environment happens to
produce an individual who with high

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139
produce an individual who with high
 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.729
produce an individual who with high
probability will engage in some criminal

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739
probability will engage in some criminal
 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.000
probability will engage in some criminal
activities let's say and then they

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010
activities let's say and then they
 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.970
activities let's say and then they
imagine that that he kills somebody in a

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980
imagine that that he kills somebody in a
 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.490
imagine that that he kills somebody in a
in a drug bust or something like you

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500
in a drug bust or something like you
 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.539
in a drug bust or something like you
know in a drug deal gone bad

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549
know in a drug deal gone bad
 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.129
know in a drug deal gone bad
well that's in essential so we're gonna

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139
well that's in essential so we're gonna
 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.539
well that's in essential so we're gonna
change the crime we're gonna make it you

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549
change the crime we're gonna make it you
 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.039
change the crime we're gonna make it you
kill somebody who's witnessed some

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049
kill somebody who's witnessed some
 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.699
kill somebody who's witnessed some
embezzlement that he's

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709
embezzlement that he's
 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.050
embezzlement that he's
shouldn't make any difference if you

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060
shouldn't make any difference if you
 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.780
shouldn't make any difference if you
thought that the mr. puppet in the first

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790
thought that the mr. puppet in the first
 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.849
thought that the mr. puppet in the first
instance wasn't responsible and

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859
instance wasn't responsible and
 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.140
instance wasn't responsible and
shouldn't be held responsible and that

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150
shouldn't be held responsible and that
 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.120
shouldn't be held responsible and that
this shouldn't change now I want to

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130
this shouldn't change now I want to
 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.030
this shouldn't change now I want to
change just one more thing they keep

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040
change just one more thing they keep
 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.270
change just one more thing they keep
talking about mr. puppet okay that's a

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280
talking about mr. puppet okay that's a
