00:00:09.256 --> 00:00:10.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Over the
past several years,

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:12.636
there's been a quiet revolution going

00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:16.556
on that has transformed Harrison
High School's curriculum.

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:21.246
In almost every classroom, technology
tools are facilitating a new way

00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:22.256
of learning.

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.786
&gt;&gt;Are we collecting?

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:25.526
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Probes
and laptops are used

00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:28.076
in real world scientific
explorations.

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:31.806
History lessons are as
exciting as game shows.

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:34.056
&gt;&gt;A, Colorado, B.

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:36.536
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They even use technology

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.526
to improve their nationally
ranked cheerleading squad.

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:42.856
&gt;&gt;Student: Like without this
stuff, we'd have no idea

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:45.576
like how much things have
changed in, you know,

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:46.886
where we started and
where we're at now.

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:49.496
It lets people know that they've
either been working hard enough

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:50.626
or need to work a little bit harder.

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:54.526
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Data from the cheerleader
workouts is given to students

00:00:54.526 --> 00:00:56.776
in an algebra two class for analysis.

00:00:57.626 --> 00:01:00.146
&gt;&gt;Charlotte: These students are just
learning how to graph equations,

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:05.056
and instead of just plain graphing
numbers, we're graphing real data,

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:07.906
so they can have something
meaningful for their work.

00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:10.646
&gt;&gt;Student: Right now,
I'm tracing myself

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:13.046
so I can determine by
velocity of the ball.

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:17.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this physics
class, students use video cameras,

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.286
photo gates and other
high tech gadgets

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:23.566
to explore the science behind
their personal passions.

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.986
&gt;&gt;Teacher: If you consider a
minute ago, you went from up there

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.006
to the floor in a thirtieth
of a second.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:35.976
So your acceleration and your
average velocity was a lot faster.

00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:41.186
&gt;&gt;All: [cheering]

00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:43.826
