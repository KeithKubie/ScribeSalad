00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.310
And there were actually two
correct answers to this one.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.046
Now since I said y1 and x1,
I suspect you may have used point 1,

00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:12.919
in which case you would
have done y- 8 = m.

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.309
And m is 2 times x minus, well x1 is 1.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:20.595
But you could have used point 2.

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:23.164
It would have worked exactly the same.

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:27.245
In which case we would
have done y- 12 equals,

00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:30.344
the slope is still 2, times x -3.
