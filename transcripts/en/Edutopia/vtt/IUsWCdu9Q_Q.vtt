00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:10.126
&gt;&gt;Tonia: Let's keep that
good concentration going.

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:11.636
&gt;&gt;Girl: They cleared land
by cutting down forests.

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:13.716
&gt;&gt;Tonia: All four turn
out, one big chop.

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:15.346
Good job!

00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:20.356
&gt;&gt;Tonia: Because our students use the
arts to deepen their understanding,

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:25.496
they remember content for a longer
period of time, and they're able

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:29.026
to use their voice, their
body, their art skills

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:31.956
to demonstrate knowledge
in the way that is fun.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:42.526
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Here we go.

00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:43.286
[drumming]

00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:44.896
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Having the
arts as a core part

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:48.286
of our academic program was
critical to our founders.

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:52.956
We've seen the arts as
important for two reasons.

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:56.956
One is because they are beautiful
and joyful in and of themselves.

00:00:57.796 --> 00:01:01.046
But the other reasons is we think that
kids can arrive at new understandings

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:03.616
about other content areas
through their work in art.

00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:06.076
&gt;&gt;Leah: You want to be
thinking about colors--

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:09.846
&gt;&gt;Tonia: Students are either
integrating Social Studies content

00:01:09.846 --> 00:01:13.526
with an Arts discipline, or Science
content with an Arts discipline.

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:16.186
The Art Staff and classroom
teachers look

00:01:16.186 --> 00:01:19.196
at the guiding questions,
what the big ideas are.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.266
So there's just a lot of
discussion, a lot of collaboration.

00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:25.426
&gt;&gt;Sharanya: The four forces
help an airplane to fly.

00:01:26.056 --> 00:01:29.496
&gt;&gt;Sharanya: This semester our expedition
is about the physics of flight.

00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:36.346
The goal is for students to learn
about how airplanes fly in the air.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:37.716
&gt;&gt;Stuart: Our problem is people

00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:42.086
at the National Airport don't
understand the physics of fight,

00:01:42.086 --> 00:01:45.576
even though they're about
to get on planes.

00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:50.016
&gt;&gt;Paz: We're going to put
up arts at the airport,

00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:56.436
so people can know what the
four forces of flight are

00:01:56.926 --> 00:01:59.786
like lift, gravity, thrust and drag.

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:05.516
&gt;&gt;Leah: Thinking about using our
four forces, we can use paintbrushes,

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:08.376
we can even do a little bit of pouring.

00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:12.226
&gt;&gt;Leah: So we begin with Jackson
Pollock and some of his artwork,

00:02:12.316 --> 00:02:15.776
and kids realize pretty quickly
that he's using the four forces.

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:20.356
They see him using gravity and thrust
in his really active style of painting.

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:22.476
And they start trying it out.

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.606
&gt;&gt;Leah: And what force will
you be using as you're pouring?

00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:25.296
&gt;&gt;Girl: Gravity.

00:02:25.576 --> 00:02:28.876
&gt;&gt;Leah: So yeah, when you poured it,
it didn't just go out into the air.

00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:30.556
&gt;&gt;Girl: Gravity pulled it down.

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:33.516
&gt;&gt;Leah: That was gravity.

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:37.296
&gt;&gt;Ethan: Jackson Pollock
used forces like drag

00:02:37.746 --> 00:02:43.116
because when there was a big puddle
of paint, and some paint went

00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:47.466
through the big blob of
paint, it slowed down,

00:02:47.676 --> 00:02:50.416
because that blob of paint was bigger.

00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:52.056
&gt;&gt;Boy: That is so cool!

00:02:52.676 --> 00:02:53.486
&gt;&gt;Leah: All right!

00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:53.746
Good job!

00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:57.396
&gt;&gt;Leah: It's really just about making
those abstract concepts concrete.

00:02:57.606 --> 00:02:59.496
&gt;&gt;Leah: What if we do
a little bit of this?

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:04.466
&gt;&gt;Ethan: I like art and science,
so I'm doing two things I

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:07.596
like to learn how something works.

00:03:07.596 --> 00:03:09.676
&gt;&gt;Leah: You guys had
a great contribution.

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:11.216
I'm loving it.

00:03:11.216 --> 00:03:14.446
&gt;&gt;Sharanya: With these art experiments,
it's something they could hold onto

00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:17.726
and point to and say,
"Here's how a force works,

00:03:17.726 --> 00:03:20.986
and I was able to do that myself."

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:23.536
&gt;&gt;Leah: Great job today, guys!

00:03:23.756 --> 00:03:24.046
&gt;&gt;Tonia: All right!

00:03:24.086 --> 00:03:26.036
Here we go, action.

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:33.336
&gt;&gt;Class: There is a river
that tells a story.

00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:35.906
&gt;&gt;Alex: So this semester, we're
learning about the Anacostia River,

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:39.446
and all of like the problems
and things going wrong

00:03:39.446 --> 00:03:40.916
with it, like all the pollution.

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:43.626
&gt;&gt;Alex: It is a story of the
community's efforts to save it.

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:46.416
&gt;&gt;Tonia: They were using an anchor
text in their classroom called,

00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:48.906
"A River Ran Wild," which
is a true story

00:03:48.906 --> 00:03:50.796
about the Nashua River in Massachusetts.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:54.766
And they were using that to help
build students' background knowledge.

00:03:54.866 --> 00:03:58.306
And we decided to let
that be their drama piece.

00:03:58.466 --> 00:04:01.306
&gt;&gt;Tonia: Step back upstage, high five.

00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:04.356
Natives come downstage and--

00:04:04.356 --> 00:04:08.096
&gt;&gt;Tonia: We just started acting it out,
playing around with the characters,

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:11.216
and it just kind of just
started gelling together.

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:11.786
&gt;&gt;Tonia: Shoot!

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:15.516
&gt;&gt;Tonia: And so we put all of
our ideas from playing with it

00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:18.216
in class into one organized script.

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:22.836
&gt;&gt;Boy: This is a story about
people who made a difference!

00:04:23.386 --> 00:04:23.686
&gt;&gt;Tonia: Good!

00:04:23.836 --> 00:04:25.886
&gt;&gt;Bryn: It's teaching you
through something more fun,

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.846
so you can like learn more
through something like active.

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:31.876
&gt;&gt;Tonia: Pose like you're
overcome with grief and sadness.

00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:32.976
Crying...

00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:35.206
&gt;&gt;Tonia: When you put movement
to text, it helps you have

00:04:35.206 --> 00:04:37.436
to think about it much more deeply.

00:04:37.706 --> 00:04:39.706
Kids have to make intentional choices

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:42.346
about how they're going
to use their voice.

00:04:42.346 --> 00:04:43.506
How they're going to use their body.

00:04:43.506 --> 00:04:46.856
How they're going to depend on
one another to relate the story.

00:04:46.956 --> 00:04:50.416
&gt;&gt;Bryn: And slowly the Nashua's
fish grew sick from the pollution.

00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:51.976
&gt;&gt;Tonia: Let's do that again, Wilson.

00:04:52.506 --> 00:04:54.886
That might just be the
showstopper right there.

00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:59.756
&gt;&gt;Bryn: Through the play we were
showing that if they can clean

00:04:59.756 --> 00:05:02.366
up the Nashua River, then we
can clean up the Anacostia,

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:05.166
so people know you can
make a difference.

00:05:05.356 --> 00:05:06.856
&gt;&gt;Tonia: Give Wilson a hand!

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:07.566
[clapping]

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:10.136
&gt;&gt;Leah: When they recognize something
they've been studying in their classroom

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:13.426
in this new environment, their
faces just really light up,

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:14.946
and you know that's going
to stick with them.

00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:15.726
&gt;&gt;Leah: Arm created.

00:05:15.726 --> 00:05:16.736
&gt;&gt;Leah: They're not going
to forget that,

00:05:16.736 --> 00:05:18.596
that's an experience that is going deep.

00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:19.756
&gt;&gt;Class: New York!

00:05:19.956 --> 00:05:20.206
&gt;&gt;Tonia: Whoo-hoo!

00:05:20.306 --> 00:05:20.536
Yes! [claps]
