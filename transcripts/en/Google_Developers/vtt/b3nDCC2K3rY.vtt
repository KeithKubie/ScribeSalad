DANIELA CRUZ: Today
we'll be sharing

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.300
some insights we've uncovered
over the past two years.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.100
From the marketing
side, I'll be sharing

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.310
some trends we've noticed
around how people are

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.350
using their digital assistants.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.860
We've gathered these insights
from multiple research surveys,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.590
in-home interviews,
and focus groups.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.190
MEI LU: From the
UX side, I'm going

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.990
to share design recommendations
or implications based

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.820
on studies that we
conducted using diaries,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.479
lab studies, or interviews.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.450
Those recommendations are
based on common issues

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.670
that we have observed
in actions that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.800
have been already deployed.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.040
I'm a very bad person in
my team because I always

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.960
talk about the issues.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.230
And I'm driving my team-- so
engineering or design teams--

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.570
crazy.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.150
I hope to shed some light on
what high quality action means.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.940
What are the key
components we need

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.640
to put in place to make an
action useful, trustworthy,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.530
easy, or fun to use.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.261
By the way, if any of you
do not know what action is,

00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:15.720
it is basically the
experience you as a developer

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.110
create for Google Assistant.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.660
On Google Assistant,
users can start

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.060
to interact with your experience
by simply saying, "hey,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.613
Google."

00:01:28.613 --> 00:01:30.030
DANIELA CRUZ: So
all this research

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.480
we've condensed into
five key insights

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.980
that range from looking at
general digital assistant

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.790
growth and how both consumers
and developers perceive

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.590
this new technology.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.770
We'll also be looking at user
behavior trends in the home

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.400
and how to best design
for in-home usage.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.140
We'll touch on some
trends we've noticed

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.260
regarding on-the-go usage
and how to best build

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.180
actions for mobile phones.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.850
We'll look at how people are
using their digital assistants

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.970
across different
types of devices.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.920
And last, we'll
talk about how users

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.780
would like to engage with
brands and third parties,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.260
as well as sharing some
additional insights,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.900
specifically regarding shopping.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.960
So let's get started
with the first insight.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.020
This space is big and
it's growing fast.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.510
If we think back
to two years ago,

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.640
smart speakers were a novelty.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.710
You would maybe go to
your friend's house

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.990
and if they had one, it
kind of felt like a toy.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.430
You would spend
most of your time

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.690
asking it silly questions
like, "hey Google, tell me

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.310
the best dad joke."

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.160
However, since
then, smart speakers

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.480
have become a common term.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.880
In the past year alone,
the Google Assistant

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.120
has become available in
over 1 billion devices

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.460
across 1,500 types of devices.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.530
And this includes
everything from phones, TVs,

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.110
smart speakers, laptop,
pens, ear pods, clocks,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.450
smart displays, microwaves,
anything you can think of.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.390
It's also become available
in over 80 countries

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.040
and 30 languages.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.290
So we're seeing
digital assistants

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.820
helping users across voice only
and voice in screens worldwide.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.200
Let's just stop there and think
about that for one minute.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.090
If we only keep in mind digital
assistant enabled smartphones

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.060
and no other of the devices
that I just mentioned,

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.940
these are still billions of
devices in people's pockets

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.580
that you could start
building for today.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.320
Under developer
community, we're seeing

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.730
more than four times growth
and actions of Google projects.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.760
And we're noticing actions
in Google categories

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.360
like games, home
automation, music,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.700
actions for families
and education,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.810
growing in popularity.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.530
So with all of this
growth, we started

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.710
to wonder what people thought
about their digital assistants.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.160
To get to the bottom of it,
we conducted some research

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.060
in the summer of last
year where we asked people

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.880
about the value of their
digital assistance.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.560
In this particular
survey, we asked over

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.860
2,000 digital assistant
users in the US

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.550
how or if digital
assistants brought value

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.079
to their everyday lives.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.250
And this is what
they had to say.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.330
71% agree that digital
assistants allowed

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.710
them to more easily multitask.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.220
70% agree that it makes
their life easier.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.080
And 67% agree that it makes
their daily routines easier.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.480
MEI LU: And on the
developer side,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.410
Dani and I run our quarterly
survey with developers

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.160
worldwide.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.060
That's 2,000 developers.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.800
As this number shows,
developer sentiment

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.400
is pretty consistent
with that of consumers.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.740
Around 70%, we
feel like they are

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.100
holding very positive outlook.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.990
Developers feel
digital assistants

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.830
will drive innovation for both
software and the hardware.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.900
And they will meet the
important user needs.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.950
We have 21% said digital
assistant are just

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.420
a passing gimmick,
which means close to 80%

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.450
think digital
assistant will stay.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.020
Overall, we are feeling that
this is an exciting space

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.480
to be in and that we
are seeing more to come.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.970
In our interviews, we have asked
many developers this question--

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.890
why actions Google?

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.770
It's great to have
you on the platform.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.940
But what brought you here?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.590
This is a quote from
a gaming developer.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.660
He was excited about creating
very natural and intuitive

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.200
interaction for
everyone, including

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.890
those otherwise might be
challenged to use technology.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.460
Voice can be so intuitive,
available for everyone,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.460
and it either enables hands
free and eye-free usage.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.670
And it's also the cornerstone
for intelligent interaction.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.790
This represents the primary
motive for many developers

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.880
we talk to.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.080
But as we all have to agree,
voice-based interaction

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.960
can also be so challenging.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.030
We asked many developers
this question--

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.980
what does a high quality
interaction mean to you?

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.990
And as one developer said,
high quality interaction

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.460
means it should be
trivial, effortless.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.290
You don't need to
think about it.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.670
You don't need to learn.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.410
It just should be as fluid
as our daily conversation.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.990
To me, these are the
two things that make

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.480
me excited about my daily job.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.450
First of all, we are
hoping to make technology

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.940
available for everyone.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.380
Secondly, it's challenging.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.560
We have many problems to solve.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.770
I really feel honored
to work with all of you

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.990
to try to solve this
problem together.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.860
Then for the next four
insights, Dani and I

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.410
are going to talk about some
specifics about user trends

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.655
that we have observed and
discuss design implications.

00:07:23.655 --> 00:07:25.520
DANIELA CRUZ: Great.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.910
So let's start
with in-home usage.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.280
Smart speakers have been used
in the home for a few years now.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.700
So when we look
at in-home usage,

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.770
data shows that
it's becoming part

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.310
of people's everyday routines.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.930
In a study we
conducted, we wanted

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.660
to understand how digital
assistants were being

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.310
embedded in people's lives.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.610
We asked users to think
about their everyday routines

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.520
and think of the user
digital assistants in them.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.790
If they answered yes,
we then asked them how.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.030
What we found is that 89%
of respondents told us

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.130
they were leveraging
their digital assistants

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.070
during their daily routines
for multiple activities morning

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.960
through night.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.830
And for some, it's even
becoming second nature.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.110
We found that the three
most common routines

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.030
are happening in the home.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.170
57% say they use their digital
assistants around the house

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.280
while relaxing.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.520
So this could be anything like
playing a game or streaming

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.830
music after a long day's work.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.710
43% say they use their digital
assistants when they're

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.190
getting ready in the morning.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.510
So as people are multitasking,
making breakfast, getting

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.289
ready, they're also asking their
digital assistants for commute

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.840
information, for the
news, for the weather,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.880
or maybe preordering
a cup of coffee

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.820
before they walk out the door.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.730
And last 43% also say that they
use their digital assistant

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.310
when they're
planning their week.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.710
Here we're seeing people
setting reminders,

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.730
adding calendar invites for
things later in the week.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.530
They're researching
locations that they're

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.210
considering going to.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.730
And sometimes even booking
restaurant reservations.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.400
A quote like the
one you see here

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.440
is actually something
common we heard

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.360
when we were going
into the homes

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.310
of digital assistant
users and asking them

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.750
about their day-to-day.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.640
They would say, my
digital assistant

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.680
is part of my daily routine.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.035
I come down to the
kitchen, turn on my coffee,

00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:19.910
and ask my digital
assistant for the weather.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.100
MEI LU: These numbers,
percentage numbers,

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.500
are actually pretty
encouraging to me personally.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.060
I was reading an article, a
recent paper about the adoption

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.500
of the internet.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.530
The researchers said
it's the small things

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:41.230
that people use the internet
for on the everyday basis that

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.490
make it an integral
part of people's life.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.910
Then they become indispensable.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.330
We once invited 32
users to our lab

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:55.340
and observed how they use
different type of actions.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.570
In the study, our
users were indeed

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.190
telling us they have been
using digital assistants

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.490
on the daily basis, often
times for small things,

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.800
just like weather.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.640
Those small things are
entwined with many other things

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.800
they're doing at home.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.090
Now, how should we design
the most engaging actions

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.500
for people's homes
that can be embedded

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.020
into people's daily routines?

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.540
After the first
encounter, it actually

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.230
needs to meet the
user expectations.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:37.280
In our lab studies, we can see
user will very quickly abandon

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.000
action if they cannot easily
figure out how to use it.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.460
The first step, oh,
how can I use this?

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.290
Then they also
carry expectations

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.910
for brands they are
already familiar with.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:56.020
An example would be if it says
TED or CNN talk or action,

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.440
then they very much
expect to see videos

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.330
on the smart display.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.320
If they are already using
your services on the web

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.560
or on mobile apps, at
this first encounter

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.220
they expect to see some
familiarity, some familiar

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.080
things that you get things done.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.420
So if we order a
pizza or a car ride,

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.810
at that first moment,
encounter moment,

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.960
you do not want the user to
feel any kind of disappointment

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.730
or they feel they're
totally lost.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:38.640
Then for next steps,
users will try to assess,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.420
does this action provide
the right utility or values?

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.160
Is this something I want to use?

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.510
We find that users carry the
mental model of a signature

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:53.420
functionality--
signature functionality,

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.400
especially for brands
they are familiar with.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.050
So for example, our research
colleagues in Google Maps teams

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:04.910
studied the user interaction
for Google Maps and ways

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.130
through assistant.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:08.540
Those are similar apps.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.060
We know they provide
similar functionalities.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:16.190
But for Google Maps, the
user's signature functionality

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.310
is to ask for directions.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:26.590
Then switched away, it becomes
to report accident via voice.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.980
So I know many of you
probably focus on voice only.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.730
You're creating brand new
experience on this platform.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.160
Then signature
functionality is something

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.000
that will get a user excited.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.090
That's something they
want to talk about.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.680
Or it will have
captured attention

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.258
from maybe on social media
or from the product emails

00:12:49.258 --> 00:12:50.050
they have received.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.370
Some experiences are designed
across multiple devices.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.420
Users can start from smart
speakers, for example,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.360
then continue onto
mobile phones.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.720
But for signature
functionality, do not do that.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.870
Breaking it across multiple
devices will break the flow

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.640
and violate user trust.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.900
Users definitely then
compare what they have--

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.120
compare action to what
they have on other devices,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.660
especially on the mobile app.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.630
They appreciate the actions
that provide convenience

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.730
beyond those solutions.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.605
At this stage, we
see really they

00:13:30.605 --> 00:13:34.280
are attracted to
quick solutions that

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.770
allow them to get things done,
especially when hands free.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:45.850
So for this example, this user
has lived in different states

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.880
and he wants to keep
up with what's going on

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.610
in all those different places.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.050
Then the radio action
allows him really

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:57.880
to easily get to those
stations just by saying

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.960
the name of the stations.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.600
Overall, we need to
create aha moments.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.730
And the users see it,
oh, that's interesting.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.820
And then I want
to give it a try.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.520
And they immediately
say, oh, this

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.750
is better than what I
have on other devices.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.880
Navigation-- navigation
with voice only

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.180
or now with a combination
of the voice and the visuals

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.170
are still very new.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.710
It's very common
for users to find

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.950
it hard to talk to
digital assistants.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.550
Oftentimes, it users a brand
[INAUDIBLE] very common

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.230
for usability studies.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.730
[INAUDIBLE] a brand [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:45.150
Oh, I just don't know
the right term to use.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.720
But as this is one
more savvy user said,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.020
technology actually [INAUDIBLE]
how to communicate better

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.900
with users.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.190
For one example, in
an action we tested,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.642
the action asked for
input for income.

00:15:01.642 --> 00:15:05.090
And then the user would jokingly
say, income in millions.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.740
I have make millions.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.850
But then they actually
want to be able to take it.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.210
The user reaction was
how am I supposed to know

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.420
you have these hidden rules?

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.720
In another example, a user
was to keep asking the action,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.700
can you do this?

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.410
The action was very apologetic.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.970
Sorry I cannot do this.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.410
Then can you do this?

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.810
Sorry, I cannot do this.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:29.620
Can you do this?

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.160
No, cannot do this.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.610
So it becomes a guess and
a check kind of sequences.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.390
At no point it actually
provide something, oh, I

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.520
can do this for you.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.230
So better design would be the
action can be more intelligent

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.890
and maybe provide some
prediction, when app is done--

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.460
the question user asked.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:55.210
And the offer, hey, I
can do this for you.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.150
Whatever happens, please
kind of remember users

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:02.290
often time do not
know what's going on.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.680
Is it because I did not
say the right thing?

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.140
Or is it because the device
or assistant does not

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.680
recognize me correctly?

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.610
Or it's just because the
functionality is not available?

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.390
So provide the right area
information that can guide them

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.450
through next steps or help
them to recover from error

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.300
is actually very important.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.180
Once a user using
different actions,

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.950
I was just fascinated by
how many different ways

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:39.410
users can say to express
the same in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.330
A lot of work is
facing us to make

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.810
our language models, [INAUDIBLE]
models more flexible.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:49.130
I have said this many times
to my teams, internal teams

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.090
at Google.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.130
We need to improve
language recognition.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.530
We need to improve
intent recognition.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.810
We need to recognize
an entity better.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.220
Or we need to recognize all
the problem names better.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.430
And obviously, users
do not like to get

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.259
stuck at any step in the flows.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:15.560
In one example, the
action was offered--

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.829
given list of options.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.550
I can do this,
this, this for you.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.180
What do you want?

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.710
The user said nothing.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.670
And then the action said,
again, I can do this repeat.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.080
I can do this,
this, this for you.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.020
The user said, I
already said nothing.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.430
So what action should
do at that step?

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.410
As you all may
know, users do not

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:41.660
like tree navigation structure.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.930
They want to easily
go back or forward,

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.720
go back to the very beginning
to start over again,

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:52.040
or at any point they want
to start new conversations.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.700
So again, think
about what Dennis

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.950
said about daily routines.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.400
During those times,
users are either busy,

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.690
they are multitasking,
or they just

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.880
want to enjoy the time
with their families.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.990
It is important from
beginning your action can

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.470
catch the attention, and then
throughout the conversation

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.830
maintain that attention.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:19.380
So users have little patience
to learn at the beginning.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.510
And the [INAUDIBLE]
voice, they actually

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:28.250
have very little patience
to try to make it work.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.700
DANIELA CRUZ: But in their
home is not the only places

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.040
where we're seeing
behavior change.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.060
As we said earlier, we saw the
popularity of smart speakers.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.610
We noticed the
emergence of routines.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.860
And now we're noticing
a new trend, which

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.340
is on-the-go on mobile phones.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.090
We wanted to understand
how and where people

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.730
were using their digital
assistants on the phone.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.450
So we ran a survey
and we saw that 76%

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.180
of smartphone digital
assistant use cases

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.710
are outside of the home.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.660
And when we asked
people where you're

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.080
using your digital assistant,
we heard everything from, well,

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.990
I'm out and about
walking, running errands,

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.110
while I'm at work, or
even when I'm working out.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.600
But probably the most
interesting part of this

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.970
is that out of these 76%,
54% of these are in the car,

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.390
because when you're driving
or stuck in traffic,

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.060
it's really convenient
to have a hands-free way

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.920
to access your phone.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.190
While talking to people who
rely on their digital assistants

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.790
on the phone, we even
heard quotes like this one.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.080
"I love how mobile it is.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.580
My digital assistant
goes with me

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.860
everywhere-- at the beach, in an
elevator, walking, and so on."

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.670
But with people using
their digital assistants

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.510
on the phone, we have started
to hear both from developers as

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.960
well as from end users
desires to connect

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.270
between their apps
and their assistants,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.580
since they both do
live on the phone.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.850
So let's take a deeper
look into this need.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:03.370
MEI LU: Yeah.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.880
Recently we conduct
a study about how

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.060
apps and the digital
assistant should interact.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.470
In the diary study,
we asked users

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.460
to spend four days to
document what they're

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.810
doing with their phones'
apps, and what kind of path

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.550
they want to complete.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.480
Then afterwards, at
another four days,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.850
we ask them to
document the moment

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.100
they wish digital assistant
could help you better

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.090
using those apps.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.670
So on this chart
on the left side,

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:41.830
you can see users are using
their mobile apps to perform

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.490
a wide range of tasks.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.160
Then on the right side, those
are digital assistant wishes.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.340
And we call them wishes.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.870
And now they're not
available, but can you

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.420
imagine how digital
assistant can help you

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.970
to better interact
with your apps.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.940
And then we can see that
those wishes are widely

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:05.890
spread across all different
verticals of experiences.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.260
This data shows that users
want the digital system

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.980
to help them with all
aspects of their daily tasks

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.420
on their phone.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.300
Their main areas are--

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:23.830
top areas are-- money or
financial management, then

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.530
shopping and entertainment.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:33.700
We put those digital
assistant wishes or use cases

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.890
into different categories.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:41.140
And close to 70%
were about getting

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:46.300
things done very quickly
via the apps, mobile apps.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.330
So about 30% about
voice commands,

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:55.520
users want to tell app
via voice to do something.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.230
For example, be OK,
Google, start my run.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.720
OK, Google, send this
picture to Instagram,

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.800
or share this
article with my wife.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.710
Then 25% about queries.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.320
Queries are just about getting
the information from the app

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.330
without picking up the phone
and then launch the app.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:18.880
So it would be hey, what's my
balance in my credit card bill?

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.050
And how much charge I
have left in my Tesla car?

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:28.370
And then there's also a desire
for perform quick transactions,

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:32.030
for example, that just order
my coffee, order my usual,

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:36.703
and pay my bills.

00:22:36.703 --> 00:22:38.870
So there's some financial
related quick transaction,

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:42.710
or using voice, get
a sequence of steps

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:44.990
done to maybe order my pizza.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:49.850
I want to tell the system
what type of pizzas I want.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.880
Further, users
also want a system

00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.080
to actively work with them and
bring actions or information

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.840
to them without them
actually asking for it.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.700
So proactive assistant means
that the assistant notice

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:13.610
the context the user's
in and then proactively

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.270
offer suggestions or help.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.850
An example would be in a car.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.980
Every day you do
similar things in a car.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.320
You have time
during the commute.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.350
So maybe notice that
you are in the car.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.260
And then it will launch
your navigation map

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.260
and tell you how
much time it would

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.960
take for you to get to work
and launch your podcast

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.890
or music or audio books.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.610
So a sequence of events
can happen together

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.260
by the assistant.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.910
And all you reveal in the store,
shopping, the assistant-- the

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.830
want assistant or bring
up the shopping assistant

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:54.400
app so they can immediately
see their shopping list.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.420
Smart compile means that they
want the assistant to work

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.370
across maybe multiple apps.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.320
And they're all
working within the app

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.980
to pull information,
summarize it, and then bring

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.380
meaningful insight to them.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.470
Example would be shopping.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:14.170
I'm interested in this
design, design [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.800
Can you look across
multiple shopping apps

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.900
and then offer me
the best price?

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:30.050
So implications for design
for the [INAUDIBLE] usage,

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.600
similar to home settings,
users are looking

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.700
for very fast solutions.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.580
Or they simply
want to save time.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.940
Or for shopping-related cases,
they want to save money.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.500
So with either app
actions we just announced

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.200
that we are at the keynotes
or conversation actions

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.620
many of you have
already worked on,

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.660
you can allow users
to use the voice

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.330
to complete important
tasks on the goal,

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:01.520
or allow them to
quickly get information,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.430
either from the app
or from other sources.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.820
As this one user said,
it is very useful

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.380
to get status information from
app without taking out my phone

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.000
and then take several
steps to get out the phone

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.760
and then find the app.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.980
We can think deeply on where we
can reduce the apps for users

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.670
for interaction flaws.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.640
Users have told us
they actually want

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.020
to help not necessarily with
the apps they frequently use.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.200
They hope it can happen
with apps they do not

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.610
use very frequently.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.190
And they forgot
where the app is.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:43.310
So you can help me define that
app, or with the functionality

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.270
that is now used all the time.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.150
Then they forget where within
your app where that is.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.960
And then using voice, I
actually can find it easily.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.820
Respect the user's
effort means simply

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.940
do not waste the user's time.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.990
We have seen that some
actions ask the users

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.660
for many steps of inputs.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:08.590
Where's your address?

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:09.980
Where's your zip code?

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.050
What type of things
you want to order?

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.550
And then at the end--

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.940
sorry, I cannot do anything
because you have not linked

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.050
an account yet.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.570
So users are usually
very mad at this moment.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:26.060
They felt they had
been led to a dead end.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.550
And we could see at those kind
of moments, they will give up.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.290
They will bend the action.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:32.060
So this just--

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.020
I will not try again.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.450
It should minimize
request for inputs,

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:41.620
maybe as we become more
intelligent on the action side,

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.170
on the assistance side.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.540
We should try to
source information

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.560
as much as possible
without asking users.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.660
And employees, the
more questions you ask,

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.290
the more likely
they're going to drop.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:27:00.040
By all means, avoid
asking same kind

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.000
of information, same employers,
at the same conversation

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.780
session.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.130
We have seen that.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.100
You just asked these
questions, exact same question.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.630
I haven't even dropped off.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:11.320
You ask again.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:17.850
DANIELA CRUZ: So we've
seen both in the home

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.830
and on the go usage trends.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.260
But we know that people don't
just stay to one or the other.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.290
They occupy both spaces.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.300
So for our fourth
insight, we've also

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.310
found that digital
assistants don't just live

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.130
in an isolated space or device.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.190
What does this mean?

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.388
If you think of an app you
by default think of a phone,

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:37.680
because that's where they live.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.953
Or if you think of a TV, you'll
think of your living room.

00:27:41.953 --> 00:27:43.620
But when we think of
digital assistants,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.160
you can really access them
across all types of devices

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.080
and trigger them anywhere.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.990
And with this, of course,
comes a new set of challenge.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.960
In our aim with our
team to understand

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.810
how we can make the product
better as people are going

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.470
from one device to the next,
we took a look at the devices

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.020
that people were using
when they were triggering

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.780
their digital assistants and a
little bit of what they expect

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.980
when they go between them.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.380
We first asked users
what devices they already

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:15.940
owned that had built-in voice
activated digital assistants.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.390
And after, we asked them which
ones they were actively using.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.490
What we found is that
more than one third

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.310
of digital assistant
users are reaching out

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.140
to talk to their
digital assistants

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.060
on tablets and laptops.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.120
And almost one third
are doing it on TVs.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.100
Now, this to us was
really interesting.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.240
We had almost assumed that
if you were on a laptop

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.730
and you had a question, you
would just open up a new tab

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.350
and ask for it there, as
that would make sense.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.430
But what we saw instead
was something like this.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.180
If I'm working from home,
instead of typing, "what's

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.190
another word for a kimono?"

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.870
I'll just ask my
digital assistant.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.930
It's slightly faster than
opening up a new browser.

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:58.337
So they're going
as far as talking

00:28:58.337 --> 00:28:59.920
to their digital
assistant, because it

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.740
feels more convenient to
them, despite already being

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.680
on a device that we would think
they would continue their usage

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.513
pattern.

00:29:06.513 --> 00:29:07.930
So what we're
seeing is that we're

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:12.245
seeing a break in their
expected behaviors.

00:29:12.245 --> 00:29:13.620
We also wanted to
know how people

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.380
are going between
devices and found

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.720
that 57% of dual device users--

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.570
so these are users
that are accessing

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:25.020
their digital assistants across
different types of devices--

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.270
made requests on one
device that they then

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.650
expected to pick up on another.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.530
So what does this look like?

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.660
An example here would be music.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.950
If you are on the go
and you're on your phone

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.380
and ask your digital assistant
to start playing music,

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.320
they would then get home
and ask their smart speaker

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.720
to continue playing music
and expect them to pick up

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.700
exactly where they left off.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.080
Another one would be directions.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.910
If you're already at
the home and you're

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:54.090
talking to your smart speaker,
telling it how long will it

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.260
take me to get to work?

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.450
They expect that as they
walk out their door,

00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:59.550
they're going to get the
directions and traffic

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.620
information on their phone.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.370
We've heard over and over
again that these dual device

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.250
users are expecting
a seamless flow

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.740
from one device to the other.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.750
MEI LU: So design across
multiple products.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:18.850
Assistant is a place
in the user's mind

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:23.860
that they can interact
with apps or webs.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.140
Here are some examples
that users have told us

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:29.690
or without us prompting
them with any ideas.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.800
So for example now,
for recipe action,

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.620
they want to be able
to search on the web

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:41.440
and then add favorite
to the action.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.870
And then when
they're cooking, it's

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.820
ready on their smartest place.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:51.430
Or when the assistant
asked in this example,

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.590
do you want me to send
this recipe to your phone?

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.170
The user said, yes, sure.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:57.610
How about next steps?

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.730
Can you add ingredients
to my shopping list?

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:08.990
And users expect or they
appreciate the intelligence

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:13.250
if an action can recognize
the user as an individual

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:17.780
and adapt the
experience over time.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:22.730
We heard a lot of a desire
to remember users have said,

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.130
to remember user's preferences.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:26.480
Now we are working on those.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.290
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:34.910
A simple adaptation is
about a welcome message

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.740
and the many actions
provide a introduction,

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.470
a welcome to my action.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.110
But they keep playing
that every time.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.500
So the message
becomes very old--

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.980
quickly become old
after one or two times.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.430
So we can think about how we
recognize that this is a--

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.140
you haven't tried
my actions before.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.530
Then they also want to be
able to interrupt maybe

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:01.220
some sessions, then switch
out and then go back.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:06.050
And the example would
be I am cooking.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.280
I'm using recipes.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.870
And now I'm switching out to
use the music and come back.

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:16.450
So resumption is very important.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:19.000
DANIELA CRUZ: Now, the last
insight we wanted to share

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.920
was a specific use case to
put all of this into context.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.320
And it's probably one of
the more surprising findings

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.323
that we came across
during our research.

00:32:28.323 --> 00:32:29.740
And it's that users
are leveraging

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.810
their digital
assistance when shopping

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.210
and that they want
to see you there.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.760
So knowing that people were
using digital assistants

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.590
in many different
parts of their lives,

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.040
we set out to understand how
they were using it specifically

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.160
to shopping.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.250
And this includes all
types of shopping,

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:48.370
so not necessarily just
making the transaction,

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:52.090
but everything along the
path to purchase funnel.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:54.622
What we found is that over
one third of assistant users

00:32:54.622 --> 00:32:56.080
are leveraging
their digital assets

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.750
and for at least one
shopping-related activity.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.210
Now, it's not necessarily
the transaction,

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.420
but it is everything from
researching products, creating

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.630
shopping lists, searching
for local information,

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:10.010
managing orders and more.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.280
And when we see where
they are doing it,

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.620
we're seeing people doing
these types of activities

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.290
with their digital assistants
across different places

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:20.560
like in the house, in
the car, on the go,

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.630
while at work, but
more interestingly,

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:25.310
when they're inside a store.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:27.620
So to understand
this further, we

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:31.580
ask users how they would like
to engage with third parties

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.620
and businesses on
their assistant.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.467
And what we found is the above.

00:33:35.467 --> 00:33:37.050
And I'm not going
to read all of them.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.508
But I'll just point out the
ones that are more interesting.

00:33:39.508 --> 00:33:42.830
So 45% told us they would like
to find business information.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.370
This is anything from knowing
store hours to locations.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.670
33% told us that they want
to receive personalized

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:52.850
information as your used
to their digital assistants

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.730
already catering precise
information to them.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.310
So it's going to be anything
from deals, promotions, or even

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.440
events that may be relevant.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:04.700
And 30% told us that they want
to access customer service

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.890
and support as this
platform already

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:11.040
starts [INAUDIBLE] for that
conversational interface.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.929
To put this in perspective,
this is a quote

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.389
we heard from one
of our users when

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.250
we were asking them
about how they use

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:18.810
their assistants for shopping.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:22.980
And they said, I was so crazy
busy one night last summer.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.530
I had a craving at 10:00 PM
for strawberry shortcake.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.989
I know this restaurant
closes at 11:00 PM,

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:30.690
so I asked my digital assistant
to get me strawberry shortcake

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.060
and it showed up
45 minutes later.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:33.800
It was that easy.

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:39.010
MEI LU: Yeah, this is
a quote from a user who

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:42.489
have a child retail
brand which offers

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:45.590
simple services
like finding a deal

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:48.159
or finding my store locations.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:51.520
And then this is the end to end,
he said that, wow, this is--

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.690
I'm liking the brand
better because it

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:57.020
offers simple ways for me to
make a connection with them.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.060
So how we design for the brand?

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.600
We love your brands,
and so do end users.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.110
Uses make an association
with a brand in many ways.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.610
It can be your logo.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:15.570
Can be your signature sound,
slogan, and the special color

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:18.720
schemes, your unique
buttons you have created,

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.510
and the special ways
you get things done.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:25.740
So a visual display provides
opportunities for you

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:32.280
to represent your brand in
more rich and prominent ways.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.520
Users also want to
see visual content

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:41.220
on the smart displays, including
images, videos, animations.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.560
A lack of a visual
content now I think

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.610
it is regarded as
lack of effort.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:52.260
So it will somehow breach user
trust and their perceptions

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.640
of your brand.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.450
Further, they expect action
through leverage of display

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:01.890
to provide suggestions,
guidance on what you offer

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:03.560
and how you can use the actions.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:14.250
Fun and personality only work
when the rest has been good.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:18.930
So that means the action
provide useful functionality

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:23.340
and also provide
smooth navigation.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:29.510
So as one user said
about a brand he liked,

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.250
he liked the functionality.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.910
And then it also
offers some fun facts.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:36.630
I like the fun facts
towards the end.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:40.710
But the second quote
is about the action

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.680
that did not provide
signature functionality,

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.360
uses the word
disappointing, and then

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:50.860
there is the, why am I going
to interest in fun facts.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:56.440
So yeah, it is important to
work on the functionality

00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:01.240
and the navigation first, and
then fun and the personality

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.730
will amplify the impact.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:09.910
Do not over-talk and do
not waste users time.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:14.920
And they like organic voices,
high quality organic voices,

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.850
or interesting accents that
compliment your services, just

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.090
like Italian accents
for a pizza action.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.160
DANIELA CRUZ: Now I know
you've heard a lot from us

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.430
today, but if you leave
here with just one thing,

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:34.030
we went out to the users, and
we asked them point-blank--

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.760
do you want to engage with
brands and third parties

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.290
on digital assistants?

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:42.250
And 80% of users
said that they would.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:46.070
MEI LU: In our studies we also
asked the user this question--

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:49.825
if there is a third
party sub action and then

00:37:49.825 --> 00:37:55.020
the Google equivalent assistant,
which version would you prefer?

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.750
Users actually told us
they prefer third parties

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:01.810
because you put more
skin in the game.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:10.210
So as key takeaways,
identify and enable

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:12.160
your signature functionality.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.760
Ask of yourself what's
that one thing that's

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.370
most for your users?

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:23.380
And then enable that signature
functionality very well.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:27.730
Do not break them across
different devices.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:32.110
And then actions,
apps, and the webs

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.020
are all part of a
people's journey

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.450
for getting things done.

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:40.630
Continuous experiences
or integrated experiences

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:45.640
across all different
products will divide users.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.720
Design and test,
design and test,

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.620
maybe design the test
multiple times for efficient

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.140
and guide the interaction flows.

00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.690
Do not let users drop off
during the conversations.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:04.140
And with the assistant
and with visual displays

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.200
with the personalities,
now you have new ways

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.340
to build your brand
or extend your brand.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:18.060
Maybe you can make them
friendly, funny, quirky,

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.780
sarcastic, or weird.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:28.170
I was from Portland, Oregon and
we love being weird over there.

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:32.110
So as a conclusion, I want
to emphasize two words--

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:35.040
small and trivial.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:40.170
We can start with small things
people do on a day-to-day basis

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:44.310
and make your action
integrated into daily routines.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:52.293
Then trivial, your action needs
to be trivial and effortless.

00:39:52.293 --> 00:39:53.210
DANIELA CRUZ: Awesome.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:56.330
So thank you guys all so much
for coming by and listening

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:57.410
to our talk.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:59.900
We'll be hanging out later
at the Assistant sandbox.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.610
I think it's open
for a few more hours

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.400
if you want to
stop by and say hi.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.450
Thank you.
