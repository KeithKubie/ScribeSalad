Episode 28: American Imperialism

00:00:01.299 --> 00:00:03.659
Hi, I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse
U.S. History and today we’re gonna talk

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.340
about a subject near and dear to my white,
male heart: imperialism.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.210
So, here at CrashCourse we occasionally try
to point out that the U.S., much as we hate

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.690
to admit it, is actually part of a larger
world.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.260
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, you mean like Alaska?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.680
No, Me from the Past, for reasons that you
will understand after your trip there before

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.289
your senior year of college, I do not acknowledge
the existence of Canada’s tail.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.439
No, I’m referring to all of the Green Parts
of Not-America and the period in the 19th

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.619
century when we thought, “Maybe we could
make all of those green parts like America,

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.199
but, you know, without rights and stuff.”

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:42.010
Intro
So, the late 19th and early 20th centuries

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.429
were a period of expansion and colonization
in Asia and Africa, mostly by European powers.

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.469
As you’ll know if you watched Crash Course
World History, imperialism has a long, long

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.320
history pretty much everywhere, so this round
of empire building is sometimes called, rather

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.589
confusingly, New Imperialism.

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.089
Because the U.S. acquired territories beyond
its continental boundaries in this period,

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.030
it’s relatively easy to fit American history
into this world history paradigm.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.440
But there’s also an argument that the United
States has always been an empire.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.340
From very early on, the European settlers
who became Americans were intent on pushing

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.420
westward and conquering territory.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.360
The obvious victims of this expansion/imperialism
were the Native Americans, but we can also

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.730
include the Mexicans who lost their sovereignty
after 1848.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.060
And if that doesn’t seem like an empire
to you, allow me to draw your attention to

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.000
the Russian Empire.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.120
Russians were taking control of territory
in Central Asia and Siberia and either absorbing

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.820
or displacing the native people who lived
there, which was the exact same thing that

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.820
we were doing.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.760
The empires of the late 19th and early 20th
centuries were different because they were

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.000
colonial in their own special way.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.030
Like, Europeans and Americans would rule other
places but they wouldn’t settle them and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.890
more or less completely displace the native
people there.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.830
(Well, except for you, Australia and New Zealand.)

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.780
American historians used to try to excuse
America’s acquisitions of a territorial

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.461
empire as something of an embarrassing mistake,
but that’s misleading because one of the

00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:04.650
primary causes of the phenomenon of American
imperialism was economics.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.650
We needed places to sell our amazing new products.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.190
And at the time, China actually had all of
the customers because apparently it was opposite

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.190
day.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.490
It’s also not an accident that the U.S.
began pursuing imperialism in earnest during

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.640
the 1890s, as this was, in many ways, a decade
of crisis in America.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.520
The influx of immigrants and the crowded cities
added to anxiety and concern over America’s

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.520
future.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.800
And then, to cap it all off, in 1893 a panic
caused by the failure of a British bank led

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.120
the U.S. into a horrible economic depression,
a great depression, but not The Great Depression.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.170
It did however feature 15,000 business failures
and 17% unemployment, so take that, 2008.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.240
According to American diplomatic historian
George Herring, imperialism was just what

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.090
the doctor ordered to help America get out
of its Depression depression.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.280
Other historians, notably Kristin Hoganson,
imply that America embarked on imperial adventures

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.700
partly so that American men could prove to
themselves how manly they were.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.850
You know, by joining the Navy and setting
sail for distant waters.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.190
In 1890, Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan published
“The Influence of Seapower upon History”

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.310
and argued that, to be a great power like
Great Britain, the U.S. needed to control

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.040
the seas and dominate international commerce.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.210
Tied into this push to become a maritime power
was the obsession with building a canal through

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.650
Central America and eventually the U.S. decided
that it should be built in Panama because

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.990
you know how else are we gonna get malaria.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.630
In order to protect this canal we would need
a man, a plan, a canal.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.630
Panama.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.540
Sorry, I just wanted to get the palindrome
in there somewhere.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.720
No we would actually need much more than a
man and a plan.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.599
We would need ships and in order to have a
functioning two-ocean navy, we would need

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.599
colonies.

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:38.599
Why?

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.130
Because the steamships at the time were powered
by coal and in order to re-fuel they needed

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.130
coal depots.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.940
I mean, I suppose we could have, like, rented
harbor space, but why rent when you can conquer?

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.140
Also, nationalism and the accompanying pride
in one’s “country” was a worldwide phenomenon

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.720
to which the U.S. was not immune.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.060
I mean, it’s no accident that the 1890s
saw Americans begin to recite the pledge of

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.540
allegiance and celebrate Flag Day, and what
better way to instill national pride than

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.580
by flying the stars and stripes over … Guam.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.660
So pre-Civil War attempts to expand beyond
what we now know as the continental United

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.130
States included our efforts to annex Canada,
which were sadly unsuccessful, and also filibustering,

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.199
which before it meant a senator talking until
he or she had to stop to pee was a thing where

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.879
we tried to take over Central America to spread
slavery.

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:25.819
But, the idea of taking Cuba persisted into
the late 19th century because it is close

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:27.259
and also beautiful.

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.659
The Grant administration wanted to annex it
and the Dominican Republic, but Congress demurred.

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.110
But we did succeed in purchasing Canada’s
tail.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.460
You can see how I feel about that.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.569
To be fair, discovery of gold in the Yukon
made Seward’s icebox seem like less of a

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.460
Seward’s folly and it did provide coaling
stations in the Pacific.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.689
But we could have had rum and Caribbean beaches.

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.999
Ugh, Stan, all this talk about how much I
hate Alaska has me overheated, I gotta take

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.590
off my shirt.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.590
Ughhh.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.249
Waste of my life.

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.300
So hard to take off a shirt dramatically.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.300
I’m angry.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.259
Anyway, coal stations in the Pacific were
important because in 1854 we “opened”

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:07.749
Japan to American trade by sending a flotilla
of threatening black ships under Matthew Perry.

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:09.529
No Stan, not that Matthew Perry.

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:10.529
You know better.

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.219
By far, America’s best piece of imperial
business before 1898 was Hawaii.

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:19.389
Like, I like oil and gold as much as the next
guy but Hawaii has pineapples and also had

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.629
sugar, which was grown on American owned plantations
by Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and native

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:24.629
workers.

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.909
Treaties between the U.S. and the Hawaiian
governments exempted this sugar from tariffs,

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.580
and America also had established a naval base
at Pearl Harbor, which seemed like a really

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.199
good idea...then.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.249
We eventually annexed Hawaii in 1898 and this
meant that it could eventually become a state,

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.970
which it did in 1959, two years before Barack
Obama was born in Kenya.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.300
And this leads us nicely to the high tide
of American imperialism, the Spanish-American-Cuban-Fillipino

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.300
War.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.189
The war started out because native Cubans
were revolting against Spain, which was holding

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:55.100
on to Cuba for dear life as the remnant of
a once-great empire.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.550
The Cubans’ fight for independence was brutal.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.210
95,000 Cubans died from disease and malnutrition
after Spanish general Valeriano Weyler herded

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.990
Cubans into concentration camps.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.909
For this Weyler was called “Butcher” in
the American yellow press, which sold a lot

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.169
of newspapers on the backs of stories about
his atrocities.

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.449
And at last we come to President William McKinley
who responded cautiously, with a demand that

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.680
Spain get out of Cuba or face war.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.150
Now Spain knew that it couldn’t win a war
with the U.S. but, as George Herring put it,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.389
they “preferred the honor of war to the
ignominy of surrender.”

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.719
Let that be a lesson to you.

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:28.719
Always choose ignominy.

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:33.889
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.210
The rules here are simple.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.860
I guess the author of the Mystery Document.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.410
I’m either right or I get shocked.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.099
Alright, let’s see what we’ve got today.

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:44.289
With such a conflict waged for years in an
island so near us and with which our people

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.060
have such trade and business relations; when
the lives and liberty of our citizens are

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.240
in constant danger and their property destroyed
and themselves ruined; where our trading vessels

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.439
are liable to seizure and are seized at our
very door by warships of a foreign nation,

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:03.939
the expeditions of filibustering that we are
powerless to prevent altogether -- all these

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:08.439
and others that I need not mention, with the
resulting strained relations, are a constant

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:13.589
menace to our peace, and compel us to keep
on a semiwar footing with a nation with which

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:14.589
we are at peace.

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:15.589
Thank you, Stan.

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:18.089
This is obviously President William McKinley’s
war message to Congress.

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:21.319
You can tell it’s a war message because
it includes the word “peace” more than

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:22.319
the word “war.”

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:25.599
By the way, it’s commonly thought that the
President McKinley asked Congress for a declaration

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:27.749
of war, he didn’t; he let Congress take
the lead.

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:31.149
That’s the only time that’s ever happened
in all of American history, which would be

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:33.830
more impressive if we had declared war more
than 5 times.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.099
So, the document shows us that, at least according
to McKinley, we officially went to war for

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:41.569
American peace of mind and to end economic
uncertainty.

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:44.289
It was not to gain territory, at least not
in Cuba.

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:45.289
How do we know?

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:50.409
Because Congress also passed the Teller Amendment,
which forswore any U.S. annexation of Cuba,

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:54.119
perhaps because representatives of the U.S.
sugar industry like Colorado’s Senator Henry

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:57.879
Teller feared competition from sugar produced
in an American Cuba.

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:58.879
Or maybe not.

00:07:58.879 --> 00:07:59.879
But probably so.

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:02.350
Also not the cause of the war was the sinking
of the USS Maine.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.999
The battleship which had been in Havana’s
harbor to protect American interests sank

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:10.819
after an explosion on February 15, 1898 killing
266 sailors.

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:15.619
Now, most historians chalk up the sinking
to an internal explosion and not to Spanish

00:08:15.619 --> 00:08:19.960
sabotage, but that didn’t stop Americans
from blaming the Spanish with their memorable

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.849
meme: “Remember the Maine, to hell with
Spain.”

00:08:22.849 --> 00:08:24.129
Let’s go to the Thoughtbubble.

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:28.149
The actual war was one of the most successful
in U.S. history, especially if you measure

00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:31.689
success by brevity and relative paucity of
deaths.

00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:36.659
Secretary of State John Hay called it a “splendid
little war” and in many ways it was.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.959
Fighting lasted about 4 months and fewer than
400 Americans were killed in combat, although

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:43.539
5,000 died of, wait for it, disease.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.210
Stupid disease, always ruining everything.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.839
There weren’t a ton of battles but those
that happened got an inordinate amount of

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:53.650
press coverage, like the July attack on San
Juan Hill at the Cuban city of Santiago, led

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.410
by future president Theodore Roosevelt.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.660
While it was a successful battle, the real
significance is that it furthered Roosevelt’s

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.660
career.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.959
He returned a hero, promptly became Governor
of New York and by 1900 was McKinley’s vice

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:05.959
president.

00:09:05.959 --> 00:09:08.300
Which was a good job to have because McKinley
would eventually be assassinated.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.680
A more important battle was that of Manila
Bay in which commodore George Dewey destroyed

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.870
a tiny Spanish fleet and took the Philippines.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.750
This battle took place in May of 1898, well
before the attack on Cuba, which strongly

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:24.740
suggests that a war that was supposedly about
supporting Cuban independence was really about

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.040
something else.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.300
And what was that something else?

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.300
Oh right.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.480
A territorial empire.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.779
As a result of the war, the U.S. got a bunch
of new territories, notably the Philippines,

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:35.480
Puerto Rico and Guam.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.220
We also used the war as an opportunity to
annex Hawaii to protect our ships that would

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.760
be steaming toward the Philippines.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.540
We didn’t annex Cuba, but we didn’t let
it become completely independent, either.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.660
The Platt Amendment in the Cuban Constitution
authorized American military intervention

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.190
whenever it saw fit and gave us a permanent
lease for a naval base at Guantanamo Bay.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.190
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.029
So, Cuba and Puerto Rico were gateways to
Latin American markets.

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:59.540
Puerto Rico was particularly useful as a naval
station.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.759
Hawaii, Guam, and especially the Philippines
opened up access to China.

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:07.639
American presence in China was bolstered by
our contribution of about 3,000 troops to

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:11.550
the multinational force that helped put down
the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.529
But in the Philippines, where Americans had
initially been welcome, opinion soon changed

00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:20.180
after it became clear that Americans were
there to stay and exercise control.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.240
Emiliano Aguinaldo, leader of the Filipino
rebellion against Spain, quickly turned against

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.730
the U.S. because his real goal was independence
and it appeared the U.S. would not provide

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.730
it.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.889
The resulting Philippine War lasted 4 years,
from 1899-1903.

00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:35.899
And 4,200 Americans were killed as well as
over 100,000 Filipinos.

00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:41.139
The Americans committed atrocities, including
putting Filipinos in concentration camps,

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:43.670
torturing prisoners, rape, and executing civilians.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:48.690
And much of this was racially motivated and
news of these atrocities helped to spur anti-imperialist

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.250
sentiment at home, with Mark Twain being one
of the most outspoken critics.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.260
Now, there was some investment in modernization
in the Philippines, in railroads, schools,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.870
and public health, but the interests of the
local people were usually subordinated to

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.279
those of the wealthy.

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:05.509
So, American imperialism in short looked like
most other imperialism.

00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:10.079
So Constitution nerds will remember that the
U.S. Constitution has no provision for colonies,

00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:13.550
only territory that will eventually be incorporated
as states.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.240
Congress attempted to deal with this issue
by passing the Foraker Act in 1900.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.380
This law declared that Puerto Rico would be
an insular territory; its inhabitants would

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.480
be citizens of Puerto Rico, not the United
States and there would be no path to statehood.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.620
But this wasn’t terribly constitutional.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.029
Congress did extend U.S. citizenship to Puerto
Ricans in 1917.

00:11:31.029 --> 00:11:35.339
Now it’s a commonwealth with its own government
that has no voice in U.S. Congress or presidential

00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:39.019
elections and no control over its own defense
or environmental policy.

00:11:39.019 --> 00:11:42.540
The Philippines were treated similarly to
Puerto Rico, in a series of cases between

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.649
1901 and 1904 collectively called the Insular
Cases.

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:47.700
But Hawaii was treated differently.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.839
Because it had a sizeable population of American
settlers who happened to be white.

00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:55.921
Ergo, it became a traditional territory with
a path to statehood because white people and

00:11:55.921 --> 00:11:56.921
also pineapples.

00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:58.899
Now let’s briefly talk about anti-imperialism.

00:11:58.899 --> 00:12:02.600
There were lots of people who objected to
imperialism on racial grounds, arguing that

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.600
it might lead to, like, diversity.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.089
But there were also non-racist anti-imperialists
who argued that empire itself with its political

00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:13.600
domination of conquered people was incompatible
with democracy, which, to be fair, it is.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.750
The Democratic Party, which had supported
intervention in Cuba, in 1900 opposed the

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.589
Philippine War in its platform.

00:12:19.589 --> 00:12:22.949
Some Progressives opposed imperialism too
because they believed that America should

00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:24.570
focus on its domestic problems.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.700
Yet those who supported imperialism were just
as forceful.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.210
Among the most vocal was Indiana Senator Albert
Beveridge who argued that imperialism was

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.110
benevolent and would bring “a new day of
freedom.”

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.560
But, make no mistake, underneath it all, imperialism
was all about trade.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.709
According to Beveridge, America’s commerce
“must be with Asia.

00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:47.939
The Pacific is our ocean … Where shall we
turn for consumers of our surplus?

00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:50.129
Geography answers the question.

00:12:50.129 --> 00:12:52.160
China is our natural customer.”

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.390
In the end, imperialism was really driven
by economic necessity.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:13:00.910
In 1902, Brooks Adams predicted in his book
The New Empire that the U.S. would soon “outweigh

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.250
any single empire, if not all empires combined.”

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.199
Within 20 years America would be the world’s
leading economic power.

00:13:08.199 --> 00:13:12.140
We didn’t have the most overseas territory,
but ultimately that didn’t matter.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.459
Now, the reasons for imperialism, above all
the quest for markets for American goods,

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:21.750
would persist long after imperialism became
recognized as antithetical to freedom and

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.750
democracy.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.959
And we would continue to struggle to reconcile
our imperialistic urges with our ideals about

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:29.990
democracy until...now.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.990
Thanks for watching.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.990
I’ll see you next week.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.760
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.459
Our script supervisor is Meredith Danko.

00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:36.800
The associate producer is Danica Johnson.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.589
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, Rosianna Rojas, and

00:13:40.589 --> 00:13:41.589
myself.

00:13:41.589 --> 00:13:43.040
And our graphics team is Thought Café.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.690
Every week there’s a new caption for the
libertage.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.680
You can suggest captions in comments where
you can also ask questions about today’s

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.999
video that will be answered by our team of
historians.

00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:53.199
Thanks for watching Crash Course and as we
say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome.

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:56.930
This is the part where Stan gets nervous,
like, is he gonna go this way or this way

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:57.930
or this way?

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:58.930
I’m going this way.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:58.931
