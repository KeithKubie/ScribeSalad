CHUO-LING CHANG: Welcome.

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.460
Today we're going to talk
about streaming your game

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.700
to reach new users.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.670
This is an exciting
project at Google

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.060
that helps game
developers reach many more

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.040
users beyond your install base.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.935
And in the next 45 minutes, I'll
show you what we have built,

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:22.540
I'll explain to you-- or we'll
explain to you-- how it works,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.480
and also tell you
as a game developer

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.205
how you can participate.

00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:30.510
And in the end, we also
have time for questions.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.790
So let's start.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.440
PETER TAN: So hi, I'm Peter.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.680
As a game developer you have put
tons of effort into your game,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.610
and finally it's
available on Google Play.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.840
Now it's time to
let the world know.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.080
There are many ways
and opportunities

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.560
to get users to play your games.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.500
And Google has been [INAUDIBLE]
in helping developers

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.520
to achieve that.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.590
For example, many
people go to Google Play

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.000
where they can browse
categories, top charts,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.130
trendings to find
a game they love.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.590
Users can also search for
specific games, or a category

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.300
like car racing, where
a grid of relevant games

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.010
will show up on top
of the search results.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.810
And in Apps, Google
offers various formats

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.800
such as banner ads,
interstitials, and videos

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.490
to showcase your games.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.450
So for all these various moments
when users are on mobile,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.380
we try to grab users'
attention, give them

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.050
enough information
about your games,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.100
and then convince them to
click this green button which

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.550
I'm sure you are all
very familiar with.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.780
Now is a decision time for users
to click, to install or not

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.140
to install.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.700
Personally I'd like to
play, to try many games.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.590
And since most of
the games are free,

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.750
I can just install games,
play the game for a while.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.020
If I don't like it, I can
uninstall and then move on

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.530
to the next one.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.690
However, this install, try,
uninstall process is kind

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.260
of tedious and time consuming.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.620
Even users are just one tap away
from trying your awesome games,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.390
they might not have time
to wait for the download.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.510
They may not want to
let the games eat up

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.140
their phone storage.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.920
For whatever reasons, metrics
generally show less than 10%

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.490
of users who visit the
game page are going

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.750
to click this Install button.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.310
And as you can imagine, if the
button comes with a price tag,

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.120
it's not even possible for
users to try your games.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.580
So we have been
thinking, what else

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.410
can we do to make users
understand your game better

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.120
before installation?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.850
What else can we
do to make users

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.850
feel this is a game they'd
really like before downloading?

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.770
What if we show
users this Try Now

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.160
button which makes
the process of trying

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.580
the game as fast and as easy
as watching a video on YouTube.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.450
Our solution is App Streaming.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.680
CHUO-LING CHANG: So
what is App Streaming?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.490
To enable this "try
now" experience,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.130
instead of asking our user
to first wait for a download,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.240
we actually pre-install the
app in a virtual Android

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.300
device running in the cloud.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.810
So as soon as the user
clicks on the Try Now button,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.180
we start again in the cloud,
and the audio and visual content

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.660
generated by the
game is then captured

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.160
and streamed all the way
down to the user's device.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.270
This is similar to how
videos are streamed

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.750
on services like YouTube.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.620
And in addition, to let the
user interact with the game,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.410
we also capture user
controls such as the touch

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.310
gestures, and then stream
them back up to the cloud,

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.680
so that the game can update
its content accordingly.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.540
This two-way
exchange is carefully

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.060
designed to run fast
and smooth, such

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.029
that the user can enjoy the game
as if it was installed locally

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.760
on the device.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.460
Now, let me give you a
more concrete example.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.470
Today in the Google
App on Android,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.590
let's say our user Jen
searches for Candy Crush

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.370
by typing it into
the Google search

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.470
box on the top of your
Android home screen.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.235
In the Search Result
page, in addition to

00:04:43.235 --> 00:04:46.020
the Install button
you are familiar with,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.400
there is now also
a "try now" option.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.470
As soon as Jen clicks
on the Try Now button,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.690
she's immediately
launched into the game.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.610
And at this point, the
screen is already generated

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.840
and streamed down
from the cloud.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.680
And Jen can start
playing right away.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.510
And some of you might have
noticed that in the App Stream

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.640
experience, there's this
additional G button that

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.520
actually floats
on top of the game

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.240
and can be moved
around in case it

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.690
covers some important
elements in the game.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.850
At any moment during
the game play,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.660
Jen can click on this G button
which gives her more options.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.180
For example, Jen can
choose to install

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.540
the game from Google Play.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.890
Or she can go back to the
previous Search Result page.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.910
Or she can simply get back to
the game and continue playing.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.930
We currently limit the length
of this trial experience

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.800
in Search to up to 10 minutes.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.740
And at the end up
this 10-minute trial,

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.870
Jen will be presented again with
an option to install the game.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.700
By now, she should be
very familiar with what

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.640
this game is about.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.520
And if she likes the game,
if she wants to play it more,

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.930
she can then install the
game on her phone from here.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.499
This feature is already live
in the Google App on Android.

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:24.040
And we are already
streaming hundreds

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.320
of games including popular
titles like Candy Crush, Angry

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.610
Birds, and Cut the Rope.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.555
So if you have an Android
phone, please give it a

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:35.655
try after the session.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.840
PETER TAN: So in
addition to Search,

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.500
we also integrate App
Streaming into a new app

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.440
format called Trial Run Apps.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.250
Let's look at how
the product works.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.210
Our user Jen is playing a
game called Bears versus Art.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.145
When she finishes one level
and goes to the next level,

00:06:59.145 --> 00:07:02.400
her ads pop up.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.175
And she notices that this is
a ad about game called 1010!

00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:08.335
Puzzle.

00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:10.360
It looks like it
has a good rating.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.630
And she can try the game by
clicking the Try Now button.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.411
So she does.

00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:18.260
The 1010!

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.460
Puzzle will be
launched instantly.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.250
And she can play the game,
get a pretty good feeling

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.880
about what the game is about.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.600
And when the trial is
over, she has the option

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.862
to install the game.

00:07:31.862 --> 00:07:34.690
Next slide.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.110
So if she likes the game, she
can install in Google Play.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.560
We launched these trial run
ads in beta six months ago.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.950
And in our early
tests, an advertiser

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.250
has seen a 20% increase
in conversion rate.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.290
In addition, since users
are getting a test of games

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.300
before going through
the download process,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.320
we think the
developer can attract

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.870
users who are more
engaged because users

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.510
have chosen a game based on
their experience in a trial.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.840
CHUO-LING CHANG: Now it's
time to show some live demos.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.164
So let's do this.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.620
So can everyone see the screen?

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.330
So what I'm going to demo is
App Streaming in Google Search.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.169
So let's say I heard
about this Angry Birds

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.440
game called Angry Birds Rio.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.539
So I look it up by typing it
into the Google Search box.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.960
There's now this
"try now" option.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.660
So I click on Try Now.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.660
I'm already in the game.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.660
And you can see that
there's a bar [? glow ?]

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.055
saying App Streaming
powered by Google.

00:08:56.055 --> 00:08:56.930
[MUSIC FROM THE GAME]

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:02.500
And at this point, you
hear the audio, too.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.390
The user can already
interact with the game.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:10.495
I can just go directly into
stage one and start playing.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.810
You can see that I
can already move =.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.415
And also multi-touch works.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.360
Let me try to do this.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.610
[BIRDS CAWING AND CRATES
 BREAKING]

00:09:41.992 --> 00:09:43.200
So let me try one more level.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.060
I think you get the idea.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.220
So I like this game very much,
I want to have it on my phone.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.600
What do I do?

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.260
I click on this button, and
then I can just-- oh, sorry.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.630
I click on this button.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.540
I can just install
the game right here.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.920
And this is how it works,
how App Streaming works

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.000
inside Google Search.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.410
PETER TAN: Let's also look at
how the App Streaming works

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.605
for trial run ads.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.980
So what you are seeing
here is an interstitial ad

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.056
for a game Two Dots.

00:10:25.056 --> 00:10:26.680
And just like all
the interstitial ads,

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.470
it has a pretty creative.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.270
It has a name and a rating.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.460
But now, I also have a Try
Now button here I can tap.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.840
And instead of watching
a video ad passively,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.200
I'm now dropped
right into a game

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.205
and I can fully
interact with the game.

00:10:50.726 --> 00:10:52.600
And it looks like the
first part of the game,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.970
just like a lot of
games, is a tutorial.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.750
Which is great,
because now I don't

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.510
need to read a description
from the Google Play.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.730
I can just follow the
tutorial like this

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.890
and then learn how
to play, and then

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.165
decide if I like
the game or not.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.560
And actually, I already played
this tutorial like 100 times,

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.180
so I got pretty good at it.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.730
And you may notice
that for ads, there's

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:27.020
also a timer on top
of the screen which

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.330
reminds users how much time
you have for the trial.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.340
Time's up.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.580
And then the user will
have the opportunity

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:52.820
to tap Install and
go to the Play Store,

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.147
and then download the game.

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:55.980
So this is our demo.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.350
CHUO-LING CHANG: So
now let's come back

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.420
to talk more about how
App Streaming works.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.290
First we run an army of
Android virtual machines

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.282
on Google Cloud Platform,
which is Google's public cloud

00:12:14.282 --> 00:12:18.530
offering that is rapidly
expanding around the globe.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.980
So you can think of these
Android virtual machines

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.030
as running the actual
Android operating

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:27.070
system on virtualized
CPUs in the cloud.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.000
And just like the Linux
VMs and Windows VMs

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.260
you usually see on
Google Cloud Platform

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.480
or any other
[? elastic ?] clouds,

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.480
these Android VMs can be
quickly spinned up or torn down

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.570
on demand.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.780
And that is how we
scale App Streaming

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.970
to serve Google users.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.300
The Android VMs currently
run Android Marshmallow.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.800
And we regularly
apply system patches

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.740
to make sure that
these games always

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.703
run in up-to-date environments
for best performance.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.050
Now as you can
imagine, in the cloud

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.350
these Android VMs do not
have physical touch panels

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.310
or physical displays
attached to them.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.720
In order to support
device input, what we do

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.210
is we customize these
Androids in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.400
abstraction layer so that they
can take virtual input events

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.950
streamed from the
user's physical device

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.880
all the way across the internet.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.020
And similarly, to
support device output,

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.760
in the VM we capture the
rendering, frame buffer,

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.350
and audio samples and code
them into video bit stream,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.930
and send it down to the user.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.470
To deliver a fully
interactive experience,

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:52.470
this additional two-way latency
introduced by App Streaming

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.350
needs to be as low as possible.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.030
So we actually spent a lot
of efforts streamlining

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.090
every single component
in this system,

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.030
all the way from
the mobile client,

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.290
the network, and also
the cloud servers.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.330
In our current implementation,
the processing time

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.300
and buffering time on the client
and on the server combined

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.220
is only 60 milliseconds.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.880
And in the US, the
network roundtrip time

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.190
from the user to a Google
Call Phone Data Center

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:27.260
is typically around
20 to 40 milliseconds.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.340
That means in total, App
Streaming only adds up to 60

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.290
plus 40-- 100
milliseconds of latency.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.910
That's 1/10 of a second.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.270
And as you all saw
earlier in the demos,

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.690
this number is low enough
such that we can still

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.845
deliver an enjoyable
mobile gaming experience.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.690
As you all know, in
streaming applications

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.240
network conditions can
have a very big impact

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.900
on the quality of service.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.880
And network conditions can vary.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.160
It not only varies from
connection to connection, even

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.750
within a single connection
the network condition

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.590
can vary significantly
over time.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.910
To cope with network condition
variations, what we do

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:23.060
is we adapt the video
quality in real time,

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.290
to the live network conditions.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.480
For example, we adapt
the video bit rate

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.210
from around one megabits
per second all the way

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.940
to more than five
megabits per second.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.440
And similarly, we also
adapt the video frame rate

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.840
from around 15 frames per
second to the regular 60 frames

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.300
per second.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.900
We also adapt a level of
protection against packet loss,

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.000
based on how lossy the
network is in real time.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.500
And with all of these
adaptation efforts,

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.490
we're able to run App
Streaming smoothly

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.813
on a variety of Wi-Fi
and 4G cellular networks.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.310
PETER TAN: I hope by now you
feel excited about this novel

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.210
approach to reach new users.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.770
So how do you get started?

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.330
Very simple.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.530
Please go to
g.co/appstreaminggames

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.600
and answer a few simple
questions on the phone

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.350
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.690
And that's it.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.390
The rest of the work is on us.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:33.010
We will use the same APK
you publish on Google Play

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.980
and create an App
Streaming experience.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.560
And while technically you do
not need to modify the APK,

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.920
please keep in mind that
this is a time-limited trial.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.870
Meaning that offering an
intuitive, fun experience

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.540
in the first few
minutes is going

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.110
to be an important thing for
users and keep users engaged.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.170
We think this is a good design
in general for all the games,

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.500
so hopefully your game
already does this.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.880
And for trial run ads, if
you have a complicated game

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.500
or something that's very
difficult to showcase

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.800
in a limited time,
you have the option

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.960
to provide us a custom APK.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.099
For example, you can start
a game from level 36,

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:18.250
or you can start a game with a
character with very fancy gear.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.760
So there's option there
for the trial run ads.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.319
CHUO-LING CHANG: So
finally, some key takeaways.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:31.610
As a game developer, you can
now reach many more users

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.270
beyond your install
base with the "try now"

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.420
functionality powered
by Google App Streaming.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.290
Users no longer need
to wait for a download

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.880
before they can
experience your game.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.490
And this removes
a lot of friction

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.860
in getting high-value users
with better engagement.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.295
We're already streaming
hundreds of games

00:17:51.295 --> 00:17:53.670
in Google Search and Ads.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.740
So to also get
your game streamed,

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.710
please sign up at
g.co/appstreaminggames.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.600
And you can even get it done
without a single line of code

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.150
change.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.900
And with that, we thank
you for your attention.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.590
But again, please go sign up,
and then also give it a try

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.710
on your phone.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:14.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.440
Thank you.

00:18:22.212 --> 00:18:24.670
CHUO-LING CHANG: So next we'll
open the floor to questions.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.890
And our Product
Manager [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.164
will join us on stage.

00:18:28.164 --> 00:18:30.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can you
guys go to the center,

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.562
please, where the microphone
is and line up for Q&amp;A, please?

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.250
AUDIENCE: So two questions.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.580
What about native
games and 3D games?

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:54.240
And can you launch into a
specific point in a game?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.560
CHUO-LING CHANG: So let me
first answer the first one.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.140
Native and 3D games, I mean,
the games you actually saw

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.220
were native and 3D or--
OK, the short answer

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.730
is we do support
native and 3D games.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.460
And currently we support
all graphics [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.380
We run graphics
[INAUDIBLE] in the cloud.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.470
So 3D games work.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.650
That's the answer.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:13.650
And the second question?

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.255
AUDIENCE: The full
OpenGL support.

00:19:15.255 --> 00:19:17.000
What about Vulcan support?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.560
CHUO-LING CHANG: OpenGL, yes.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.800
Not Vulcan yet.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.843
Because we also run
Android Marshmallow,

00:19:23.843 --> 00:19:25.700
so Vulcan is not there yet.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.830
AUDIENCE: And then launching
to a specific point,

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.663
say, an interesting
part of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:29.663 --> 00:19:32.940
PETER TAN: Yeah, so right now,
to launch to a specific point

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.440
will require you
provide us a custom APK.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.680
We don't have a way
to take a stock APK

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.230
and then launch to
a specific point.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.230
AUDIENCE: There's not
like a custom [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.190
PETER TAN: However, technically,
if you can provide us, say,

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.710
a deep link, then
we can possibly

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.714
use a deep link to jump into
a specific game you like.

00:19:51.714 --> 00:19:52.630
AUDIENCE: That's good.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.130
OK.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:53.750
Thank you.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.250
CHUO-LING CHANG:
So deep links work.

00:19:57.749 --> 00:19:58.540
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.120
What kind of metrics
do you provide?

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.800
Like how long
people do the trial?

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.675
What conversion?

00:20:02.675 --> 00:20:04.540
Do you guys expose
any of that data

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.760
so we can see how
well it's performing?

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.350
CHUO-LING CHANG: We don't yet,
but we do have the numbers.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.640
And we are looking into how
we can share these numbers

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.664
with our partners.

00:20:13.664 --> 00:20:15.080
And that's also
one of the reasons

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.750
we are asking all of you to
sign up and give us feedback,

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.440
so we can figure
out together what

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.596
numbers you are looking for.

00:20:23.596 --> 00:20:24.262
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:20:24.262 --> 00:20:26.214
I have two questions.

00:20:26.214 --> 00:20:32.774
The first is, can I try
the game, like "try now"

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:34.115
multiple times?

00:20:34.115 --> 00:20:35.009
PETER TAN: Yes.

00:20:35.009 --> 00:20:35.910
AUDIENCE: Yes?

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:40.164
And every trial has
the same time limit?

00:20:40.164 --> 00:20:41.580
CHUO-LING CHANG:
So right now this

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.890
is a number we currently set.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:47.430
So in Search, like the use case
I demo-ed inside the Google

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:52.730
App, the limit is set to 10
minutes per session per trial.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.310
And for apps--

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:59.150
PETER TAN: So for apps, I think
developer can choose the time.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.940
It really depends on the game.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.760
Some games, user can get a
full picture within 30 seconds.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.390
But some game might be 90
seconds or 120 seconds.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:08.966
I think there's an option there.

00:21:08.966 --> 00:21:09.958
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.247
Thank you.

00:21:12.247 --> 00:21:13.580
AUDIENCE: Brilliant [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.000
Really, really, really good.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.120
PETER TAN: Oh, thank you,

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.620
AUDIENCE: Any
technical restrictions

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.200
on things like Play Services,
logins, or fair play plugins,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.910
or that kind of stuff?

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.930
First thing our
games generally do

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.080
is we'll do sign-ins,
connect to Facebook,

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.330
download loads of stuff.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.017
How does the game start up?

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: So right
now when users stream,

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.060
it's done anonymously, where
if they would like to sign in,

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:44.840
they can still enter their
username and sign in like that.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.347
We're looking into
doing integration

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:48.430
where, at least for Google
Play Games integration,

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.475
the user gets
automatically signed

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:51.683
in when they start streaming.

00:21:55.854 --> 00:21:56.520
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.730
I'm doing virtual reality games.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:04.672
And I wonder if my
game will be downloaded

00:22:04.672 --> 00:22:10.780
and the user later decides to
install it, in emerging markets

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:18.180
will this require to re-download
again all the activity code

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.740
and all assets again
on mobile internet?

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.770
How about saving bandwidth?

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.240
CHUO-LING CHANG: Currently, what
we stream down are all pixels.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.250
So we don't stream any assets.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.710
So if the user do want
to install the app,

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.690
he needs to do the
whole downloading again.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:41.170
But there is some possibility
that we can integrate these two

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:41.990
directly together.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.620
Like while streaming we
can do partial downloading.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.510
But this is something we can
look into, but we haven't.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.320
AUDIENCE: The question is these
games only work with the games

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.334
that have expansion files?

00:22:58.334 --> 00:23:00.750
So actually when you're running
it on the virtual machine,

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.270
you're running what you have
already on the console there?

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.576
Or it can also work
for the kind of games

00:23:06.576 --> 00:23:11.630
that we are using with our
CDM to download the content?

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.700
PETER TAN: Do you
mean the OBD file?

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.550
The extension file?

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:14.900
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.025
When you're running it on
the virtual machine, what

00:23:17.025 --> 00:23:19.315
you are running is
the APK plus the OBD.

00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:20.856
PETER TAN: Yes, we
also run with OBD.

00:23:20.856 --> 00:23:22.720
AUDIENCE: What happens
with the kind of games,

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.094
in example, in
the company I work

00:23:24.094 --> 00:23:27.600
for, we have some APKs
that when you download it,

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.625
then we go through
a-- an installer

00:23:29.625 --> 00:23:31.000
thinks that we
are not using OBD.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.060
We are downloading the data
from the CDM that we have.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.310
PETER TAN: So I think right
now those kind of games,

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.780
meaning that after
the first launch

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.690
they might want to download
additional file or something.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:48.260
And some type of games that
would take maybe a minute

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.370
or even more to download.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:53.260
Those kind of games currently
doesn't work with us.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.380
But we are also looking
to that possible solution.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.080
For example, pre-fetch or
pre-download [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:04.133
before take a snapshot
and serving to user.

00:24:04.133 --> 00:24:04.674
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:04.674 --> 00:24:07.337
Thanks.

00:24:07.337 --> 00:24:08.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.010
I have three questions.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.970
What's the minimum
bandwidth for streaming?

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.960
CHUO-LING CHANG: So
the current system

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.340
is set to 1 to 1.5
megabits per second.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.110
And the fast one is over five.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.030
So there's this range.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:28.190
AUDIENCE: And how
about the maximum users

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.620
can try their streaming
at the same time?

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.810
Because there are lots of
users around the world.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:38.494
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:38.494 --> 00:24:39.160
PETER TAN: Yeah.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.170
So in terms of computing power,
there's always a limit, right?

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.460
But because we are
running on the Google Data

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.340
Center and Google
Cloud Platform,

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.490
so our theoretical
limit will be the limit

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:55.180
of whatever the Google Cloud
Platform can provide to us.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.250
AUDIENCE: And the final
question is, is the user trial

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:04.760
run currently online?

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.011
PETER TAN: Yes, it's live.

00:25:06.011 --> 00:25:07.260
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.135
PETER TAN: Thank you.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.220
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.680
Just a question around the
degradation of the networks.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.020
So like with video there's
dynamic adaptive streaming.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.100
Do you guys do something
similar to make sure

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.510
that the experience
is consistent?

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.312
So if my network
quality gets worse,

00:25:27.312 --> 00:25:30.740
does the streaming
quality get worse?

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.690
CHUO-LING CHANG: Yes,
we do something similar.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.250
So if you do have a low
bandwidth, the video you see,

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.749
the stream app you see will
be slightly more pixilated.

00:25:39.749 --> 00:25:41.290
The firmware might
be slightly lower,

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.240
but we make sure the
experience is still

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.370
smooth enough so the user
still can enjoy the game.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:49.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.860
AUDIENCE: Good job.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.710
Two questions.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:56.680
One is, does the app
know it's being streamed?

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.670
And the second question is, does
this work with app indexing?

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.160
CHUO-LING CHANG: I guess
I'll take the first part.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:12.270
So the app, when we start the
activity with normal Android

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.560
intent, and currently we
do provide a special intent

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.780
to tell the app you are in
the App Streaming experience.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.660
So if developer really want
to know for referral purpose,

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.490
for tracking purpose,
there's a way for them

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.470
to know this is a game
or this is a traffic

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.400
coming from the App Streaming.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.080
AUDIENCE: So we could use that
to customize the experience

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.260
and try it out.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.320
CHUO-LING CHANG:
Yes, that's possible.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.960
AUDIENCE: A related question
is on that app indexing,

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.500
because if the search
results can take you

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.100
straight into a special
section of the app,

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.122
does that work right now?

00:26:46.122 --> 00:26:47.193
PETER TAN: It does.

00:26:47.193 --> 00:26:48.026
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:55.720
PETER TAN: I think if your app
or games support app indexing,

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.157
I think it would also work
on our streaming experience.

00:26:59.157 --> 00:26:59.990
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.490
Thanks.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.729
PETER TAN: I think we are good.

00:27:07.729 --> 00:27:09.770
CHUO-LING CHANG: So if
there's no more questions,

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.610
I mean, we'll still be
here, hang out with you.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.459
And please come to us if
you have more questions,

00:27:15.459 --> 00:27:17.000
or you want to have
more discussions.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.950
PETER TAN: And we
also have a phone,

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:19.780
so if you want to just
try it personally,

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.340
we can show you the phone.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.330
And we'll also be available
in the Search Sandbox.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.650
So find us over in the
Search Sandbox outside.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:28.150
Thank you.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.275
CHUO-LING CHANG: Thank you.

00:27:29.275 --> 00:27:30.880
