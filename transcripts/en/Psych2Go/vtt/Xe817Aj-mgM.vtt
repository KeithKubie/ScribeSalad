00:00:07.505 --> 00:00:10.385
What is up with this idea of people being left-brained and right-brained?

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:13.420
Is it myth? Actually, no.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.900
The thing is some people are more left-brained and others

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.940
are more right-brained. We found

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.520
out what determines which side has dominance

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.540
happens before even born. In the womb,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.640
when our xxx develops, the way they wire up to our developing brain determines which side is dominant.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.700
Why do we have dominant side?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.095
Lateralization.

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:35.125
This refers to some brain functions taking place in one hemisphere

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:37.195
or one side rather than the other.

00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:40.365
Each hemisphere controls a different body side as well.

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:43.560
Your dominant brain side connects to your dominant body side.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.280
The left side of the brain controls the right side of the body.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.580
And the right side the left.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.475
This cross-wiring neural pathway means

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:53.355
if you are left-handed you are more relying on the right side of the brain.

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:54.705
And again vice versa.

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:58.085
How does this affect our think style?

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:01.155
The left side and the right are responable for very distinct thinking patterns.

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:04.115
Generally, the right brain thinks in pictures

00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:04.885
instead of words.

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:07.775
Using intuition and focusing on the bigger picture.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.120
The left focuses on actual words.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.940
Thinking in a very verbal way. Holding into details first,

00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:16.020
and then putting them toghter to form a whole picture.

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:18.895
It's why we agree upon that the right side is creative

00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:20.335
and the left is logical.

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:23.465
How is language afftected?

00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:26.785
The left side is good for vocabulary, grammar, and literal meanings.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:29.915
The right side is great for intonation and accentuation,

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:31.735
basically, how we speak.

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:35.005
How is music heard in the brain?

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:37.295
We alreay know the right side is more creative.

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:40.325
Music processing takes place in the entire brain.

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:43.325
With the right side focusing on the melody while the left side focuses on

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:45.855
the motor scale your hands need to play the instrument.

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:49.315
It's true that math is left brain business.

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:52.725
We assume the left side being more logical does more math.

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:56.065
Things such as adding, counting, subtracting, etc.

00:01:56.505 --> 00:01:59.455
The right, however, actually helps us with estimating amount of set of objects.

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:00.895
 

00:02:00.895 --> 00:02:03.135
While your left brain might help you take a test,

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:06.205
the right brain can tell you how many boxex are still on the dilevery pallet at work.

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:07.200
 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.180
Which side handles the memories?

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.295
The hippocampus is actully the part of the brain associated with memory.

00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:15.905
And it occupies both sides of the brain.

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:19.125
The left side has been deemed more important for storing memories,

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.645
as its strength is in retrieval.

00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:24.925
The right side is good for reciting, like multiplication tables.

00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:28.815
Which side will help me more in wieding in survival camp?

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:30.365
Depending on our situation,

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:32.585
the sides we depend on change.

00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:35.595
Studies have shown that, in a warm places with more xxx moods

00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:38.855
and less risks to your life, the right side is better.

00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:42.205
The left kicks in when it's cold.

00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:45.065
The food is xxx and threads to your life like a wielding polar bear are abondant.

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:46.895
Survival skills are

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.185
based more on spatial awarance and logic.

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:52.240
Not creativity.

00:02:52.245 --> 00:02:53.920
So the left side controls more of our ability to survive.

00:02:54.345 --> 00:02:57.305
How does damage xx the right side affect person?

00:02:57.505 --> 00:03:00.445
Damage xx the right side

00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:01.945
and even suicide.

00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:04.885
An over-acted right side can cause feelings of depression and inksed.

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:07.725
It can also case problems with language and preception.

00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:10.880
So just the lacks of motion while speaking.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.220
How does damage to the left side affect a person?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.240
Left side damage affects vision.

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:19.935
There is a reduction in spatial frequency. So we only see the larger part of a image.

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:21.735
 

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:24.695
Speech also seems to be litered with gramatical errors.

00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:26.835
This is called

00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:29.445
So, which side is superior?

00:03:29.715 --> 00:03:31.635
It is important to stress that there is

00:03:31.635 --> 00:03:34.545
no right or wrong way to think.

00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:37.915
Both sides have their advantages and simply represents two ways of thinking.

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:40.215
If you want to increase your brain power,

00:03:40.215 --> 00:03:41.925
work on both sides if your are XX.

00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:44.885
 

00:03:44.885 --> 00:03:46.205
 

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:48.455
 

00:03:48.455 --> 00:03:51.425
 

00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:53.215
