00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.333
 Female Presenter: Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:06.767
On behalf of Google+
and Musicians@Google,

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:11.767
I am thrilled to welcome Scotty McCreery
and Lauren Alaina to Google today.

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:12.100
[applause]

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.533
Scotty: Howdy, Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.333
[applause]

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.667
Female Presenter: And as many
of you know,

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:20.233
they are the winner and runner-up,
respectively,

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:23.333
of Season 10 of American Idol.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:28.667
They're in town right now for their Bay
Area concerts with American Idol Live.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:30.567
Scotty: Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:32.833
Female Presenter: So welcome
to the Bay Area, guys.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:33.333
Scotty: Thank you.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.000
Thank you.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.400
It's chilly out here, isn't it?

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.133
Or, at night.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.733
Female Presenter: Yeah,
first impressions on July,

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.667
summertime, in the Bay Area.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.133
Lauren: It's a little cold.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.933
Scotty: Yeah, it's 105 degrees
yesterday in North Carolina.

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.533
So it's a little, wee bit different.

00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.800
It's nice.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.200
Female Presenter: Right.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.167
And so, welcome.

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:55.567
And then, Lauren, 
I have to point out

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:56.900
I'm sorry to hear about
this ankle.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.000
What happened?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.667
We gotta get to the bottom of this.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:03.267
Lauren: Well, we were at--.

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:05.467
It was at Portland, Oregon.

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:10.267
We were in Portland and I was
walking down some stairs backstage,

00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:12.567
'cause I was wearing
a new outfit

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:15.200
and I had to find
some heels to match.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.333
 So, I borrowed Thia's.

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.200
And that was not a good idea 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.200
because I fell down the stairs
and sprained my ankle.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.033
And now I have this sparkly boot.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.033
[laughter] 

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:28.567
Female Presenter: For those of you
in the back who can't see,

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:32.733
this is the most bedazzled boot
I have ever seen.

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:37.533
We'll have to get some
photos and post that later.

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.133
So let's talk.

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:42.167
Other than the ankle issue,

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:43.533
which we all hope will heal,

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.600
let's talk a little bit about the tour.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.667
So, it's pretty fresh.

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:49.233
You guys started just recently

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:51.900
and this is the beginning
of quite a long trip.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.533
So, first impressions on touring
and how's it going so far,

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.567
besides the ankle?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.433
Scotty: Yeah, so far it's been
really great.

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:02.267
We started off July 6th in Salt Lake 

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:06.000
and we're headed to the end
of September and finish up.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.800
We're adding dates
here and there.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.167
So, it's been great.

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:13.767
All the crowds' been receptive of us
and I think it's going really good.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:15.900
A whole lot better than I expected.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.933
Lauren: It's kinda cool to
go to the different places

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.433
and see the different reactions

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:21.867
and how people act differently
in the areas.

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.467
Like, everyone seems
excited to see us,

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:27.267
but they show it in different
ways in different places.

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:28.867
Scotty: Yeah, it's cool for me
'cause I'm a sports fan.

00:02:28.867 --> 00:02:32.000
So we're playing at all these NBA
venues and hockey venues and I'm all,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.600
"All right.
It's cool."

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.433
Female Presenter: All right.
So you're checking off your venue list there.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:36.100
Scotty: I know.
Exactly.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.600
Female Presenter: That's great.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.767
And so, tell us a little bit about like,

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:40.333
your average day on the tour.

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:41.767
Are you sleeping in?

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:42.700
Are you getting up early?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.300
What's the regime like?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.433
Lauren: Well, Scotty sleeps
at any chance that he gets.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:48.467
Scotty: [laughing ]Got that right.

00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:52.000
Lauren: And I have to get up early,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.833
especially now that I have
a boot on my foot

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:56.933
because it takes me
forever to get ready.

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:57.867
But I mean--.

00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:00.233
Scotty: Basically, it's
just like clockwork nowadays.

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:01.100
We wake up.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.933
We get on the bus.

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:03.167
We head to the venue.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:06.433
And it's just like, meet and greet,
show, meet and greet,

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:08.567
autograph signing, dinner.

00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:09.167
Lauren: Bus.

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:11.733
Female Presenter: Visits to great
companies in the middle.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:12.200
Scotty: Visits to Google.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.633
This is the best place
I've seen ever to work at.

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:15.800
This place is crazy.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.967
[chuckling] 
[clapping, whistling]

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:19.400
Yeah.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.867
Female Presenter: Well,
we're really glad to have you.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.767
And they were enjoying
the smoothies on the way up.

00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:27.167
So, they get taste of--
Lauren: I got the googly blueberry.

00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:28.900
Female Presenter: You're
getting a taste of Slice.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.033
OK.
So, let's go back in time a little bit.

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:36.500
So, Scotty, I do have to say that my
mom picked you from the first audition.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.267
Scotty: Aww, thank you.

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:38.167
Female Presenter: Which is,
you know.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:40.267
So, I got the phone call
right after you won.

00:03:40.267 --> 00:03:44.233
But, when in the process
was it that you both--.

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:46.367
Of course you believe in yourself
the whole way through, right?

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:49.533
And you believe, 
but when was it that you felt

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:51.667
like that it was really within sight

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:55.333
and things that you guys were
gonna be winner and runner-up?

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.533
Scotty: Winner and runner-up, or
like actually could be on the--.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:03:58.433
Female Presenter: Well,
you being the winner

00:03:58.433 --> 00:03:59.733
and Lauren, of course,
being runner-up?

00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:02.200
Scotty: Yeah. I remember it was
about Top Five on the show.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.467
We were walking
around the apartment.

00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:04.733
This is like the fifth time
we'd moved.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:06.267
We finally got to apartments.

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:07.900
And I was walking around
my bed and I said,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.767
"Mom, I'm starting to kinda
wanna win this thing."

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:14.667
So, I kicked it in another
gear after that.

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:16.833
But it was pretty much
Hollywood week.

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:17.767
And once I got through that,

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:20.133
I felt like I could get through anything.

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:21.300
I'd never--.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.000
I would never--.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.267
I would pity you if you had to go
back to Hollywood week next year.

00:04:25.267 --> 00:04:26.800
That week, I just--.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.767
Female Presenter: Grueling?

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.567
Scotty: It is.
Lauren: It's rough.

00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:31.400
Female Presenter: And Lauren,
what about you?

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.100
Lauren: I thought I was going home
every week. [laughter]

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.600
I would like, 
on the Elimination Day,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.600
I would go up to everyone

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.667
and tell them everything that
I loved about them 'cause

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:44.667
I thought I was going home.
[giggles]

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:45.533
Female Presenter: It was the end
every week.

00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:48.700
That must've been a little exhausting.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.367
Lauren: Yeah.

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:52.767
I mean, everyone knew
what I thought about them.

00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:56.567
Female Presenter: And then,
what--.

00:04:56.567 --> 00:04:59.600
One of my favorite parts about
the show is towards the end

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.700
when they do the look back

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.000
and you see your auditions

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.900
and you see your different
performances.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.200
What is it like for you guys to have
had that experience documented

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.500
and to look back
at those first times?

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.700
And even, you know
your recent performances?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.300
What's that like?

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.933
Scotty: It's still wild for us
to think about them.

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:18.833
Me and Casey were on the bus
the other day and we said yeah--.

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:20.867
We were talking about just
getting done with the show

00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:21.633
and we stopped and said,

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:24.433
"We really just did the
number one show on television."

00:05:24.433 --> 00:05:27.033
And it's still crazy for us to think about
that we actually went through that

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:27.767
and got to do that.

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:29.900
So, it's still pretty wild.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.433
I mean, I go back on YouTube and
watch my audition a number of times,

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:34.533
just thinking, "Wow."

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:35.967
It seems like so long ago, 

00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:39.633
but then again, it seems like
it was just yesterday.

00:05:39.633 --> 00:05:42.200
Lauren: It's really cool
to be able to watch it

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.600
because you can see how you change 
throughout the whole experience.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.133
Like, if you pull up my first audition,

00:05:49.133 --> 00:05:50.900
I don't even look
like the same person.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.400
Not only like, 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.567
how I act and stuff.

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:58.467
Scotty: She didn't like her hair
in that video.

00:05:58.467 --> 00:05:59.500
Lauren: But I just, 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.733
I don't even look like
the same girl anymore.

00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:02.433
It's kinda--.

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:03.533
Like, people say,

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:05.367
"You look so different in person."

00:06:05.367 --> 00:06:06.767
But I think I'm just like--.

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:09.267
I guess when you're 16 years old
and you're a girl,

00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:10.867
you change a lot anyway.

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:12.333
I just did it on national television.

00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:14.200
So, like forever I'll be able
to pull it up

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.033
and look how much I drastically changed.

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:19.767
Female Presenter: [chuckling]
Absolutely.

00:06:19.767 --> 00:06:23.200
You got a little video yearbook
of your year.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.500
Scotty: Oh yeah.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.567
Female Presenter: So let's talk about
the judges on the show, right?

00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:31.367
This was the first year with
this great set of new judges.

00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:33.733
And what was that like
working with them

00:06:33.733 --> 00:06:35.567
and working with Jimmy Iovine,

00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:37.700
kind of the crew that
you were surrounded with?

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.767
Can you guys talk a little bit
about the inner scoop?

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:42.167
Scotty: Yeah.
The judges were great.

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:44.900
I mean, we were both kinda
worried about the new judges

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.533
and stuff, new season,

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:47.767
but it worked out perfectly.

00:06:47.767 --> 00:06:50.633
I mean, Steven Tyler, 
he's just a crazy dude,

00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:51.233
a funny dude,

00:06:51.233 --> 00:06:52.567
but he treated us like
we were his kids.

00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:55.267
So, he was really a cool guy off-stage.

00:06:55.267 --> 00:06:56.933
And Jennifer, 
she's just a sweetheart.

00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:59.633
So, I think I had a little--.

00:06:59.633 --> 00:07:02.267
Me and her had a little connection
because we had the Puerto Rican blood.

00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:02.767
Female Presenter: That's right.

00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:03.533
That's right.
[laughter]

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.833
Scotty: And Randy's just a dawg.

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:12.667
I mean, "Yo, dawg," not a dog.
[laughter]

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:14.767
Lauren: We get asked a lot
who our favorite judge is.

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:16.967
And it's kind of hard to say 

00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:21.500
because they're all so different
and they're just all really great.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.900
Steven's really funny and he says the
craziest things that never make sense,

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.567
but that's what makes you love him.

00:07:26.567 --> 00:07:28.700
And then Jennifer's like--.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.367
She's really--.

00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:30.767
You can tell that she really cares.

00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:34.667
Like, she's a very caring person
and even like backstage and stuff.

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:37.067
She'd know if we'd be nervous
and stuff and hug us

00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:38.700
and try to make us feel better.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.600
And Randy's just, 
he's just Randy.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.500
Everyone--.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.433
I mean, he's been, 
he's the trooper.

00:07:44.433 --> 00:07:47.533
He's stayed there since the
first season, so it's cool to--.

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:48.833
We've watched him all these years,

00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:51.100
so we actually get to know him now.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.200
So, it's really nice.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.100
Female Presenter: And so, we have
this thing at Google called the Dory.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:02.900
And the Dory tool is where we
solicit questions from various people.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.667
You can submit text questions
and the people can vote on them.

00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:06.400
This is a good question.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.033
This is a bad question.

00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:10.800
So, this is a question from
the Dory, submitted by Amy.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.867
So, Idol's been around for ten seasons 

00:08:13.867 --> 00:08:16.767
and remains being successful
as the number one show on TV.

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:22.067
What do you think it is about Idol that sets
it apart from other reality show competitions?

00:08:22.067 --> 00:08:24.700
Scotty: I think it's a testament
with just me and Lauren.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.100
I mean, I think--.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.867
[laughing]

00:08:29.867 --> 00:08:30.633
Lauren: Oh, my God.

00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:31.933
No, I have a point.

00:08:31.933 --> 00:08:34.400
I was gonna that middle America
can relate to us

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.100
'cause I was bagging groceries
and she was a pizza flipper.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.967
And to see that somebody
like us could do this,

00:08:40.967 --> 00:08:43.900
I think middle America just likes that.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.633
Lauren: I think it's because the crowd
is so involved in everything

00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:47.833
that goes on in the show,

00:08:47.833 --> 00:08:50.300
like they get to pick the results.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.100
And even if what they want
to happen doesn't,

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.100
it's cool to see how it actually
all turns out.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.000
I just love the show.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.033
I'm a big fan.

00:08:58.033 --> 00:09:00.567
Female Presenter: So, when you, I'm
assuming you watched the show before,

00:09:00.567 --> 00:09:03.000
would you text and
would you go online?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.867
And were you active,
engaged viewer?

00:09:06.867 --> 00:09:08.233
Lauren: Oh yeah.

00:09:08.233 --> 00:09:09.667
Scotty: Yeah, I was mainly a huge voter,

00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:11.667
but in Season 2, 
Clay Aiken was in it

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:13.733
and he was like, 
ten minutes from my house.

00:09:13.733 --> 00:09:15.833
So it kinda got started in Raleigh
like it did this year.

00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:18.100
So that's when I kinda
got on the Idol bandwagon.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.167
Female Presenter: Cool.

00:09:19.167 --> 00:09:22.133
So, let's talk a little bit
more about home towns.

00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:24.467
So James is from Santa Cruz.

00:09:24.467 --> 00:09:27.767
And so we all saw in the Bay Area
how exciting that was

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:30.500
when his home town rallied around.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.767
So, what's it been like for you guys?

00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:38.500
Have you gotten a chance to go home
besides the episodes on the show?

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.700
What's that like knowing

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.867
that you're both kind of far away
from home being in California?

00:09:42.867 --> 00:09:44.133
Scotty: It's pretty wild for us

00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:46.967
'cause we grew up our whole life
just being home town kids,

00:09:46.967 --> 00:09:48.500
just normal, average teenagers.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.433
And now, when we go back,

00:09:50.433 --> 00:09:53.667
we can't go out to dinner without
signing autographs and taking pictures.

00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:55.267
And people treat us differently.

00:09:55.267 --> 00:09:57.933
The people that we're closest to,
they don't treat us any different.

00:09:57.933 --> 00:10:00.700
And they still slap us around if
we get a big head or anything.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.400
But, exactly.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:02.933
Mama.
[Lauren giggles]

00:10:02.933 --> 00:10:06.967
Female Presenter: Pointing to the
mothers in the corner of the room.

00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:08.267
You can't even walk through Google

00:10:08.267 --> 00:10:12.100
without getting photographs
and autographs.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.867
Lauren: [giggling] That's kinda cool.

00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:16.467
I never thought I would say
I was walking through Google.

00:10:16.467 --> 00:10:19.400
[laughs]

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.067
I come from a town with 3500 people.

00:10:24.067 --> 00:10:29.000
So, it's a lot different being in California,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.767
where you can go to the mall
and there's 3500 people there.

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:34.733
[laughter]

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:37.100
So, when I went home,

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.133
it was a lot different.

00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:44.867
I mean, 'cause pretty much everyone
knows everyone for the most part

00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:46.267
where I live anyway.

00:10:46.267 --> 00:10:49.767
But I met a lot of people that I thought
I knew just about everybody,

00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:50.433
but I didn't.

00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:52.767
And I have a lot more cousins
than I thought.

00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:54.667
[laughter] 

00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:55.933
Female Presenter: People coming
out of the woodwork?

00:10:55.933 --> 00:10:59.167
Lauren: I got all kinds of family members
that I didn't have before.

00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:01.467
Female Presenter: [laughing]

00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:03.100
That's great.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.967
So, let's take another question
from the Dory.

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:09.333
This is from Anonymous.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.267
No, don't worry.

00:11:11.267 --> 00:11:14.967
So, do you ever wish the judges
would give you or the others

00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:17.900
more constructive criticism
than showering everyone

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.733
with a lot of the same compliments?

00:11:20.733 --> 00:11:22.633
Scotty: You mean everybody
wasn't in it to win it this year?

00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:27.367
[laughter]

00:11:27.367 --> 00:11:28.000
Lauren: What?

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.300
Scotty: No, I mean I thought
the judges this year were nice.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.700
I mean, they weren't the Simon Cowell
beating us up and everything.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.833
But they were nice to us 

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:41.500
and it gave us confidence
going into the week,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.900
knowing that we didn't have to
see Simon Cowell

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.300
on the end of the judge's panel.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.400
'Cause I can't imagine 
how that would've been.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.633
He woulda hated me.

00:11:48.633 --> 00:11:50.367
[laughter]

00:11:50.367 --> 00:11:52.533
Lauren: Well, he liked blondes.

00:11:52.533 --> 00:11:55.233
Female Presenter: He might
have had something going for you.

00:11:55.233 --> 00:12:00.567
Lauren: No, I think that the judges 
are kind of there to help us

00:12:00.567 --> 00:12:01.567
do the best that we can

00:12:01.567 --> 00:12:04.600
because the audience is
what makes the decision,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.567
or the people who make
the decision anyway.

00:12:06.567 --> 00:12:09.133
So they can be tough on us
and send us home

00:12:09.133 --> 00:12:10.433
if we're not doing good enough.

00:12:10.433 --> 00:12:13.933
But it's kind of nice to have
someone pushing you a little bit,

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:17.600
but not being too mean
about it at the same time.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.533
Female Presenter: Right.
Right.

00:12:18.533 --> 00:12:20.467
I'm sure there were other people
on the show working with you

00:12:20.467 --> 00:12:21.933
that were actually giving--.

00:12:21.933 --> 00:12:22.667
Scotty: Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:25.500
The producers and Jimmy and
all the guys up at Interscope

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.067
were with us every week,

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:28.667
helping us out and the vocal coaches.

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:30.667
And we had a lot of people
behind the scenes

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.167
that nobody else saw that helped us
to get through every week.

00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:34.300
Female Presenter: Right.
Right.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:34.867
That's great.

00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:37.000
So, let's take another one from the Dory.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.200
This one's specifically for Scotty.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.100
One of my favorite songs is
Craig Morgan's, "Almost Home."

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.367
I had really hoped you would end
up doing that during the show.

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:48.933
How much flexibility do you get in
song choice on the impending album

00:12:48.933 --> 00:12:51.767
and is a cover of "Almost Home"
possible?

00:12:51.767 --> 00:12:52.600
Scotty: Yeah.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.200
I mean for song choices
for the album,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.033
it's pretty much my choice.

00:12:56.033 --> 00:12:59.200
And we have people that help me out
with the choices

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.467
when we get demos and stuff.

00:13:00.467 --> 00:13:01.867
For a cover song on the album,

00:13:01.867 --> 00:13:03.800
I don't think we'll do it on this first one

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.133
just 'cause we have the chance
to put out brand new material.

00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:10.800
And I just got off a national televised show
of three months doing nothing but covers.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.467
So I think it'll be a--.

00:13:11.467 --> 00:13:12.133
Female Presenter: Right.
Changing it up.

00:13:12.133 --> 00:13:12.533
Scotty: Yeah.

00:13:12.533 --> 00:13:13.233
It'll be nice to--.

00:13:13.233 --> 00:13:16.733
Female Presenter: So, what
are the plans for the album?

00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:17.367
Scotty: We're recording.

00:13:17.367 --> 00:13:18.633
I mean, on our off days, 

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:20.400
it's pretty much me and
Lauren's non-show day,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.333
still a work day.

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:23.000
So, we're going to the studios 

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.133
and we're recording vocals
and we're getting close,

00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:29.667
close to the finish line with the album.

00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:30.100
Female Presenter: Great.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.500
And so you're working on an album as well.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.933
Lauren: Yes I am.

00:13:32.933 --> 00:13:35.200
I actually have to record pretty soon.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.433
And it's kind of scary because no one
has ever heard these songs before.

00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:41.433
So if they don't like them,

00:13:41.433 --> 00:13:43.900
they're just gonna can 'em,
I guess.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.367
I don't know.

00:13:44.367 --> 00:13:45.867
It's scary.

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:49.400
Female Presenter: Well, let's be positive.
[laughter]

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.400
Lauren: Looking on the bright
side of things.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:51.967
Female Presenter: [laughs] Great.

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:58.267
I'm sure you have a great team
working with you and you'll do a great job.

00:13:58.267 --> 00:13:58.767
OK.

00:13:58.767 --> 00:14:00.933
So let's talk a little bit, 

00:14:00.933 --> 00:14:05.700
move away from the show
and the tour and talk a little bit.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.000
You mentioned earlier about your auditions
that you've looked back on YouTube.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.267
And millions of people have
watched your auditions

00:14:12.267 --> 00:14:14.600
and watched different videos.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.833
So, do you guys go onto YouTube
and watch those videos?

00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:20.133
Or do you watch, 

00:14:20.133 --> 00:14:21.733
what other sorts of things
do you watch on YouTube?

00:14:21.733 --> 00:14:22.167
Scotty: Oh, yeah.

00:14:22.167 --> 00:14:25.067
I mean, I'm on YouTube pretty
much after every show to see my--.

00:14:25.067 --> 00:14:27.867
Even on tour now, I'm looking at
the videos people take out there.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.067
And not so much to see me,
but to critique me and say,

00:14:30.067 --> 00:14:31.000
"What are you doing there?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.400
And fix that for the next show."

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.767
And I do stuff like that.

00:14:33.767 --> 00:14:35.867
It's a cool little tool
we get to use and I mean,

00:14:35.867 --> 00:14:37.867
I did it on the show as well.

00:14:37.867 --> 00:14:39.267
Lauren: It's, you kind of have to

00:14:39.267 --> 00:14:43.267
because you make these little mistakes
and you're able to watch them

00:14:43.267 --> 00:14:45.900
so you can kind of think about
not doing 'em anymore.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.133
It's a good way to better yourself.

00:14:48.133 --> 00:14:51.467
Female Presenter: Right.
It's like a crowd sourced home video.

00:14:51.467 --> 00:14:54.933
Everybody's videoing for you.

00:14:54.933 --> 00:14:56.533
And so what about, 

00:14:56.533 --> 00:14:58.300
do you guys go onto YouTube for fun?

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.167
Do you watch YouTube videos?

00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:00.633
Scotty: Oh yeah.

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:01.367
There's the classic--.

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:02.233
Female Presenter: Any favorites?

00:15:02.233 --> 00:15:03.067
Scotty: There's the classic,

00:15:03.067 --> 00:15:05.200
[imitates British accent] 
"Charlie, that really hurt."

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.600
Lauren: "Would ya look at that.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.300
Would you just look at it?"

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:08.633
Scotty: I don't know.

00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:10.333
There's a lot of classic YouTube
videos out there that--.

00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:12.500
Lauren: I think that's so funny
and I showed it to Scotty

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.000
and he didn't think it was that funny.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.133
Female Presenter: The "would you look at that."

00:15:15.133 --> 00:15:15.700
Lauren: Have you seen it?

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.367
Female Presenter: Would you look at that?

00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:18.300
Lauren: Would you look at that?

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.200
Female Presenter: Just look at that.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.100
Lauren: Oh, where's he at,
I like to look at--.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.233
Have ya'll seen that?

00:15:22.233 --> 00:15:22.600
No?

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.167
Female Presenter: No?

00:15:23.167 --> 00:15:24.667
We'll have to share that afterwards.

00:15:24.667 --> 00:15:25.967
I think it's called like,

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.300
Lauren: "Would You Look At That."

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.867
Female Presenter: "Would You Look At That."

00:15:28.867 --> 00:15:30.967
It's like a sketch comedy prank.

00:15:30.967 --> 00:15:31.933
Lauren: It's funny.

00:15:31.933 --> 00:15:33.367
Female Presenter: But anyway.

00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:34.433
And then what about Google?

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.333
Have you guys Googled yourself ever?

00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:39.333
Scotty: We did a lot early on.

00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:40.033
Lauren: Kinda quick doing that.

00:15:40.033 --> 00:15:40.800
Scotty: And then we learned
pretty quick

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:46.333
that not everybody loves us out there.
[laughter]

00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:48.133
Lauren: We decided
that wasn't a good move.

00:15:48.133 --> 00:15:48.867
Scotty: Yeah.

00:15:48.867 --> 00:15:51.333
I mean, the bloggers out there
are the worst part.

00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:52.100
I mean, if you read articles.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.167
I like to read it, you know?

00:15:53.167 --> 00:15:54.767
I love articles, so I Google myself.

00:15:54.767 --> 00:15:56.300
The Google alerts and everything.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:56.900
Female Presenter: How nice.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.033
Scotty: You know?
You know?

00:15:59.033 --> 00:16:01.400
Female Presenter: Let's just talk
real quick about the Google Alert.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.900
Is it the full Scotty McCreery?

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.933
Do you also do them for Scotty?

00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:06.700
Scott McCreery?

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.500
What's your technique?

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.600
Scotty: Scotty was actually something
you could search

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.933
and it would come up on
the little bar that you search.

00:16:12.933 --> 00:16:13.733
That was really exciting.

00:16:13.733 --> 00:16:15.900
Lauren: I'd type in Scotty
and then McCreery's down there.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.867
Scotty: If you type in S-C-O,
it comes up.

00:16:17.867 --> 00:16:18.800
Female Presenter: That's the--.
You're the first--.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.867
Scotty: It's exciting.
[laughter]

00:16:20.867 --> 00:16:22.367
That was really exciting.

00:16:22.367 --> 00:16:23.233
Female Presenter: So,
you've spent some time.

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:23.900
Scotty: You know.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.333
[laughter]

00:16:27.333 --> 00:16:29.500
Female Presenter: The answer is yes.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.767
Lauren: We've never Googled ourselves.

00:16:31.767 --> 00:16:34.133
Female Presenter: Now Lauren, do you
also have Google Alerts for yourself?

00:16:34.133 --> 00:16:34.767
Lauren: Yeah.

00:16:34.767 --> 00:16:35.733
I mean--

00:16:35.733 --> 00:16:36.633
Female Presenter: You oughtta do it.

00:16:36.633 --> 00:16:38.400
Lauren: My mom is always on Google.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.300
Female Presenter: Nice.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:40.767
Lauren: Thank goodness.

00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:43.267
And if there's something good
then she'll show it to me.

00:16:43.267 --> 00:16:45.467
And I guess she doesn't show
me the negative stuff.

00:16:45.467 --> 00:16:46.633
Female Presenter: Maybe it's all positive.

00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:47.533
Maybe it's all positive.

00:16:47.533 --> 00:16:48.967
Lauren: I'm always looking
on the bright side of things

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:51.567
as everyone can tell.
[laughter]

00:16:51.567 --> 00:16:52.500
Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.633
The album's gonna be great.

00:16:55.933 --> 00:17:00.133
So, let's talk a little bit about
just how the social media things,

00:17:00.133 --> 00:17:02.733
whether it be Facebook or Twitter, 

00:17:02.733 --> 00:17:05.033
or other digital things
that you guys are doing.

00:17:05.033 --> 00:17:05.767
How has that--.

00:17:05.767 --> 00:17:09.267
Do you think that's shaped
where you are now?

00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:10.000
What you're doing?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.933
How you're connecting with fans?

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:15.267
Scotty: It's definitely been a great tool
for us to connect personally with the fans

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:17.933
and not just seeing them
on the show days and stuff,

00:17:17.933 --> 00:17:19.333
but be able to tell them--.

00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:21.000
I mean, they like to know
what we're doing,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
so if I wake up and eat Cap'n Crunch,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.733
I'll tell 'em I'm eating Cap'n Crunch.

00:17:24.733 --> 00:17:26.967
So it's just cool little things like that,

00:17:26.967 --> 00:17:31.633
that get them connected to our normal lives.

00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:34.633
Lauren: I just started using Twitter
when I was on the show.

00:17:34.633 --> 00:17:39.333
And it's really cool because my fans
will tweet me and they come to the show.

00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:41.767
And this one little girl
tweeted me and said,

00:17:41.767 --> 00:17:42.467
"Look for me.

00:17:42.467 --> 00:17:45.133
I'm gonna wear an 'I Love Lauren' shirt
that's hot pink."

00:17:45.133 --> 00:17:46.567
And I didn't tweet her back

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:49.633
because I didn't wanna say that
I'd look for her and then not see her.

00:17:49.633 --> 00:17:52.433
She's the first person I saw that day.

00:17:52.433 --> 00:17:53.867
I was like, "Did you tweet me?"

00:17:53.867 --> 00:17:57.900
And she got really excited and we took
a picture and she tweeted it to me.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.300
So, it's really cool that we have
that connection with them.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.133
Female Presenter: That's great.

00:18:02.133 --> 00:18:03.533
And so, that's so fun.

00:18:03.533 --> 00:18:07.967
And so, connecting with fans is
obviously a big part of your tour

00:18:07.967 --> 00:18:11.767
and obviously, like you said,
your daily Cap'n Crunch updates.

00:18:11.767 --> 00:18:16.067
So, earlier on Scotty and Lauren's visit,

00:18:16.067 --> 00:18:19.967
we gave them a tour of, 

00:18:19.967 --> 00:18:21.733
and an overview of, Google+.

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:26.167
So you guys got to see a little bit
about Google+ and you guys--.

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:27.533
So, first impressions?

00:18:27.533 --> 00:18:29.400
Or do you wanna talk about the hangout?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:29.833
Scotty: Yeah.

00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:30.433
It was really cool.

00:18:30.433 --> 00:18:32.567
I mean, it's gonna be
cool for me 'cause I get to,

00:18:32.567 --> 00:18:34.600
you know the Skypes and stuff
you can only do one person,

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.233
so with Google+, you can get ten.

00:18:36.233 --> 00:18:40.033
So I can get all by boys from back home in
Raleigh and from on the tour bus I can just--.

00:18:40.033 --> 00:18:41.467
We can hang out.

00:18:41.467 --> 00:18:42.167
Female Presenter: Right. Right.

00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:46.167
[applause]
[laughter] 

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.633
Scotty: And I know you wanna talk about it.

00:18:50.367 --> 00:18:53.500
Lauren: There's this guy on there
and his name is Jonathan.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.567
And he asked us if we were in choir.

00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:56.933
And we both were 

00:18:56.933 --> 00:19:00.733
and he said that he grew up in choir
and it was really strict and stuff.

00:19:00.733 --> 00:19:02.767
So I asked him to sing.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.867
And he was like, 
"I don't even know what I would sing."

00:19:04.867 --> 00:19:05.767
Like, real embarrassed.

00:19:05.767 --> 00:19:07.500
I was like, 
"Sing the Star-Spangled Banner."

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.933
Someone said that so I told him to sing it.

00:19:09.933 --> 00:19:10.833
And he did.

00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:13.533
He sang the whole thing.
[audience laughs]

00:19:13.533 --> 00:19:15.000
And like, ten people were watching

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.667
and we could see the people
down at the bottom, laughing.

00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:20.033
And we were all like--.

00:19:20.033 --> 00:19:21.600
It wasn't like it was funny.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.833
It was just like I couldn't believe
he was actually doing it.

00:19:24.833 --> 00:19:25.533
It was really cool.

00:19:25.533 --> 00:19:26.767
Female Presenter: It was a live hangout.

00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:28.133
Lauren: Make a shout-out to Jonathan.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:29.467
I don't know if he's gonna see this,

00:19:29.467 --> 00:19:30.833
but we love you, man.

00:19:30.833 --> 00:19:32.267
[giggles] [laughter]

00:19:32.267 --> 00:19:33.767
Female Presenter: It was very, very cool.

00:19:33.767 --> 00:19:38.233
So then, Scotty, you mentioned
your boys at home

00:19:38.233 --> 00:19:40.033
and that might be a good--. 

00:19:40.033 --> 00:19:41.633
We talked a little bit
about circles, right?

00:19:41.633 --> 00:19:43.033
And what groups you put people in.

00:19:43.033 --> 00:19:46.367
So, Scotty, if you were gonna
put Lauren in a circle-- [laughter]

00:19:46.367 --> 00:19:52.933
when you are on Google+,
which is not yet, right?

00:19:52.933 --> 00:19:53.867
Because they're not 18.

00:19:53.867 --> 00:19:55.767
But in the future, 

00:19:55.767 --> 00:19:58.400
if you get on Google+,

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.200
what circle would you put Lauren in?

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.200
Scotty: Hmm.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.800
What circle would you put me in, Lauren?

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.500
That'll give me time to think.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.167
[chuckles]

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:12.000
Lauren: I don't know.
[giggles]

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.867
Scotty: Block.

00:20:13.867 --> 00:20:15.267
Just kidding.

00:20:15.267 --> 00:20:16.467
I'm just kidding.

00:20:16.467 --> 00:20:16.933
Female Presenter: What about me?

00:20:16.933 --> 00:20:19.967
What circle would you put me in?

00:20:19.967 --> 00:20:20.567
Scotty: Friends.

00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:22.900
Female Presenter: Friend circle.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.833
Lauren: Come on, Scotty.

00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:24.800
Scotty: Well, you know.

00:20:27.533 --> 00:20:29.933
Lauren: I get blocked and you get friends.

00:20:29.933 --> 00:20:30.667
 Female Presenter: [laughing]
You never know.

00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:32.700
Things happen at Google quickly.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.133
[laughter]

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:40.533
So, I think we can, 

00:20:40.533 --> 00:20:43.767
if there are people in the audience
who would like to ask some questions,

00:20:43.767 --> 00:20:46.800
if you guys wanna line up at the mic.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.233
So, we can prepare for that 
if there's anybody.

00:20:49.233 --> 00:20:53.867
Otherwise, 
I can keep asking questions.

00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:54.567
Nobody.

00:20:54.567 --> 00:20:55.200
Lauren: OK.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:55.833
Female Presenter: Quiet bunch.

00:20:55.833 --> 00:20:57.867
Quiet bunch.

00:20:57.867 --> 00:21:00.700
So, nobody?

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.233
All right.

00:21:01.233 --> 00:21:01.667
All right.

00:21:01.667 --> 00:21:02.300
I'll keep going.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.400
Scotty: Oh, there we go.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.700
Female Presenter: OK, we have one.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.700
female #1: OK.
First of all, moms.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.833
You did a great job with these kids.

00:21:08.833 --> 00:21:13.467
[applause] 

00:21:13.467 --> 00:21:18.500
So I'm curious about the outfits
and clothes you wore on the show.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.700
Did you guys have to bring your own clothes,

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.000
like the white suit with big flowers?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.800
Scotty: Oh, yeah.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.533
female #1: That, I forget his name.

00:21:25.533 --> 00:21:25.900
Lauren: Paul.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.267
female #1: Paul wore.

00:21:27.267 --> 00:21:29.467
Or, did they choose your clothes for you?

00:21:29.467 --> 00:21:30.600
How did that work?

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.967
Scotty: Well, Paul's suits
were actually his suits

00:21:31.967 --> 00:21:34.233
that a friend made him
back home in Nashville.

00:21:34.233 --> 00:21:36.700
But for us on the show, 

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.633
we got to go out every week
with the stylist.

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:42.267
And did you go out with Art or Miles?

00:21:42.267 --> 00:21:43.167
Lauren: I went out with Soyon.

00:21:43.167 --> 00:21:43.633
Scotty: Soyon.

00:21:43.633 --> 00:21:44.400
She went out with Soyon, 

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.667
like Carrie Underwood and
she does a lot of big acts.

00:21:46.667 --> 00:21:48.100
She is our tour person, too.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.200
But we'd go out and we'd get a budget

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.233
and we'd just shop for clothes
we thought would look good.

00:21:53.233 --> 00:21:56.567
Lauren: Yeah, and we got
lots of boots on the show.

00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:58.267
Scotty: We did.

00:21:58.267 --> 00:21:58.867
Female Presenter: Do you
get to keep the clothes?

00:21:58.867 --> 00:21:59.467
Lauren: Yeah.

00:21:59.467 --> 00:22:00.633
We got to keep them all.

00:22:00.633 --> 00:22:01.067
Female Presenter: Wow.

00:22:01.067 --> 00:22:03.333
So, your wardrobe is, 
your closet's getting--.

00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:05.800
Lauren: We had to send boxes
home with clothes-- 

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.433
because we didn't have anywhere
to put them.

00:22:07.433 --> 00:22:08.267
Female Presenter: Oh, that's nice.

00:22:08.267 --> 00:22:11.200
And then what about your tour outfits?

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.767
Lauren: We get to keep those, too.

00:22:12.767 --> 00:22:16.033
Scotty: Yeah.
[laughter]

00:22:16.033 --> 00:22:18.000
Lauren: Is that what you were talking about?
No?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Female Presenter: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.133
Lauren: Everyone's laughing at me
and I didn't know that that was funny.

00:22:24.133 --> 00:22:27.067
Scotty: But we have like, seven outfits
for tour and we'll choose one every show

00:22:27.067 --> 00:22:28.500
and we'll wash it,

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.900
just pull one out from the rack every show.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.167
Female Presenter: What did you say?
You wash it?

00:22:31.167 --> 00:22:32.300
Scotty: Well, we have a
person out there that--.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.567
Female Presenter: Yeah, I was like,
you're not washing your clothes every morning.

00:22:34.567 --> 00:22:35.500
You don't have time for that.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.667
Scotty: I know.

00:22:36.667 --> 00:22:38.333
Female Presenter: You gotta do
interviews at Google.

00:22:38.333 --> 00:22:40.333
Scotty: Exactly.

00:22:40.333 --> 00:22:41.600
Female Presenter: We have
another question, or a--?

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.600
female #2: A question and a favor.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.500
So, my roommate Amy,
she's been watching you now.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.133
Scotty: Hey, Amy.

00:22:45.133 --> 00:22:45.767
female #2 She's like,
your biggest fan.

00:22:45.767 --> 00:22:46.900
She saw you last night live.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.367
She started her first day at YouTube today,

00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:50.067
so she can't be here. 

00:22:50.067 --> 00:22:51.733
Can you just like, 
wave at her and say hello?

00:22:51.733 --> 00:22:53.033
Scotty and Lauren: Hi Amy.

00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:55.167
[laughter]

00:22:55.167 --> 00:22:56.967
Female Presenter: This is Amy from YouTube.

00:22:56.967 --> 00:22:58.000
It's her first day.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.867
Scotty: How are you doing?
Hey.

00:22:59.867 --> 00:23:02.500
Female Presenter: Oh, she's fanning
herself like this.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.967
[laughter]

00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:06.233
Lauren: I think she's crying.

00:23:06.233 --> 00:23:06.933
Female Presenter: Was she crying?

00:23:06.933 --> 00:23:07.633
Lauren: I think so.

00:23:07.633 --> 00:23:08.633
Female Presenter: Let's hope not.
Let's hope not.

00:23:08.633 --> 00:23:09.833
Tears of joy.

00:23:09.833 --> 00:23:11.400
Tears of joy will encourage.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.133
It's positive.

00:23:12.133 --> 00:23:14.600
[Lauren laughs] 

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.200
female #3: I have a question for Lauren.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.767
I read somewhere that Carrie Underwood
said that every year

00:23:19.767 --> 00:23:22.400
she gives out her numbers
to the American Idols.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.200
So, I was wondering since you're
such a big fan of hers,

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.267
have you been calling her, keeping in touch?

00:23:27.267 --> 00:23:28.833
Lauren: I've texted her a few times.

00:23:28.833 --> 00:23:31.600
And she gave both of us
her phone numbers,

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.967
so she tells us good luck for things
and vice versa.

00:23:34.967 --> 00:23:36.500
So it's really cool.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.100
Scotty: The one time I texted her,
my boys were in the car with me.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.133
We were up in Nashville.

00:23:41.133 --> 00:23:44.733
And all my boys, my friends, you know?

00:23:44.733 --> 00:23:47.800
So, I was texting and they looked
over the seat and said,

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.233
"Scotty, who's that?"

00:23:50.233 --> 00:23:51.900
And I said, "It's just somebody."

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.300
And they said, 
"Is that Carrie Underwood?"

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.633
And they were like going crazy
in the back seat. [laughter]

00:23:56.633 --> 00:23:57.100
Yeah.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.433
It's been really cool.

00:24:00.367 --> 00:24:02.600
Female Presenter: And so,
tell us a little bit.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.300
That brings up your duet with Carrie
Underwood and yours with Tim McGraw,

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.133
which was a pretty epic moment
of the show.

00:24:09.133 --> 00:24:10.900
What was that like for you guys?

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.000
And obviously you've been
in touch with Carrie.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.167
I guess we can call her Carrie, 

00:24:14.167 --> 00:24:19.400
but what about you with Tim
and what was that like?

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.633
And was that, I'm guessing,
a dream come true?

00:24:21.633 --> 00:24:23.967
But what was it like?

00:24:23.967 --> 00:24:26.200
Lauren: Well, I've always looked up
to Carrie Underwood

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.600
ever since she was on the show.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.633
And she's such a beautiful person
inside and out.

00:24:30.633 --> 00:24:33.300
And to actually meet her was incredible.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.367
But to be able to sing with her and
share the stage with her was like,

00:24:37.367 --> 00:24:39.167
epic.
[giggles]

00:24:39.167 --> 00:24:40.467
Scotty: Oh yeah.
Definitely.

00:24:40.467 --> 00:24:43.367
And the thing with Carrie and Tim was
they're such down to Earth, normal people.

00:24:43.367 --> 00:24:45.267
I mean, even Jennifer Lopez.

00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:47.900
I was backstage with her
in dress rehearsal finale

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.300
and her mom was back there
and she said,

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.033
"Mom, can you help me put my shoe
on before I go on stage?"

00:24:52.033 --> 00:24:53.433
So, they're just normal people.

00:24:53.433 --> 00:24:56.167
And Tim was like my country Dad, 

00:24:56.167 --> 00:25:00.067
just helping me out and pat me on the back
and giving me pointers and stuff.

00:25:00.067 --> 00:25:03.367
So it was really cool to just see
that they're not the heavenly Gods--.

00:25:03.367 --> 00:25:04.900
Female Presenter: Right.
They're real people.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.500
They've gotta put their shoes
on just like the rest of us.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.967
Scotty: Exactly.

00:25:08.967 --> 00:25:09.633
Female Presenter: So let's talk.

00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:10.900
You bring up moms,

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.400
which I think is a good thing because
both your Moms are here today

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.100
and on tour with you,
which is pretty cool.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.833
I just found out that not all the Idols
on the tour have their parents with them.

00:25:21.833 --> 00:25:22.700
Scotty: We're the lucky ones.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.400
Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:28.667
[laughter]

00:25:28.667 --> 00:25:30.033
Lauren: He means that.

00:25:30.033 --> 00:25:31.067
[laughter] 

00:25:31.067 --> 00:25:33.033
Scotty: No really, really.

00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:37.533
Female Presenter: So, what's that like?

00:25:37.533 --> 00:25:42.300
I'm sure it's nice having a familiar
face with you guys.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.267
Scotty: It definitely is.

00:25:43.267 --> 00:25:45.500
They were there every week
to keep us in line

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.133
and to get things going for us
behind the scenes

00:25:48.133 --> 00:25:49.867
that not everybody sees.

00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:52.733
I mean, people send us fan mail
all the time at the studios,

00:25:52.733 --> 00:25:55.567
so she'd sit down and she'd write out
all the thanks and I'd sign them.

00:25:55.567 --> 00:25:57.100
We had a system going.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.867
It was always nice to know that
they were there to help us out

00:25:59.867 --> 00:26:02.767
and I don't know if we'd have
made it this far without them.

00:26:02.767 --> 00:26:03.267
Lauren: At one point, 

00:26:03.267 --> 00:26:05.900
I shared an apartment
with Haley Reinhart

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.500
and she would get really upset
and come and talk to my mom

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.167
because her mom wasn't there.

00:26:12.167 --> 00:26:16.800
And I mean, when I was with her
I realized how lucky

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.567
I really was to have my Mom there,

00:26:18.567 --> 00:26:21.633
because I could just cry to her, 

00:26:21.633 --> 00:26:24.300
but when you get upset and
you don't have anyone there,

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.267
you have to cry to your pillow.

00:26:27.267 --> 00:26:28.367
We were lucky.

00:26:28.367 --> 00:26:29.567
Female Presenter: Right.
Very lucky.

00:26:29.567 --> 00:26:33.367
So, I know Lauren, 
you have a brother at home.

00:26:33.367 --> 00:26:35.100
And Scotty, do you have siblings, too?

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.067
Scotty: I got a sister.

00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:36.667
Female Presenter: OK.

00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:39.433
So what's it like to be
far from home,

00:26:39.433 --> 00:26:45.100
to not be in the middle of normal
high school things right now?

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.900
What's it like keeping in touch
and seeing those photos?

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.200
And what's that feel like?

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.533
Scotty: It's definitely tough on all of us.

00:26:51.533 --> 00:26:54.167
I mean, my sister, she's at the beach
working for the summer,

00:26:54.167 --> 00:26:55.700
so she's having a good time.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.467
But it's weird for us to
be apart from them

00:26:58.467 --> 00:27:00.100
because we've grown up our whole lives with them

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.900
and to be on the opposite side
of the country from them,

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.967
I mean, we try to keep in touch.

00:27:03.967 --> 00:27:07.633
I don't do the best, but I should've
texted them and stuff.

00:27:07.633 --> 00:27:09.900
Lauren: Surely not you.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.033
Scotty: But it's definitely tough
on all of us.

00:27:13.033 --> 00:27:15.667
But it's just something that
comes with the job description.

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:16.833
Female Presenter: Right.
Right.

00:27:16.833 --> 00:27:18.333
Scotty: I gotta find a way to get around it.

00:27:18.333 --> 00:27:22.000
Lauren: Well, I mean,
American Idol changed our lives.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.533
Like, everyone that has--,
like our family and everything.

00:27:24.533 --> 00:27:26.867
And my brother just started doing Twitter,

00:27:26.867 --> 00:27:28.233
'cause all of my fans,

00:27:28.233 --> 00:27:31.633
like, tweeted me and told me to tell
my brother to make a Twitter page.

00:27:31.633 --> 00:27:35.933
And he has like fan pages
and everything.

00:27:35.933 --> 00:27:37.233
Female Presenter: Oh my goodness

00:27:37.233 --> 00:27:38.800
Lauren: And my brother is really shy.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.067
He's like the complete opposite of me.

00:27:41.067 --> 00:27:42.167
He's like really smart and stuff.

00:27:42.167 --> 00:27:42.467
Scotty: Really shy 

00:27:42.467 --> 00:27:44.133
Lauren: I'm not saying I'm not smart,
I'm just saying--

00:27:44.133 --> 00:27:45.033
[laughter]

00:27:45.033 --> 00:27:46.667
Female Presenter: Lauren.
Positive, positive.

00:27:46.667 --> 00:27:52.367
Lauren: [giggling] But he, and he doesn't
know what to do with all of them.

00:27:52.367 --> 00:27:53.767
He's like, 
what am I supposed to do?"

00:27:53.767 --> 00:27:57.333
So he just tweets my fans and
it's the cutest thing ever.

00:27:57.333 --> 00:27:58.033
Female Presenter: That's great!

00:27:58.033 --> 00:28:02.700
Lauren: I mean, my brother and I,
we're only 17 months apart so we're like,

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.500
really close.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.533
And I just miss him.

00:28:04.533 --> 00:28:09.467
But I talk to him on the phone
quite often and it's just--.

00:28:09.467 --> 00:28:13.700
He's really supportive along with both
of our families are super supportive.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.967
And we got like two more
months of this tour

00:28:15.967 --> 00:28:17.600
and we're gonna be reunited with 'em.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.400
And this is our dream
and we're living it

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.367
and our families are with us
every step of the way.

00:28:24.367 --> 00:28:26.033
So, we're really lucky kids.

00:28:26.033 --> 00:28:26.900
Female Presenter: That's great.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.333
That's great.

00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:31.700
And then what's the plan for after the tour,
which ends in what?

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.133
September?

00:28:32.133 --> 00:28:33.233
Scotty: We'll still be working.

00:28:33.233 --> 00:28:35.433
We're going straight from the tour

00:28:35.433 --> 00:28:37.700
and then hopefully the album
will launch soon after that.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.100
So, we'll be able to go out there and
do a couple weeks of album promotion.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:41.667
And then hopefully, 

00:28:41.667 --> 00:28:43.600
I'm trying to work out some time
where I can go home

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.267
and go enjoy some high
school football games.

00:28:46.267 --> 00:28:46.800
Lauren: Me, too.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.000
Scotty: Just do the normal life for a while.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.200
And then, back to work.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.267
Female Presenter: Absolutely.

00:28:51.267 --> 00:28:54.733
So, let's take another question from a Googler.

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:56.300
female #4: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.500
So, basically taking it back to the show.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.100
I always wonder when Ryan came
over and asked you questions,

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.700
how rehearsed were those questions?

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.067
Scotty: Not really at all.
Lauren: They weren't.

00:29:06.067 --> 00:29:08.900
Scotty: They'd tell us what the questions
would be like right before he asked them.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.567
Like, "Be prepared for this question."

00:29:10.567 --> 00:29:12.200
Lauren: On the commercial break.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.300
So he'd walk up and literally five seconds later
you have to answer this question.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.067
Scotty: Yeah, a lot of the stuff
you saw was rehearsed on the show,

00:29:19.067 --> 00:29:20.900
but that part of it wasn't.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.633
Lauren: That's a good question.

00:29:23.633 --> 00:29:24.833
I've never been asked that.

00:29:26.633 --> 00:29:27.933
Female Presenter: Another question?

00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:28.900
male #1: Yeah, hi.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:29.767
Thanks for coming.

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:30.333
Scotty: Yeah.

00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:33.300
male #5: So, my niece is
a huge fan of yours, Scotty.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.600
Scotty: Aw, tell her I said hey.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.667
male #1: I used to get a text
every night during the show

00:29:37.667 --> 00:29:39.133
basically asking me to vote for you.

00:29:39.133 --> 00:29:41.467
male #5: So I was wondering
if you could give a shout-out to her.

00:29:41.467 --> 00:29:44.233
Actually two of them, Isabella and Lulu.
Scotty: Yeah, I'd love to.

00:29:44.233 --> 00:29:45.267
Isabella and -- 

00:29:45.267 --> 00:29:45.933
male #5: Lulu.

00:29:45.933 --> 00:29:46.433
Scotty: Lulu?

00:29:46.433 --> 00:29:47.233
male #5: Yeah.

00:29:47.233 --> 00:29:48.733
Scotty: Just give a big shout-out.

00:29:48.733 --> 00:29:49.967
All right then.

00:29:49.967 --> 00:29:52.333
[laughter] 

00:29:52.333 --> 00:29:54.133
Hey, Isabella,
hope you're going good.

00:29:54.133 --> 00:29:55.800
And Lulu, that goes for you, too.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.867
Thank ya'll for the support.

00:29:56.867 --> 00:29:59.133
[applause] 

00:29:59.133 --> 00:30:00.000
male #5: Thank you.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
[applause] 

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.967
Female Presenter: Perfect.

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:07.533
Well, are there any other questions?

00:30:07.533 --> 00:30:08.133
Oh.
One more.

00:30:08.133 --> 00:30:09.100
Go ahead.

00:30:13.033 --> 00:30:14.133
female #5: Sorry, sorry.

00:30:14.133 --> 00:30:15.400
OK. So you guys are in high school.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.000
So how are you finishing 
your high school work?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.900
Are you having to do that
on the road, private tutors,

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.033
all that jazz?

00:30:20.033 --> 00:30:22.300
Scotty: I just found out today
I'm not done with English yet.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.700
[laughter]

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.900
So, we're--. 

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.900
I think you're done 
with your Sophomore year.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.333
We're just finishing up.

00:30:28.333 --> 00:30:30.467
Lauren: No, actually.
I'm finishing it up right now.

00:30:30.467 --> 00:30:31.867
Scotty: Yeah.
So we're--.

00:30:31.867 --> 00:30:32.767
It's taking our time.

00:30:32.767 --> 00:30:37.000
I mean, it's definitely stressful
on us to have school

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.100
and this tour and album
recordings and stuff.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.500
But most of my teachers are working
with us and helping us get along.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.767
So, I only need one more class
to graduate after my Junior year.

00:30:46.767 --> 00:30:49.767
Lauren: I've been doing
my school on the internet.

00:30:51.167 --> 00:30:52.167
Scotty: OK.

00:30:52.167 --> 00:30:53.033
[laughter]

00:30:53.033 --> 00:30:55.200
Female Presenter: Love the internet.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.667
Lauren: I was trying to
plug the internet, there.

00:30:56.667 --> 00:30:59.167
[laughter] 

00:30:59.167 --> 00:31:01.633
Female Presenter: Well, earlier in the hangout,

00:31:01.633 --> 00:31:03.200
someone was having trouble hearing

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.233
and Scotty said, "I think
it must be your connection."

00:31:06.233 --> 00:31:08.300
[laughter]

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.833
So, he gets it.

00:31:09.833 --> 00:31:10.567
He gets it.

00:31:10.567 --> 00:31:11.800
One more question?

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.667
Brett?

00:31:12.667 --> 00:31:13.033
Brett: Hey guys.

00:31:13.033 --> 00:31:14.100
Good to see you again.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:14.567
Scotty: Yes, sir.

00:31:14.567 --> 00:31:14.967
Brett: It's Brett.

00:31:14.967 --> 00:31:16.233
How's it going?

00:31:16.233 --> 00:31:17.367
So I was wondering, 

00:31:17.367 --> 00:31:20.033
what are some of the craziest things
that have happened

00:31:20.033 --> 00:31:21.300
since you guys started this journey, 

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.267
then people don't really know that 

00:31:23.267 --> 00:31:25.267
they didn't see on the show
and stuff like that?

00:31:25.267 --> 00:31:27.700
And maybe you haven't
talked a lot about publicly.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.767
Or, some of the highlights or lowlights,
those sorts of things that--.

00:31:30.767 --> 00:31:31.633
Female Presenter: Give us a scoop.

00:31:31.633 --> 00:31:32.367
Brett: Yeah. Give us a scoop.

00:31:32.367 --> 00:31:33.367
What's the back story?

00:31:33.367 --> 00:31:34.900
Scotty: What's the craziest stuff?

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.467
Like, behind the scenes stuff?

00:31:37.467 --> 00:31:38.467
Female Presenter: Or on the tour, yes.

00:31:38.467 --> 00:31:39.067
Brett: Behind the scenes, 

00:31:39.067 --> 00:31:41.700
or like things you never anticipated
that were great that came out of this.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.033
Scotty: Oh.

00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:46.100
You know the night that Stevie Wonder
came on the show and so did Hulk Hogan?

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.633
Well, we found out about an hour
before the show

00:31:47.633 --> 00:31:49.433
that Stevie Wonder was gonna be on the show.

00:31:49.433 --> 00:31:52.000
So, we had to rehearse
our whole new dance routine

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.467
and then we didn't know Hulk was comin' .

00:31:53.467 --> 00:31:56.000
So like, everything in that show is impromptu.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
And I mean, 
so, that kind of crazy stuff.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.733
Live television is the worst part about it.

00:32:00.733 --> 00:32:04.867
Lauren: And I think it was even
Steven Teller's birthday that night

00:32:04.867 --> 00:32:09.400
and Pia and I are the clumsiest
people on the show

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.900
and they asked us to carry
his cake in high heels.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.567
So we were both like freaking out,
walking across the stage.

00:32:15.567 --> 00:32:18.033
The whole night was just like
a surprise for everyone.

00:32:18.033 --> 00:32:20.533
We didn't know any of that stuff
was gonna happen.

00:32:20.533 --> 00:32:21.033
Scotty: Yeah.

00:32:21.033 --> 00:32:22.933
But there's a lot of crazy stuff
that goes on behind the scenes.

00:32:22.933 --> 00:32:24.667
We'd have bread balls.

00:32:24.667 --> 00:32:28.800
The stage director would get like bread
and she'd crumble it up in a ball

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.700
and we'd throw it across the stage and hit--.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:30.300
Female Presenter: Bread?

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.000
Scotty: Yeah, bread balls.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.933
And you had to catch it a certain way.

00:32:31.933 --> 00:32:32.433
Female Presenter: A bread ball?

00:32:32.433 --> 00:32:33.600
Scotty: It would go everywhere.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.500
Female Presenter: This is our scoop:
bread balls.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.300
Lauren: You try to catch it
without the bread breaking.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.267
And it's really hard.

00:32:39.267 --> 00:32:40.500
Female Presenter: What kind of bread?

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.400
Lauren: It's like--.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.100
Scotty: Wonder Bread.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.367
[laughter]

00:32:45.367 --> 00:32:46.767
Lauren: You don't know that.

00:32:46.767 --> 00:32:47.700
Scotty: You never know.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.433
Lauren: It was a bagel, wasn't it?

00:32:49.433 --> 00:32:50.900
She rolled up a bagel.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.733
Scotty: Who knows?

00:32:51.733 --> 00:32:52.767
Lauren: I don't know.
Whatever.

00:32:52.767 --> 00:32:54.833
Female Presenter: So this would happen
before the shows or just during?

00:32:54.833 --> 00:32:57.100
Lauren: This is how much fun
we have backstage.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.500
Female Presenter: And is the bread
ball tradition going on tour with you?

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.233
Or is that just--.

00:33:01.233 --> 00:33:02.100
Lauren: We should do it.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.233
Scotty: We should.

00:33:03.233 --> 00:33:05.200
I don't know if the venues
would like us, but you know.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.300
[Lauren laughs] 
[laughter] 

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.367
Female Presenter: So what are your first
impressions of Northern California?

00:33:11.367 --> 00:33:14.467
You guys had a show last night in Oakland.

00:33:14.467 --> 00:33:15.567
And how did that go?

00:33:15.567 --> 00:33:18.067
Anything crazy happen?

00:33:18.067 --> 00:33:19.233
Scotty: Crazy.

00:33:19.233 --> 00:33:21.133
Uhhh.

00:33:21.133 --> 00:33:22.633
Lauren: I can't think of anything.

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:24.533
Scotty: I got to watch the All-Star
game on the bus,

00:33:24.533 --> 00:33:26.433
'cause I come on at the last part of the show.

00:33:26.433 --> 00:33:28.333
So I get to kinda chill, early.
So, I got no--.

00:33:28.333 --> 00:33:30.600
It was my first baseball game 
I got to watch in a couple months,

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.133
so it was nice.

00:33:31.133 --> 00:33:33.967
I mean, yeah.
Go back and enjoy my pastime.

00:33:33.967 --> 00:33:36.500
Lauren: Last night it was everybody's birthday

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.367
and almost everyone that I met
that was a little girl,

00:33:39.367 --> 00:33:41.333
told me their name was Lauren.

00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:44.800
Lauren is a popular name in California
I have come to find out.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.167
Female Presenter: What do you mean
it was everyone's birthday?

00:33:47.167 --> 00:33:48.200
Lauren: Everyone was like,
"It's my birthday.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.733
Can we please have a picture?"

00:33:49.733 --> 00:33:50.700
Scotty: It was the truth .
Didn't it?

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.400
Yeah.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.133
Lauren: Didn't they?

00:33:52.133 --> 00:33:53.433
Scotty: Yeah.

00:33:53.433 --> 00:33:55.533
Lauren: Yeah, it was everybody's
birthday yesterday.

00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:56.700
[laughter]

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.567
Female Presenter: And so--.

00:33:57.567 --> 00:33:58.100
Lauren: For real.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.733
Female Presenter: everybody in Northern
California's birthday was yesterday.

00:34:00.733 --> 00:34:03.333
Lauren: Everybody's name that
was Lauren that I met yesterday,

00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:04.633
it was their birthday.

00:34:04.633 --> 00:34:06.300
Female Presenter: And what about tonight?

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.100
You guys have a show tonight?

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:07.800
Are you nervous?

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.567
Are you relaxed?

00:34:08.567 --> 00:34:11.000
What's the plan for the afternoon?

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.400
Scotty: Yeah, we're--.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.767
It's just kinda like clockwork for us now.

00:34:13.767 --> 00:34:14.867
It's just the same thing.

00:34:14.867 --> 00:34:15.633
I mean, this is different.

00:34:15.633 --> 00:34:17.100
This is a kind of a nice
little thing for us to do.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.067
So, we're heading to the venue
and meet and greet,

00:34:21.067 --> 00:34:24.033
show, meet and greet, dinner, bus.

00:34:24.033 --> 00:34:24.633
Lauren: Bed.

00:34:24.633 --> 00:34:27.967
[giggles] [laughter] 

00:34:27.967 --> 00:34:30.133
After a while you don't really get
as nervous anymore

00:34:30.133 --> 00:34:33.667
'cause it's just like, we do the same
thing every time we're on the stage.

00:34:33.667 --> 00:34:36.133
Scotty: Well, you still get the same rush
right before you walk on a stage and right

00:34:36.133 --> 00:34:36.700
when you get on it.

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:38.100
Lauren: Yeah, it's just
right before you walk out there,

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.633
except when you fall down the stairs
and you have a boot on your foot.

00:34:40.633 --> 00:34:42.433
And then all I have to do is sit there now.

00:34:42.433 --> 00:34:46.067
So, I have a lot less to worry about.

00:34:46.067 --> 00:34:49.167
Female Presenter: And then, so we need
to just about wrap up.

00:34:49.167 --> 00:34:53.733
Do you guys have any messages for the Googlers,
for the YouTubers out there?

00:34:53.733 --> 00:34:58.067
And we'll post this online,
so anything you wanna say.

00:34:58.067 --> 00:34:59.233
Scotty: Go ahead.

00:34:59.233 --> 00:35:01.867
Lauren: When the age is dropped on Google+,
we will join.

00:35:01.867 --> 00:35:05.033
[laughter] [applause]

00:35:05.033 --> 00:35:08.767
Scotty: Yeah, definitely.

00:35:08.767 --> 00:35:12.633
But thank you Google for all ya'll's support.

00:35:12.633 --> 00:35:18.333
And I'll keep reading the positive things 
I see on Google and not the negative things.

00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:19.833
But yeah.
YouTube's been great for us, too.

00:35:19.833 --> 00:35:23.133
It's been wonderful to have these
two tools with us along the journey.

00:35:23.133 --> 00:35:23.633
Female Presenter: All right.
Great.

00:35:23.633 --> 00:35:27.800
Well, on behalf of Google+ and
Musicians@Google and all the folks here,

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.867
we're just so happy that
you guys could stop by today.

00:35:30.867 --> 00:35:31.767
Best of luck.

00:35:31.767 --> 00:35:34.433
Congratulations and thanks for coming.

00:35:34.433 --> 00:35:35.067
Scotty: Thank you.

00:35:35.067 --> 00:35:36.200
[applause] 
00:35:36.200,00:00:00.000
