00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.980
I’ve got a new set!

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.780
With new props like my friend Nietzsche and his
sweet but ultimately totally meaningless mustache.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.460
And I’m here in this fancy new place to
dive into a very old discipline.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.279
This year on Crash Course, I am excited to
be tackling some of the biggest questions

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.320
yet. What is consciousness? Truth? Goodness?
Do we even know anything? And how?

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.590
No, seriously Socrates, how do we know?

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.769
These are the daunting questions we’re going
to try to wrap our heads around this year

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.480
on Crash Course Philosophy.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.520
While I’ve spent the last few years teaching
you different sciences, much of how we arrive

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.060
at the knowledge we have can be traced back
to Philosophy.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.980
Like, the Socratic method of breaking things
down into simpler questions to arrive at answers

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.850
heavily influenced what we now know as the
scientific method.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.059
In fact, the institutional ancestors to modern
universities thought of most of the subjects

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.879
we now call sciences as philosophy. Everything
was philosophy!

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.300
Because all academic inquiry was trying to
answer important questions about the world,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.620
our place in it, and establishing a reliable,
trustworthy framework for answering those questions.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.300
While some of the questions in philosophy
can seem a little, like, impractical, its

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.860
approach to thinking about the world actually
applies to pretty much everything.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.240
Unlike other courses, this year we’re going
to be far less interested in making sure you

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.590
know a bunch of memorizable facts -- which
also means, thank goodness, that I won’t

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.980
have to say epithelial again all year -- and
more interested in how you think.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.060
We’re going to talk about reasoning and
logic. How do you arrive at your own conclusions?

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.380
And can you explain them?

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.480
These are things you’re already doing every
day to make decisions about your life or whether

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.490
you can eat another corn dog. Your daily life
already consists of tons of inductive reasoning,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.780
and probably a few encounters with people
whose ideas you might describe as “illogical.”

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.530
But because this course is less about what
you know than how you know, we’re going

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.170
to make you better at reasoning and hopefully
even understanding that relative who posts

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.990
incessant ranty status updates that drive
you crazy.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.890
Maybe. We can’t promise miracles. If nothing
else, you’ll be better able to understand

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.770
the strengths and weakness of your own ideas
as you go forth into the world.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.220
And that will make you a better anything -- scientist,
economist, historian, corn dog consumer.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.060
So join us for the big questions this year
on Crash Course Philosophy, which is produced

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.400
in association with our good friends at PBS
digital studios.
