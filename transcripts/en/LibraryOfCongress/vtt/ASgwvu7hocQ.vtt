00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.350
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.360
&gt;&gt; Karen Heller: I'm Karen
Heller, national features writer

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.190
for the Washington
Post, a charter sponsor

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.290
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.480
The Library of Congress has
been the festival's host

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.570
since its inception
sixteen years ago.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.260
We want to thank the cochairman
of the festival, David Rubenstein

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.900
and the many National
Book Festival sponsors

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.970
who made this event possible.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.400
You can support the festival with
a donation by checking information

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.750
in the program and there will be
time for questions after the talk.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.700
Harlan Coben is big, literally,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.160
since 1990 he has written
thirty books that have sold

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.840
and this is a fact reporting
folks a gazillion copies

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.520
in uptillion countries, okay.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.030 position:56%
So he sold more than seventy million
copies in forty three languages

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.250
in more than 100 countries.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.240
Harlan, how can he not be a writer
with a name like this born to dance

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.600
on the spine of the book?

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.660
He is the first author to win
the Edgar Award, the Shamus Award

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.050
and Anthony Award which means he
writes mysteries very, very well.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.560
Harlan comes from that most exotic,
intriguing and art inspiring land

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.550
of enchantment, New Jersey.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.200
That's true, nobody should put
New Jersey down for anything

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.610
because Maryland and Virginia
cannot claim what New Jersey can,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.550
and we can go into
that another time.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.210
He is a guy from Newark, New
Jersey a distinction he chairs

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.140
with the literary bard
of that city Philip Roth.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.680
He still lives in New
Jersey unlike Roth,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.890
he is also admired by the French.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.920
His brace in 2001 thriller
Tell No One was made

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.710
into a terrific French movie
Nila D Appel Son [phonetic].

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.970
When Coben was nine
years old and living

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.980
in Livingston he met
a self-confident kid

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.110
in a catcher's uniform
who approached him

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.490
by saying Harlan Coben, hi,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.050
I'm Chris Christie
what nine-year-old does

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.410
that Coben asked years later.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.270
The lifelong friends disagree on
the single most important issue

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.670
of our time - which Bruce
Springsteen song is better.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.430
Christie argues it's Thunder Road
and Coben swears it's Jungle Land,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.850
for the record Coben is right.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.710
Also, if I may indulge I have a
mystery idea for him; perhaps,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.030
your next thriller could be

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.030
on the nation's busiest
bridge mysteriously closing

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.520
for some traffic study
the first day of school.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.960
It's just an idea but I'm
giving it to you for free.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.290
In 2013, he had so many
honors, Coben was inducted

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.500
into the Little League Hall of
Excellence with Chris Christie.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.940 position:56%
That same year he was also inducted
into the New England Basketball Hall

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.140
of Fame for his hoops
score in Amherst in college

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.450
and this is quite amazing, folks.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.780
He was a member of the Psi
Upsilon Fraternity with Dan Brown

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.200
who also knows how to craft
a best-selling thriller

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.940
and shared a freshman dorm
hall with David Foster Wallace

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.940
who certainly knew how to footnote.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.560 position:56%
Coben's new book home published this
week has ace detective Myron Bolitar

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.690
investigating high
profile kidnapping

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.280
of two young boys a decade earlier
when only one of them returns home.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.110
He was also at the first
National Book Festival.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.040
Bolitar [assumed spelling] is
6 foot, not Bolitar, Harlan.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.360
Bolitar is 6 foot four like
his creator like his creator

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.800
and a native of Livingstone,
a former basketball star,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.100
a sports agent turned sleuth.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.490
Also, perhaps most
compelling of all,

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.020
he's considered quite attractive

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.990
to women despite being
saddled with the name Myron.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.510
Readers, friends: Harlan Coben.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.850
[ Applause ]

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.980
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Just got to adjust
this a little higher, there we go.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.670
Thank you Karen, that
was really good, man.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.240
It was like a roast, I was getting
a little afraid sitting here.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.870
Hey, how are you guys?

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.860
Good. It's so great to be
back here in Washington DC

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.470
and I haven't even know where
I was actually born just north

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.420 position:56%
of Washington in Newark, New Jersey.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.740
So it's a thrill to be back
here amongst my people,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.850
thank you very much.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.100
So the book just came out,
it came out on Tuesday.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.060
I do have a copy of it over here.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.860
And so the book came out on
Tuesday and I usually do one

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.690
of those morning shows first thing

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.380
so this year I did
the CBS morning show

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.610
with Gail King and Charlie Rose.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.910
And people always wonder
what's the best

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.160
and the worst part
being on the show.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.120
The worst part is the teaser
like have you've ever seen,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.960
they do stick the camera right
in your face and you're all

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.930
in your own room and they're like
coming up in the next half hour.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.650
And you can't know what to
do and you're sitting there

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.860
and adjusting things, but
the best part of being

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.710
on those shows is I
get to wear makeup.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.710
I look so good with makeup,
seriously I glow, I don't know.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.290
So when I do that, I'm actually
tweeting this sort of thing,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.900
I'm like wow, I look so good with
makeup, I don't know what it is,

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.790
so like you want to take a wipe
and wipe it off afterwards?

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.110
And I'm like "Are you kidding
and I'm wearing this all day.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.260
I look great" and suddenly
I have four kids,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.130
I am getting like emergency
text from my kids, right,

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.090
stop tweeting about make up.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.480
If you follow me Hon any of those
things you will know which one

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.320
of my kids are because their
reaction to any picture I used

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.490
to you put up is either
one of three things.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.670
Can you not?

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.180
Don't? And all in caps STOP
like an emergency thing.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.130
In fact, I don't normally
do impression, I'm not.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.580
I'm more known author as an author
than the guy doing impression

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.920
but I'm going to do a
quick impression for now

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.720
because when the books first
comes out I'm lucky enough

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.800
to get a full page ad, my
publisher gives me a full page ad

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.900 position:56%
and at times a big picture like this
audit, yeah, I know, embarrassing.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.240
So you can imagine my teenage
daughter's joy and pride

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.850
in seeing her father's picture
in the New York Times this big.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.940
So here's my quick impression, is
my kitchen table in the morning,

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.800
the newspaper articles are here.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.200
My daughter is coming down, she's
going to see her father's picture

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.040
in the newspaper as she is
going to school, here it is,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.110
thanks, thank you, thanks.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.590
In fact, oh, I got to
share, don't tell my wife,

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.890
I'm sharing this with you, okay?

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.310
Stole this, I stole this, I know,
we'll get to the books in a second,

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.700
don't worry, I promise,
we'll talk about books.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.000
I have to share it with you.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.690
So my, what's an actual
example of writing,

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.620
it's actually a great
example of writing

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.800
because writing you're
trying to sum things

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.770
up in a way that's entertaining
and economical, right?

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.190
So I'm about to, I snapped
this off my wife's song,

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.220
it says text exchange
between mother and daughter.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.180 position:56%
Just mother daughter mother daughter
and I think this is what I mean,

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.690
you'll see the relationship in
just these four quick notes, okay,

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:33.820
so let me read it to you and
don't tell my wife, alright?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.610
Mother: Why are you home?

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.780
Daughter: Stomach wasn't
feeling well.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.630
Mother: Oh mine too, diarrhea?

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.930
Daughter: Bye.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.570
Do you get the relationship?

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.240
Do you see what I mean?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.600
That's the wonderful thing
sometimes about writing.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.870
Okay, I'm here to talk
to you about healthcare.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.400
No, I am here to talk to you
about how to write, well,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.340
I've nothing else I
can talk to you about.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.980
So I might try actually if I can
to show you how I write the novels

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.890
and then we will take
a few questions

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.280 position:56%
and please have you raise your hands

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.950
because if you don't raise your
hands and I'm just going to call

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.740
on you and not all of you
have done the reading.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.320
Remember that?

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.620
Throwback, right?

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.870
So, first my Surgeon
General's warning.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.760 position:56%
You may not like how novels, a novel
is a little bit like a sausage;

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.690
you might like the final taste,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.860
you probably don't want
to know how it was made.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.160
That being said, here we go.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.780 position:56%
So, the first question we always get
is, "where do you get your ideas?"

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.170
Like just a boutique
on Dupont Circle

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:41.540
that sells them, you
know what I mean?

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.870 position:56%
And the truth is anything can
stimulate an idea, tabloid headline:

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.300 position:56%
boy 16 becomes grandmother, marries
Ed Asner, you know what I mean like?

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.630
Anything, you walk around all day
with your mind as open as it can be

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.750
and you ask yourself this is
the key to all writing, what if?

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.150
All the time what if and every
once in a while ideas get stuck

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.790
in these hooks in the brain
and it sort of stays there.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.750 position:56%
So I'm actually going to try to tell
you how to come up with a couple

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.380
of book ideas to illustrate this.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.320
So a few years ago, I wrote a book
called Promise Me and the idea

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.610
for Promise Me came to be a little
bit serious here I overheard a

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.550
couple of teenagers talking
about drinking and driving.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.680
And I pulled them aside
and I said maybe some

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.670 position:56%
of you are doing same thing like
that, Promise Me, title of the book,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.280 position:56%
you won't get in a car with
someone's been drinking and driving.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.630
Here's my phone number, I don't
care if it's three in the morning,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.920
I don't care what you're on,
I don't care where you are.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.720
I'll come pick you up, I won't tell
your parents just promise me you

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.800
won't get in the car with someone
who's been drinking and driving.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.720
Now in real life that's it
and they still will never call

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.250
but fiction writing is
asking what if, what if?

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.460
A girl in New York City
calls my heroine, my hero,

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.120
have to make a promise like
this, he drives into New York,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.510
he picks her up, he drops
throughout what he thinks is her

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.810
friend's house.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.750
She's gone, no one sees
her ever again, what if?

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.330
That was the start of Promise Me.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.090
Hold tight, friends confessed
to me that they're worried

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.910 position:56%
about their kid, teenage boy fifteen
so they put spyware on his computer

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.540
to monitor what he was doing.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.940
Part of me was repelled but that
part of me was like you have

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.100
to watch your kids the most and it
was like this is a cool grey area

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.400
and I can make a book out of it.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.700
Again, what if?

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.200
What if they get a message?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.740 position:56%
That completely changed their lives.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.430
Now, the problem of these
two examples is it sounds

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.740
like it took me back ten minutes
to come up with these ideas.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.020
This is three months of
work, ladies and gentlemen.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.980
This is three months to
sit in the couch going, no,

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.280 position:56%
honey I can't throw out the garbage.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.850
I'm working, can't
you see I'm working?

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.280
Hardest part of my job,
convincing my wife I have one.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.820
The other problem with
this example is,

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.760
it doesn't quite get the mind
frame of how your mind just sort

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.220
of wanders and jumps around.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.760
It's kind of like have you ever
had one those nights you can't fall

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.700
sleep because you're trying
to think of something?

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.710
Something really stupid like
you know, what's the name

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.870
of the dog in Petticoat Junction?

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.170
And you're sitting in bed,

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.470
and you're wondering what the
heck the name of that dog.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.630
Was it Bobby Joe, Billy
Sue, what's the dog's name?

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.720 position:56%
And then you're wondering "why am my
thinking of something so idiotic?"

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.630
And you try to trace your thoughts
back, you know, like bouncing all

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.230
over the place and you
are actually started

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.530 position:56%
with something completely different.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.180
You actually started with something

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.440
like why doesn't Burger
King serve Mountain Dew,

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.740
you know what I mean like?

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.190
Your mind just kind of
bounces about the place,

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.740
that's sort of a better
example I think of how you come

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:36.130
up with an idea and then I'm try to
now put that into another example.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.470
I wrote a book a few years
ago called Tell No One.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.130
And the idea for Tell
No One came to me

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.510 position:56%
from two different directions, okay?

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.910
One and this is what I mean by
anything can stimulate an idea.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.920
I was watching a really
crummy romance movie on TV;

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.260
I won't mention the name of the
movie "Message In A Bottle."

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.020
I love Nicholas Sparks, a good
friend of mine, but that movie.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.190
Anyway, what struck me about that
movie was it's a story we've seen a

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.530
few times especially the ladies
will know what I'm talking

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.560
about where the man loses his
wife, right, the wife dies.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.900
The man loses his wife
and he can't go on

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.980
and then a hot babe
walks by and he's fine.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.280
Have you noticed that
in that movies?

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.380
In that case it was Robin
Wright, that kind of movie.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.250
And I said to myself in
those moments I get serious.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.060 position:56%
What about the man that can't go on?

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.170
What about the man who's
truly lost his soul mate?

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.570
Is there a way I can
find redemption for him?

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.870
That's one part of the idea.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.320
The second part of the
idea is I lost my parents

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.520
at a fairly young age,
yes, I get sentimental

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.880 position:56%
and overwrite Myron's parents that's
what I imagine my relationship would

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.180
be with my parents.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.990
If they survive if you
don't like the parts,

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.630
skip them, that's my therapy, okay?

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:39.930
Just leave me the heck alone.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:44.200
But one day, I was thinking
the same way that we all do.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.160
Wouldn't it be great if my
parents were still alive?

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.180
Wouldn't be great for my four kids

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.270
if they could meet
their grandchildren?

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.680
As I'm doing this I'm looking at
one of the street cams and I think

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.380
to myself "what will I do right now

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.700
if I saw my parents
on these street cams?"

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.100
Again, what if, right?

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.340
Now I took these two ideas
and I mash them together.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.070
A man and a woman happily married.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.660
Wife gets murdered, eight years
pass; he can't get over her death.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.560
He gets an email, he clicks
a hyperlink, he sees a WebCam

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.860
and his death wife walks by.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.290
And then the Homer Simpson part of
me goes "woo", that's the moment,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.000
he's start kicking like a dog,
like you're being scratched,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.300
right in that right area.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.140
Again, three months of work,
ladies and gentlemen, three months.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.380
Okay, so the next thing you'd
have to do, you have the sort

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.180
of concept, these sort of ideas.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.040
It's first of all,
writers are a little bit

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.500
like we of the Hebrew faith.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.210
Ask ten of them to
have to do something;

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.620
you get eleven different answers.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.140
So they keep that in mind, every
writer does it differently.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.280
I need to know the ending
before I start in every book

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.070
with the exception of one called
the Woods I knew the ending.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.040
The Woods I had this
four kids in the world,

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.340
I didn't know what's going on.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.580
I had to start the book about
a page a hundred and ninety,

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.670
one of the characters was kind
enough to tell me what's going

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.530
on because I was really
getting lost.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.410
But normally I know the
beginning and I know the end,

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.670
I compared it to driving
from my hometown of Newark,

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.300
New Jersey just the
north of Washington D.C

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.890 position:56%
across the United States over to LA.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.170
I make a Route 80, chances are I
will go via the Suez Canal or stop

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.390
in Tokyo but I pretty
much always end up in LA.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.690 position:56%
Neil Doctorow has my second favorite
quote on writing he says that

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.150
"writing is like driving
in the night in the fog

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.840
with just your heads lights on.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.550
You can only see a
little bit ahead of you,

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.030
but you can make the
whole journey that way."

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.330
So the only thing that
I would add is

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.230
that I know the end of the journey.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.610
My very favourite quote on writing
and if you learn nothing else today

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.870
like you're learning something.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.580
My very favourite quote on writing
is the best writing advice I have

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.260
ever heard comes from
the great Elmore Leonard

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.980
who said think about this.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.260
I try to cut out all the
parts you'd normally skip.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.640
Is that not genius?

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.580
And I try to do that,
I try to remember that.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.080
Every page, every paragraph,
every sentence,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.860 position:56%
every word I ask is this compelling,

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.290
is the best I can do,
is this gripping?

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.240
And if it's not I got to
find a way of changing it,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.440
it doesn't mean many kind
of themes or descriptions

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.640
or the larger things that's
supposed to be a novel.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.180
But every one of those
has to be compelling,

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.810 position:56%
I write as though there's a knife
against my throat and if I bore you.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.360
I write as though we are cavemen,
we're sitting around the cave

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.140
and if I bore you, this
guy is going to pick a club

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.630
and wack me over the head with it.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:23.240 position:56%
That's the kind of energy I try
always to write with, you have to do

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.390
that at all times, if you can.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.070
Alright, so, what do we have next?

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.300
Let me give you an example of what
I kind of mean by this by the way

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.000
if getting description
to whatever else.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.500
Mary Higgins Clark tells
a story all the time also.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.280
I'm a member of group
called the Adams Roundtable,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.850
a bunch of mystery writers we meet.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.130
It's supposed to be once a
month in New York for dinner,

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.220
ends up being a lot less
then that but members:

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.830
Mary Higgins Clark is a member,
Lawrence Block, Lee Child,

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.980
Nelson DeMille, Linda
Ferinstein, Susan Isaacs a lot

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.970
of great writers, very
talented people.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.050
And one time a subject came up,

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.710
of what's the scariest
noise in the world?

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.650
Man being tortured, a woman
crying, a baby is screaming,

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.470
what's the scariest
noise in the world?

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.130
And one of our members goes
no, no, no, the scariest noise

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.280
in the world is you are
alone in a cabin in the wood,

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.020
you know you are all alone,
you are all alone in the cabin,

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.300
no one else is there and from
upstairs you hear the toilet flush.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:19.300
That's the moment you're
always looking for as a writer,

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.460 position:56%
the Flush Toilet Moment if you will.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.370 position:56%
So for setting for example, I'm
describing to you Route 23 in Wayne,

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.570
New Jersey by the way New Jersey
for some reason we have a lot

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.710
of mattress stores, do you
have that down here in DC too?

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.910
We have like Sleepies which
is the mattress professional.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:38.550
And I was always wondering, is
that an MBA program, is that a JD,

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.700
how many years is to become a
mattress professional, anyway.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.810
But if I'm describing to
you Route 23 in Wayne,

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.730
New Jersey I won't tell you
it's four lanes to cross

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.140
through the divider in the middle
lane but I find the one thing

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.300
so for example Route 23 in Wayne,

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.590
New Jersey there's a tattoo
parlor club, think about this.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.510
Tattoos While You Wait.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.090
[ Laughter ]

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.790
Like how else would you do it?

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:08.690 position:56%
Here's my arm, put a little snake
on there, I'll be back around three.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:13.190
That will tell you more than pages
and pages of dialog or description

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.560
on Route 23 in Wayne, New Jersey.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.210
Also, in New Jersey we're
fairly honest people.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.160
I'm not going to knock some of you
who are from close to this area,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.520
but I was doing an
event not too far here

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.540
where the people kept telling
me when they go to the event,

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.450
they're going to cross
the Great Bridge.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.040
Wait till you see the Great bridge,

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.630
you're going to love the
Great Bridge, keep mine,

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.360 position:56%
I like the George Washington Bridge.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.930
The Great Bridge is about
the length of this room that,

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.690
why don't you call it A
Little Piece Of Crap Bridge?

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.850
We have a motel in Route
17 in Ramsey, New Jersey.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.590
One of those no tell motels,
thank you so much for nodding.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:49.500
Has a sign saying "now
featuring towels", you know

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.470
and then also my favourite sign,

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.020
color TV like some people
have black-and-white still.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.660
And the colors is always spelt
out like the c is in green,

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.920
the o is in red, the l is in yellow

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.040
like we don't know what
the word color is, right?

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.670 position:56%
But I love this, because the name of
this hotel, this motel in Route 17.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.200
It's the Fair motel.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.720
We're not great, we're
not even good, we're Fair.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.420 position:56%
What do you want for an hourly rate?

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.390
That again will tell you
more about New Jersey

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.080
than pages and pages of dialog.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.430
Oh, one more thing.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.930 position:56%
Sometimes with ideas, anger is a
great way of coming up with an idea.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.310
Okay, so I wrote a book called
Just One Look a just a few again,

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.120 position:56%
I'm sorry to get off course, I will
get back, remind me I'm on research.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.190
Okay, so I wrote this
book Just One Look

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.110
and idea for Just One Look came.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.780
I was picking up the family
photos at the Photo Matt,

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.080
you remember those things guys?

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.380
Some of you are old
enough to remember those.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.610
So I'm going through the pictures
in the envelope and for a second,

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.380
just a split second, I
thought it was a picture

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.680
in there that I didn't take.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.570
It turns out that the picture
is just upside down, oh,

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.880
but I had the idea what
if there was a picture

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.570
in the envelope I didn't take,

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.450
what if that picture
changed my life, okay?

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.380
But then you ask who's
going to tell the story

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.710
and for the first time I wanted
a woman to tell the story

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:09.140
because I've been reading a really
bunch, a ton of really bad women

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.860
in jeopardy novels, you know
the ones I'm talking about?

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.360
Where the heroine was like naïve
to the point of mental arthritis.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.390
It's like gee, there is a serial
killer loose in the woods,

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.700
I think I will run to a secluded
cabin and not tell anybody

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.080
where I am going, not hook up a
phone line and hang out in my bra

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.290
and panties all day,
I mean people please.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.320
In today's society, for
us to still be putting

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.730
up with that sort of thing.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.430
So you guys I'm sure probably know.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.780
There's a movie on the road,
we just changed people,

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.760
I'm going to really throw
you off now by taking to you,

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.190
I'm sorry, I'll forgot you're here.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.490
So when I'm talking about
this woman in jeopardy thing

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.610
so I'm flipping along stations
because I'm a guy in the hotel room

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.980
and I'm on tour and I always to go
pass the Lifetime Movie Network.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.100
And I'm not making this up, there's
been a remake of it but I used

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.700
to tell the story and
people wouldn't believe me

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.040
but I've seen this movie that
was starring was it Meryl Streep,

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.340
no, it's Tori Spelling.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.940
I always mixed those two up
Tori Spelling and Meryl Streep,

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.740
but this was, this was, this was
Tori Spelling not Meryl Streep

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.040
and the name of the movie some

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.590
of you have probably seen this is
Mother May I Sleep With Danger?

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:21.970
No. This should be an awfully
short movie shouldn't it, right,

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.050
first of all the name is Danger, a
clue that it might not be for you.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.940
Anyway, that anger, that wanting
to not have the story like that,

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.420 position:56%
that wanting to have a heroine who
is real not the kind that goes "who,

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.630
there is a serial killer at the
door, honey, go get the door,

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.860
mommy is going to take a shower",
will inspire you sometimes

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.140
to write something better, okay.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:47.590 position:56%
So this setting, oh, research thanks
research, I'm on research, hold on.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.010
So you're seeing writers here,
right, and they all talk probably

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.300
about research, do
a ton of research.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.850
If your a writer in
the room my advice

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.590
to you is do zero research, none.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.560
Thank you all very, very much.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.640
I'm going to defend that
position now, okay, two reasons.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.450
First of all, have you
ever read that novel

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.660
where the author's done a ton of
research and he keeps throwing in,

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.210
cute tit bits that he learned,
sort of slows the story down,

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:17.880
not a problem with me because
I don't know anything, okay?

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.880
Second reason, the more important
reason, research is more fun

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.100
than writing so you're using
research as an excuse not to write;

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.880
I see a lot of people
nodding their heads right now.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.700
So it will be like, I'm going to
write a scene in Fifth Avenue,

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.840
New York, oh, but I can't write
it today I have to go back

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.160
and smell the hot dog stands
and watch the girls go by.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.180
No, you're have an imagination,
you probably been there,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.380
you can look at pictures,
write it now and then worry

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.740
about the exact research later on.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.860
Don't let anything be
an excuse not to write.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.090
Following on that, there are
three things that make a writer

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.690
and we'll go through
that in a second.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.140
Well three things, two are
obvious, one is not so obvious.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.690
The two that are obvious
are inspiration, well duh,

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.800
you need to be inspired to write
so let's just move that aside.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.390
The second is perspiration
and that is doing the writing

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.540
and the only writing is writing.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.820
Researching is not writing,
creating characters is not writing,

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.510
thinking about ideas is not
writing, outlining is not writing,

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.320 position:56%
buying a new notepad is not
writing, going out with your friends

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.090
to Starbucks, eavesdropping,
none of those are writing.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:21.760
Only writing is writing, only
putting actual words on a piece

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.350
of paper or on a computer
screen count as writing,

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.820
everything else his flotsam
and jetsam and nonsense.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.670
So the only thing that
counts is your butt

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.100
in a chair producing words, okay?

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.660 position:56%
So we have, oops, excuse me; we have
inspiration, we have perspiration,

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.700
but the third and the most
important thing a writer has

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.340
to have is desperation.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:46.920
And that is I'm not fit to do
anything else like hold a real job.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.690
I do have shoes; I
forgot to bring the socks.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:56.180
I'm forgetful, I'm disorganized,
I'm sloppy, I have a tendency

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.730
to drift off, I go to never
never land all the time.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.920
I go to fiction land; I'm
not good at anything else.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.460
I was once on a panel with
a bunch of other authors

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.760
and we often get the question

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.890
if you weren't an author,
what would you be?

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:15.530
And one of my friends says a US
Senator; I'm like, oh, please.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:22.450 position:56%
I'll be a duvet cover I mean this is
it, this is all I got and that fear,

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:26.310
that worry, that insecurity
is what drives me back

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.190
to coach Steve Martins old line
being afraid that I have to wake

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.200
up at six morning and go
to the pharmacy and I had

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.520
to sell flare pens for a
living or whatever it is.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:39.280
That fear drives me back still to
this day; writing is about fear.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.160
I'm going to drop name
drop right now.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.410
I had breakfast this
morning with Stephen King

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:48.670
and we both discussed the fact
that we still feel because I was

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.090
like I feel but insecure.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.140
We writers never stop
feeling insecure.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.450
I'll be writing my book like
okay I'm writing my book

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:02.100
and I'll be going Oh my God I
lost it, I was so good before.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.420
What happened to me?

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.720
How did I lose it?

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.190
Five minutes later,
this is sheer genius.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:12.280
Someone is going to read that ad
book, I'm not keeping this work

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.300
of Shakespearean proportions
really chanced five minutes happens

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.730
within five minutes one another.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.540
When I finish a book I sound
like one of those game show host,

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.150
the voice services,
that's it for you Harlan,

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.860
there's no more ideas left.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.000
You're going to get a real
job and here's some turtle wax

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.910
to go along with your new career.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:32.010
Every book same thing, I've
written thirty books, thirty books.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:36.870
One about one a year so I
started when I was seven.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.170
Yeah, I wish.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.680 position:56%
But that never goes away, that fear.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.280
The muse is not an angelic voice on
your shoulder singing beautifully,

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.640
it's your mom, well,
you don't be with me,

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.080
you'd rather be out
with your friends.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.380
Come on Friday night,
no phone call, nothing,

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.470
that's what's there all the time.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.500
And if you're a writer,
you always feel guilty even

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.500
when I'm reading, I love to read.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.100
But even when I'm reading I
feel guilty I'm not writing.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.970
There's always a voice
in my head that says

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.270
"you should be home writing."

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.640
If you don't have that voice
you're probably not a writer

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.350
and that's cool, I don't
need the competition,

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.990
seriously, it is always a voice.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:15.770 position:56%
Recently because I have nothing
else in my life other than my family

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.560
and writing, I took up golf.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.440
Why didn't smash a
glass, pick up a chard

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.870
and stick it straight
in my eye I don't know.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:27.580
Instead I took the less pleasurable
route of taking up golf but even

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.050
on those days when
it's beautiful out

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.750
and I'm doing okay
and hitting the ball.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.820
There's still always
a voice in my head

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.760
that says "you should be writing."

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:40.710
Usually it's the guy I almost
hit with my errant tee shot.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:45.270
Another question that writers
often get is "what's the bad part

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.390
about being the best-selling
author?"

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.230
You know, what's the bad part?

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.220
And I'm here to tell you, nothing.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:58.810
It's as good as you imagine it is,
it's awesome and anybody who has,

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.790
it's bad karma man to
say anything negative

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:05.630
about being a best-selling author
because it's really the best,

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.080 position:56%
and for me the other thing writers
say that annoy me, and if you're one

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.380
of those writers in the room

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.290
that says this I'm calling
you out as a liar, okay?

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.580
Or someone who needs a therapy.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.860
Okay, here it is, the thing that
writers say that really annoys me,

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.730
have you ever heard of this?

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:24.960
I write only for myself, I
don't care if anyone reads it.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.780
That's like saying I
talk only to myself,

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.430
I don't care if anyone listens.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.120
From the beginning of time
since we could scratch,

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.660
oh, look I'm over there.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:41.180
It's hard to capture my raw animal
magnetism in photography people.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.650
You're better off looking here.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:46.600
You know from the beginning of time
since man can write on cave walls,

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.350
writing has been about
communication,

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.650
right, that's what it's about.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.260
So Berkeley's tree in the
woods, if I write a book

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.000
and no one reads it I don't
exist as a writer, you know.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.170
This just came out; a writer

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.750
without a reader is a man
who claps with one hand.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:02.840
I should clap here, claps with
one hand, you're the other hand

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.550
so this is the part
that is fun for me.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.670
I'm throwing the ball,
you're catching it.

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.200
There's an Arabic expression

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.880
that when one man dies
a whole universe dies.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.930
When one of you reads this book
a whole new universe of Myron

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.900
and Wayne and Esperance
and big-city comes

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.120
to life differently
than everybody else's.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.290
A one-on-one connection
between you and me,

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:30.760
that frankly is the coolest thing
in the world to me and the fact

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.610
that I get to do this and
I get to meet you guys

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.510
who are reading the
books, that's otherwise

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.030 position:56%
but the point, you know what I mean?

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.450
That's the magic of why
you're here, why we're talking

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.690
about books today at this thing.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:46.280
Books still do that men,
what else still does that?

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.000
That spurs the imagination, that
moves you and enlightens you,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.590
entertains you, what
else changes lives?

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.770
I was asked today about literacy,
and people are giving great answers

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.910
about how literacy, you need
it to fill out job forms,

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.210
and that whole economic reason,

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.570
but I'm just thinking imagine
your favorite books right now,

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.050
imagine your life, or how
intelligent you would be

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.980
if you never had a
chance to read this.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.270
So I want to thank you all
for listening to me today

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:15.060 position:56%
and I would be happy to entertain if
not answer a few of your questions.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.360
Thank you all very very much.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.160
Thanks.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:23.700
[ Applause ]

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.000
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: We've
got about ten minutes

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.910
for some questions if you want.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.670
Everyone's running out rather
than running to the microphone.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.730
This is not a good sign.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:37.760
Remember I said I would
just call on you.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.030
Yes, go ahead.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.240
&gt;&gt; I have two questions
I'm very interested in.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.540
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Yeah.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.890
&gt;&gt; Second one you might have
to answer at book signing

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.300
so it doesn't give it away.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.600
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Okay.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.900
&gt;&gt; And then.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.200
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: I'm not answering
any [inaudible] no spoilers,

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.500
go ahead.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.800
&gt;&gt; No, okay here's why.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: I have to tell you,

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.400
I recently read this book I was
completely fooled by the ending.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.040
[ Laughter ]

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.380
It's that stunning an ending, I'm
telling you, none of you is going

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.690
to guess the ending of this book.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:01.990
&gt;&gt; I cried at the end.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.400
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Oh, good, I
want you to cry, you're supposed

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.610
to cry, good, good, good.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:06.910
&gt;&gt; Quick question.

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.210
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Yeah.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.510
&gt;&gt; You usually write
a book once a year

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:12.570
and now it's only been six
months, will this be a pattern?

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.230
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: No, no.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:15.530
&gt;&gt; Wrong answer.

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:16.830
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: My publishers
are listening and they know.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.800
This year for some reason it's
hard to explain, I did two,

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.300
I had the idea for the Myron
Bolitar which is my first one

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:28.790 position:56%
in five years very, very quickly and
I became obsessed with it and was

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.290
at it, wrote it fast
enough that they said "Woo,

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.590
can we get this done by now?"

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.320
and I'm like "yeah I think we can."

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.620
&gt;&gt; This one is not a spoiler.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.920
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Okay.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.220
&gt;&gt; Because it right at
the beginning you see

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.520
when it's not with the Company.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.820
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Yeah.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.060
&gt;&gt; What was Myron doing after
selling the Company for all

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.440
that time until Wynne got back?

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.740
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: I don't know.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.640
You know, I don't respond
to anything

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.670
in this life that's not
necessarily in the book

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.140
but thank you for asking.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.350
Gentleman over here, thank you.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what a pleasure it is.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:58.200
You talked about how you came

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.530
up with your ideas for
stories and things.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.610
You also come up with some
very frightening characters

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:03.910
in your books.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.810
Do you have, are those something
you're always thinking of as well,

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:14.270
particularly, tell one no
one Eric Wu was particularly

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:15.570
frightening [inaudible].

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.870
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Thanks.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.170
&gt;&gt; Just curious about how did
you come up with [inaudible]?

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.470
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: This is same

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:20.770
as regular people it's just
a little bit, you know;

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.070
you just got to twist
them just a little bit.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.020
All my friends by the way always
think that the cool guys are based

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.320
on them, all my friends are

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.520
like that guy gets all the
chicks, that's me right?

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.330
Then we go that loser
with halitosis,

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.480
that's me right, they
never think that.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.780
Yes, over here.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:41.260
&gt;&gt; So in a lot of your books there
seems to be someone that's lost,

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.080
someone that people are
looking for and I was wondering

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.690
if there was anything in
your life that had kind

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:50.150
of propelled this idea
into your books?

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.180
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Yeah,
I prefer missing people

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.000
because in missing
people there's hope.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.460
Somebody is dead they are
dead, you just saw me crying

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.710
but missing people there
could still be alive.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.990
There was a time in my
life before I was forty;

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:07.100
I had done seven eulogies
including both my parents,

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.780
maybe before I was
thirty five, seven.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.370
Yeah so I had a lot of
loss and probably is part

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:17.830
of the reason why I'm trying to
find a way to bring back the dead.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.610
That was deep, give me a moment.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:21.910
Yes.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:24.800
&gt;&gt; I'm student of French; I
started about ten years ago.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.820
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: I hear your French
accent, is pretty thick, yeah.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.120
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] it really.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.420
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: I
expect that, yeah.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.720
&gt;&gt; Really good one.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.450
So I've been going to Paris for
the last ten years, once a year.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:36.010
And I thought I might
as well pick up a book

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:40.780
that French people are reading and
each time it was a Harlan Coben.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Yeah, I'm a big in,

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.380
I'm the Jerry Lewis
of crime fiction.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.680
&gt;&gt; You're very.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.980
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: I'm hoping
that Germany will pick

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.460
up so you meet David
Hasselhoff also.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.760
But right now it's
just the French, yeah.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.060
&gt;&gt; It was very big.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.360
Yeah.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.660
&gt;&gt; They're an easy read.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.170
I didn't need a dictionary,
everything was fabulous

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:58.230
until I hit one and it was clunky,

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:01.300
I couldn't read it and
I didn't finish it.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.160
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: I hope this
is a going somewhere nice.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.460
&gt;&gt; No.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.490
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: I'm
teasing, just go ahead.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:09.610
&gt;&gt; I looked, I thought "what is
the difference with this book",

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:12.640
and it was translated
by a different person.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.880
Do you ever think that your books
rise or fall on a translation?

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.670
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: It's pretty
simple, if the books doing well

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.000
in a country I assume
the translator's good.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.200
And if it's doing poorly
I blame the translator.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.500
&gt;&gt; No.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.530
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: It's
actually exactly,

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:28.660
&gt;&gt; Which is exactly what I did.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.560
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Exactly based
on translator, I once got,

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.320
my Japanese translator once sent
me a copy of the book and he said

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.620
if there's anything

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.750
in this translation you don't
like, be sure to let me know.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.250
This symbol isn't capturing
what I'm trying to say.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.760
Let's take two more questions
then will all go down

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.290
and sign books as fast as I can.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.590
Yes, thank you.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.680
&gt;&gt; First of all I love
your adult series a lot.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.980
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Thank you.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.280
&gt;&gt; But I'm an eighth grade teacher.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.580
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Yes.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.890
&gt;&gt; And there's a whole new
generation with the Shelter series

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.560
that we can't keep
them on our shelves.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.860
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: That's so sweet.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.160
&gt;&gt; They love them.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.460
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Thank you.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.760
&gt;&gt; Is there going to be more?

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.060
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Well,
I will tell you

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.360
that I think the kids are little
probably old enough, Mickey, Evan,

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.660
Spooner are all in this book
and we've learned a big secret

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.960
about one of their lives.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.790
I don't think I'm going to go
back to the young adult novel

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.350 position:56%
for a while, I wrote it as a trilogy
and I'm just so busy right now.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.990 position:56%
I'm doing two TV shows overseas also

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:17.350
that I don't think I'll have
a chance with the young adult

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.700
but just give it to me again and
tell them they never read it.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:24.040
&gt;&gt; Well, I get a whole new
group each year every September.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.340
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: That only
works with the older readers,

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.640 position:56%
it doesn't work with the young ones.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.410
One last, two last, both of
these two and then we're done.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:29.710
Yes, thank you.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.350
&gt;&gt; Could you address
the business side,

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.800
agents and publishers
and give us just the.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.600
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: There
are all whores.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.720
[ Laughter ]

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.020
No.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.510
&gt;&gt; Can you dig a little
deeper and...

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:47.280
[ Laughter ]

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.700
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: I've
been very, very lucky.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.780
All the people I've worked
with have been fantastic.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:55.060
All the rumors you hear about like
that they want you to have more sex

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.360
in the books, or violence
in the books.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.880
Each one of my books by the way
has less sex than the one before it

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.810
which also reflects my reality.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:04.430
[ Laughter ]

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:08.220
Kidding, not really.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.050
But I had nothing with great
relationships with my editors

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.560
and agents, find ones you trust.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:18.060
I really could not do it,
everyone works for me like,

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:22.080 position:56%
When I went to hire somebody I tell
them their job is just thinking work

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.650
I do it to free Harlan up to write.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.170
All I want to do is to write,
I don't know about e-books,

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.960
I don't know that Amazon or Barnes
&amp; Noble in the evils and sign this.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:34.230
I just like as soon as I hear it I
go like, lalala I can't hear you.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:38.210
What that makes me do is it
makes me just write harder,

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.140
I put my head down because the only
thing I can control is my book.

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.260
I can't control my Amazon ranking.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.970
I can control how good the
next book is going to be,

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.960
and if that book is good enough you
guys will read it on stone tablets

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.880
so I don't have to worry
about the e-book or audio.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.580
I try really to be as naïve
as I can about the business end.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:56.880
Is that help it all?

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.180
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.480
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Alright, thanks.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.780
Just write man, I'm
just telling you.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.080
The only answer is always to write.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.380
Yeah.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:04.680
&gt;&gt; First of all thank you
for hours of enjoyment.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.980
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Thank you.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.280
&gt;&gt; Really really [inaudible].

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.580
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Thank you,
oh, that's very sweet of you,

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.960
that's very [inaudible]
thank you, thank you.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.460
&gt;&gt; I was curious why your
books haven't been turned

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.560
into movies and if they ever are.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.860
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Yeah.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.240
&gt;&gt; Who would play Mylan?

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.560
&gt;&gt; Harlan Coben: Tell
[inaudible] was mentioned

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.250
in the introduction really,
really good French movie,

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.500
was nominated for nine
of their Oscars.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.130
It won four, for those
of you that have seen it,

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:30.110
I'm in it for about eight
seconds from the background,

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.180
I'm following Kristin Scott
Thomas and Françoise [inaudible]

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:37.230
like I said about eight seconds, no
line, but I was brilliant really I.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.150
I stole the film; I was ripped off

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.820
for the best supporting
actor nomination

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.670
for assuming the French are
anti-Semitic, I don't know,

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.190
I don't have any excuse for it.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.560
I did a TV show this year
in England called the Five.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.480
I did, you know, Second
Chance in France,

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.940
Tell No One has a chance
of being made again.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.920
It's an American remake, Fool
Me Once I'm working on right now

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.390
with Julie Roberts,
I love saying that.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.210
I'm working now with Julie Roberts
like the two of us are hanging

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.650
out working on this movie.

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:05.650
I'm writing the screenplay for now
it's a weird, Hollywood is a weird

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:09.150 position:56%
and destructive animal and it's hard
to really explain, other than to say

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.190
that I'm not too worried
about it because at the end

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:15.580
of the day there's always a James
Kay line when they asked him,

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.480
don't you hated what
Hollywood's done to your books?

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.780
She said "they did nothing

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.080
to my books they are
right there on the shelf."

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.430
Thanks everybody very much.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:22.730
I'll see you downstairs.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:25.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.650
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
