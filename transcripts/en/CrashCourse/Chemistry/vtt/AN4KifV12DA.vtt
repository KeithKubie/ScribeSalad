00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.870
It falls from the sky, makes up about 60%
of our bodies,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.960
and just about every chemical process related to life takes place with it, or in it: dihydrogen monoxide.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.380
Without it, none of the chemical reactions
that keep you alive would happen.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.620
None of the reactions that sustain any life
form on earth would happen.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.800
Not even the majority of inorganic chemical reactions that shaped the surface of the earth would happen.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.380
Water is the key to nearly everything.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.500
And one of the reasons it's the key, is because
it's really good at dissolving stuff.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.540
We need it so bad, that we dump over 180 gallons
of it into our bodies every year,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.909
and we do that to maintain an aqueous or water
based solution inside our cells,

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.289
because aqueous environments are pretty much
the best for cool chemistry.

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.649
Each and every one of us uses water for all
kinds of chemistry every single day.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:59.149
Our body chemistry, our food chemistry and yes, our laundry chemistry, all take place in water. Ew.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:08.720
[Theme Music]

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.580
This used to be a white sock. It is now a little bit of gray sock, and in places a little bit of a yellow sock.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.299
But anyway, I want it to be white again, and
to do that I'm gonna need some chemistry.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.899
To whiten whites, you might use a solution
of sodium hypo-chlorate, better known as bleach.

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.829
What makes bleach so good at it's job is that
it's a really strong oxidizer,

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:32.380
meaning that the oxygen atom is really good at pulling electrons away from other compounds, making them break apart.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.140
This is really handy for getting rid of stains
but as you can tell by the formula,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.659
sodium hypo-chlorate also contains chlorine, which happens to be really good at killing things.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.429
That's why we use it in swimming pools and
as a disinfectant.

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:50.240
But there are lots of other good oxidizing agents, and one that doesn't contain chlorine is hydrogen peroxide.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.820
And it can be used as a bleach too, but it's only components are hydrogen and oxygen, just like water.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.140
We'll talk about oxidation and other kinds
of reactions in a couple weeks,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.280
but before we get to that you have to understand
solutions,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.350
and before we do that I'm just gonna get rid
of the laundry because it's kinda stinky.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.280
This bottle of hydrogen peroxide contains
a solution and not just the solution to my

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.910
problem of stained laundry.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.690
By solution, I mean a solution of liquid with
another substance dissolved in it.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.500
Here water is the liquid, or solvent, and hydrogen peroxide is the solute, or dissolved material.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.160
And water is an amazing solvent, possibly,
arguably, the best solvent on earth.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.720
Why? A lot of reasons. There's a lot of it on the surface of the earth, that helps. Just abundance is good.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.660
It's liquid at a very wide range of temperatures and being liquid is what you need to be able to be a solvent.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.120
But also because it's polar; it's a very polar
molecule

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.820
Remember how I said that oxygen is very good
at pulling electrons toward it?

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.920
Well, oxygen atoms are more electronegative
than hydrogen.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.180
The oxygen atom pulls harder on the molecule's
electrons than the hydrogen does.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.760
As a result, the electrons in a water molecule tend to spend most of their time near the oxygen,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.680
giving the oxygen end a partial negative charge,
and the hydrogens, a somewhat positive charge.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.280
This polarity makes water extremely effective at dissolving things, especially other polar things.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.520
The sugar we mixed into our tea last week,
for example, was polar.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.490
When you mix a polar solid, like sugar, into
a polar liquid, like water,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.450
the molecules of the water surround the sugar
molecules

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.780
The negative side of the water molecules is attracted to the positive side of the sugar molecule and vice versa.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.360
In interacting with the sugar molecules, the
water inserts itself between all of the individual

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.260
molecules of the sugar that were once clumped
together in the sugar crystals.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.600
A liter of water can dissolve as much as 1800
grams of sucrose.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.460
Water based solutions, earlier I called them
aqueous solutions.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.100
And I'm calling it an aqueous solution again so that you remember it's called an aqueoussolution. Aqueous.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.680
You can create all sorts of aqueous solutions
using salts or minerals, even acids.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.000
Ethanol, which composes 95% of this grain alcohol, is polar. So it dissolves easily in water.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.820
But water does not dissolve non-ionic, nonpolar
substances.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.720
Oil, for instance, doesn't have any polarity.
So it has no interest in interacting with water.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.560
So when you mix them, they separate.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.780
Water's polarity also gives it lots of other
super useful properties.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.900
For example, water can decrease the attraction
between ions of different charges.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.900
We call this it's dielectric property.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.640
Take table salt, for example.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.550
It's made of positively charged sodium ions
and negatively charged chlorine ions.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.430
When it's mixed with water, the water dissolves
the salt into it's component ions.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.670
The water molecules then surround the individual ions and shield them from each other's electric charges.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.120
These ions in water are called electrolytes;
literally, loosened electricity,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.440
because separating through dissolution frees them to act independently and carry their electrical charge around.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.580
You've probably heard about electrolytes in
biology class,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.560
but you've definitely heard about electrolytes
in Gatorade commercials.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.280
Your body needs electrolytes to carry electrical
signals that help your muscles twitch,

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.730
and your brain cells fire, and get all the
business of living done.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.790
In addition to helping you live, electrolytes
are one of the most important ways chemists

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.070
have of classifying solutions.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.510
Pure water, on it's own, does not conduct
electricity, which seems a little weird to us --

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.240
the whole hairdryer in the bathtub thing still
being a terrible idea.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.300
But if you put a bit of salt or any other ionic solid in the water, they dissolve into those component electrolytes.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.020
It's the electrolytes that are conducting
the electricity.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.640
It's not what you might expect, but we have Swedish physicist Svante Arrhenius to thank for figuring this out.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.720
While doing his doctoral research in the 1880s,
he first developed the idea that a solution's

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.780
electrical conductivity could be linked to
the concentration of ions in the solution.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.610
It was one of his predecessors, British super-genius
Michael Faraday,

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.980
who discovered that substances dissolved in
water conduct electric currents.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.880
Faraday was terrible at naming stuff, so he wrote to a guy who was known for coining terms, William Whewell.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.520
You may have heard of his most famous creation,
the word "scientist."

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.460
Whewell wrote back to Faraday saying,

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.450
"I would propose for the two elements resulting
from electrolysis the terms 'anion' and 'cation.'

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.180
And for the two together, you might use the
term 'ions.'"

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.380
And there's something interesting here, and
I didn't pick up on it at first, but Whewell said,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.960
"The things resulting from electrolysis."

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.160
Faraday, thought that the electric current
is what produced the ions.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.300
What Arrhenius discovered, was that water
simply dissolves certain substances, like salts,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.760
into their constituent ions, which themselves
carry the charge.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.470
And since electrolytes carry electric charge,
the higher the concentration of electrolytes

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.639
in a solution the higher it's electrical conductivity.

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.610
Arrhenius found that you can even reverse
engineer your study of a solution

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.970
and by measuring it's electrical conductivity,
figure out how concentrated it is.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.840
Despite the importance of his work, Arrhenius'
chemistry professors didn't think much of it

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.080
and he got a mediocre grade, which is why
it must have been particularly sweet

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.540
when he won the Nobel prize in 1903 for that
very same research.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.120
Today, we know a little bit more about how
electrolytes work,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:10.020
and we've learned that the relationship between their concentration and their conductivity is not always straightforward,

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.139
because not all electrolytes dissolve equally
well in water.

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.430
A strong electrolyte, for example, is one
that dissociates, or breaks apart completely

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.970
when dissolved in water and conducts electricity
very well.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.180
Salts do this. So do strong acids like hydrochloric,
and sulfuric, and nitric acid.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.480
As well as strong bases, like sodium and potassium
hydroxide.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.240
Weak electrolytes only dissociate partially when dissolved in water, so they're only somewhat conductive.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.660
Most of the solute's molecules stay stuck
together, remaining neutral.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.980
Acetic acid, the active ingredient in vinegar,
and ammonium hydroxide are examples of this.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.100
And of course, some things dissolve in water
but don't conduct electricity at all,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.360
because they don't dissociate into ions.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.740
Alcohol and sugar, for example, are nonelectrolytes.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.560
Now, what does any of this have to do with
my laundry?

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.830
Well, hydrogen peroxide is a polar molecule
so it dissolves really well in water.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.990
But it's a very weak electrolyte.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:07.720
When it dissolves, it tends to dissociate into a water molecule and a lone oxygen ion.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.900
Since the dissolved peroxide creates even more water, the concentration of ions is quite low.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.020
But that lone oxygen ion is not happy by itself.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:22.290
It goes on an oxidizing rampage, swiping electrons
from anything it can find.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.340
It's especially good at tearing up the tricky double bonds that tend to give laundry stains their color.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.240
When that rampaging ion destroys the double
bond, the stain disappears.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.669
We're used to thinking of hydrogen peroxide
as a fairly mild chemical,

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.899
but that's because the over the counter stuff
is pretty dilute.

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:41.169
Too much peroxide could actually dissolve
my clothes,

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:46.660
and some of my favorite shirts are in here, so we need to dilute this stuff to make the solution the right strength.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.779
And as you might expect, if you joined me
on my recent foray into stoichiometry,

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:55.259
when chemists think about the strength of
a solution, they think about moles.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.220
So before we can dilute this formula,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.300
first we have to figure out how many moles of solute, of hydrogen peroxide, we're working with here.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:08.520
You'll remember, I hope, that one mole of
a compound equals 6.022 x 1023 molecules.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.360
That is a big number.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.600
So to make it easier on ourselves, we usually figure out how much a mole of a particular substance weighs.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.100
In our case, a mole of hydrogen peroxide weighs
34.014 grams.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:25.140
The number of moles of solute that are in
a solution is known as it's molar concentration,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.140
that's also known as a solution's molarity.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.120
As a rule, molarity equals the number of moles
of solute divided by liters of solution.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.740
So a one molar solution, contains one mole
of solute per one liter of solution.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.040
Do not confuse this with another way of measuring
concentrations based on mass,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.840
instead of based on volume.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.980
This is known as molality and it's expressed
as the number of moles of a solute in a kilogram

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.350
of a solution, rather than in a liter.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.329
Molality refers to moles per unit mass and
molarity refers to moles per unit volume.

00:09:56.329 --> 00:10:00.959
Sorry, scientists are bad at naming things sometimes. You just have to remember this stuff.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.820
So now that we know what molarity is, let's figure out the molarity of this hydrogen peroxide solution.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.600
The label on the bottle says a 3% solution,
weight per volume.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:16.260
Technically that's terrible chemistry because it's expressing a percentage in terms of two different sorts of units,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:22.920
but it does let us know how much solute went into the solution: 30 grams of H2O2 per one liter of water.

00:10:22.929 --> 00:10:29.279
I mean, just to be clear, it makes no sense
to have a percentage with two different units

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:32.819
and maybe these folks need to watch some Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:10:32.819 --> 00:10:36.300
So to calculate the molarity of this solution
we first need to figure out how many moles

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.000
of hydrogen peroxide are in 30 grams of hydrogen
peroxide.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.420
If we divide the 30 grams in the solution
by it's molar mass of 34.014 grams per mole,

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.699
we find that we have 0.88 moles of hydrogen
peroxide per liter of solution.

00:10:50.699 --> 00:10:57.230
Or, so you get used to the lingo, a 0.88 molar
solution of H2O2 in this little brown bottle.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:02.160
Now that we know the molarity of the original formula we can start thinking about how to dilute it.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.600
To dilute a solution you either have to add
more solvent or reduce the amount of solute.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:12.189
Since I'm already starting with a solution,
I need to add even more solvent, water,

00:11:12.189 --> 00:11:15.269
probably in this tub right here, so let's
just get that out of there.

00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:18.269
And there's a handy chemical rule for understanding
dilutions:

00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:23.269
the moles of solute before dilution is equal
to the moles of solute after dilution.

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:26.829
Think about it, the total amount of hydrogen
peroxide is going to stay the same,

00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:28.709
no matter how much water it's diluted with.

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:34.780
But as you dilute a solution, it's volume grows, the moles stay the same, and it's molarity thus shrinks.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:40.600
To calculate precisely how much one affects the other, we use a standard, and super simple, dilution equation.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:47.100
Here M1 &amp; V1 are the molarity and volume of the original concentration, sometimes called the stock solution.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.439
In this case, it's what's in the bottle.

00:11:49.439 --> 00:11:53.189
M2 and V2 are the molarity and volume of the
dilute solution.

00:11:53.189 --> 00:11:59.199
So in our case, M1 equals 0.88, that's the molarity of the hydrogen peroxide solutionthat we've got.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:06.259
And to bleach the stains out of laundry we need a 0.1 molar solution, that's M2, the molarity we want to get to.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:11.699
And the tub that I'll be soaking my whites
in, holds 38 liters of liquid, so that's our V2.

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:15.889
All that's missing is the volume of the peroxide
solution that we must add to 38 liters of

00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:18.239
water to get to our target molarity.

00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:24.429
Do the math and you get V2 equalling 0.24
liters of hydrogen peroxide or 250 milliliters.

00:12:24.429 --> 00:12:32.949
And we just fill this right on up here, hopefully
we have enough. Annnddd, that's what we need.

00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:35.440
And while I wait a few hours for the peroxide
to do it's work,

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.720
I'm going to enjoy another of my favorite
aqueous solutions: tea.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.160
Today here at Crash Course Chemistry we learned about some of the properties of water that make it so special:

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.730
it's polarity and it's dielectric property.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.239
We learned how electrolytes can be used to
classify solutions.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:56.100
And we discovered how to calculate a solution's molarity, as well as how to dilute a solution using the dilution equation.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.879
