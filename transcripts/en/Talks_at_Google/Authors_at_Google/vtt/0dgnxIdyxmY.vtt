00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.960
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.009
Authors@Google New York is
pleased to welcome today Dr. Oran Hesterman.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.330
Dr. Hesterman is the president and CEO of
Fair Food

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.330
Network.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.080
And he is here today to present his book Fair
Food: Growing a Healthy, Sustainable Food

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.080
System for All.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.970
As stated in the bio of his book if you read
on the cover

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.500
there, for 15 years Dr. Hesterman has co-led
the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.439
integrated farming systems and WK Kellogg
Foundation

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.179
during which time the foundation seeded the
local food

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.100
systems movement with 200 million dollars.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.940
In Fair Food
Dr. Hesterman outlines the change that must

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.860
be made in
regarding not just how we eat but how food

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.990
is grown,
packaged, delivered, marketed, sold and addressed

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.950
by
public policy.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.230
Thus outlining the steps we all must take
beyond just eating organic.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.620
Dr. Hesterman.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.820
[Applause]

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.651
&gt;&gt; Oran: Thank you very much.

00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:00.220
It's very good to be here with
you today.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.030
Thank you for the invitation and for your
interest in this topic.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.580
I'm going to try to -- I think
we have about an hour together.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.580
So I'm going to try to
keep my remarks short enough so we maybe spend

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.359
half the time
with me talking a little bit about the book,

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.539
what's in it, why I wrote
it, and a little bit about the work we do

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:21.880
at Fair Food Network.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.100
But I want to save about half the time to
hear what you â€“

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.950
what's on your mind, what questions you have,
what you're

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.399
thinking about this issue.

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.480
So you know if we're going to
create a healthy and sustainable food system

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.840
for
everybody, I would say the single -- you're

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.499
asking me
before, "what can we do?

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:43.499
What can a person do?"

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:46.689
I would
say the single most important action for somebody

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.819
to take
is to make the transformation from conscious

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.639
consumer to
engaged citizen.

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:55.249
So what do I mean by that?

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.499
So I'm 36
years old.

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.820
I'm not 36 years old right now.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.310
Most of you
aren't even there yet, right?

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.369
But when I was 36 years
old, I am lying in a hospital bed with such

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.900
a severe
flare-up of ulcerative colitis that my digestive

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.860
system
stopped functioning altogether.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.980
Lying there with an IV
in my arm being pumped full of prednisone,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.840
the doc comes
and says, "if this inflammation doesn't cool

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.310
down by the
end of the week, our only option is surgery."

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.390
So
I'm lying there faced with losing my colon

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.580
for the rest
of my life.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.550
Couple days later when the doc says, "okay,
we think you can eat something now."

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.280
In comes a tray as
I'm lying in bed.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.730
Roast beef, a pile of mashed potatoes
and some big ass piece of cake.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.811
White flour, white sugar
cake.

00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:49.840
And I look at this food and I say, "No way.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.220
I
know this is not the food I need to get my

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.230
body healthy."

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.180
So I politely send the food back pick up the
phone and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.420
call my friend and ask her, "Can you save
my life this week?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.830
Can you
make some brown rice, tofu and steamed greens

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.320
and bring
them to me in the hospital?"

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.540
So fortunately I got
better.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.510
You know, knock on wood, I'm now healthy as
can

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.090
be.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.910
But while I was lying in bed during that week
in the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.590
hospital, I was thinking about how fortunate
I was that I

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.590
both knew what I needed to eat to get my body
healthy and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.650
I had the access to what I needed.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.510
And I also thought
about all the people who either don't have

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.250
the education
and knowledge or if they have the knowledge,

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.340
they simply
don't have the access.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.680
You know, I live in Ann Arbor and
a lot of our work in Fair Food Network is

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.430
in Southeast
Michigan in the Detroit area.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.660
Now Detroit might be the
most severe situation of a food desert in

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.370
the country
where over half the population in the city

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.941
of Detroit,
the 11th largest city in the country, they

00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:58.710
don't have
access to fresh food and healthy food.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.910
In fact, since
2007 there's not a single supermarket in the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.350
city of
Detroit -- not one.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.110
But it's a situation you can find in
almost any inner city community in this country

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.040
including
parts of New York.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.930
So the question is, "why should we
care about this?"

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.560
I mean, all of us lead very busy
lives, right?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.800
And you probably have certain causes that
you care about.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.210
My hope with writing my book and with
visiting with you is that you can think about

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.009
moving the
idea of repairing the food system a few notches

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.810
higher on
your list.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.880
And you know this is why it's important to
care about it.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.770
One reason why it's important to care
about it.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.259
A few months ago I was in an audience much
like this but a little larger listening to

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.069
the executive
vice president of the largest health insurance

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.689
company in
the country.

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:02.990
Here's what he says -- he says, "we've
looked at the trends, we've run the numbers,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.130
we've done
the predictions and our numbers tell us by

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.790
2018 the cost
of treating obesity related illness in the

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.900
United States
will be 345 billion dollars a year."

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.430
He says, "when that
happens, it not only bankrupts our company,

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.740
it bankrupts
this country."

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.490
So why should you care and why do we have
to care?

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.879
Because if this happens, if that actually
happens and current trends are taking us there,

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.820
I don't
know how many of us will be able to afford

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.560
health
insurance.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.800
And the burden of all of us for paying for
health care for those who aren't insured will

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.939
be more
than we can bear.

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:50.249
And all that happens in 2018 or
somewhere down the road depending on the predictions

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.330
because we're not doing enough today to create
food

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.190
environments that enable people to access
the food to

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.330
keep them healthy.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.529
You know, you've got a great food
environment here at Google.

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.990
I know about that and it's
wonderful.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:14.259
And the point I make over and over in the
book is that we need to take the health and

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:18.379
vitality that
we gain from living in a healthy food environment

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:23.150
and
make sure that it's not just us; it's everybody.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.960
You
know, there's a lot of, in the story I'm telling

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.509
the
what's happening with obesity and diet related

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.479
illness
and food access, there's a lot of bad news.

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:30.779
I know that.

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.810
But there's actually some good news; really
good news --

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.509
I promise you.

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:39.180
Because we really are sitting in a
historic moment right now.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:46.069
A moment where the rising
tide of diet-related illness and obesity is

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:52.469
being matched
by an up-swell of resources, of ideas, and

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:53.620
of action.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.740
And
awareness on this issue.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.319
We're at a moment where we
actually know what to do about this.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.130
You know many
systems that are broken in our country, we're

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.430
not sure
what to do.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.349
How the heck do you reform health care?

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:08.009
Nobody really seems to know what to do about
that.

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:10.099
What
are we going to do about our energy systems?

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:12.159
But about
our food system -- we know what to do.

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.559
We know what a
fair food system is and how to create it.

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:18.080
And if there's
one thing you remember from what I'm saying

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.650
today, I want you to remember what I mean
by a fair food

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.650
system.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:28.819
It's a system where the food is healthy, good
for our bodies, green, grown in an environmentally

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:33.259
responsible way, fair, nobody is exploited
in that

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:34.259
system.

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:37.419
Everybody gets a piece of the economic pie.

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:38.629
And
affordable.

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:41.800
Everybody has access to the food.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.669
And we
know how to create these systems now.

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:48.930
And the way I know
that is because I can see models and examples

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.939
in
practice -- in communities and public policy--

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.419
with those
kind of features embedded in them all across

00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:56.460
the country.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.900
So we know what to do about this.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.900
That's the good news.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.680
20 years ago we didn't, but now we do.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.020
And you know it's
happening at many levels.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.969
It's happening at the policy
level.

00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:11.180
I think about the great work of our first
lady,

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.990
Michelle Obama, and her "Let's Move!" initiative
focusing on

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.990
this.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.909
And I think of the thousands of farm to school
projects happening now that are supported

00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:23.460
with federal
dollars with more federal dollars coming.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.270
It's happening
at the commercial level.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.949
And this is something I want to
spend a little bit of time with because that's

00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:32.479
the sector
where you folks live and work.

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:36.610
It's happening --
everything from Whole Foods to the increase

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.050
in the number
of farmer's markets around the country.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.610
Tripled since
the mid 90s.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.459
How many of you like going to farmer's
markets?

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:50.240
I mean, I love going to a farmer's market.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.120
Wherever I am -- whether I'm home in Ann Arbor,
or when I

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.040
travel around, if I'm there on market day,
that's where I

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.040
want to go.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.440
It's like the happiest place in any city I
go.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.440
And they're just exploding.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.050
They're on the
increase.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:11.810
But it goes beyond farmer's markets and
grocery stores.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.820
I've learned a little bit about how you
do your food service here at Google -- both

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.360
here and in
California.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.650
You know, most of the food being sourced
within 150 miles.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:26.660
A real focus on using food from local
and sustainable sources.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.709
And I think it's great that
your company and other companies are starting

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:31.750
to do this.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:37.420
And just to give you an idea -- it's starting
to happen

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.910
in a lot of places.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:44.050
You know, Dow Chemical, based in
Midland, Michigan has 43,000 employees around

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.279
the globe
and they're focusing on bringing healthier

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:50.029
food to their
employees primarily because they want to get

00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:51.519
better
health outcomes.

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:54.800
I mean, they see it as a way to reduce
their cost for health insurance.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.029
So it's smart.

00:09:57.029 --> 00:10:01.269
Another
company Bon AppÃ©tit Management Company is

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:02.449
another
interesting one to look at.

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:08.540
So they oversee food service
in more than 400 cafeterias in 31 states around

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.540
the country.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.470
They serve more than 120 million meals each
year.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.530
And they
have a company-wide goal that they are going

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:23.790
to purchase
20 percent of all of the ingredients that

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.930
they use in
those 120 million meals from farms that are

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:34.100
within 150
miles of each cafeteria that are from small,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.110
owner-operated farms or artisan food processors.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.839
And
some of the corporations that they work with

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.630
that they're
sourcing food like this Abercrombie and Fitch

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:47.310
in Ohio,
Amazon headquarters in Seattle, Ebay in San

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.310
Jose.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.920
And Medtronic headquarters in Minneapolis,
just a few.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.630
It's to me very cool to see
companies like yours and many others starting

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:01.139
to see that
this is not -- yes, it's about what they can

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:02.790
do for
employees.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.630
And employee morale and employee health.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.470
From my perspective it's also about what they're
doing

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.630
for the food system.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.860
It goes beyond individual consumers
and it starts to be an institutional practice

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:16.360
which is
what we need to be doing.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.410
You know, it's also happening
at the community level.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.560
And that's kind of a level
nearest and dearest to my heart because of

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.380
all my work in
the nonprofit sector in the foundation sector.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:31.660
Just a few examples here in New York,
in Brooklyn, there's a fantastic project called

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.660
Added
Value.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:39.350
It's a farm in red hook where youngsters are
working -- teenagers from the neighborhood

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:44.670
are working on
about a 3-acre organic farm that was created

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.180
on the top
of a ball field.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.009
And they've got a farmer's market there
so that kids are earning money and growing

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:52.449
food.

00:11:52.449 --> 00:11:55.740
I think
of Slow Food USA which has its headquarters

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.750
right here in
New York and connecting with about 200,000

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.209
people around
the country on this issue.

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:08.670
Grow NYC that supports 64
farmer's markets all across the city.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.720
And the most
significant part about Grow NYC is that out

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.850
of those 64
markets 49 of them accept what's called EBT

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.879
--
electronics benefits transfer.

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:21.940
You'll hear me talk a little bit more about
this.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.329
It's how food stamps are
used now.

00:12:24.329 --> 00:12:26.500
So we have now about 44 million people in
this

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.470
country receiving food stamps from the government.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.170
It's
the largest single flow of funds in our agriculture

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.449
--
through USDA and our agriculture department

00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:39.259
-- at the
federal level.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:44.019
Almost more than 70 cents of every dollar
we spend as a nation on agriculture is spent

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:46.269
on food
stamps.

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:52.730
And Grow NYC is making sure that the
healthy, fresh, locally grown food at farmer's

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.350
markets is
also accessible to people who are on food

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.290
stamps, who have their EBT card.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.070
So
that's just a few of the examples here in

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.450
New York and
there are many, many more.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:09.060
But in almost every case local
brilliance is really leading the way in this

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.060
movement.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.490
And it's all about innovation.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.490
All about innovation.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:20.889
And I wanted to take just a few minutes -- a
few minutes

00:13:20.889 --> 00:13:24.110
to talk to you about my experience with innovation
in

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.750
this field in a couple of different ways.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.230
So I'm
probably older than almost everybody here

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.209
but
there was a point at which I was younger than

00:13:33.209 --> 00:13:36.410
almost
everybody here when I started my career initially

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.130
as an
organic farmer.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.230
That sort of transformed into a business
opportunity for me.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.000
So I was living and working on an
organic farm out in Santa Cruz.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.890
It was out at the
University of California in Santa Cruz.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.910
In hindsight it
turned out to be one of the first -- I think

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.040
it was the
first-- student organic farm in the country.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.649
And we had 17
acres of land and there was a group of us

00:13:58.649 --> 00:14:03.339
-- we were
using French intensive methods of growing

00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:06.000
beautiful
organic vegetables.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.560
This was in the early 70s when the
sort of natural food movement was just starting

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.560
to be
seen.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.670
It was in its infancy.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.350
No such thing as Whole
Foods or even Trader Joe's.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.350
Nothing.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:23.050
It was all independently-owned stores,
restaurants that were starting to use organic

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.320
food.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.579
And
we started selling some of our food.

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:29.670
It was actually
bartering, right?

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:34.610
So the produce folks from some of
these stores would come up from the Santa

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:38.699
Cruz help us
harvest our squash and lettuce and carrots

00:14:38.699 --> 00:14:39.959
in the
morning.

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:41.899
Take them back and sell them in their store.

00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:45.360
And we would get credit in their store for
buying the

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.801
nuts and seeds and cheese and flour and other
things we

00:14:48.801 --> 00:14:49.801
needed at the farms.

00:14:49.801 --> 00:14:51.279
That's how we were surviving there.

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:56.839
One day, one of the produce managers from
one of those

00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:59.350
stores came up to the farm and while we're
harvesting

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.069
they said, "you know, we started having people
walking

00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:05.090
into our store - this is 1972-- we've got
people walking into our store asking if they

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.069
could buy alfalfa sprouts
but nobody's growing alfalfa sprouts commercially."

00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:13.560
Have
any of you grown alfalfa sprouts?

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.089
You take alfalfa seeds--.

00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:16.089
It's a really healthy
food.

00:15:16.089 --> 00:15:17.089
You take alfalfa seeds.

00:15:17.089 --> 00:15:20.689
You probably had bean
sprouts at a Chinese restaurant maybe?

00:15:20.689 --> 00:15:23.889
So alfalfa sprouts, you take an alfalfa seed,
you sprout it

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:27.389
just for a few days and it's very good source
of many

00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:29.139
vitamins.

00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:35.480
You could find them in a health food store,
but there were no sprouts being grown commercially.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.649
We took
that on and started growing alfalfa sprouts

00:15:37.649 --> 00:15:41.170
in these big jars â€“ big
sort of mayonnaise buckets with screens in

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:46.490
the bottom and delivering them to the
stores or giving them to the stores with our

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:47.550
vegetables.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.060
About a year later, most of the folks who
were working on

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.220
that farm left the project to go start farming
in

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.259
Arkansas, but I was still a California boy
and I'm not

00:15:56.259 --> 00:15:57.259
ready to go to Arkansas.

00:15:57.259 --> 00:15:59.220
I'm not ready to live in the Ozarks.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.380
So I inherited that
alfalfa sprouts business.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.949
What that means is I scraped
up the 75 dollars to buy the one bag of alfalfa

00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:09.330
seeds that we had on
hand.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.259
I inherited the buckets.

00:16:11.259 --> 00:16:13.440
I started growing the
sprouts in the buckets and delivering on the

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.490
back of my
bicycle to the three accounts.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:25.009
By about eight years
later, this was a business that had 20 employees,

00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:28.949
delivering sprouts all over northern California,
shipping

00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:31.480
into southern California, air shipping some
sprouts to

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.110
Chicago.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.709
We were the first alfalfa sprouts in the
Safeway chain of stores.

00:16:36.709 --> 00:16:41.430
I was introducing this new
product to people locally in delis to use

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.980
on sandwiches,
in restaurants to use on salad bars.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.769
I was introducing
them to the wholesale produce market.

00:16:46.769 --> 00:16:50.240
I was introducing them to
the big retail chains.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:56.420
And we were, by the time I sold
the business at the end of the 70s, we were

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.959
growing and
selling nine tons of sprouts a month.

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:02.089
Now, next time
you're in the grocery store, I want you to

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:05.770
go look at
alfalfa sprouts and you're going to see what

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:10.459
the sort of
bulk of 4 ounce package is and then do the

00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:13.640
math and
you'll get a sense of what nine tons of sprouts

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.130
a month
is.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.660
That was a big operation in those days.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.520
It was very
successful.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.059
I sold it for enough money to go back to
graduate school which I did to earn my Ph.

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:26.679
D. in agronomy
and plant genetics.

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:30.520
Because I was very interested in the
science of all this.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.779
My point in telling you the story
is that whenever people say to me, "you know,

00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:37.350
the reason
the food system is like it is and has to stay

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.409
like it is
is there are really no options.

00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:42.520
There are no options
besides doing it the way we're doing it."

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.860
And I say,
"from my experience you're wrong.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.429
There is innovation
available in every field all the time.

00:17:50.429 --> 00:17:51.429
And you all know
this.

00:17:51.429 --> 00:17:52.650
You live it.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.860
It's part of what has made your
company successful and it's what's going to

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.020
propel
success in your company and this your

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.830
individual careers.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:06.510
That's one story of innovation from
my own life in the for-profit sector when

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.539
I was younger.

00:18:07.539 --> 00:18:11.890
I also want to share with you -- did these
get handed

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:12.890
out?

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:13.890
Yeah.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.970
Let's hand these out so folks can see what
I'm talking about.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:22.870
I also want to share with you a
project that we're doing right now at the

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.200
Fair Food
Network which is the nonprofit organization

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.280
that I
founded about two years ago.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.620
So I had spent -- after
being a professor at Michigan state University,

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.500
I
had spent another career -- I guess that would

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.290
be my
third career -- at Kellogg Foundation.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.820
And at Kellogg
Foundation, I helped them develop a funding

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.840
program in
sustainable food and agriculture and was able

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.440
to fund
projects all over the country that were looking

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.429
at
innovation in the food system trying to embed

00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:54.940
some of
these principles I was just talking about

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.070
into projects
into policy into practices.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:03.549
And we were able to fund
about 200 million dollars worth of projects

00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:05.910
all over the
country and really kind of seeded this local

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.190
food
movement over a period of years.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.320
Now I'm in the
nonprofit sector and one of the signature

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.299
programs we're running at Fair Food Network,
my colleague

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:18.360
Anthony here, is our communications and policy
director and is

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.100
responsible for our beautiful communications
material.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.570
Lucinda works with us on outreach at the Fair
Food

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.220
Network.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:31.390
And this project, Double Up Food Bucks, the
way it works is that anybody who comes to

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:35.059
a farmer's
market -- participating in the program -- and

00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:37.210
right now
there's about 50 of them across the state

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.600
of Michigan
with their EBT card remember I talked about

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.140
the
electronic benefits card.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:49.020
They bring their card to a
farmer's market, swipe it at a kiosk to spend

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.549
say 20
dollars at the market that day, they will

00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:55.309
get an
additional 20 dollars of what we call double

00:19:55.309 --> 00:19:57.020
up food buck
tokens.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.200
So they spend 20 and they get 40 dollars worth
of

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.610
buying power.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:07.200
The token can only be spent on Michigan
grown fruits and vegetables.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.740
So what we're doing with
this program is we're encouraging people -- we're

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.790
incentivizing them to bring their federal
food assistance

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:20.899
dollars -- right now I talked about the percentage
of the

00:20:20.899 --> 00:20:24.130
agricultural budget federally that goes into
this.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.260
If
you look at the numbers, it's about 70 billion

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.970
dollars a
year.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.210
So we're spending about 70 billion dollars
a year

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.840
of our taxpayer money on food stamps.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.840
I don't argue with
that.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.020
I mean, people are hungry.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.340
We have responsibility to help
them eat.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:44.260
What we're missing is an opportunity to
innovate and to use that flow of federal funds

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.520
to both
encourage low income families to eat healthier.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.020
At the
same time using those exact same dollars to

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.720
support local
farmers and a local food economy.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.380
And that's what we're
doing with double up food bucks.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.770
We're demonstrating on
a statewide basis now in Michigan the feasibility

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:04.270
and
effectiveness of these kinds of monetary incentives

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.470
to do
those two things at the same time -- eat healthier

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.950
food
for your family and for your kids and support

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.210
the local
food economy and local agriculture.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.820
So far the program
is going really well.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:22.549
We're in our second of four years
of this demonstration.

00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:27.820
And at the largest farmer's
market in inner city Detroit, again the place

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.080
where
there's not a single supermarket, we saw an

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:35.140
increase from
last year -- from 2009 to 2010 -- we saw an

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:43.399
increase of
sales from the EBT card of 368 percent.

00:21:43.399 --> 00:21:46.280
So when you let
people know about a program like that and

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.399
you have it in
place, people will use it.

00:21:48.399 --> 00:21:53.039
And now, part of our work at
Fair Food Network is to share these kinds

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:56.140
of results and
this kind of innovation with our policymakers

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.431
in
Washington, D.C. because we believe we can

00:21:58.431 --> 00:22:01.570
do a lot
better job with that 70 billion dollars a

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.690
year than we're
doing right now.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:13.020
And that's part of what we'll be
working on over the next couple of years.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:20.210
So, as I'm
going around talking to people about the book

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:25.840
and what I
wrote about and why I wrote it, some people

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.390
consider it
as sort of a celebration of a publication

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.750
of a book and I
actually consider it the celebration of the

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.809
maturity of a
movement.

00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:35.899
You know, I've been at this since the early
70s.

00:22:35.899 --> 00:22:40.950
It's been my entire life career in different
forms,

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:47.049
but I'm seeing now an up-swell of concern
and excitement

00:22:47.049 --> 00:22:50.220
especially among young people about healthy
food and

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.100
sustainability in the food system like I've
never seen.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.159
So I'm really saying, "We're celebrating the
maturity of

00:22:55.159 --> 00:22:56.159
a movement.

00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:58.919
This is a movement that's coming to
maturity."

00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:02.700
It hasn't always been this way.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.220
I think
about a time about 15 years ago.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.020
I'm sitting at a coffee
shop in Atlanta.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:13.029
It's a Sunday morning and I'm waiting
for a couple of friends to come meet me.

00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:16.279
Down the street
comes Gary and Sandy and Gary can't wait to

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:17.929
hand me a
newspaper.

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:22.919
It's the New York Times magazine from that
day.

00:23:22.919 --> 00:23:26.230
And it's the -- I look at it and there's an
article

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:28.410
written by an author I'd never read before
-- Michael

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.410
Pollan.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:31.179
We've talked about this beforehand.

00:23:31.179 --> 00:23:32.320
So I see some of
you nodding.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.640
So you've been reading Michael Pollan's
work.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.650
Well, this is his first article in New York
Times

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.650
magazine.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:41.850
And it's about genetically modified potatoes
and the farmers that are growing them.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.780
And I thought to
myself, "My God, this issue is now starting

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.780
to hit
mainstream."

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.299
We had never seen even an article in New
York times about this stuff.

00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:52.490
I mean, you see it now, 15
years ago it wasn't there at all.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.909
So I practically inhaled
the article and I'm celebrating in the street,

00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:59.019
thinking, "My God, our time is coming."

00:23:59.019 --> 00:24:01.890
This issue is finally getting covered by the
press as it

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:02.890
should.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.710
So you can imagine how excited I was a couple
of

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.409
years ago when I learned that Bill Moyers
was going to be

00:24:08.409 --> 00:24:10.600
interviewing Michael Pollan.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.529
So Bill Moyers, one of the
most esteemed television journalists of our

00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:17.470
times,one
of his last episodes of Bill Moyer's Journal

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.200
he's
interviewing Michael Pollan.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.279
And Moyers is asking great
questions and Pollan is giving great answers.

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:27.750
It's a great interview and towards
the end, Moyers asks Pollan, "Okay, Michael.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.180
If you now
have the viewers convinced this food thing

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.760
is something they
should pay attention to, what's the one thing

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.929
you would
tell them to do to make a difference?"

00:24:35.929 --> 00:24:39.809
And without missing a
beat, Poland says, "Plant a garden."

00:24:39.809 --> 00:24:43.789
And I said to
myself, "Oh shit."

00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:45.970
I felt so disappointed at that
moment.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.399
I wasn't disappointed at Michael's answer.

00:24:48.399 --> 00:24:52.070
I
mean, I know how important it is to grow gardens.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.290
I grow
a garden myself at my home in Ann Arbor.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.799
I know growing
a garden can change your life.

00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:58.110
The more gardens, the better.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.909
I was so disappointed at that moment because
I realized

00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:05.580
how many important answers there are to that
question and

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:11.570
how many more voices need to be out responding
to it.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.610
Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser and the
folks who made

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:15.980
the movie, "Food, Inc."

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.750
I have the utmost respect for them.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.679
They have done a great job at pointing out
the problems

00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:26.720
and challenges with our current food system.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.940
But we have
to move beyond growing gardens.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.620
We have to take the next
step which is -- the next step in finding

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.690
solutions --
not just mapping out problems.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.850
And my belief is that
next step is this shift from conscious consumer

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.080
to
engaged citizen.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:51.400
And that's why I wrote Fair Food to
help be part of taking that next step.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.580
You know, I wrote
this book for several kinds of people.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.750
I wrote it for
folks who lead busy lives and might just have

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.610
a couple of
hours a week that they can spend on making

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:03.260
better choices in
their homes, in their communities, in their

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.260
families.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.620
I
also wrote it for people who, now all over

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.700
the country, are
getting so excited about this work that they're

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.250
putting some of
their passion into it.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:14.529
I mean, that they're really
focusing on this because this book is a resource

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:18.090
coming
from 40 years of experience in the field.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:22.190
I also wrote
it for policymakers so we can get better public

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:23.190
policy.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.440
Public policy to make sure everybody has access
to

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.910
healthy food and policy that helps farmers
reduce their

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.779
toxic chemical load on the environment and
save our

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:34.530
precious soil.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:39.679
And I wrote it from all the different
perspectives that I've had in my life.

00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:44.500
You know, farmer,
sprouts businessman, agronomist, university

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:49.860
professor
foundation program director, foundation executive.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.360
I
don't know about you -- I don't know how many

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.360
times
you're going to change your jobs and your

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.360
career.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.320
I
never thought I'd change jobs this many times.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.200
In
hindsight it's been great, because it's brought

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:04.779
so many
different perspectives into this work.

00:27:04.779 --> 00:27:09.049
So I just want to
end my comments and really encourage you to

00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:10.750
let me know
what you're thinking and any questions you

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:11.750
have.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.460
I just
want to end with another story about a time,

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.950
around 25
years ago, when a group of engaged citizens

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:21.750
changed a
system that seemed hopeless.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.070
Many people tell me, "How
the heck can you think about changing a food

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:29.210
system and
agricultural system that's so big and so entrenched?"

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.600
In
1988, you could not see a single scientist

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.899
predicting the
fall of the Berlin wall.

00:27:34.899 --> 00:27:37.620
But one year later that's
exactly what happened.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.039
It surprised everybody.

00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:42.539
But I
think about all the activists in East Germany

00:27:42.539 --> 00:27:45.720
struggling under
a system that was strangling them, a system

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.000
that wanted
to change.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.820
And then in 1989, literally those same people
picking up hammers and chisels and start banging

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.200
against a wall.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:02.190
We'll never know which brick came out to
make that wall fall down, but when it came

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.309
down, it
changed the world.

00:28:05.309 --> 00:28:10.240
For those in my generation, who lived
through that, it absolutely changed the world.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.170
The Cold
War Ended almost overnight.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.420
Shifted geopolitics.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.120
In the
same way, I think about food systems activists

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.919
many of
whom I have met and supported over time all

00:28:20.919 --> 00:28:25.289
across this
country -- farmers, chefs, students, teachers,

00:28:25.289 --> 00:28:29.380
moms,
dads, journalists, business people -- each

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:34.010
of them
working in their own way to challenge a food

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.820
system that
is not working well for us right now.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.779
Just as with the
Berlin Wall, we will never know which innovation,

00:28:41.779 --> 00:28:44.230
which
new model is the one that brings us to a tipping

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.950
point,
but it will happen sooner or later.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:53.350
I wrote my book so
it could happen sooner and not later.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.899
And I really hope
that you will take the opportunity to read

00:28:56.899 --> 00:29:02.100
it, to learn
from it, and to ask questions about it.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.409
Because this is
an ongoing process for all of us.

00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:08.100
It's the system that's
most important for all of us.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.570
It's a system on which our
life depends.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:16.149
If we don't get our food system right, I
would say anything else we're doing is less

00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:19.090
important, if
important at all.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.600
It's a system we have to get right.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.190
So now let me open it up and see what's on
your mind and

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.380
what questions you might have.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.840
Yes?

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.840
.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.200
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Okay.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.130
So I actually have two questions.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:40.870
The first
one is, "How do you define healthy food?

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.950
Because I feel that
most people -- that even if they want to eat

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:49.429
healthy, they don't know what's healthy with
so many sources of information"

00:29:49.429 --> 00:29:55.400
&gt;&gt;Oran: So like, when we talk about in
our Double Up Food Bucks program we're talking

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.710
about creating what we're calling healthy
food

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.399
incentive.

00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:00.679
And you are right.

00:30:00.679 --> 00:30:03.990
There is so
much information; it's hard to read through

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.990
it
all.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:10.620
But there is very little contradiction
that eating more fresh fruits and vegetables

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.419
in
your diet is good.

00:30:13.419 --> 00:30:18.630
That very few of us are
eating the amount that's recommended by USDA.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:24.741
And if you look at our low income communities,
you're lucky to find a lot of folks who are

00:30:24.741 --> 00:30:27.080
eating more than one or two servings a day.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.450
So
we are really focusing on fruits and vegetables

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.970
as the component of a healthy diet in our
work.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:38.280
&gt;&gt; Male #1: And the second question is actually
continued to your answer.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:43.220
So if you suggest
fruit and vegetables, do you also recommend

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:49.220
adding the incentive for keeping the animals
safe?

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:55.440
Like the environmental reasons of
growing animals or eating them.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.620
&gt;&gt; Oran: So I'm not sure if you're asking
me

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:02.049
about the idea of vegetarianism or the idea
of

00:31:02.049 --> 00:31:04.799
how to sustainably raise animals.

00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:09.400
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I mean, I believe it goes
together -- being vegetarian is helping the

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.580
environment and also keeping you healthy.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:18.480
&gt;&gt; Oran: So I've -- I mean, I've not seen
a

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.860
lot of -- as a scientist now -- I've not seen
a

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:26.020
lot of data that says vegetarianism is required
to be healthy, right?

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.560
At the same time we know
that, in general, in our society -- our western

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.780
culture -- we're eating way too much meat.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.279
As
an agronomist, which is the way I look at

00:31:36.279 --> 00:31:42.580
the
world the most, there are places where our

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:48.470
natural ecology is much better suited for
animal agriculture than for crop agriculture.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.450
In one sense, ruminant animals are pretty
miraculous.

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:57.929
All the animals that have multiple
stomachs because they can digest cellulose.

00:31:57.929 --> 00:31:59.530
We
can't.

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.880
Single stomach animals can't.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.510
And
there are places where producing grass, which

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.169
is
mostly cellulose, it's got nutrients in it

00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:10.169
but
it's mostly cellulose -- where producing grass

00:32:10.169 --> 00:32:13.899
is the absolute best ecological plan.

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:17.360
And so,
my feeling is, on those kinds of acreages,

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:22.669
we're actually better off producing animals
than we are trying to produce crops.

00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:24.929
We're
going to be able to produce systems where

00:32:24.929 --> 00:32:27.200
the
nutrients are recycled.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.519
I'm actually a
believer in integrating crops and livestock

00:32:30.519 --> 00:32:33.909
into agriculture but doing it in a way that's
more agriculturally sensitive.

00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:37.249
Thank you for
the questions.

00:32:37.249 --> 00:32:45.270
&gt;&gt; Male #2: So over here you speak about taking
us from conscious consumers into engaged

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:48.450
citizens but you're speaking to the choir
here.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:53.260
What about reaching other people even to the
point of even being conscious consumers.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:57.580
There's a lot of people out there -- again,
lives are busy or they're misinformed, a lot

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.990
of
bad information out there, a lot of marketing

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:04.149
touting vitamins and this sort of stuff instead
of actual real food.

00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:09.140
How can we get people to be
concerned and understand that this is good

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.639
for the
environment; it's good for their health and

00:33:10.639 --> 00:33:12.619
it's also most cost effective?

00:33:12.619 --> 00:33:17.860
&gt;&gt; Oran: When I say move from conscious
consumer to engaged citizen, I don't assume

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.950
that everybody are conscious consumers yet.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.440
I mean, I know that.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:29.059
The point I'm trying to
make is that the frame that we -- the way

00:33:29.059 --> 00:33:34.269
we
think about food is primarily a frame that

00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:37.710
is -- it's a relationship between me and my
plate.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:39.419
Me and my refrigerator.

00:33:39.419 --> 00:33:43.419
Or you know at
the farthest outreach, maybe me and the grocery

00:33:43.419 --> 00:33:44.840
store.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.840
And what I'm trying to do is actually shift
our

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.019
frame of reference to understand that when
we think

00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:57.850
of food -- it's sort of like when we think
about the health care system, we actually

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.710
don't
usually think about our own personal doctor.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:02.009
And when we think about what it's going to
take

00:34:02.009 --> 00:34:04.700
to reform the health care system, none of
us

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.220
think choosing different a doctor is going
to do

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.919
anything to reform health care.

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:14.800
So what I'm
trying to do is move us along in our thought

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.690
process around food where when we think about
food,

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:23.040
we're not only thinking about "my relationship
with food and the plate."

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.970
We're thinking about
the consequences of my actions, all along

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:27.970
the
system.

00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:34.169
And when you think about that then,
you know, if somebody is going to take, if

00:34:34.169 --> 00:34:39.230
I -- if a legislator is going to take the
right

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:45.629
stand on farm bill legislation, I don't really
care what they eat, tell you the truth on

00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:46.629
a
personal level.

00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:50.659
What I care is about the
actions they're taking to make our food system

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:55.040
healthier and more sustainable.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.009
Thank you for
the question.

00:34:57.009 --> 00:35:01.950
&gt;&gt; Male #3: It seems like there's a lot of,
you

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.260
know, great grass roots movements in terms
of

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:09.180
local farms and co-ops producing organic and
sustainable fruits and veggies, but it seems

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.450
like the major shift that needs to happen
is to

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.000
do this at scale so it's economically viable
so

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.510
so we can price those at competitive rates
to

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.020
factory farm produce.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.690
To your knowledge, is there any sort of example
out there,

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:24.770
of a farm that's out there doing this to a
grade

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:28.319
scale to bring this into economic viability.

00:35:28.319 --> 00:35:29.319
&gt;&gt;Oran: Yeah.

00:35:29.319 --> 00:35:35.869
So first of all, I want us to
challenge our assumptions that locally produced

00:35:35.869 --> 00:35:39.970
organic food is more expensive.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:44.750
Study just
came out of Vermont.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:47.579
Probably the study was
actually done last year, but it was just

00:35:47.579 --> 00:35:49.910
published.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:53.730
Group of students went out and
looked at -- you know did good statistics

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:54.730
with it.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:36:01.880
They looked at the price of vegetables and
fruits at farmer's markets and at the grocery

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.480
stores and supermarkets in the same
communities.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:10.099
And, for non-organic fruits and
vegetables, there was very little significant

00:36:10.099 --> 00:36:11.099
difference.

00:36:11.099 --> 00:36:15.220
There was some difference in
specific items, but there wasn't much

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.220
difference.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:20.650
For organic, the difference
between supermarket and farmer's market was

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:23.800
38
percent with the farmer's market being 38

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.589
percent lower than the supermarket.

00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:29.740
So, you
know, we have to challenge our assumptions.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:36.040
There's a lot of information out there about,
"oh, yeah -- local produce and farmer's

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.609
market -- all this stuff is so expensive,
it's only

00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:38.609
for the elite."

00:36:38.609 --> 00:36:42.319
The experience actually, when you look
at the evidence, is not so much.

00:36:42.319 --> 00:36:44.319
That's sort of
on the one hand.

00:36:44.319 --> 00:36:47.380
In terms of the example you
asked for.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:54.430
I think about friend of mine, Fred Kirschenmann,
who's farming in North Dakota, he's farming

00:36:54.430 --> 00:37:01.470
3100 acres of organic grains, seeds, and
livestock.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:05.089
And you know, if that's not scale,
I'm not sure what is.

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:10.000
So it's, you know, it
has already gone beyond small scale.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.880
And the
question of affordability -- my belief is

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.530
the
question of affordability comes down not just

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:18.859
to scaling an individual farm but scaling
a

00:37:18.859 --> 00:37:19.910
system.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:25.940
Where -- we need to be -- we know the
demand for locally grown organic and

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.020
sustainably raised food is increasing.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.670
We know
that.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:33.839
And I've worked enough with farmers to
know they're good business people.

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:37.760
And if they
recognize this demand as real, credible,

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.210
stable, they will shift their practices.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.760
This
is where institutional purchasing can come

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:50.650
in,
because companies -- institutions like schools,

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:58.640
hospitals, correctional facilities -- can
actually create contracts to purchase local

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.900
and
organic and sustainable food.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.120
And then farmers
have something that's actually -- a contract

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.089
that's bankable to borrow money to get to
scale

00:38:07.089 --> 00:38:08.089
up.

00:38:08.089 --> 00:38:12.490
One of the missing pieces we have now is
called the regional food infrastructure where

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:17.060
you have an infrastructure where 47 percent
of all

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.620
retail grocery in this country is controlled
by

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.440
four companies.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.570
And when that happens the
entire distribution system has been vertically

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.410
integrated with those companies.

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:28.690
And we need
to establish a more regional food

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:34.180
infrastructure so that each individual farmer
doesn't bear the responsibility to find the

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:39.050
individual consumer to connect with, but
there's actually a way to aggregate and

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.240
distribute.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.280
So some of the things we're
working on.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.109
Some of the activists you talk about in
your organization are working not just on

00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:49.180
the
individual level but that kind of aggregation.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.490
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Thank you.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.220
&gt;&gt; Oran: Thank you.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:57.839
&gt;&gt; Male #4: My question was actually very
similar to the previous one, but I can sort

00:38:57.839 --> 00:38:59.320
of
go off with that.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.859
In terms of the subsidies --
the government subsidies for larger farms

00:39:03.859 --> 00:39:04.960
and
stuff like that.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:10.369
I see that as a pretty large
hurdle for a smaller farm to overcome like

00:39:10.369 --> 00:39:15.109
because of the economic incentive behind that
government subsidy.

00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:20.009
So what you're sort of
alluding to is this shift, right?

00:39:20.009 --> 00:39:23.560
From
government subsidy to sort of a privatized

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.560
system like companies investing in farms.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.770
Do
you -- how do you see that -- what's the

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:36.040
incentive for that farm that was getting the
subsidy for corn or something like that

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.330
shifting to a totally different model.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.020
Maybe
they've already invested in that kind of

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.020
equipment.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.510
Is there a system out there to help
them make that transition or is that still

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.560
sort
of gray area.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.810
&gt;&gt; Oran: Well, you know as you talk about
that wouldn't it be great if we decided.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:53.950
I mean, we're
a democracy.

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:59.089
We get to decide how we spend our
tax money in the perfect world.

00:39:59.089 --> 00:40:02.460
What if we
decided rather than spending our 5 to 8 billion

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:08.971
dollars a year in subsidy money on just
supporting ten percent of the largest farmers

00:40:08.971 --> 00:40:11.630
in this country growing five crops that we
know

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.079
there's surpluses of.

00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:17.550
What if we decided we
would use some of that money to help farmers

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:20.790
transition to a kind of agriculture that we're
talking about.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:24.020
A more regional scale
agriculture producing a more diversity of

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.300
crops
doing it in environmentally friendly way.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.410
There's no reason why we can't do that.

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:31.910
I
don't advocate getting rid of subsidies

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:33.339
actually.

00:40:33.339 --> 00:40:42.530
I think that, you know, I think
about -- wasn't too long ago that we had

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:45.950
political leaders on both sides of the aisle
talk about these companies that were too big

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:48.500
to
fail, right?

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.170
And a lot of money went into
companies that we thought were too big to

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:53.170
fail.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.760
Well, rather than too big to fail, I say our
food system is too important to fail.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.430
And it's
failing a lot of us right now.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.280
In fact, if you
scratched the surface from an environmental

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.970
perspective from a perspective of how farm
workers are treated and live, this system

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.290
is
failing most of us right now.

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:12.730
So there is
nothing wrong in my view in a democracy for

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:15.950
us
to decide that we need to intervene with

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:19.110
resources of any kind into a sector that's
too

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.660
important to fail.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.000
We're just doing it in the
wrong way.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.270
We need to do more of what you're
talking about.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:29.400
The ideas you have about how to
help farmers transition to a more reasonable

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.319
and sustainable kind of production.

00:41:31.319 --> 00:41:34.110
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Just a follow up.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:38.510
Is that more of
like a community outreach in a marketing issue

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.510
as well.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:47.150
Sort of reaching out to farmers on a
local level or is that something that is

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.150
lobbying territory?

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.150
I mean.

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:50.150
[cell phone rings in background]

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:51.440
&gt;&gt; Oran: I mean, listen it's always going
to

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.270
be lobbying territory, because you got a lot
of

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:59.180
vested interest in agribusiness to have things
the way they are.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.920
So let me give you an
example.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.040
Over the last two years the Natural
Resource Conservation Service, which is an

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.220
agency of USDA, decided because, you know,
we

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:11.680
have -- we have a new scene at USDA with
president Obama and Secretary Vilsack and

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.780
Deputy Secretary Merrigan--
they're thinking very innovatively.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.880
So they
come up with this plan to use some of our

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:25.120
federal conservation dollars to support the
building of what's called High Tunnels or

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.500
Hoop
Houses so in northern climates like here,

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.000
local
food is great right now.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.380
It will be great till
about Thanksgiving time, right?

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.450
And then from
December through May or so, there's not much

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:39.450
there.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:43.240
But there are great technologies that
have been developed that -- they're called

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.240
High
Tunnels.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.560
Just big plastic.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:52.550
Might be the
length of this room, literally a hoop with

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:54.359
greenhouse grade plastic over it.

00:42:54.359 --> 00:42:58.140
And there
are ways to extend the growing season without

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.470
any exogenous source of energy.

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:01.470
So you don't
have to heat them.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:04.750
The reradiation from the
soil takes care of that.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:06.790
There's ways to grow
crops in there.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:13.840
So the USDA is now giving grants --
cost share grants -- to farmers all across

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.690
the
country, in the northern part of the country,

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:17.230
to build these hoop houses.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.869
I think that's
great use of our government funding.

00:43:19.869 --> 00:43:21.170
It's
extending the growing season.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.910
It's helping to
create some of this more regional

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.460
infrastructure for production.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:28.670
I just think we
need more innovation like that in our policies.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:29.969
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Thank you.

00:43:29.969 --> 00:43:31.170
&gt;&gt; Oran: Thank you.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:32.380
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Hi.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.380
&gt;&gt;Oran: Hi

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:37.880
&gt;&gt; Male #5: So I was listening to this article
or this story on NPR a month back.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:42.280
Somebody
was criticizing the local and slow food movement.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:46.420
I don't remember his name, unfortunately,
but

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.720
realizing that this transition wouldn't take
place overnight, I'm wondering if there's

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.480
any validity to the argument that the guy
was making that there's not enough

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.100
local farmers producing food to feed everybody.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:00.819
Do you know if there's any truth to that,
like if we were all to switch right now, would

00:44:00.819 --> 00:44:03.690
there be enough on the supply side to meet
the demand?

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:09.000
&gt;&gt; Oran: Well, I mean, not tomorrow there
wouldn't be, but again, my experience working

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
directly with farmers.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.320
I spent a good 15 years
working in extension in Michigan where I was

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.300
directly working with farmers and extension
agents

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.300
throughout the state.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.370
And I got to know
farmers.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.910
I was farming myself when I was
younger.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:25.450
Farmers are good business people.

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:28.000
If
there's a demand there, they'll figure out

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.589
how
to fill it.

00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:38.230
If we try -- if we just said,
"Could we make the switch tomorrow?"

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:39.400
Absolutely not.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:44.460
But if we said to ourselves,
"Is there a vision for what our future food

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.040
system needs to look like so it's
environmentally healthy, it's healthy for

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.390
our
communities, it's healthy economically, and

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:52.809
then start moving towards that with policy
and

00:44:52.809 --> 00:44:53.809
practice.

00:44:53.809 --> 00:44:54.900
Absolutely, there's no reason why we
can't.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:45:00.190
And I don't advocate for a wholesale
switch.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:04.140
But right now, we have not -- about 98
percent of our food system is highly

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:09.530
concentrated highly specialized highly
globalized and about two percent of it is

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:11.569
the
kind of system that we're talking about -- more

00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:15.089
localized, more diverse, more environmentally
sound.

00:45:15.089 --> 00:45:19.170
You know, I would be pleased as punch
if, within my lifetime we saw a shift from

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:20.580
2
percent to 20 percent.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.860
That would be huge.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:23.950
It
would change the landscape of food and

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:24.950
agriculture.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:28.740
So, when people bring up
arguments about how, "Well, we can't even

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.800
start
to make the change because you can't do it

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.859
100
percent."

00:45:32.859 --> 00:45:34.680
I think it's a spurious argument.

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.040
I
think it's a deflection and I think we ought

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.000
to
dismiss it and say, "Fine, maybe we can't

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.200
do
100%, but I bet you we can do 20."

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.430
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Thank you.

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:44.040
&gt;&gt; Oran: Thank you.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.040
Emily?

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.460
&gt;&gt; Female #1: So my question is, if we are
all to

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:54.359
become engaged citizens, say we all go back
to our

00:45:54.359 --> 00:45:56.851
desks and decide to do something.

00:45:56.851 --> 00:45:57.851
What -- this
sounds like a pointed question but I promise

00:45:57.851 --> 00:45:58.851
you it's not -- what are
the two or three things we can do.

00:45:58.851 --> 00:46:00.970
Is it to write to a
local legislator and say, "Support these changes

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:02.160
in the farm bill?"

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.190
Is it to volunteer in Red Hook at their garden?

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:09.130
What
is it exactly we can do today or next week

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:10.130
or next weekend or whatever?

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:12.300
What are the things
we can actually look into to start doing as

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:16.170
we are inspired
by your book and your work.

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:20.230
&gt;&gt; Oran: You know what I say is that it's
important to start where you are.

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:22.980
And that's
why I would never say, "Everybody should do

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.290
this or this or this."

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:29.640
I would say that if
you're a parent and you have youngsters in

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:34.809
school and you care about the food that they're
eating and being fed in school, that's where

00:46:34.809 --> 00:46:36.599
you ought to engage.

00:46:36.599 --> 00:46:39.339
You should start getting
together with other parents.

00:46:39.339 --> 00:46:44.720
And learning
about how the school food service works.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.830
Where
they're sourcing their food.

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:48.070
And try to make a
few small changes.

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:49.599
Start small.

00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:53.410
If you're a college
student, I would say the place to start would

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:58.660
be getting in touch with the Real Food
Challenge which is working to shift 20 percent

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:06.540
of the 5 billion dollars that are college
university cafeterias are spending nationwide.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:12.579
If you live in an area that is rapidly
urbanizing, --so I'm talking about people

00:47:12.579 --> 00:47:14.579
who
live in suburbs--rapidly urbanizing.

00:47:14.579 --> 00:47:18.130
I say, look
into farmland preservation policy.

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:20.200
There's
some examples in the book where that's

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.460
happening and how to do it.

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.109
You've got great
opportunities right here in New York, as Emily

00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:28.140
says, to volunteer with organizations.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.510
To spend
your time and money supporting organizations.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:31.540
They are all over this city.

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.569
This city is rich
with organizations that are working to help

00:47:34.569 --> 00:47:36.780
make the kind of change we're talking about
here.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.680
And they all need volunteers.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.880
They all
need financial support.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.810
So there's no lack of
those kinds of opportunities.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.480
And many
directories.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.470
And there's a directory in the
back of my book.

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:53.390
And we're right now
developing our online directory at our website

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:59.720
so that organizations that are not listed
in

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.160
the book -- it's in the chapter ten of the
book--

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.970
where I list all these organizations but that
want people to know about them can

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.849
self-populate this directory that I'm building
on this website.

00:48:09.849 --> 00:48:13.220
So people can find each
other.

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:16.770
Something else you are uniquely
qualified to do because you live in New York

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:22.069
and that is you have a senator, Senator Gillibrand
who really cares about these issues.

00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:27.829
She
is on the senate agricultural committee and

00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:30.020
is
going to be one of the people who is helping

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:34.760
consider the reauthorization of the Farm Bill
which is the place where the subsidies happen.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.200
The places where these Hoop House resources
happen.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.030
The place where our food stamp
expenditures happen.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:45.250
So one thing everybody
can definitely do is let your own Senator

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:49.079
Gillibrand know that you care about these
issues and

00:48:49.079 --> 00:48:52.120
you want to support her to support the kinds
of

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.609
policies that we're talking about and that
I'm writing about.

00:48:54.609 --> 00:48:57.380
So these
are a few things people can do here.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.680
&gt;&gt; Female #1: And I just have one more question.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.940
Just because I think it's such a great program,
the

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:02.940
Double Up Food Bucks.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:06.660
After the four years demonstration that you're
doing now in Michigan, are there plans to

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.920
expand that to area like New York or D.C.,
or Philly, or

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:10.920
places.

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.660
&gt;&gt; Oran: Right now there are some other
programs.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.330
There's something happening in
Philly.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:15.809
There's something in New York; it's called
Health Bucks.

00:49:15.809 --> 00:49:18.380
It's
something different.

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:22.040
We are working now
partnering with organizations all over the

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.400
country that are supporting these programs.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:29.350
And we are doing an nationwide
evaluation and creating what we saying is

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.160
a policy
education process.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.270
So there will be some
lobbying involved, but it's mostly education.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:39.109
And our intention is that when the next farm
bill is reauthorized, we want to bring some

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:43.120
federal dollars flowing into this
kind of incentive work so it is not only being

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.160
financed by nonprofit money.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.980
So tell your
Senator Gillibrand that you think healthy

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:51.901
food
incentives are a great idea and you want her

00:49:51.901 --> 00:49:54.520
to
support them in the next farm bill.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.970
That's a
very specific thing you can do and something

00:49:56.970 --> 00:49:57.970
she can help with.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:59.200
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Thank you.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.289
&gt;&gt; Oran: Thank you.

00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:04.069
&gt;&gt; Female #2: [inaudible question]

00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:09.630
&gt;&gt; Female #2: The healthy food incentives
-- so is

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:12.410
that an educational component?

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:18.010
Because I do
feel like lower income people fill that healthy

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:19.760
food is just for wealthy people.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.730
And farmer's
markets are for wealthy people.

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:26.990
So is there
that educational component that no, it is

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:30.970
affordable and using your dollars there can
go a long way.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:31.970
&gt;&gt; Oran: Absolutely.

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:35.890
I am not at all a
believer in, "if you build it, they will come."

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:37.440
I'm sorry Anthony had to leave.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:46.329
He had to take
a train back to DC, but he has really been

00:50:46.329 --> 00:50:47.640
working hard with communications.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.109
So our
communications around this includes direct

00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:57.420
mail, very bright and colorful engaging
postcards.

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:03.410
To every person who is receiving
food stamps in Detroit, Flint, Grand Rapids

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:04.530
and
Lansing, Michigan.

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:08.790
The four biggest city in the
state, three times during the summer telling

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:10.730
them about the program and how to access it.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:13.160
We
have radio running in those places.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.410
We have
billboards, this summer it will be 50 billboards,

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:19.230
all up over Detroit and other areas
telling people about it.

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:21.369
We're doing bus signs.

00:51:21.369 --> 00:51:23.299
And
in addition we're working in a more grass

00:51:23.299 --> 00:51:24.420
roots
way.

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:31.349
We actually hired people in those
communities, working with churches, working

00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:34.180
barbers and beauticians to really get the
word out about

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.829
this program.

00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:40.870
The one assumption that I hear
you say that I would challenge, from our own

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:44.690
research, is that folks in these low income
communities don't understand what healthy

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:45.799
food
is.

00:51:45.799 --> 00:51:47.180
They really do.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.609
&gt;&gt;Female #2: No, I don't assume they don't
understand.

00:51:48.609 --> 00:51:53.170
I just think that they might not
think that it's accessible.

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:55.200
&gt;&gt; Oran: They know it's not accessible.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.530
That's the issue.

00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:58.890
We've done the focus group
work.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:02.109
We've done the interview work.

00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:05.130
Most
people in our low income communities of color

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:08.180
understand that lack of access to healthy
fresh

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:12.170
food is, in essence, a social justice issue.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:13.809
They see it as nutritional red lining.

00:52:13.809 --> 00:52:15.660
That's
what I call it.

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:20.970
A generation ago we had red
lining in terms of home mortgages, right?

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:24.059
They
were literally like mortgage banks would draw

00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:27.230
red lines around communities that they would
not lend to.

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:29.500
And it was almost always low
income communities of color.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.650
And that's one
reason why home ownership was much lower there.

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:33.880
That's an illegal practice.

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.410
You can't do that
anymore.

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:39.030
But from my perspective we have, in
essence, nutritional red lining.

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:43.869
We have whole
vast areas in our inner cities where

00:52:43.869 --> 00:52:49.049
conventional food retail is basically said,
"we're out of here."

00:52:49.049 --> 00:52:50.140
And we got to do
something about that.

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:54.390
It's not to our own
benefit to let that happen.

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:56.151
But we have --
you're right -- we have to let people know

00:52:56.151 --> 00:53:01.880
about this program and we're doing it in every
way we know how and every way we can afford.

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:06.230
&gt;&gt; Female #2: And one more question -- is
local

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:11.119
more sustainable or seasonal more of a
sustainable food?

00:53:11.119 --> 00:53:13.800
&gt;&gt; Oran: Well, if you think about it, they
go

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:14.800
together.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:15.800
Right?

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.460
Because if you're going to
eat local, you're going to be eating seasonal.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:26.630
So in some respects, if you think more about
eating seasonally, it is automatically going

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:30.410
to
to drive toward eating food that's produced

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:33.570
more in the area where you're living.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:34.570
Thank
you.

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:36.270
&gt;&gt; Female #3: That's it.

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:39.520
That's all we have time
for.

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.490
Thank you for coming today.

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:42.490
&gt;&gt; Oran: Thank you.

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:42.491
[Applause]
