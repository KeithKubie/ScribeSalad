00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.300
Hello.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.300
Hi.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.300
Hii.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.200
So how’s it going?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.300
Good, you know

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.300
What?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.400
Better today.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.400
Mm-hmm.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400
Good.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
Great.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.000
So I want to ask you some questions about
"The Lovers."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Yes.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Mm-hmm.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.680
Now some of the equipment
was purchased by Canon for you.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.680
Yes.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.190
So will you have the laser disc players?

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.190
Yes.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.420
And you will have the projectors?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.420
Yes.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.489
And you will have the slide players?

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:58.590
Yes.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.700
Ok.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.610
So, there still is a chance you would have
to do it for nine meters, not ten.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.610
Mm-hmm.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.259
So that would take you how long to install,
including the modification?

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.259
Yes.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.420
You know, we're not clear how much you have
to reprogram.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.690
Ten meters is just we've done it, so we are
sure about it.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.690
Right.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:44.260
But doing it in nine meters, it's possible,
but you know, it's something we are not sure of.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.899
Okay.

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.550
I wanted to ask you some questions about the
content itself.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:59.820
Do you consider the viewer or the participant
to be a voyeur, not a lover?

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.820
Pardon?

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.970
Is the viewer more a voyeur, more someone
who looks?

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.970
More what?

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.929
It's a French word.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.929
Voyeur.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:11.929
Voyeur.

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:12.929
Means what?

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:23.170
It means the viewer is really someone who
is looking, not someone who is a lover also.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.850
I can't get the question.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.850
OK.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.360
With the word, "lovers," what kind of lovers
are you...

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.700
It's very...

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.190
It should be broad.I mean...

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.200
Once I thought...

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:48.140
I considered the title, "The Lovers," as a
title, I was thinking that the sense of the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.640
word, "lovers," is becoming more and more
exclusive in recent days.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.640
Mm-hmm.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.210
I mean, maybe in America too, but especially
in Japan, there are two persons, a man and

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.510
a woman, get together and get married, and
make their home.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.940
And those go one more preserved, conservative,
and they make their own home and their own

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.940
happiness.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.770
And they become, you know, don't care about
the outside of their home.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.770
Mm-hmm.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.140
Of course, "The Lovers" is a very positive
term, but nowadays it becomes...

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:39.290
For me it became a very negative term to me,
but it's considered as a positive term.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:48.700
And I thought we can be in a way more promiscuous,
you know, being lovers with many things.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:56.540
And it doesn't have to be with a person.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:10.900
It can be with other matter or something

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.700
Mm-hmm.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.859
And then with the piece, because the lovers
are quite alone, so there's...

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.919
I don't know if "alienation" is the right
word.

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:22.919
Um.

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:23.919
Because they're separate.

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:24.919
Yes.

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.320
And they're going to come together very briefly.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.260
But even when they're together, they're very
alone.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Mm-hmm.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.360
Hmm, maybe that's my impression.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.360
Uh-hmm.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360
My perspective.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360
Ah, uh-hmm.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360
Yeah.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:45.189
I think, yeah, that part is most sensitive
as an emotional person for me. ...to those

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:54.879
images are transparent and when they get together,
they can see through to each other.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:00.030
And they never make one figure, you know.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:09.029
It's see-through and transparent, and it's
projected from different projectors.

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:10.409
Mm-hmm.

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:19.680
And there is a possibility for them to separate
again and meet again, because they are independent.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.680
Yeah.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.259
And then of course, for the ordinary person,
they won't know that one character is you.

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.999
That's not a big deal, is it?

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:31.520
I mean, it's not a self-portrait.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.150
Or do you…

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:47.719
I don’t know

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:59.870
Because when I talk to Bill Viola or Gary
Hill, often they're in the piece too.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.960
Mm-hmm.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.529
Both talk it in different ways.

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:07.189
Bill will talk about that's the way he works.

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:15.569
Of course, he is his most readily available
subject, but he is in the process, in the

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:16.569
making.

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:17.569
It is him.

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.879
And Gary talks about it in a little different
way, but...

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:24.249
What am I trying to say?

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:25.580
Yeah.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:37.279
I think in that way we are very parallel,
because many artists don't want, you know,

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.050
the figures of themselves in a piece.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:45.490
They want to make a certain distance from
the object that they make.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:57.729
I'm quite interested in projecting myself
and seeing it from the distance, as an artist.

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:09.639
Like if I'm the painter and I paint myself,
self-portrait, you know, the brush and my

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:16.669
hand is directly connecting, and what I paint
is what I think, direct, very direct.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:23.389
I mean, through technology I expect something,
something that I've never seen.

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:26.849
But it's something unclear to me.

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:32.620
That's why I want to deal with something like
that.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:45.330
And if I don't put myself in it, the technology
becomes more toys, or something like that.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:59.020
You know I if i put myself in image then the
technology can get inside me.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:07.599
If i put myself in image i become more myself,
so you know in that way technology can become

00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:13.340
kind of a circuit to explore myself .

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.259
Uh-hmm, good.

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:23.550
You said some good things.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.729
So, so I can go away and write more.
