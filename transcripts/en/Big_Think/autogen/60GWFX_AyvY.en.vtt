like on little cards on the table and
and it was something that was just a

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110
and it was something that was just a
 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.260

member as extended family members who
 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.839
member as extended family members who
maybe are more conservative that was

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849
maybe are more conservative that was
 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.720
maybe are more conservative that was
kind of a radical thing for them to hear

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730
kind of a radical thing for them to hear
 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.759
kind of a radical thing for them to hear
and that seemed more active to us and

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769
and that seemed more active to us and
 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.770
and that seemed more active to us and
were activists to us than not doing

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780
were activists to us than not doing
 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.059
were activists to us than not doing
anything so that was the right decision

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069
anything so that was the right decision
 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.650
anything so that was the right decision
for us it certainly doesn't change

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660
for us it certainly doesn't change
 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.330
for us it certainly doesn't change
anything that's going on in the world

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340
anything that's going on in the world
 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.220
anything that's going on in the world
and it certainly doesn't make marriage a

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230
and it certainly doesn't make marriage a
 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.500
and it certainly doesn't make marriage a
fair institution or a not sexist

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510
fair institution or a not sexist
 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.020
fair institution or a not sexist
institution but it was the way we went

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030
institution but it was the way we went
 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.850
institution but it was the way we went
about it

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860
 
 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.090
 
you know I think that that almost all

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100
you know I think that that almost all
 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.910
you know I think that that almost all
traditional institutions are are sexist

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920
traditional institutions are are sexist
 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.260
traditional institutions are are sexist
and they're probably racist and

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270
and they're probably racist and
 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.550
and they're probably racist and
homophobic and they're all of these

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560
homophobic and they're all of these
 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.860
homophobic and they're all of these
things and but a lot of them like

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870
things and but a lot of them like
 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.570
things and but a lot of them like
marriage are too embedded into the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580
marriage are too embedded into the
 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.250
marriage are too embedded into the
culture to give up like people are not

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260
culture to give up like people are not
 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.890
culture to give up like people are not
going to give up marriage but we can try

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900
going to give up marriage but we can try
 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.420
going to give up marriage but we can try
to make it more fair we can try to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430
to make it more fair we can try to
 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.310
to make it more fair we can try to
change that institution and and make it

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320
change that institution and and make it
 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.310
change that institution and and make it
more equal and I do think that's

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320
more equal and I do think that's
 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.810
more equal and I do think that's
happening I do think that people are

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820
happening I do think that people are
 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.000
happening I do think that people are
what are aware of that and I think that

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010
what are aware of that and I think that
 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.390
what are aware of that and I think that
that's really the best we can do
