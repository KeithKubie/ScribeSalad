00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.890
Working for Figurative Peanuts and Literal
Beer

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:14.660
For most people, saying “a monkey could
do my job” is a roundabout way of saying

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.520
that their current position of employment
isn’t exactly that mentally taxing.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.480
For James Wide though, it was more of a statement
of fact because for 9 years in the late 19th

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.110
century, his job of railroad signalman at
Uitenhage station in South Africa was literally

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.250
done by a chacma baboon called Jack.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.539
Jack came to prominence thanks to a tragic
event in 1877 when his eventual owner, James

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.730
Wide, lost both of his legs in a horrific
accident.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.120
Prior to the accident, Wide had worked for
Cape Government Railways as a guard.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.409
During his tenure as a railway guard, Wide
developed a knack for jumping between and

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.999
onto moving trains, which earned him the wholly
unimaginative nickname, “Jumper”.

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.249
If you’re thinking that Wide’s habit of
jumping between moving trains had something

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:04.420
to do with him eventually losing both of his
legs, you’re absolutely correct.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.200
After mis-timing a jump between two trains,
Wide landed on the tracks and was unable to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.940
move in time to stop the 80 ton car from crushing
his shins and feet.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.430
The damage was so extensive that Wide’s
legs had to be amputated at the knees, leaving

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.400
him crippled and of little use to the company.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.130
Not to be dissuaded, after recovering from
his injuries, Wide carved himself a pair of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.490
peg legs and begged his superiors at the railway
company to give him a job.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.890
Wide’s pleas didn’t fall on deaf ears
and he was given the job of signalman, which

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.500
basically put him in charge of conveying information
to conductors via the various signals placed

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.520
on the tracks, among other similar duties.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.440
Although the job required little physically
strenuous activity, since all of the signals

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.600
were controlled by a series of levers that
Wide could reach from a chair, he still had

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.910
troubled getting to and from work.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.950
To help with this, the ever industrious Wide
made himself a trolley that he could sit on.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.860
Even with the trolley, getting to work was
still a hugely tiring endeavour for Wide and

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.930
for a while, he struggled with this task until,
according to a July of 1890 edition of the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.379
science journal, Nature, Wide spotted the
fuzzy solution to all of his problems- a baboon

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.269
leading an oxen cart at his local market in
1881.

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.349
A curious Wide struck up a conversation with
the animal’s owner and learned that along

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.299
with being trained to obey a few simple commands,
the baboon, who was called “Jack”, was

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.780
sufficiently strong enough to push and pull
relatively heavy loads.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.090
jack-the-signalman3Upon learning this, Wide
asked the owner if he’d be willing to part

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.120
with the animal so that he could train it
to push him to and from work.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.010
The owner, perhaps moved by Wide’s condition
or maybe Wide just offered a price he couldn’t

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.720
refuse, for whatever reason agreed to give
up ownership of Jack.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.450
Again according to Nature, before the two
men parted ways, the owner explained to Wide

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.749
that he should give Jack a “tot of good
Cape brandy” every night if he wanted him

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:58.640
to work, as without it, the baboon would spend
the next day sulking and would even become

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640
disobedient.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.219
(This is similar to the famous circus elephant,
Jumbo, who would reportedly get very annoyed

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.060
if his trainer forgot to give him a bottle
of beer before he went to sleep).

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.529
Initially Wide simply trained Jack to push
his trolley (which had been designed by Wide

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:16.420
to fit on train tracks) along the half mile
section of track between his house and the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.779
signal box he worked in.

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.650
It wasn’t long though before Wide realised
that Jack was a lot smarter than he’d assumed

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.700
and could be trained for other tasks.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.230
For example, one of Wide’s duties involved
grabbing a key to the coal store from a locked

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.790
box and delivering it to train drivers when
they tooted their whistles four times.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.810
After only a few days of working together,
Jack picked up on this and soon began grabbing

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.480
the key before Wide could whenever he heard
the appropriate number of whistles and delivered

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.480
it himself.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.430
jack-the-signalman4With a bit of training,
Jack also learned to operate the levers in

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.099
the signal box that controlled which section
of track a train would travel on as it passed

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.989
by, similarly picking up on the audio cues
given by drivers.

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.299
While the system itself wasn’t that complicated,
consisting of a few levers that controlled

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.980
certain pieces of track that would be pulled
in a certain order based on whether a driver

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.579
tooted one, two or three times, and is something
you could probably train a dog to do with

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.060
the right setup, Jack had something dogs don’t
have- opposable thumbs, which made him a bit

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.359
more useful with the equipment at hand.

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.150
Jack soon became a familiar figure at the
signal hut and drivers didn’t take long

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.639
to become accustomed to the unusual sight
of a disabled man and a baboon working in

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.560
tandem whenever they passed through Uitenhage
station.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.740
As you can imagine though, some passengers
weren’t exactly enthused with the idea of

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.710
their lives literally being in the hands of
a baboon, and after one particular member

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.860
of the public caught sight of Jack in the
signal hut, a complaint was filed and the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.090
pair were unceremoniously fired.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.139
Wide appealed to the company to reconsider
their decision, arguing that Jack actually

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.509
knew what he was doing.

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.729
After several more workers stepped forward
to argue that, in their experience, Jack was

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.990
doing a pretty decent job prior to being fired
, the company begrudgingly agreed to give

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.450
the baboon a test.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.509
Wanting to make sure Jack could handle even
the most complicated of scenarios, the test

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.379
was structured such that they played a series
of rapidly changing whistles at Jack after

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:13.620
placing him in front of a set of levers with
the same layout as those in the signal hut.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.050
Jack passed this test without making a single
mistake and he and Wide were given their jobs

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.050
back.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.340
Since Jack was now an official employee of
the company, instead of just a pet Wide brought

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:30.080
to work, Nature reported he was given a salary
of 20 cents per day (about $5 today), daily

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.409
rations and a beer on Saturdays.

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.349
Hiring Jack proved to be a smart move for
the company since not only did they get a

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.129
tourist attraction that brought people from
all over to ride their trains to see the baboon,

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:46.629
but they also got a fiercely loyal guard with
imposing baboon arms to chase away vandals

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.009
and trespassers.

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.229
Besides signal operator and occasional guard,
during his time with the company, Jack was

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.509
also reportedly trained to clean, move railway
sleepers, garden and was officially put in

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.970
charge of the keys to the coal yard.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.520
Unfortunately, Jack met and untimely end when
he contracted and died from consumption in

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.750
1890 (see: Why Tuberculosis was Called Consumption),
which interestingly enough “Old World”

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.190
monkeys like Jack are highly susceptible to,
unlike “New World” monkeys.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:28.199
In total, Jack worked for the railway company
for about nine years before his death.
