00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.229
It sounds absurd when stated baldly, but we
do not always – at some deep level – understand

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:12.780
that we need to speak to those whom we so
badly wish would understand us. We long for

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.680
our intentions to be known, for our moods
to be honoured, for our states of mind to

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.090
be read – but we do not for that matter
want to speak or particularly see an urgent

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.349
need to do so. We want to be guessed at, intuited,
read by a kind of magic we don’t realise

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.100
we believe in. We want people to know what
we have not bothered to tell them. We may

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.840
even, in certain moods, suspect that they
know full well what we think and want – but

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.660
are deliberately frustrating us in order to
score points and humiliate us. The only explanations

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.470
for them not having guessed already is rudeness,
a lack of love or extreme stupidity. We think

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.640
like this not because we are evil; we are
stubbornly mute because we were, for a short

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.610
but profound length of time infants. In other
words, for a significant stretch, we were

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.549
in the odd position that we could not utter
a word. Others had to guess what was on our

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.780
minds. And most importantly, for a while,
they more or less got it right. They listened

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.820
to our crying, they witnessed our angry faces,
they saw our outstretched arms; they had a

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.820
shot at guessing and they got it right. They
fetched some milk, they picked up nounou from

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.820
the floor, they put us on their shoulder and
walked us around the living room – and we

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.979
felt calm and satiated. They were not geniuses
at interpersonal understanding, they guessed

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.310
correctly because it was easy. The things
we needed back then were so uncomplicated

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.329
and so limited: food and drink, clean clothes,
sleep, hygiene and reassurance. It is this

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.000
ancestral memory of successful mind-reading
that has the paradoxical effect of making

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.259
us more isolated and intemperate than we need
to be in later life. We keep expecting that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.619
a process which unfolded successfully when
we were young might continue to occur – even

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.310
though we have grown infinitely more sophisticated
in what we need to be understood for. We don’t

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.639
just need the milk and a cuddle, we now need
people to understand how our diary is looking

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:07.950
next week, what the hand we put around them
in bed means, how the kitchen should be left,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.110
where the towels need to hang, how the document
should get back to the NY office, who should

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.420
have the remote control and how we feel about
their mother. And we want them to know all

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.520
this not on the basis of careful and slow
instructions and eloquent, patient and playful

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.860
disquisitions, but immediately, just like
that, on the basis that they are intelligent

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.550
and that they care for us. And if they don’t
understand, then there might be cause to shout,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.690
to accuse them of laziness or a lack of affection
or to fire them. We are terrible communicators

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.480
because we refuse to accept the dignity, necessity
and complexity of the act of communication.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.050
We wander the earth with the problems of sophisticated
adults insisting on believing that we are

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.440
as easy to understand as infants.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.640
