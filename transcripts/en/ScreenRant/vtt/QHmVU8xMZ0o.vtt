00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.530
There's no better hero to love than a super-powered
one, so it makes sense that every year sees

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.539
more comic book blockbusters hit the screen
- and bring even more incredible mistakes

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.070
and errors along with them.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.750
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Biggest Mistakes
in Superhero Movies.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.250
Guardians of the Galaxy
The tears started flowing when Star Lord read

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.609
his mother's last goodbye, but when filming
the scene, Chris Pratt actually got to hear

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.930
a recording of the lines - recorded that day.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.680
The prop was already made, which means the
goodbye note and the voiceover don't match

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.960
up.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.809
A big mistake any speed-reading fan would
catch.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.520
Captain America: The Winter Soldier
The directors wasted no time in showing how

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.949
effective Cap had become in the modern era,
taking down a ship full of enemies almost

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:57.949
singlehandedly.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.179
Even if he's able to jump from an airplane
into the ocean without injury, the fact that

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.690
he emerges completely dry is going a bit too
far.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.840
Considering how grounded the rest of the movie
was, it's a ridiculous oversight.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.760
Once the movie's villain reveals himself,
things spin out of control fast.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.020
Things go from bad to worse when Cap gets
tossed into a city bus, which flips when it's

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.020
struck by another vehicle.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.670
It's an impressive stunt, but when you take
a closer look at the massive crash, and the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.510
lack of actual damage, it's actually the movie's
funniest moment, sending the bus flipping

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.050
but barely denting the metal.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.390
Man of Steel
Actor Henry Cavill packed on a ton of muscle

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.790
for the role, but it's Superman's superhuman
strength that makes him impossible to beat.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.430
Or, when he's dealing with a group of rowdy
bar patrons, impossible to even move.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.530
It's one of the film's most understated gags...

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.720
But it causes a problem.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.710
When Clark was almost killed aboard a fishing
vessel earlier in the movie, one of his shipmates

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.110
can push him out of the way like any other
human.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:02.660
The Dark Knight Rises
When you're making a movie about Batman's

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.090
last fight, who has time to worry about traffic
lights cooperating with filming?

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.690
Fans could probably buy Catwoman speeding
through a red light in Bruce Wayne's stolen

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.611
Lamborghini, but the rest of the traffic pretending
it's green makes a production oversight a

00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:19.660
lot more likely.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.190
The GCPD become the real heroes of the movie
when they square off against Bane's army in

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.410
downtown Gotham.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.670
It's a memorable moment, made even more unforgettable
by the crew member coming out of a subway

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.810
station before realizing he's just walked
into the shot.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.530
Luckily, he's missing from the next one.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.280
Ant-Man
If you had a hard time grasping the science

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.430
behind Marvel's Ant-Man, you're not alone.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.140
And you're not wrong, either.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.960
The Superhero is made possible by Pym Particles,
allowing a person or object to shrink, but

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.450
keep the same amount of mass and energy - just
shrinking the spaces between its atoms.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.890
It makes enough sense, but when you consider
Hank Pym has been walking around with a full

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.950
size tank in his pocket, and Darren Cross
lifts a lamb with only two fingers, the science

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.180
doesn't add up.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.120
Deadpool
It's a single matchstick from the villain

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.950
Angel Dust that helps Wade Wilson escape his
torture at the hands of the movie's villains.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.730
The match is used to ignite and detonate oxygen
tanks, but oxygen itself isn't actually flammable.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.010
Seeing the match burn a bit brighter would
have been scientifically accurate, but...

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.500
a lot less exciting.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.260
The Avengers
Since it launched Marvel's shared movie universe,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.160
the Post-Credits scene from the first Iron
Man will probably be the most famous of all

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.840
time.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.900
Which means the hilarious mistake in it isn't
going anywhere either.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.990
Look closely: it isn't just Nick Fury waiting
to surprise Tony Stark at the end of the movie,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.510
but the crew member clearly reflected in the
picture frames on the wall.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.290
Once you see it, you'll wonder how you ever
missed it.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.740
The Avengers: Age of Ultron
When the Avengers are rescuing innocent civilians

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.880
from Ultron, Thor and Cap team up to violently
throw one woman to safety.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.270
But Cap's powers are even better than fans
realized, since he grabs the woman with BOTH

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.120
arms - and still manages to keep them hanging
on the entire time.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.489
He's been holding out on us.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.849
Those are some of the most amazing mistakes
and goofs in our favorite superhero movies,

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.750
but which ones have we missed?
