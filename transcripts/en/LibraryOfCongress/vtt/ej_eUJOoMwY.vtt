00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.210
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Our
guest this evening,

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.510
as you know, is Amor Towles.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.600
[ Applause ]

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.050
He told me last night that he was
afraid that being last at the end

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.730
of the day that nobody would come.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.030
Turn around.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.380
The room is completely packed.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.180
Amor worked for 20 years as
an investment banker until,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.330
like so many investment bankers
before him, he began to pine

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.570
for the financial security
of being a novelist.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.870
Don't laugh.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.090
In 2011, his debut novel, Rules
of Civility, was a breakout hit.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.500
And his wonderful new novel,
A Gentleman in Moscow,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.130
is still on the Washington
Post best seller list,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.510
though it was published
last September.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.870
If you've read it, you know why.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.370
A Gentleman in Moscow is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.020
about a Russian aristocrat
count Alexander Rostov.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.070
At the start of the novel in 1922,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.570
the Bolsheviks declared him a
former person and sentenced him

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.240
to house arrest in a grand
hotel near the Kremlin

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.690
where he spends the next 32
years without ever leaving.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.230
No spoilers.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.110
That plot may sound a bit
constraining, but in Amor's hands,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.830
it is wonderfully expansive

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.550
because his total is a fascinating
place full of fantastic characters,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.100
some coming and going, others
permanent, and, of course,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.750
the most wonderful one of all is
the count himself, this elegant,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.600
sophisticated, unfailingly
kind and generous man.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.610
Like hundreds of thousands
of other readers,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.690
I fell in love with the count.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.840
He truly knows the rules of
civility, as does his creator.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.510
Please join me in welcoming
Amor Towles.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:56.150
[ Applause ]

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.450
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Thank you.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.300
I want to thank the
festival for having me here.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.130 position:56%
Ron, thank you for the introduction.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.520
But most of all, I really want
to thank all of you for coming

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.830
out tonight to hear me speak.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.730
As most of you know, my relatively
new novel has a rather odd premise,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.360
that it opens in 1922 at a
Bolshevik tribunal in the Kremlin

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.270
where a 30-year-old
aristocrat is being interviewed.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.110
And in the course of this brief
interview, it becomes clear

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.460
that the count wrote a poem as a
young man that was very popular

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.200
with the revolutionary generation.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.500
So he has some friends in the upper
ranks of the party, as it were.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.980
But on the other hand,
it's also clear

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.880 position:56%
that he's an unrepentant aristocrat.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.960
And so as something of a
compromise, the tribunal decides

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.720
that the count can go back to the
hotel where he's been staying,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.840
and if he ever comes out of the
hotel again, he will be shot.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.380
And with the snap of a gavel,
he's marched out of the Kremlin,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.210
across Red Square,
and through the doors

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.920
of the historic Metropol Hotel.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.820
And that's where he
spends the next 32 years.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.520
And that's where I ask you
to spend 32 years with him.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.610
Now, where did this
odd premise come from?

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.130
I began writing fiction as a kid.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.040
I wrote it in high school, in
college, in graduate school.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.100
But when I was 25 and I moved to
New York, I joined a friend of mine

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.320
who had started an investment
firm, and 20 years later,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.710
we were still working side-by-side.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.910
Now, ultimately in my capacity
as a spokesperson for the firm,

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.670
I would spend a week in any
given year in a hotel in Chicago,

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.200
a hotel in London, a
hotel in Los Angeles.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.080
And one year when I was
arriving at my hotel in Geneva

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.460
for the eighth year in a row,
as I walked into the hotel,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.380
I recognized some of
the people lingering

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.100
in the lobby from the year before.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.980
It was as if they had never left.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.640
And I thought to myself, this is
a nice hotel, but can you imagine

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.720
if you actually had to live in it?

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.930 position:56%
In the elevator on the way upstairs,
I thought, that's actually kind

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.570
of an interesting idea for a book.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.180
A guy gets trapped in a hotel
for a long period of time.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.800
So in my hotel room, I took
out the hotel stationary

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.450
and I began sketching the
outline for this story.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.460
Now, right off the bat, I
knew that if I was going

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.390
to take my protagonist and trap
him in a hotel for 30 years,

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.430 position:56%
he shouldn't be there by preference.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.630
He should be there by force.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.440
And that made me think of
Russia for some reason.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.540
I made this little
imaginative leap there.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.060
But as soon as I thought of
Russia, I knew that I wanted

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.200
to put the story in this
story in the Metropol Hotel.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.710
Now, I had visited the Metropol
when I went to Moscow in 1998.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.500
I hadn't stayed there,
but I had visited

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.560
because it's quite
famous architecturally.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.480
It has a giant dining room with
a hand painted glass ceiling

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.930
that covers the entire room.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.720
So I had gone to admire the
architecture of the building.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.060 position:56%
So I knew something about the hotel.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.850
And what it really comes
down to are two key factors.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.020
And the first is quite
simply location.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.320
Okay, here we go.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.980
And I know from the back, it's
going to be hard to see this.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.540
So you're just going to
have to bear with me.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.050
This is a map of central Moscow.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.780
Now, if you look in
the middle of this map,

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.030
there is a little green triangle.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.470
And that's the Kremlin, the great
stone fortress that's 1,000 years

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.210
old where the Tsars
lived and ruled Russia

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.090
until Peter the Great
moved the capital of Russia

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.240
from Moscow to St. Petersburg.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.540
Now, just to the right

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.120
of that triangle is a
little empty white space.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.750
That's Red Square, which is
just a great paved square

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.380
with an ancient cathedral
on either end of it.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.690
Now, if you went out the top
of Red Square and took a right,

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.760 position:56%
at about a half a block, you would
end up in what is shown in the inset

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.330 position:56%
of this map, in the lower right-hand
corner, which is a grand plaza

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.100
with fountains and
plantings in the center

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.210
around which are five majestic
19th century buildings,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.560
all of which are significant
in the history of the city.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.780
In the lower left-hand corner,
you have a building that was known

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.150
as the palace of the nobility.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.410
It was the private
club of the nobility

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.860
in the years before the revolution.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.630
It's where they would gather every
year to celebrate anniversaries,

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.160
weddings, you know,
that sort of thing.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.550
After the revolution, it became
known as the palace of the unions.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.230
It's where Lennon's body was
first held in state when he died,

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.650
so the citizens of Moscow could
come pay their respects before they

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.140
embalmed the body and put it
permanently on Red Square.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.770
It's also where the famous show
trials in the 1930s were held.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.660
At the top of the plaza is
the Bolshoi, which, of course,

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.570
is where the ballet performed then.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.030
It's where it performs still today.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.080
In the upper right-hand corner is
the most expensive department store

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.560
in Moscow before the revolution
and after the revolution too.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.880
Next, you have the Maly Theater,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.830
which is one of the two most
important dramatic these in Russia.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.580
And finally, in the
lower right-hand corner,

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.580
you have the hotel
itself, the Metropol.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.580
So as I say, I knew the hotel to
be in a very important location

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.320
in terms of the history and
the geography of Moscow.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.470
But, of course, a primary interest
to me was the hotel itself.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.250
Now, everything you see in
this picture is the hotel.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.680
The hotel is about the size of a
city block with hundreds of rooms.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.040
Now, this is from about--

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.570
this is shortly after it
opened in 1905, this picture.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.620
When it opened in 1905, the
Metropol was, without question,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.380
the best hotel in Moscow.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.060
It was the best hotel in Russia.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.380
Built with the finest materials,
imported marble, imported crystal,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.200
French furniture in the bedrooms.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.760
It was the first hotel in Russia
to have hot water in the bedrooms.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.790
It was the first hotel in Russia
to have telephones in the bedrooms.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.460
So it was, without question, the
height of elegance when it opened.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.290
Now, while it was relatively unique
in Russia, it was far from unique

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.780 position:56%
in the west in that regard because
I want you to keep in mind that 1890

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.850
to 1910 roughly, this is the
golden age of the grand hotel.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.400
This is when large scale,
fine hotels were being opened

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.250
in every major city in
Europe and the United States,

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.420
all along the Mediterranean coast
and along the Florida coast.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.640
This is when the Waldorf
Astoria opens in New York.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.540 position:56%
This is when the palace opens in San
Francisco, when the Breakers opens

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.560
in Palm Beach, and
all the equivalents

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.120
in Europe at the same time.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.840 position:56%
Now, the grand hotels, they all
tended to be a size of a city block.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.210
They all tended to be made
with the best materials.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:33.170
But in addition, they would have
had a card room, a billiard room,

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:38.670
multiple ballrooms, a great palm
court where tea would be served,

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.320
shops on the ground floor that
would go around the circumference

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.330
of the building that you
could enter from the lobby

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.610
or from the street outside.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.890
Now, the grand hotels, of course,
what they were designed to do,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.080
to some degree, was to satisfy the
demands of the great new wealth

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.270
that came out of the 19th century,
the Vanderbilts and their ilk.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.740
But in addition, these hotels
were designed to do something

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.010
that hotels really hadn't
been designed to do before.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:08.570
And that was to become an
extension of their city.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.840
What I mean by this, the best
way I can put this is if you went

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.920
to the Metropol in the decade after
it opened on a Saturday night,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.360
more than half the
people you saw pass

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:25.110
through the lobby would have
been Muscovites, not travelers.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.130
It would have been the
local Russians on their way

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.360
to the coffee house to meet friends
or to go to the fine restaurant,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.390 position:56%
which is the best in the city, or to
dance to one of the live orchestras

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.760
that played there every night.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.650 position:56%
So as I say, it was a-- right from
its opening, it was very much a part

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:45.640
of the social fabric of Moscow,
visited on a weekly basis

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.910
by the aristocracy,
by the intelligentsia

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.320
and by the upper bourgeoisie.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.500
Now, having said that the
Metropol shared many things

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.260
with the grand hotels
throughout Europe,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.220
a distinguishing characteristic
is that 12 years after it opened,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.530
it found itself in the middle
of a Proletarian revolution.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.260
And it was very much in
the middle of things.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.370
As revolutionary activity
was heating up in 1917,

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.930
a lot of it was centered in St.
Petersburg, where the Tsar was hold

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.840
up in the Winter Palace,
the Hermitage.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.890 position:56%
But there was a lot of revolutionary
activity occurring in Moscow,

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.210
and there were protests
often with Theater Square,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.090
where the Metropol was located.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:28.420
So the soldiers, who on
permanent guard in the Kremlin,

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.040
ended up taking over a
portion of the Metropol just

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.340
in case anything happened.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.370
They put snipers in the corner
windows you see just left

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.950
of center there, looking out over
Theater Square to keep an eye

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.810
on any revolutionary
type of activity.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.300
Now, in response to
this, quite predictably,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.720 position:56%
the Bolsheviks built barricades
across the middle of Theater Square.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.430 position:56%
And they stood behind the barricades
with their weapons, with their backs

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.180
to the Bolshoi, and you ended up
in sort of a Mexican stand-off.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:59.600
Now, in October, 1917, the
revolutionary activity boils

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.530
over in St. Petersburg,

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.570
the revolutionary stormed the
Winter Palace, they seized the tsar

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.870
and his family, and they are
suddenly in control of the capital.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.550
News of this reaches
Moscow 24 hours later.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:19.340
And the Bolsheviks in Theater
Square decide enough is enough,

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.570
and they bombard the Metropol
hotel with everything they've got,

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.150
breaking every single
window in the hotel.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.000
Now, they successfully drive the
soldiers out of the Metropol,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.870
back across Red Square
through the Kremlin,

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.740
and they end up in
control of the Kremlin.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.120
Now, we have a very
interesting firsthand account

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.780
of these events from an American.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.500
John Reed, the great
American journalist,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.020
whom Warren Beatty
immortalized in the movie Reds,

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.190
was a great classic
Greenwich Village lefty.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.740
He loved revolutionary activity.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.180
And when he sensed there might
be a revolution in Russia,

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.840
he boarded an ocean liner,
crossed the Atlantic,

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.360
took a train to St. Petersburg,
and he arrived just in time

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.100
to follow the soldiers
into the Winter Palace

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.400
as they were seizing the tsar.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.210
Now, when he came back out of
the Winter Palace, he decided,

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.810
I've got to go see
what's going on in Moscow.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.970
So he boards an overnight
train filled with soldiers.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:21.290 position:56%
And he arrives in Moscow shortly
after the battle for Theater Square.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.870
And the first thing he does
when he gets there is he goes

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.900
to the Metropol Hotel because
it's the only hotel he knows

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.200
by reputation.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.190
And he arrives and goes
straight to the desk.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.330
He asks if there's a room
available for the night.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.590
And in this great unflappable
19th century fashion,

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:40.830
the desk captain replies,
"we do have a room,

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.300
provided that the gentleman
doesn't mind a little fresh air."

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:52.020
Now, with the revolutionaries
in control of St. Petersburg

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:57.130
and Moscow, this does not represent
the end of hostilities in Russia.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:01.920
This represents the beginning
of a five-year Civil War.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.010
Eight foreign countries
send soldiers

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.540
into Russia with their own agendas.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.400
The whites, the soldiers who were
loyal to the tsar, are continuing

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.630
to roam the countryside in small
battalions trying to pick fights

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.790
with the red guard whenever
they find them in the hopes

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.740 position:56%
of turning back the tide of history.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.380
The revolutionaries
are not a single force.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.750
They are multiple factions who
have been kind of working together,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:29.050
but also elbowing each other
for control of the situation.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.080
Pretty early on, the
Bolsheviks are the faction

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.200
who control St. Petersburg
and Moscow.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.160
And actually here we go.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.970
This is, of course, the
head of the Bolsheviks,

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.640
the father of the revolution,
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.070
who was also the first leader

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.530
of the new Russia once
the tsar had been killed.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:55.590
I like to think of this as
Lenin's Leonardo DiCaprio

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.600
in the Titanic pose, you know?

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.130
Sort of leaning out over
the bow there of his podium.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.980
This is Theater Square.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.670 position:56%
That's the Maly Theater behind him
that I showed you a few minutes ago.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.190
Because this is exactly where you
would want to go if you wanted

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.860
to gather a large group and you
had an important speech to make.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:16.580
This is 1920, so we're kind of in
the middle of the Civil War here.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.960
And what Lenin is doing is he
is speaking to factory workers,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.700
and he is trying to convince
them to join the Red Army

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.570
and go to the Polish frontier.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.050
The great fear that the
Bolsheviks had at this point was

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:35.570
that a foreign power would
take advantage of the chaos

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.350
of the Civil War to
launch a major invasion.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.190
So they were constantly
recruiting new soldiers

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.410
to protect the frontier
on the border.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.520
Now, this photograph is actually
very famous for another reason.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.900
And that is that Lenin, of course,
the father of the revolution,

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.120
the head of the new
Russia, his number two,

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.000
his right-hand man
during the revolution

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.600 position:56%
and in the new government, was Leon
Trotsky, his old friend and comrade.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.000
And as usual, Trotsky is right here

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.750
at Lenin's side as
he gives this speech.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.810
Now, you needn't bother
looking for him.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.110
Here he is.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.550
He's the guy with the mustache and
the captain's hat just to the right

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.030
of the podium, kind of
leaning on it as Lenin speaks.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.260
Now, you could tell from
these two photographs,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.620
which were taken seconds apart,

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.410
that Trotsky's not in
the first photograph.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.220
Now, he has not excused
himself to go to the washroom.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.210
What's happened here is
that while Trotsky was one

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.610
of the first Bolsheviks
to lead the new Russia,

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.220
he was also the first
one to fall out of favor.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.610
He was pretty quickly
kicked out of the politburo,

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.390
and then he was kicked out
of the communist party.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.730
He was sent into exile.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:51.020
And he was eventually assassinated
in Mexico City by Russian agents.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.240
And when that happened,
the Bolsheviks went back

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.500
and this airbrushed him
out of all the photographs

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.710 position:56%
because they didn't want Lenin to
have to share his moments of history

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.990
with his old comrade who
had fallen from grace.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:09.380
Now, 1922, suffice to say that the
Bolsheviks control the whole show.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.600
They have silenced the whites,
they've sealed the border,

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.310
and they've consolidated the,
to some degree [inaudible]

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.010
and they are now in control
of the entire country.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:25.490
And the first thing they do is
they move the capital of Russia

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.570
from St. Petersburg back to Moscow.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:32.330
Now, this poses a significant
problem for the Bolsheviks.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.360
Because Moscow did not
have the infrastructure

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.910
to support a modern government.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.630
You couldn't use the
Kremlin for that purpose.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.240
It's an old stone building

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.130
that hadn't housed government
in hundreds of years.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:49.610
So what they did is they seized
the three best hotels in Moscow,

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.970
the National, the Savoy
and the Metropol.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.960
The Metropol is renamed the
second house of the Soviets.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.490
They kick out all the guests.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.970
They sweep aside the luxuries.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.570
And the first thing they
do is they put the leaders

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.090
of the new government, many
of them, in the suites,

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.710
of the grand suites
on the second floor.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.750
Because you want to keep
in mind that the leaders

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.630
of the Russian revolution
and the new government,

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.570
for the most part,
were not Muscovites.

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:14.650
Many of them were not even Russia.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.020
So they literally needed
places to stay.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.950
So they're given the
suites in the hotel.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.440
But all the other rooms get
emptied to serve as all manner

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.540
of governmental agencies that
this room can imagine better

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.770
than almost anybody else.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.500
So they're all filling
in the building.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.160 position:56%
The ballroom is emptied so that they
can have votes and speeches there.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.120
The fine dining room is emptied,
and it's filled with cots

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.650
so they can keep a
standing battalion

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.680
of soldiers on site just in case.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:49.030
The first Constitution of the new
Russia is written in suite 217

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.600
of the hotel, the Metropol.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.250
Now, at this point, the Metropol is
basically the largest bureaucratic

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.150
building in the new Russia.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:02.240 position:56%
And that should have represented the
end of its life as a grand hotel.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:08.030
But an interesting thing
happens over the course of 1922.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:13.490
And that is that the major European
powers begin recognizing the

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:18.060
Bolsheviks as the legitimate
government in Russia.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.690
Now, it takes the United States
more than a decade to come

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.990
around to that point of view.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.570
But the European powers
come to it quite quickly.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.840
Because keep in mind, they
just spent, most of them,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.770
a couple of last 150 years,
they've been deposing kings,

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.100
cutting off their heads
and establishing some kind

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.280
of quasi-democratic
governments in their place.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.780
So from the standpoint of Europe,
it was time for the tsar to go.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.640
And they viewed the Bolsheviks
as the will of the people.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.800
So they recognized the
government, and what that meant was

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.210 position:56%
that by the end of 1922, ambassadors
start showing up in Moscow.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.200
Trade representatives from the
major European governments show

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.740
up in Moscow.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.390
Corporate executives from the
biggest corporations in Europe

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.330
and the United States show up in
Moscow eager to establish ties

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.520 position:56%
and do business with the new regime.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.410
And what the Bolsheviks
realized pretty quickly is

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.720 position:56%
that if they take these
sophisticated visitors from the west

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.630
and they put them in
crummy proletarian hotels,

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.700
the risk they run is that the
visitors would go back to New York

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:24.930
and Paris and London with the news
that the revolution is failing.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.870
So the Bolsheviks kicked all the
party guys out of the Metropol.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:34.810
And they began restoring the
hotel to its prewar glamour.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:41.180
There were bellhops back in
the lobby, uniforms doorman

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.040
out in front, champagne and
caviar in the dining room.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.600
And they reassembled
the old orchestra,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.630
which began playing American
jazz on a nightly basis.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.500 position:56%
Now, initially, the restored glamour

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:01.670
and liberty inside the Metropol
is reserved solely for foreigners.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.840
An ordinance is passed
in the City of Moscow,

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.760
forbidding any Russian
citizen from spending time

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.090
in a foreign designated
hotel or restaurant

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.830
of which the Metropol
is example number one.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:18.470
So it's just the foreigners.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.230
But the citizens reclaim
the Metropol.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.940
Now, citizens of Moscow
reclaim the Metropol.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.120
And this occurs in two waves.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.510
The first wave is that the leaders

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.980
of the communist party start
hanging out in the hotel.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.310
They decide, you know what?

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.730
It's not such a bad place.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.100
The food is pretty good, the liquor
is pretty good, the music is good.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.630
So they're hanging out there,
dining with their proteges,

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.160
their comrades, their mistresses.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.000
Now, I think if you ask many
Americans what percentage

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.360
of the Russian population were
communists in the 1920s, the 30s,

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:01.910 position:56%
the 40s, right up into the Cold War,
most Americans would say oh, 90%,

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.390
three quarters, certainly
more than half.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:10.460
In reality, only 10% of the
Russian population were members

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.100
of the Communist party
throughout that period.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.960
Now, this is not because
the other 90% didn't want

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.800
to be members of the
Communist party.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.220
This is because the other
90% were not allowed

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.170
to be members of the
Communist party.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.710
At the time of the revolution,

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:29.980
membership in the Communist party
was a badge of ideological honor.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.360
In you were a member of the party,

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.490
it's because in the years before
the war, you had organized trade--

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.810
well, first of all, you
could quote your marks

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.170
and angles, that's for sure.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.290
You organize trade unions.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.660
You printed pamphlets in basements.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.080
You'd probably done some time.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.810
And this is what has earned
you your place in the party.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.340
But in the aftermath of the
revolution, pretty quickly,

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.120
what ended up happening
is that membership

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.390
in the party became a
gateway to privilege.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.190
In those years, if you were a
member of the Communist party,

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:04.940
you had access to special apartment
buildings with larger apartments

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.060
that you did not have to
share with other families.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.520
If you were a member of the party,

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.350
you would access two
special grocery stores,

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.080
where not only did they
have bread and milk

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.310
on a daily basis, they
had delicacies.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.920
If you were a member of the party,

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.990
your children were given
better opportunities.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.250
You were generally treated
better by the judicial system.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.900
So there was no question about it,
through most of the Soviet era,

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.850
membership in the Communist
party was a huge advantage to you

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:34.150
and your family and the memberships
were doled out very selectively

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.900
to those individuals
who had paid their dues

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.920
and proven their loyalty
to the powers that be.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.320
So suffice to say that this group
is hanging out in the Metropol,

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.890
despite the prohibition,

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.260
because they can basically
do whatever they want.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:52.540
Now, the second wave
is a much bigger wave.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.750
And what brings this about
is a financial crisis.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.830
What I want you to remember is that
at the time of the first world war,

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:04.720
Russia was the most backward of
all the great European nations.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:11.520
At that time, 95% of the
population was illiterate.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:17.920
85% of the population were
peasants, still plowing fields

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.340 position:56%
with wooden plows, oxen, on somebody
else's land, much in the manner

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.880
that their great-grandparents
had done as surfs.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.500
There was very little
industry in Russia.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.710
It was way behind the west.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.700
So one of the things the
Bolsheviks wanted to do

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.940
when they took charge is they
wanted to volt over decades

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:42.270
of failed investment and rapidly
modernize Russia to bring it

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.150
into parity with the
other western powers

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.050
from an industrial standpoint.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.260
This is what the five-year
plans were all about,

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.910
the rapid industrialization
of Russia.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.350
Now, the problem the Bolsheviks
had is that there was not--

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.670
didn't have the expertise
or the equipment

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.000
in Russia to industrialize.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.510
The good news was that
the major western powers,

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.870
including the United
States, were perfectly happy

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:10.540
to sell their equipment and
expertise to the Communists.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.910
But they didn't want to
receive the new Russian currency

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.210
in exchange for these goods.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.350
They didn't want to receive an IOU.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:22.110
What the western powers wanted
in exchange was hard currency.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.520
And this means the Swiss
rank, the British pound,

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.600
the U.S. dollar, or gold.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.850
Initially, the Bolsheviks
had a significant warehouse

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:35.100
of hard currency, which they
had seized from the aristocracy.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.010 position:56%
But they had begun to run out before
the five-year plans were over.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.480
And that was threatening
the completion

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.490
of the industrialization project.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.170
Now, the good news at this point
was that there was still a lot

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:48.450
of hard currency in Russia.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:52.660
It's just that it was under the
mattresses of the civilians.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.700
The local population had
realized pretty quickly early

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.260
on that they didn't totally
trust the new Russian currency,

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.980
which was experiencing
incredible inflation,

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.430
and they could buy what they
needed for their families

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:07.250
on the black market very
effectively with foreign currency.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.450
So they were hoarding it.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.200
So the Bolsheviks came up with
this ingenious compromise.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.370
I say, okay, once again,

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.740
we are going to open the foreign
designated restaurants and hotels

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:25.690
in Moscow to the citizens of the
city, provided that when you dine

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:31.020
at the Metropol, you pay your
bill in foreign currency.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.180
And through this compromise,
the Bolsheviks rake

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.400 position:56%
in the hard currency they need to
complete the modernization of Russia

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.900
and the citizens of Moscow
reclaim the liberty and glamour

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.680
within inside the walls
of the Metropol hotel.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:50.510
Now, just in case you think I'm
making this up, because I am not

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:54.180
above that, by the way, what
I want to do is I want to read

00:25:54.180 --> 00:26:00.180
to you a very brief passage have
the memoires of Eugene Lyons.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:04.240
Now, Eugene Lyons was the United
Press International Moscow

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.180
correspondent in the
late 20s and early 30s.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:11.620
And he spent a great deal
of time in the Metropol

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.470
because from the time the
revolution until the Cold War,

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:19.580
the bar at the Metropol
was the watering hole

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.740
for all American and
British journalists.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.290
It's where they met every night.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.750
So in all their memoires
throughout that period,

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.510
they talk about the
Metropol in some detail.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.920
And what I'm going to read
to you is this brief passage

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.140
where Lyons is describing
what's going on inside the hotel

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.980
in the early 30s, this one moment.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.600
And I want you to keep in mind
that means this is a few years

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.270
after the great Ukrainian
famine when millions died,

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.350
a time of terrible
shortages in Russia.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:48.940
And it's a few years before
the Great Purges ramp-up.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.870
So in essence, in a very dark
decade for the Soviet citizenry,

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.110
this is what's going
on inside the hotel.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:01.280
The Metropol was the new social
center of the bourgeois colony.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.610
Its main restaurant was
a Russian peasant's dream

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:10.480
of of capitalist splendors, immense
candelabra, oversized lights,

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.290
heavy furniture, a jazz band of
symphony orchestra proportions.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:19.400
The chief pride of the restaurant,
its ultra bourgeois touch,

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.220
was a great circular
pool where lights

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.310
and rather proletarian
looking fishes played.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:30.500
On grand occasions, the chef in cap
and apron emerged from his sanctum

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.670
with a net over his
shoulder and captured a fish

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.620
for special customers
bearing foreign currency.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.420
The dancing couples rotated
around the pool, and sometimes an

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.410
on study customer joined the fishes

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.580
to the great delight
of the assembled crowd.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.970
Actually, will this pop up again?

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.590
Oh, yeah, there's the dining room.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:51.890
This is a picture.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.400
You're seeing about 60% of the room

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.220
because of the position
of where I was standing.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.440
That's the great hand painted glass
ceiling that I mentioned earlier

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.740
that you can see at the top.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.100
These are the giant lights
that Lyons is describing.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.140
That's the fountain where the
chef would come to get the fish.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.230
That's the bandstand in
the back of the room.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.560
The only thing different
in a period photograph is

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.220
that there would have been about
three or four times as many tables,

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.420
with everybody in there elbow to
elbow having a grand old time.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.550
Now, what I love about that
Eugene Lyons passage is

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:27.960
that it could easily have
come from a memoire of someone

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.230
in F. Scott Fitzgerald's circle
describing what was going

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.550
on at the Plaza Hotel in the 1920s.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:38.280
It is crazy that this is what
was going on inside the Metropol

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.240
across the street from the
Kremlin and around the corner

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.400
from the headquarters
of the secret police

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.990
at the height of the Soviet era.

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.030
And this, of course,
is what interests me

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:50.070
in the hotel, this paradox.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:53.630
Now, for those of you who
have not read the book,

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:58.080
most of what I just said isn't
in the book, is not in the book.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.210
This is the kind of stuff
that's helpful to me as kind

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.040
of a background to think about.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.030
Because the book is
not a Wikipedia entry.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.840
It's not a work of history.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.140
It's a novel.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.440
And so appropriately, at the
center of it are individuals.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.260 position:56%
And most significantly is the figure
of the count himself, who at the age

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.010
of 30, is sentenced
to life in the hotel.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:22.930
And he's lost all his possessions.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.510
He's lost his family.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.570
He's lost his social standing.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.520
In a way, more profoundly,
he's watching as everything

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.670
that he values in Russian life
is systematically being uprooted

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.420
by the new regime.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.490
This is how he begins
his internment.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:41.180
And over the course of his 30
years in the hotel, he must find--

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.380 position:56%
he must establish new relationships.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.870
He must find new causes for
happiness, however small.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:52.490
And he ultimately must find
a new sense of purpose.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:55.090
This is really what
the book is about.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.980
Having said all that, I would be
happy to answer your questions.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.770
And if you don't have
questions, I will ask them myself.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.720
Oh, yes.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.440
&gt;&gt; Characteristics I really enjoyed

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.710
that the count possessed was
his adaptability and his humor.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.720
Can you talk about how
those two served him well?

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.900
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Yeah, his
adaptability and the--

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.570
can you all hear the question?

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:24.820
So let's talk about
those in separate--

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.190
we'll take them in two parts.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:27.490
Adaptability.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.280
There's no question about it,
that early on in the crafting

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.580
of this novel, first
of all, I should say,

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.010
I outline everything in advance.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:39.130 position:56%
But when I sit down to write Chapter
1 of a book, I know every chapter,

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.260
every event, every character,
every setting, their backgrounds,

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:47.310 position:56%
all major events, some of the ideas,
some of the poetry, so the outline

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.650
for me is about 50
pages long when I start.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:53.560
But now, yes, I knew very
early on that the count

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.110
in his internment had two
things really going for him.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:31:01.310
And the first was that this notion
that his grandmother gives him

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.670
as a young boy, which is described
early in the book, which is that,

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.240
you know, he loses a Checkers game
and he throws a tantrum in essence,

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.180
and his grandmother says, you
know, listen, losing isn't fun,

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.480
there's nothing good about losing.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.690
But why would you have given
your opponent the satisfaction

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.790
of seeing you act that
way in essence?

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.500
And he sort of has that
throughout his life.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.350
You know, why would you ever give
your opponent the satisfaction

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.260
of showing that you've
been, you know,

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.960
unsettled by what they've done?

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.190
But secondly, he's a born optimist.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.460
He's one of these people
who just imagines from birth

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.780
that most things are probably
going to work out for the best

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.790
and most people are
probably good at heart.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:38.620
And these are the sort of things
that he has carrying with him

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.820
that make a big difference
in his life in the hotel.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.720
And yes, I think that humor became
a very important component of that

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.340
that I did not anticipate.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.110
So if I went back and said, if I
looked at the 50 pages of outline,

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.570
first of all, there's not a
lot of humor in an outline.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:53.870
That's the nature of an outline.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.170
It's not funny.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.940
So, you know, if I went back
and looked at the outline,

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.240
the outline doesn't suggest

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.540
that there was going to
be humor in the book.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.940
And that was something
that kept growing

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.350
over the course of the crafting.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:04.320
And you get to a point
where you're like,

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.740
you're writing a scene
that's particularly comic,

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.990
and you kind of have to ask
yourself, am I off the rails,

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.670
you know, this humor, am
I taking this into farce,

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:15.040
is this no longer the book
I thought I was writing?

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.370
And, you know, you have to
sort of go through that.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.670
And there was a certain point
where I was like, you know what,

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:18.970
I'm going to go with this.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.410
This aspect of the humor, I
think, is true to the count,

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.540
and it's true to the
life of the book.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.170
But yes, go ahead, please.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.620
&gt;&gt; Hi. That's a lot of feedback.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.200
Both of your books
are very different,

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.130
and written in a similar format
that totally envelopes me.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:38.160
Sorry. Written in a format
that envelopes me and takes me

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.310
to someplace else, and I
really appreciate that.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.100
And also with protagonists
who are actually likeable,

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.680
which I think is something
that's missing

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.580
in literature nowadays,
some literature.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.460
What are you working on next?

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:55.550
Because they're so
different, I'm excited to hear

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.210
if you have something very
different coming up down the line,

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.060
or similar because I really
love those other ones.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.820
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: I am not writing
a sequel to A Gentleman in Moscow.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.250
The future of these
characters are in your hands.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:11.710
But what am I working on next?

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:13.620
As I said, I design
books long in advance.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.700
So I am well towards completion of
the design phase of my next book.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.970
I will start writing in January
when I'm done being on the road.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:26.540
And that book is about three
18-year-old boys who are

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.120
on their way from Kansas
to New York City in 1952.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.170
And that's about all
I'll tell you about that.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:34.470
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.770
Can't wait.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:37.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: But it is different.

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.500
And it's true, you
know, it's a good point.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.520
That's kind of part of my mode.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.850
I want to investigate something
new, try something new.

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:46.200
I'm very interested in-- and
each book I write I think should

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.500
sound different.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.040
If you're dealing with different
people with different themes,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.700
the book itself should
sound different.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.660
And that's part of the joy for me
creatively is to try to do that.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.960
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.260
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: You're welcome.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.560
Left.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mr. Towles, thanks.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.160
That was a great summary
background for the book.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.460
Thank you very much.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.760
&gt;&gt; Fantastic.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.060
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Thank you.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.360
Thank you.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.660
[ Applause ]

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.310
&gt;&gt; And also the lesson
we never learned,

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:15.050
that the profitiers always supply
the rope that will hang them.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.020
But more on that later, no doubt.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.740
I'm rather intrigued by
your approach to the book,

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.920
and I wonder if you could say a
little bit more about how you went

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.090
about selecting the
actual characters.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:29.180
Because as I understand,
they're very different voices,

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:33.160 position:56%
and I wondered how you modeled them,
you know, where they came from,

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.460
if you could go a little--

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.760
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: You're talking
about the individual characters

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.060
in The Gentleman in Moscow?

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.360
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah, and why
you picked them.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.660
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Yeah, I
appreciate your saying

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:40.960
that they seem different.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.740
That's certainly the goal.

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:47.080
You know, and I think-- well, I'm
going to give a longish answer

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.710
to this because I think it matters.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.060
Well, first, I'll put it this way.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:57.940
If you look at the major of fine
arts, music, classical music,

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.970
you know, fine painting, you know,
oil painting of the 19th and 18th,

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:06.570
17th centuries, what have you, of
the novel, if you look at painting,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:11.280
a fine painter of the 19th or
18th century can depict a place

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.970
and a moment in time so well that
we can see it from across the room.

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.600
You know, yeah, you see that Hudson
School painting, and you're like,

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.530
I know what that-- even if I don't
know exactly where that place is,

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.570 position:56%
I know the feeling of it, I know
what it means, and I can imagine it.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:32.230
And with fine music, a capable
cellist can transmit a sense

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.200
of emotion in about two seconds.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.610 position:56%
You know, the drawing of the strings
across the bow four times, you know,

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:43.040
can signal to us a great
sense of sorrow or joy,

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.460
like instantaneously
in this incredible way.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.360
But the novel can give us
a sense of time or place,

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.770
it can give us a sense, it
can trigger emotions for us

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:54.000
in a more cumbersome
fashion than those art forms.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.580
But what the novel can do that
the other art forms cannot do is

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.010
that it can put us in the position

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.260
of another individual
in a real sense.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:09.310
A well-crafted novel, as readers,
we can begin to live the life

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:12.020
of that individual who's at the
center of the story in particular,

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:16.920
such that when that individual
has a setback, we can actually,

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.220
we can shed a tear literally.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.750 position:56%
When something funny happens to that
person, we laugh out loud about it.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:26.940
When their victories and
their setbacks are felt

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.310
by us as loss or joy.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.400
We get to the point where we
can imagine what they would say

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.820
in a different circumstance.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.020
They travel with us like family.

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.420
And I think that not even--

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.930
the other art forms cannot
do this, not even film.

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:44.740
So I think anybody who aspires
to write serious narrative

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.890
as a young person, this
becomes one of the big elements

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:50.040
of craft that you try to command.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:56.770
A novel involves many aspects of
craft, dialogue, setting, tone,

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:01.640 position:56%
philosophy, metaphor, the poetry and
the sound of the words themselves,

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.270 position:56%
you know, the structure of the book,

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.800
each of these is its
own art form in a way.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.100
But the creation

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.370
of three-dimensional individuals
is the most important of those.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:12.700
If you think about the books that
have affected you in your life,

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.210
almost certainly there are
individuals at the center of them

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:16.550
that you think of as people.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:21.240
And so that's what you work on as a
young person, constantly, or I did,

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.230
constantly adopting a
different personality

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:25.580
to write a different story.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.880
What would they say?

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.180
What would they think about?

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.880
What would they look out
when they entered the room?

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.840
And try to imagine that
all different people,

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.420
different ages, races, whatever.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.820
And so until it becomes, to
some degree, second nature,

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.770
and you start to imagine the
story and it populates itself,

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:43.750
and you're like, that's the
guy, that's her, that's him,

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.310
you know, that's the way it works.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:49.530
But basically it's from nothing.

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.220
&gt;&gt; Not watching too
many Russian films.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.520
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: No.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.820
It's Elkonin.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.120
It really is Elkonin.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.420
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.720
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: You're welcome.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.020
&gt;&gt; I really love the
writing and the characters.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.160
And I found myself thinking
as I was reading this book,

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.510
oh, this is so charming.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:06.370
Oh, isn't this lovely?

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.370
But what's the big deal?

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:12.660
I mean, it's just like this story
that's going on and on and on.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.410
And then--

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:15.710
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: You should
have written the blurb

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.010
on the back of the book.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.310
&gt;&gt; No, no, no.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:19.610
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: On and on and on.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:24.150
&gt;&gt; But then at about 75
pages before the end.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:25.450
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: No spoilers.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.050
&gt;&gt; No, I'm not going to spoil it.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:30.470
But I was on the edge of my seat.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:31.770
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Yeah, okay.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.950
&gt;&gt; But what you were
just saying before

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:36.630
about how you outlined
the book, you know,

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.820
I listened to other authors here
say, you know, I started this book

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.830
and I had no idea where
it was going.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:46.070
And so you must have at
the beginning said "aha,

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:49.230
they're just going to think they're
going along this lovely little

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:52.010
street, and then boom, it's going
to turn into Niagara Falls."

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.310
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Yeah,
that was the plan.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:39:01.340
It says really bore them for 100
and-- but then, then at page 350,

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.640
I'm going to let them have it.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.940
In all seriousness.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.360
&gt;&gt; I wasn't bored.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.350
I just didn't see why people were
going, oh my gosh, and then I got

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.040
to that point, and it
was like, oh my gosh.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.340
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: You're very frank.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.100
That's good.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.400
No, you know.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.180
&gt;&gt; Now this is going to be
in the Library of Congress.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.040
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: No,
that's all right.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.340
Yeah, exactly.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.160
You know, I would just
change the shape

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.810
of what you're saying a
little bit for me, which said,

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:34.970
I knew that the first 100 pages in
particular were going to be tough

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:36.840
in the book because it's
about a person being trapped

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.140
in a building and not moving.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.470
And you have to go through
an element of claustrophobia

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:44.520
and a feeling of depression,
because the book depends upon that.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.880
Now, in addition, this is a
book in which a lot of elements

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.170
in the first 100 to
200 pages show up later

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:52.860
in all kinds of interesting ways.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:57.780 position:56%
And so my challenge was to get you
through this period of the hard part

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.750
of the internment, but also to
give you a lot of raw material

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:04.130
that you don't notice, but that
you're not driven crazy by,

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.470
and that later it will
pay off for you.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:08.550
So hopefully most people
have that experience

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:12.180
at page 100 instead of 350.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.480
&gt;&gt; It did pay off.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.920
Let me say that.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.220
Thank you.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.520
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Thank you.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.820

&gt;&gt; First of all, I do have a
question, but I have to say,

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:32.460
my good fellow, that I don't think
the count would have unbuttoned

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.760
his collar.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.610

know, it's a long day.

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:36.910

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:41.670
Man, this is tough, tough audience.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:48.770

you talked about the craft.

Everything you said, I was going
to say about you, how beautifully,

I mean, I don't know
how you can be so smart.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:15.860
It's beautifully written.

It's a pleasure to read.

there are beautiful surprises.

Just your ability to
write is phenomenal.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:31.710
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: You don't
have to ask a question.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.010
You can keep going.

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:34.310
I mean, that's fine.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.610
That's great.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:36.910
You're doing great.

&gt;&gt; That works for me.

But my question is one that you will
not answer because I know you won't.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:47.340
But I do-- I'm going to ask it
in a way that might trick you.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:53.320
And I don't want to
make it a spoiler deal.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.440
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Yeah, nothing about
the back half of the book, please.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.740
&gt;&gt; No, no, no.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.770
But I mean I'm going to couch it.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:03.430
But you must have a point of view,
because I've been arguing already

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:07.110
with my friends, and our book
club meets in a week on this.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.120

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.420
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: If you're going

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.800
to start asking, okay,
wait, wait, wait.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.230
No, no. I want you to
grab me afterwards,

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.220

question very specifically.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.400
But I don't want to give
any suggestions of anything

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.700
that might matter in the end.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.000

hard for you to do that.

it for other people.

your personal inner self hoped.

That's all.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.240
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Well,
I'll tell you that too.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.950
That's hard to answer without other
people having finished the book.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:37.870
But the book isn't-- I don't know.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:39.420
&gt;&gt; Is that an after thing also?

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:40.740
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Yeah,
that's an after thing.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.040
Sorry.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.340
&gt;&gt; Well, anyway, thank
you very much.

you for the compliments.

I really appreciate it.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.540
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Thank you.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.840
Go ahead.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.140
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this won't
be a spoiler question.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.440
And I actually have a
small question afterwards.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.930
But clearly with both of your
novels, you have a central theme

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:57.850
of a personal code of ethics.

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:00.080
The first one is called
Rules of Civility.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:06.070
So I wanted to hear more about
how you stumbled on that theme.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:07.830
Is that showing up in your next--

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:10.400
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: Yeah, for those
who haven't read either of my books

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.240
or my first book, Rules of Civility
and Gentleman in Moscow both,

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:18.500
to some degree, deal with these
ideas around civil behavior.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.230
And so the first thing I want to
say is my next book has nothing

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:23.530
to do with civil behavior.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:26.250
There is no civility
in it whatsoever.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:32.510 position:56%
But, you know, I think the most
interesting thing I can say about it

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:37.690
in regard to A Gentleman in
Moscow is that I think that we,

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:41.590
in our modern times in America,
think of civility and elements

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:47.870 position:56%
of etiquette as kind of the nice
frosting on the surface of behavior,

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.640
kind of shallow in a way.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.650
In kindergarten, our kids learn to
say please and thank you and isn't

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:55.250
that nice because it will
impress grandma or whatever,

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:59.430
but it's kind of at that level to
some degree on a blown-up basis.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:03.020
But for the figures like the
Count in the 19th century

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.500
who would have been raised in
an aristocratic upbringing,

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.410 position:56%
and an educated, refined upbringing,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.730
they would have viewed
it very differently.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:13.310 position:56%
In fact, it would go all the way
back to the Stoics and then repeated

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:16.100
in the Age of Enlightenment
figures, very much on the mind

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.390
of the founding fathers as a class.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:23.210
And for them, the notion
of civil behavior,

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:27.690
it was in essence an outward
expression of an inward struggle.

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:33.780
And the inward struggle was over
the mastery over the seven sins.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.330 position:56%
You know, the notion is, going right
back to the Stoics, was that yes,

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:41.610
we were all born with these
impulses to greed, gluttony,

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:44.400
lust, sloth, what have you.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.230
We all have those impulses.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.460
But the Stoics and the Age of
Enlightenment thinkers believe

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:53.660
that these-- we could master
these impulses, and that to do

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:56.990
so required reflection, it
required having role models,

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:59.220
and it required having
a code of behavior

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.280
that you tried to adopt
and to live by.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.810
Now, if you think about polite
poly tests, simple polite behavior,

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:09.780
in many cases, the whole
role of it is a delay.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.200
It's a little simple delay.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.440
So picture a dinner party.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.630
And the notion here is that
polite behavior teaches you

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.860
that before you take that
second helping, you know,

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:27.770
before you make a crude joke,
before you make a pass at a member

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:30.950
of the opposite sex, you know,
before you show impatience

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.750
to the person serving at
the table, what have you,

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:36.290
politeness was taught, told you,
that's inappropriate behavior,

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:38.440
and you'd stop for a second.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.660
But the notion is that in
that moment when you stop,

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.140
you then look inward and
you say, you know what,

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.550
that's not the right
behavior anyway.

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:48.240
And then you turn to
your inward angels

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.570
and you try to do the opposite.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:51.110
You offer someone a second helping.

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:53.250
You say the polite thing.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:56.610
You change the subject before it
gets off color, what have you.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.020
This is really what
politeness was about,

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.460
was about allowing you the
moment to complete the battle

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:02.910
as it was over these elements.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:06.710
And so the Count is very
much from that tradition.

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:09.910
And so for him, simple
behavior is very much,

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:12.370
it's tied to moral behavior.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:13.670
And part of the interesting aspect

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:16.830
of the book is he finds
himself in uncivil times.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:21.700
And I think that, you know, I came
to sort of feel this maybe, well,

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:27.780
is that in uncivil times, a civil
act is itself an act of rebellion.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:32.290
And that's kind of the
life the Count is living.

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:34.700
Now, somebody was signaling me.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.360
Were you saying that I'm done?

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.660
Where are we at?

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.960
What do we have on the clock?

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.260
&gt;&gt; We've got to go.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.560
&gt;&gt; Amor Towles: We've got to go?

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.110
Wait, wait, then I'm sorry,
I'm not going to be able

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:45.590 position:56%
to answer your six questions, but I
am going to tell you one more story,

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.720
because he promised me I was
going to be able to before I go.

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.280
And that is, you know,
the book is invention.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.960
The people are an invention, the
circumstances are inventions.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:57.360
But inevitably, while
you're writing a novel,

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.700
aspects of your personal
life will percolate

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.130
up through the inventive process.

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:04.960
And there's no question about it
that in A Gentleman in Moscow,

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.260
the single most important
aspect of that, version of that,

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:11.450
was in the creation
of Nina and Sophia,

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:13.520
the two young girls in the story.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.840
The Count meets a 9-year-old
girl at the age--

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.020
when she's 30, at the
beginning of his internment,

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.890
and she has a big impact on him.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:22.800 position:56%
Much later in his life, he's asked
to keep an eye on a 5-year-old girl,

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.980
and she has a big influence on him.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:29.540
And the source of these two girls
really comes down very simply

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.210
to the fact that when
I came up with the idea

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.110
for this book, my daughter was 5.

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:35.310
And when I finished
writing it, she was 9.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:39.630
And my daughter, at that
time, is really the one

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:45.610
who gave me the insight into
how shrewd a little girl can be.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.330
They're very clever.

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:51.080
They are not to be
underestimated in any way.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:56.930
You know, just to give you a sensor
to that, give you a sense of that,

00:47:56.930 --> 00:48:00.120 position:56%
on New Year's Day this year, we got
to dinner, me, my wife, my daughter,

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.370
my son, and I say--
my daughter's now 11.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:06.530
I say, hey, why don't we go around
the table and we'll, you know,

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:07.830
share New Year's resolutions.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:09.130
You know, that would be fun.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:10.430
New Year's Day.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:11.730
What do you say?

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:13.340
And without missing a beat,
my daughter says, "dad,

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.980 position:56%
don't you think"-- oh, there she is.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.990
Well, that's a little premature,
but all right, well, there she is.

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:20.290
You can imagine.

00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:23.530
She says, at 11, she says, "dad,
you know, New Year's resolutions,

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:26.320
don't you think you
should be focused less

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.030
on New Year's resolutions and
more on your bucket list?"

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:32.050
[ Applause ]

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.460
That was terrible.

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:39.960 position:56%
Terrible. So I hit her with my cane,

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.630
which is the only appropriate
response, you know,

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:43.930
under those circumstances.

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:48.260
Okay, but so, so what I want to
tell you is when my son was 8

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.940
and my daughter was 5,
their favorite restaurant

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.150
in New York was this little
Italian place right down the street

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:58.880
from us called Paul &amp; Jimmy's,
a third generation joint.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.750
You know, chicken parm,
veal marsala, you know,

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.810
real classic stuff,
spaghetti and meatballs.

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:05.110
They liked the food.

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:08.200
But what they really loved was how
they were treated by the staff.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.460
You know, when we would
go, my kids--

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.480
our kids would run
ahead of me and my wife,

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.830
and they'd burst throughout
the door of the restaurant,

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.840
and the staff would say, "oh,

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:20.500
Senior Towles [foreign phrase]
you know come in, come in."

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:24.220
And when we got to the restaurant,
they'd be seated at our table,

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.290
you know, looking like
they own the place, right?

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:27.590
They loved it.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:30.930
So when my son turned 9, we
said, "hey, Stokley, you know,

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:32.910
for your birthday, where do
you want to go for dinner?

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:34.920
We can go anywhere in
the city within reason,"

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.840
assuming that he'd
say Paul &amp; Jimmy's.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:41.080
And instead, in this very
wistful way, he says, "oh,

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.690
wouldn't it be great if we could
go to Smith &amp; Wollensky's."

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.040
For those of you who don't know,

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.710
that's like a [inaudible]
old steakhouse

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:49.470
in upper New York, Upper East Side.

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:52.880
I'm like, where does an 8-year-old
boy get an idea of a steakhouse?

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.680
What are they teaching
in that school?

00:49:54.680 --> 00:50:00.450
Well, it turned out the year my son
turned 9 was the year they put TVs

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:02.670
in the back of taxi
cabs in New York.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:06.880
And the very first ad
was Smith&amp; Wollensky's.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.760
So he'd seen it 100 times.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.700
So I said, "Stokley,
if you want to go

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.660
to Smith &amp; Wollensky's,
we can do that."

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.620
He says, "you mean
it's in New York?"

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:18.350
I'm like, "yes, it's in New York."

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:20.290
So on his birthday, we
all dress up, go uptown.

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:22.170
Now, if any of you have ever been
to this joint, what you know is

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:25.000
that the waiters at Smith &amp;
Wollensky's, they look like--

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.320
they're these big old guys
who look like butchers.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.420
And in fact, they wear
white butcher's aprons.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.720
That's what they wear.

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.810
And so we get seated in our
banquet, and out waiter comes over,

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.970
and he says, this six foot tall
guy in a butcher's apron, he says,

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:38.830
"all right, welcome to
Smith &amp; Wollensky's,

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:40.130
let's get down to business.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:42.830
You know, what are you going to
have tonight to drink, ma'am?

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:44.130
A martini?

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:45.430
Good choice.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:46.730
For you, sir?

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.030
Another martini, well done.

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:49.670
Young man, a Coca Cola,
it's on its way.

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:52.540 position:56%
And what about for the little baby?"

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.440
Now, the second he says this,

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.910
he realizes he's made
a terrible mistake

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:59.620
from the expression
on my daughter's face.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:03.570
So after a moment of
silence, my daughter says

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:05.390
to this six foot tall
guy in a butcher's apron,

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:10.900
he says, "I am not a baby.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:14.670
At the other restaurant,
they call me La Principessa."

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.560
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.770
Thank you for coming out
for the Book Festival.

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:22.070
Thank you.
