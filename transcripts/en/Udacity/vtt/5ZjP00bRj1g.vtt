00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.270
&gt;&gt; In this section of the course, we'll learn

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.750
about resource control and content distribution. Resource control deals

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.590
with handling bandwidth constraints on links. And in this

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.600
first section, we'll focus on controlling congestion along links.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.200
&gt;&gt; To learn more about TCPA and congestion control, your

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.540
Minia project will explore what happens when congestion control goes wrong.
