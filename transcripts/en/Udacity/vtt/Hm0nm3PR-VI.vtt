00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And so I sort of did process of elimination on this one. Let's see.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If it starts up here, that means the velocity is 0, right?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well it can't be the blue graph because the blue graph starts with some positive velocity

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
likewise the green starts with some negative.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That just doesn't make sense. We know it starts at rest as both the pink and the red do.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Look at the difference here. The red immediately goes towards negative velocity.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The pink goes towards positive. What actually happens? Well it goes downwards.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Of course it goes downwards. We're dropping it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So it's actually the red graph is the best answer.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There's a lot more to say about these graphs.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Ways to manipulate them and change the amplitude period

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
shift them and a lot of interesting stuff to learn.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We're not going to cover it in this class. Maybe in a later one.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But you should definitely read up on it on your own if it's something you're interested in.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But these graphs sort of highlight the periodic nature of simple harmonic motion.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
They just repeat themselves over and over and over,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and that's exactly the property we want from a chronometer.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We want it to be able to repeat itself.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We want to know that every period is the same length of time.

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
One tick of the clock. Now, the real question is, how do we control what this period is?
