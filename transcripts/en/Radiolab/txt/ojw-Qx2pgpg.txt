Speaker 1:          00:00:00       You are listening to radio lab radio from W. N y. S. C. E. N. N. P. E. R.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       Okay. Let's see. Hello? Hello. Hi, is this Aero Morris? I think it's me. Hello. This is Chad from, uh, from radio lab. Hi. Thank you for your very, very nice but somewhat disturbing email, but disturbed you in the email. The term truth fascist

Speaker 3:          00:00:34       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:00:35       you called Aaron Cloris a truth fascist. Where were you thinking? I was, I was trying to, I wrote him an email to try and get him to come talk to us. And I don't know why you use that

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       is a truth fascist that was meant and lovingly I should say, ahh, wasn't exactly the right choice of words. Fundamentalist. Oh, I like it. The really what I meant is it like, this is a guy who's always trying,

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       you get to the bottom of things. I mean, all these documentaries, uh, thin blue line. Well, you've got a guy off death row actually in a thin blue line. He made the fog of war, right? Vernon, Florida. Yeah. But I contacted him because you know, I'd recently seen him give this talk about this one investigation of his. The for me is like the purest example of the thing that drives him think it's in all of his films, this desire, relent,

Speaker 4:          00:01:19       lis desire to figure things out, to get to truth, and it all starts with a photograph.

Speaker 2:          00:01:27       One of the very, very first photographs of war, 1855 which war? This is the Crimean war that involved Great Britain, France, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and believe it or not, Sardinia, the fighting took place in what is now basically the Ukraine. The Russians were on one side. Everybody else on the other half a million people died. It was incredibly brutal. And there's this photograph titled The Valley of the shadow of death. It's black and white. It shows a dirt road cutting through this landscape. Just one dirt

Speaker 5:          00:02:10       road

Speaker 2:          00:02:11       between two hills. There's nobody in the photograph, no birds, no trees, no people. There's really nothing living in the photograph, not even grass, nothing. What is, you stare at this road a little more closely. You realize why nothing is living in this photograph because this road is littered with Canon cannonballs everywhere. As soon as you notice them photographs springs to life, you imagine this fuselage of artillery fire raining down on this landscape. This is one really fascinating thing about photography. It's a time machine. There's a physical connection between that photograph and world cause you're holding this piece of film that was literally ripped right out of that world. But the context is God and more importantly in this case, you don't even know if that picture is true. What do you mean? It turns out that this photograph is one of a pair. There is a second photograph exactly the same as the first photograph, exact same camera position, but in this other photograph, the cannon balls that were on the road are gone.

Speaker 6:          00:03:32       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       So one has cannibals on the road and one has cannon balls not on the road, but otherwise they're completely identical. Yes. He thought that's weird. Let me look into that. And there was a passage in any ends up reading this essay by Susan Sontag. Where is she talks about these photographs as though it's just obvious what was going on. And he was like, ah, that word. Well I don't like the word obvious. Susan Sontag was basically arguing that the guy who took the picture, Roger Fenton, came to an empty road, put the cannonballs on the road. He staged it. Yes, it's obvious, but that word, nothing is so obvious that it's obvious. And so I started investigating

Speaker 6:          00:04:19       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04:19       and so we began a ludicrous, obsessive dug it, but kind of sublime pursuit of this slippery little fact that actually inspired this whole hour. So today on radio lab, we are going to wrestle with a series of seemingly simple facts. Yup. Turn out to raise complicated questions like what is truth? Is it just a pile of facts? And how much does the fact of the matter matter?

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich back to Aero Morris. I track it down. Fenton's letters from the Crimea journals, written records of soldiers who were in that area given time. Didn't find much. I interviewed five historians who ordered the photograph in one way thing. Yes, it's obvious he posed the pictures who, this is a bit of a surprise order. The photographs in the opposite way. Really they told them it is actually very possible that Fenton saw the cannonballs, took the picture and then soldiers came along, took the cannibals off the road to recycle them so they could fire them back at the rushes. Exactly. Was that kind of recycling common practice? Yes, indeed. It was actually see at a tie to historian saying you faked it to saying he didn't and the fifth Daybreaker jumped back and forth. I like the, you call it, tried to call him the tie that he didn't break the tie. Well, of course none of none of these things is subject though. Vote truth isn't something that you vote on at this point. He says he was feeling a very familiar irritation start. You know what? Forget historical. What if I could from the photograph itself, the very photograph itself determine which photograph came first from just the photo. So I started a being the photograph, just sort of superimposing them on each other and flipping back and forth.

Speaker 7:          00:06:13       A, B, B, a, B, B, a,

Speaker 2:          00:06:17       etc. Etc. Nothing in any things. I know what I can do. I can start studying the shadows, which meant, yeah, let's go to the Crimea. Are you serious? Yeah. His reasoning was I can't study the shadows unless I knew the exact direction the camera was pointing on that day in 1855 which means I need to find the exact spot where Fenton stood and I had terrible trouble finding this place. Is it marked? No. All of the guides kept taking me to the charge of the light brigade. That's site where Tennyson wrote about the valley of death. No, no, no. Noon. Not The valley of death. The Valley of the shadow. Finally, a guide named Olga. She was fabulous. Helps them locate this spot. It's completely desolate, undeveloped, still after 150 years with some trial and error, he's able to figure out that Fenton was facing north when he took those photos and then he goes off to the Crimean war museum and asks them, could I borrow some cannon balls?

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       Oh Man. I take the cannon ball, take it out to the valley. Of the shadow of death and I photograph it at different times of the day, hoping that he'd be able to see subtle differences in the shadows cast by those cannonballs that could help them order the photos, but nothing, nothing. There was endless questions about cloud cover, whether you could even measure the shadows on these photographs. In fact, he now suspects that the shadows in those old pictures may not have been shadows at all, but just artifacts of how the prints were made and on and on. So was the trip useful at all? Not so much.

Speaker 2:          00:08:08       How many, how many days did you spend photographing and examining the photographs of cannon balls on the road? I was there for about a week and then he went home with no answer to his question, only that continuing irritation, but he was like, no, no, not done yet. Look, when you investigate anything, I don't care what it is, whether it's a Fenton photograph or Ahboo grave or the mirror of a Dallas police officer. Yes. Complications, result thinking causes complications. I'm sorry, but it's part of that process that we go through of trying to figure out what's out there in the world, what really happened. Uh,

Speaker 8:          00:08:56       this is about truth,

Speaker 9:          00:08:59       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:09:00       absolute truth

Speaker 10:         00:09:01       and the

Speaker 2:          00:09:04       pursuit of truth properly considered shouldn't have stopped short of insanity.

Speaker 10:         00:09:10       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:09:11       So yes, the photographs worried me that I might not be able to resolve it to my satisfaction,

Speaker 2:          00:09:19       but then he's at a party and he bumps into a friend of his, a guy by the name of Dennis Purcell, who is very, very good with Photoshop when he called them up. Hello? Turns out, well, I'm an optical engineer, so he's not just good at Photoshop. He actually, he builds high tech cameras. In any case, they were talking at this party and the Fenton picture came up. Aerial told him he had this problem of wondering which came first and said, could you take a look at these? Dennis takes the pictures home, puts them in his computer. Then I immediately started to compare them right away. He starts noticing differences between the two. The light changed. The weather was different shadows, but he comes to pretty much the same conclusion as Arrow that those things ultimately don't help. So he just starts flipping between the photos, flipping the back and forth, back and forth between the two photographs on the road, flip off the road, flip on the road, flip off the road, flip it's doing this for hours off the road, flip on the road, and then he sees it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:22       The rocks on the left hand side, this little group of pebbles up on the left bank. Every time you flip back and forth, flip, flip, those little rocks popped out. They moved just a little bit and when he zoomed in, he could see that there were five of them. Fred, George Oswald, Lionel and Marmaduke, we named them. Yes, these five guys shifted from one photo to the next. And here's the key in the picture where the road was empty, they were a little bit higher on the hill when the road was full of cannibals. This little rock shift down maybe eight inches or nine inches. And from the direction of that movement, you can order the photographs. It's basically like this, you could say some rocks fell down the hill. They went from up on the hill to down, up goes before down. And if the up photo is the empty road and the down photo is the road full of cannonballs. Well then the one with the cannon balls on the road was the second picture. Imagine the scene. Fenton comes upon an empty road, but he sees Canam malls on the hill. So he and

Speaker 8:          00:11:27       whoever was helping him would have walked along the sides of the road and lifted up cannon balls, move them on to the road. In that process, they would have invariably knocked into rocks

Speaker 2:          00:11:42       and rocks don't fall up hill. They only fold down downhill. It's gravity. So case closed. This is, this has been resolved. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       Susan Sontag was right for the wrong reasons, but she was right. Fenton staged the photograph. So in addition to being one of the first photographs of war, this is one of the first photographic lies.

Speaker 6:          00:12:10       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       I guess he just figured it was a better photo. Yeah, or you could say

Speaker 8:          00:12:16       fitting was a coward. Maybe he didn't want to get too close to the actual fighting, so he'd put the cannon balls on the road to make it look a lot more dangerous than it would have otherwise, or maybe he was after some kind of emotional truth.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       That's what Dennis Purcell thinks. It's obvious why he did it. Here's that word again to make it look the way it felt to put those cannonballs on the road is how you felt when you were there. Which case he would argue that the second photo, the one he posed is more authentic than the first,

Speaker 2:          00:12:47       but forget all of that. Who in hell knows what Fenton was thinking? I really don't know what his motivation was, but isn't that kind of the question at the end of the day, do I really care whether he put the cannon balls on the road or not? Well, I hope you do. If you do, don't you?

Speaker 6:          00:13:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:11       I do and I don't really, we didn't. Why would you go through all this then? I guess this is what I take from it.

Speaker 6:          00:13:21       Mm.

Speaker 8:          00:13:22       In flipping back and forth between those two photographs, flip, he says, you see the rocks move, flip. And when you see the rocks move flip, you imagine feet kicking those rocks and when you imagine feet kicking those rocks flip, you feel the soldiers walking like really feel it. You feel them hitting into the rocks. You feel on some deep sense for me, the reality of that scene in a way that I would not have felt otherwise. It's almost as if you've walked through a pinhole camera into the past

Speaker 6:          00:14:13       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:14:13       that world in which the photograph, that strange temporal evanescent world in which we live is gone. But if you can step between these photographs, you're permitted a brief trespass into something that you thought was lost. Yes. My father died when I was two years old and perhaps the deepest one of the deepest mysteries of my life. Who was he air all these photographs around the house [inaudible] I was very, very young. I have no memories of him. There's a mystery about this man who is central to my life in so many ways, but who I don't know and who I never will know.

Speaker 4:          00:15:32       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:17:52       Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today we've been investigating the truth, fact of the matter and this next segment to set it up. I guess all I really want to say is it sometimes getting to the fact of the matter, a fact of the matter, the way Arrow just did. That can be tricky. Yeah. You end up finding things that you didn't expect that are way more complicated than you expected. The story begins with our producer, Pat Walters started for him when he was talking with an ex CIA agent.

Speaker 15:         00:18:23       So maybe you've taken me to, was this the summer of 1981

Speaker 16:         00:18:29       okay. In the summer of 1981 I was being transferred from one overseas post to another.

Speaker 15:         00:18:35       This is a pro bono and I'm a retired CIA officer. But in 1981 Merle was still at the CIA and he was posted

Speaker 16:         00:18:43       in the sticks out in the boonies somewhere in Southeast Asia. And, and, and why, why were you, oh, well that's, yeah, I had a, I had a little disagreement with my, uh, previous chief and I ended up in a, in this remote, a jungle backwater, I guess is the best way to phrase it. Can you say what country you in? Um, I'd rather not.

Speaker 17:         00:19:08       Oh,

Speaker 15:         00:19:10       in any case, as much as Merle did not want to be there, it turned out that this little backwater was ground zero for what was about to become one of the strangest stories of the Cold War, just to set the scene. The story happens in Laos, which is that kind of narrow country between Vietnam and Thailand. And the time is a few years after the Vietnam War, right after the war, U s army left pulled out all of our troops. And once we were gone, the communist basically took over the region, the communist being the Vietcong and their allies and loudest the path at Lao [inaudible] Chateau g, it was may of 1975 all of a sudden they'd be a con that La had infiltrated and they were all over our village. And I knew that the American Tetlock, this is Ang Yang. Robert and I spoke with him and his niece, Kalia translated for us [inaudible] lives in Minneapolis, but in 1975 he lived in a tiny village in the mountains of Laos [inaudible].

Speaker 15:         00:20:06       It's part of a tribe called the man and ink says as soon as the Americans left Lao and Vietnamese soldiers showed up in his village, there was a hundred of them. They came in cars and in a way you could say they were out for a day, they told because during Vietnam war, thousands of Mong soldiers had fought on our side and as soon as we were out of the picture, that's when the killing started. Thanks. As it began with isolated attacks, John Mondo had the [inaudible] par villagers started getting killed in random field [inaudible] like did they just find one of their neighbors shot dead in his rice patty one day or a woman would go fetch water and never come back. Yellow car show John Name, which are partial far long. It

Speaker 14:         00:20:48       was a village and I know the name of the village. I know the name of the village chief,

Speaker 8:          00:20:51       the path that Lao, which again is the communist army in Laos, had gotten suspicious that these villagers may have been hiding guns in the jungle like plotting to rebel against the government to one day.

Speaker 14:         00:21:02       The fact that law went over and he slaughtered the whole village. That's when we knew that the laws of humanity had been, had been terminated

Speaker 18:         00:21:12       and not long after that in his family, along with thousands of other mung fled their villages when to hiding the jungle. This is where things stood when Moreau got his assignment and a, before he left DC and flew over to Asia. I stopped in our headquarters and while I was there I was brief by our desk officer who told him about what was happening. The communist raids, the among the fleeing, but then the desk officer said something kind of odd. There had been these reports from refugees, refugees like Ang about this yellow, these yellow droplets falling from the air.

Speaker 19:         00:21:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:21:52       PBS went out to the camps and interviewed some of the refugees. Crab who? Oh area. I said this yellow stuff that was falling out of the sky was coming from planes. We only saw the powders free from yet. Some refugees talked about powder, some talked about the liquid, a yellow miss sometimes, but they all said whatever this was. When it landed, it mean people violently ill and they all talked about how after this stuff fell from the sky, when did powder reach the ground? It's dark on everything, but behind these yellow spots, chip are done now, you know,

Speaker 14:         00:22:22       yellow drops everywhere all over the landscape.

Speaker 8:          00:22:27       Ang remembers. The first time he saw it, she was hiding in the woods somewhere and somebody came running to him and said, you have to come and see this yellow stuff. Just fell on a village up on the hill, ran up the hill and sort of crashed out of the forest and just stopped

Speaker 10:         00:22:42       [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         00:22:43       right there at the edge of the village, a glued Lucia toe. I learned let p electronic too. I saw a dead cow and two dead pigs and several dead chicken and all the people who've been exposed that they, they were all having stomach trouble.

Speaker 8:          00:22:57       Ink says people were doubled over covering their stomach, riding in pain, throwing up some, throwing up blood. Yet [inaudible] people began to suffer from everything from diarrhea to headaches, rashes.

Speaker 14:         00:23:08       There was a person, and I have the photo right here am my keeping her capa ma who had been exposed and her eyes, her eyes were destroyed, entire leap and many people ang says, didn't recover. What I saw was people dying, they wouldn't get better. They would die.

Speaker 18:         00:23:24       Marel says the thought in CIA was that this might be some kind of chemical weapon. Right? Did it have a name at that point? Yellow rain, yellow rain. By the time Marel got to Southeast Asia, hundreds of these reports had come in. Hundreds and several thousand people had been reported killed by this stuff. But you know, in those kinds of situations and in Southeast Asia general, you know, are tons of rumors,

Speaker 16:         00:23:46       but you have to be careful of what you believe and what you don't believe. And you have to rely on evidence, which it just didn't have no until all of a sudden

Speaker 20:         00:23:56       [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:23:56       they did just a few months after Maura got there and they started getting these reports that refugees and collected samples off of leaves. Some refugees had shown up with leaves covered in these yellow spots there. Here's a closeup. This is Matt Messel son. He's a Harvard chemists and chemical weapons expert. The U S government asks to help examine these samples. I went up and visited him in his office and Cambridge. Here's some old leaves. These are only leaves rug back. These are all dried out. No, the leaves are small, black, brittle, which only makes the spots stand out even more because they're this incredible bright yellow. They're tiny. They're, they're two or three millimeters across. And Matt says, when scientists put these leaves under a microscope and looked inside the yellow spots, they saw that the spots had a very high content of toxin called t two which is a poison. And while T2 does grow in nature, the concentrations that they found in these spots was way too high to have occurred naturally,

Speaker 16:         00:24:53       which demonstrated that this was, you know, in fact a, a, a new type of a chemical weapon.

Speaker 21:         00:25:00       We now have physical evidence.

Speaker 18:         00:25:04       This is secretary of State Alexander Haig in the fall of 1981

Speaker 21:         00:25:07       which has been analyzed and found to contain abnormally high levels of potent mycotoxins, poisonous substances. The United States said today it has evidence that chemical warfare has been waged and parts of Southeast Asia, the US obtained a test sample of twigs and leaves. Chemical analysis found high levels of three toxic chemicals.

Speaker 18:         00:25:29       The news of this poison, this yellow rain became an instant political crisis. Refugees and camps along the Thai border have been telling for years have a yellow rain or rain that was followed in minutes by vomiting, bleeding, and death. Because everybody knew the Lao and Vietnamese armies were not capable of making this stuff. No Vietnam could not even make their own rifles. They were pretty backward in that sense, which really left only one likely suspect circumstantial evidence points to the Russians. The Soviet Union may be engaging in biological warfare. The Soviets, of course denied. They were involved. Soviets said it was a slanderous accusation, but the US government did not believe them. Soviet Union, the allies are violating the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and in the summer of 1982 in a speech, the UN president Reagan officially accused the Soviet Union of supplying and using chemical weapons in Southeast Asia. There is conclusive evidence the Soviet government has provided toxins for you, Shun Laos and Cambodia. Three years later, Congress passed legislation authorizing the production of a chemical bomb called the big guy, a 500 pound bomb, and it's been to be carried on high performance aircraft and within two years, the factory in Penn Bluff, Arkansas, begin churning out thousands of bounds designed to carry Saron gas.

Speaker 18:         00:26:42       Why? This would be the first time the United States had manufactured a chemical weapon in nearly 20 years. All this in effect because of the yellow rain

Speaker 4:          00:27:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:27:01       but before we jump ahead in the, in November of 1982 there were two days of press briefings by the State Department, and this is where things really start to get weird. The State Department had gotten everybody together to explain it. Some British scientists had looked at the spots and in addition to the poison, they found something else. All the samples had a very high content of pollen from flowers, which initially didn't make any sense like why would pollen be toxic? But eventually the government officials came to this kind of terrifying conclusion that in fact, this was a very, very clever communist mixture. Somehow the Russians had found a way to use pollen as a vector to transmit this toxin. If it falls right on your skin, it would intoxicate you poison you. But if these drops should fall on a leaf or a rock, then the wind would read, disperse these

Speaker 22:         00:27:57       Poland Greens, which we've just the right diameter to penetrate to the depths of [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:28:02       the lungs, thereby making it a more deadly weapon.

Speaker 4:          00:28:06       [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:28:07       that remembers hearing that and thinking that just seemed completely bonkers to me. I knew a lot about chemical weapons. You'd never heard of anything like that before? No. So he sent some of these samples around to other scientists. He knew in one afternoon he's sitting in his lab and he gets a call. I remember the phone call. This is the guy who called and Tom Sealy. I'm a professor in the department of Neurobiology and behavior at Cornell University. Matt pick up the phone. Tom said to him, Hey, I analyzed the samples you sent me and then he said, the State Department explanation is not parsimonious. Meaning meaning this yellow stuff is not a chemical weapon that he paused. He said it's be, and then he used a four letter word and if we can use that word because that all right. Yeah. You said it was beaten. What? BC, what we call fecal spot of honeybee.

Speaker 23:         00:28:57       You tell

Speaker 18:         00:28:59       that was their idea. Yeah. They were like, look, here's the thing. Every winter bees kind of hibernate during the winter. There are no flowers and there is no Paula, there's no nectar. There's nothing for the bees to go out and collect so that they stay inside and confined to their hives all winter feeding their babies, fattening up the new worker bees for the next season.

Speaker 22:         00:29:18       It's since they're very fastidious, they do not defecate in their nests. They don't poop all winter. Right? So the becoming immensely constipated. And then when the first warm days, they all fly out on mass,

Speaker 18:         00:29:33       do like a hundred feet off the ground and defecate all at the same. It is called the cleansing flight in anybody who cultures, bees, noses. And if you get caught beneath the situation, Tom says, if feels like light raindrops hitting your arms, hitting your forehead. So this was their theory that the yellow rain was not a chemical weapon. It was just B droppings. They published this and the government was like, seriously, even a bunch of prestigious scientists came forward and said that it was an absurd explanation. Kind of crazy and embarrassing a, let's not forget that this rain was toxic and be honeybees and southeast Asia don't even hibernate. There is no winter in Southeast Asia. It's the tropics. So Southeast Asian bees never get constipated and they never do the big poop. Those Eric, good objections. No, Matt and Tom Counter by going to Thailand. 12 and I flew out there and they go into the jungle plants and beehives and one day they're staring up at a high and in the flesh they see it happen. The bees shoot up into the sky

Speaker 2:          00:30:37       and within a minute or two after that we started to get rained upon by the beef ECS. So to tell the government, sorry, we think it happens here too. Wait, there's only half of it. I mean, what about the toxic part? The whole idea that these bees are pooping poison.

Speaker 18:         00:30:56       That is a hard one. But when Matt and Tom were in Thailand, some labs had started retesting those original samples because you see the poison had been detected by one particular lab in Minnesota at the beginning, but now that these yellow spots were such a big deal, other labs all over the world began to retest them and they couldn't find anything. The British never found the trees. The Swedes never found a trace. The Way Matt sees it, the analyses were wrong. He thinks that lab, the lab in Minnesota that had been doing this work inadvertently contaminated the pollen because this lab did lots of other work with Mycotoxins, large quantities of these toxins. The government obviously wanted to be sure they did their own retests of the samples. They didn't find anything. They sent a team to Southeast Asia to verify the bees do the poop shower thing and they do,

Speaker 2:          00:31:48       and my friend, it's a good friend, Palm Tet, who was part of that team, told me that in the bar at the end of this multi-day excursion, off the record, one of the gentlemen said, well, I guess we owed the Soviets and apology on this one. Which hasn't ever happened. In fact, yellow rain is still, that's moral again in the U S Army Chemical Corps manual is, you know, one of the possible weapons that might be used. Oh really? Yeah, it's still there. It's still there.

Speaker 14:         00:32:17       I have a, I have a clarifying question before I interpreted that. So, so they found toxins initially and then when they looked again at those samples that talk, some were no longer there. That's right. Okay. I've got like, you know, had the Hathaway [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:32:31       at a certain point in our conversation with Ang, the Hmong guy, Robert and I talked to you earlier with his niece, Kalia translating for him. We explained that the evidence they'd been attacked by chemical weapons seemed, yeah,

Speaker 14:         00:32:42       I interpret that from my uncle, a little shaky, heightened and [inaudible] uh, [inaudible] thanks. Response was if this was just be feces explains the kids dying the people and the animals dying. That where there is this yellow thing where there are no bees, um, whole whole villages die.

Speaker 18:         00:33:03       We asked Kalia to tell Ang what the scientists had told us that the Hmong were definitely dying. The mode were under real attack. They were being fired at from airplanes and by soldiers. And but more importantly, even if they weren't killed by those direct attacks, they were on the run through the jungle. Mountain nourished and drinking from contaminated streams. Diseases like dysentery in Colorado were rampant. And the way a lot of people see it is that they may have miss attributed some of those mysterious deaths to this cloud of bee poop that looked like it could have been a chemical weapon.

Speaker 14:         00:33:36       Hi John Jake with hydro Noosa. The Ang says no Caicos are more on a weekend in the mirror planet, not a chance. What I've seen, and there is no inkling in my mind that those deaths were not caused by starvation dysentery. It was chemicals that without were killing my people.

Speaker 18:         00:33:54       So we wanted to know, and this was an honest question, did he see something that would contradict the scientist story?

Speaker 14:         00:34:02       Did the source of the rain, was there always a plane and then rain plane and then rain or did sometimes the rain happen without a plane? [inaudible] Sheila, let's learn [inaudible] potty now. We never saw what what they said was that it was always just being dropped on them and it will always, always be in drop where there are heavy concentrations of Hmong people that that's what we knew. We don't know whether there was a plane causing it. It was just a, you just see the dust or see the, you know, you have to understand that the planes are shooting bullets and bombs everyday all the time and so, so whether it was a bombing plane or yellow plane, it was incredibly hard to distinguish [inaudible] Tamayo everybody runs when you hear the plane. So mom, people don't watch bombs coming down. You came out, you sneak your head out and you watch what happened in the aftermath. You saw broken trees, you saw yellow in the, in the aftermath of what had been bombed [inaudible] and [inaudible] on it. I saw with my own eyes, the bee pollen on the leaves eating two holes with my own eyes. I saw Paul and that could kill the grass, could kill leaves, could kill trees, but he himself

Speaker 18:         00:35:14       clear, oh.

Speaker 14:         00:35:16       Whether it's the B stuff or whether it's other stuff, because there was so much stuff coming down from the sky. Jean Young and my yard needs either. Yeah. Them [inaudible] that she don't pay a court. Yeah. Which hippo had the [inaudible] [inaudible] you know, that, that, that were chemicals being that being against the mall in the mountains of Laos, whether this is the chemicals from the Balm or yellow rain chemicals were being used, it feels to him like this is a semantic debate and it feels like, um, there's a sad lack of justice that, that, that the word of a man who survived this thing must be pitted against a professor from Harvard who's read these accounts. As far as I can tell,

Speaker 2:          00:35:59       your uncle didn't see the bee pollen fall. Your uncle didn't see a plane. All of this is hearsay.

Speaker 4:          00:36:09       Okay.

Speaker 14:         00:36:10       It's hard. Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:36:14       hot hope. Yeah. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         00:36:19       my uncle says, um, for the last 20 years, he didn't know that anything anybody was interested in the death of the among people. Did he agreed to do this interview because you were interested in know what happened to them about what happened and the world has has been on interested for the last 20 years. He agreed because you were interested that the story would be hurt and that the moment that's would be brought, documented and recognized. That's why he agreed to the interview

Speaker 24:         00:36:45       that the mobile heart is broken, that our leaders have been silenced and what we know has been questioned again and again. It's not a surprise to him or to me.

Speaker 4:          00:36:55       Okay.

Speaker 24:         00:36:56       I agree to the interview for the same reason that radio lab was interested in the Hmong story that they were interested in, documented the dust that happened. There was so much that was not told. Everybody knows that chemical warfare was being used. How do you create bombs if not what chemicals goes? We can play the semantics game. We can, but I'm not interested in, my uncle was not interested. We have lost too much heart and too many people in the process.

Speaker 4:          00:37:22       Okay.

Speaker 24:         00:37:26       I, I think that, I think the interview is done.

Speaker 4:          00:37:29       Okay

Speaker 2:          00:37:46       now, um, that, that wasn't the end of the interview. They kept on talking Robert and bad explained to Kalia that we know we're reporters. We're just trying to figure out what happened. One thing I do want to make clear, we informed the gangs in advance that we wanted to talk about the controversy surrounding yellow rain. We were very clear about that. We did not intend to ambush them, but this interview troubled us. We talked about it for months, arguing back and forth about what it meant to the story, what it meant for us personally and we decided at a certain point to bring that conversation into the studio. We're gonna play you that conversation as we originally podcast it and then we'll have some things to say on the other end.

Speaker 4:          00:38:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:33       That started by, uh, talking about the moment that you just heard on

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       tape

Speaker 15:         00:38:38       that somehow that moment was when the whole story changed for me.

Speaker 1:          00:38:45       How exactly like

Speaker 15:         00:38:47       I think that there was something about like the way that she was pointing away from the thing that we had been looking so hard at and saying, stop looking at that. Look over here. Yeah. Like she like she didn't convince me at all that this wasn't a chemical weapon, but she convinced me that we were missing something.

Speaker 1:          00:39:11       Yeah. What I'm hearing her say they're not having been in this interview is quit focusing on the clo reign stuff because when you do that, you shoving aside the much larger story, namely that my people were being killed. Right. So what she's saying, so you're mad as wrong.

Speaker 15:         00:39:28       That is absolutely into my mind. That is not fair to us. How is it not fair? It's not fair to ask us to not consider the other stories and the other frames of this story. The fact that the most powerful man in the world, Ronald Reagan used this story to order the manufacturer of chemical weapons for the first time in 20 years. If the United States with the manufacturer chemical weapons again and then use them because the Russians supposedly had, then people would have died. Ugly deaths in the consequence of that. And that is not unimportant. That's hugely important, but it's not important to her. So should that not be important to us? But yeah, I think that, I dunno, I, I think that until she, until she said the things that she said at the end of that interview, I don't think that I had fully appreciated the, the volume of pain that was involved in that moment for them. Yeah. Yes. I thought, I thought her reaction was very balancing, but her desire was not for balance. Her desire was to monopolize the story and that we can, sure. We can say that though. Oh, if you listen to the words, that's okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:42       No, I just think that they feel like their trauma has never been fully acknowledged and that they've attached it to this because maybe they felt that they had to, they've attached it to this idea that yellow rain was a chemical weapon. And if yellow rain suddenly isn't a chemical weapon that doesn't just and validate the yellow rain, it negates their whole loss. And I think she might be right. But it's a, and I also think that the scientists are right, it's not a chemical weapon. And I also think you're right that to call it a chemical weapon has big consequences. So what do you do when three truths are right at the same time? This is where we stop.

Speaker 15:         00:41:25       So that was our original conversation and when the podcast went out, a lot of people were very upset by me in particular. So I think I want to, if I could add just a couple of things here. First of all, clearly it was wrong to say that Kalia Yang was trying to monopolize our conversation because after all we are the editors. We choose what to put on the air. And in this case we chose, we were looking for evidence that despite what the sciences thought, that maybe there was a chemical weapon here and we wanted to find an eye witness to see if anybody saw a bomb open and yellow rain come out. That's what reporters do. We test truths and that is why I was persistent. I had no idea what the gangs were going to say and when they got angry I was, I was embarrassed. And when I got angry in my conversation with Jed and pat, that was not right. And for that, I apologize to Kaya and Mr. Yang in particular, I have to ask questions and search for truth. But in this case, given how much Mr. Yang had already suffered, I should've done it with more respect and more gently

Speaker 15:         00:43:34       I don't really know where Tim is, so we're just going to try. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today we're talking about truth and facts. Yep. Facts of the matter. So recently our producer, Pat Walters and I, we were trying to get in touch with a guy, Tim Kreider. Hello, Tim. Nope. Right there. I think if we just shout very loudly, like up the window, we wanted to talk to Tim because Tim is not only is he a wonderful writer and before that a cartoonist has this essay, which kind of gets to the heart of a very different kind of truth that we've tackled so far, and that is, can you truly know somebody even after everything you thought you knew turns out to be wrong. Hello, Tim? Yes. Oh, there you are. You sound great too. Oh, we should say this is a story not about Tim, but about his friend who he named Skelly just to protect his identity. Right. So let's, let's try, if it's okay with you, if we could maybe just talk about Skelly

Speaker 25:         00:44:32       as if we were just kind of hanging out at a bar, even though you're in a tiny booth on the other company. I have a little shred of beer in this tiny room that would be easier. Tell us, uh, how you met this guy. Um, he was part of a group of friends I made when I was working in post-collegiate job, going door to door for the environment. Um, to knock on doors with clipboards and get people to donate, like vacuum salesman, not, not kind of thing. Yeah. You're dropped off by a van in a suburban neighborhood and I can still faintly feel the dread of, of having to knock on your first door the night, which was always the worst. But you know, like, like being in the army, it was a bonding experience, especially because they're knocking on the door. Stuff was just really, you know, a few hours a day.

Speaker 25:         00:45:20       Then there's going out to the bars afterwards, which became as much a part of the job for us as, as anything else. And one of those nights out drinking with friends, he got to talking with Skelly. What'd he look like, by the way? You know, I, he forbade me ever to draw him. I used to put my friends in my cartoons all the time and um, I did that once to him and he interdicted me from doing that again. So you don't want to draw him on the radio? No. You know, he's about to, okay. I'm sorry. He had this great mop of curly hair glasses that were literally held together by duct tape. And the overall effect was warmth and intelligence. But from the beginning he says basic facts about this guy where little hard to pin down.

Speaker 25:         00:46:05       It wasn't really clear at first whether he belonged to our camp, uh, the hippiest young people or whether he was someone slightly older. His first life hadn't worked out. Um, as it turned out, he was the ladder and he had been a practicing lawyer and he had quit being a lawyer for reasons that remain unknown to me. I mean, I'm not sure it was entirely voluntary quitting, but Tim says at the time he liked the guy. Yeah. For one thing, women seem to like him. They were charmed by him right away. All my girlfriends always liked him. And beyond that, you know, he and I were two of the readers in the group. We each always had a book with us. So they began to swap books. And as they got to be good friends, Skelly even showed him his writing. I still have it somewhere in Longhand, even beautiful long hand.

Speaker 25:         00:46:55       He was clearly, um, a sort of kindred spirit. But then some questions popped up. One day, Skelly told him that he had written a novel and that it had been accepted for publication. Tim was like, wow, it was excited for him. You probably thought you got published. That's amazing. I wanted to do that. Yeah. So, you know, I kept bugging him about, well, when's, when's your book coming out? Skelly would say, well, you know, in a few months, and then the few months would pass. And Scotty would say, well, they just pushed it back. It's coming. And you know, we had a close little group of friends and like all people on Earth, we talked about each other behind each other's backs. And it may be that someone else sort of clued me in like, Tim, there's no block.

Speaker 5:          00:47:37       Mm.

Speaker 25:         00:47:38       I mean, maybe he wrote a book, but it's not being published. Initially Tim said, well, there's probably some truth to it, you know, even if the truth was only the kind of truth that's contained in dreams. But then there were other stories. One of his stories was about having been married briefly in France and having a daughter over there. And there was a time, at least one time when he was on vacation from the environmental canvas and he supposedly was going to be in France visiting his daughter who lived with her, uh, maternal grandparents there. And our boss saw him walking on Charles Street in Baltimore during that time. Obviously he was not in France

Speaker 25:         00:48:20       and they were never like, uh, dude, someone saw you in Baltimore where you really in France? No, we didn't say that. And you know, I, I've met, uh, I mean I've spent, I've logged a lot of time hanging out in bars and you do meet pathological liars in that line of work. Um, and, and you know, I'm always duly impressed by their stories when I first hear them, until they pile up and they've, they're always able to one up your story, you know, they've always met someone more famous than you. Something more tragic has always happened to them. And then they start to seem creepy and repellent. And all I can say is he didn't feel that way. He just seemed like a really good guy who happened to lie more than most.

Speaker 25:         00:49:11       In any case, after they left the canvasing job, they both stayed in Baltimore and the state clothes, we frequently ended up crashing on the same floors together, closed down the bars together every night they take road trips together, blasting classic rock and he loved LED's up on. And after a while those stories, like I've published a novel or I have a daughter in France, we didn't hear that stuff anymore. Our, our theory is that he did not expect that we would end up being friends for the next 20 years and he would have to maintain these stories. And you know, we liked the guy so much that it would have been unthinkably mean spirited to bring this stuff up. So we just sort of pretended we'd never heard it. And he says they kept themselves from asking too many questions like, yeah, they knew he had a job at the opera house, you know, fundraising, but he was always broke, always hitting them up for money.

Speaker 25:         00:50:08       And he was, he was, they wonder why was he always house sitting and spending the night at the library? You just never knew. You did have to, you did have to triangulate from, from the few facts available. And you know, in a way it was a fun, it was fun to speculate about and fun to tease him about behind his back. Of course, for example, Tim told us about one time he'd, his friend nick were up at their cabin near the Chesapeake Bay, which is about an hour outside Baltimore. And we had had a lovely afternoon eating oysters, drinking beers overlooking the bay. And we're supposed to drive to a train station about 20 minutes, half an hour away to pick Skelly up. Uh, he's going to take the train up there and join us. And so we break away from our pleasant set up on the water and we drive down to the train station to pick them up.

Speaker 25:         00:50:56       The train comes and goes, he's not on it. Uh, and we're both a little peeved at having been torn away from our afternoon to come get him only to be stood up at the train station. So my friend checks his cell phone to see if maybe there's a message and indeed there is and the message goes like this. Hey guys, this is Skelly. Um, I missed the train. First of all, there's the background noises of what is clearly a bar glasses clinking the TV on unmistakably the mount royal tavern, a low oil. We just knew and he says, so, um, I'm really sorry about this, but I was in a meeting that ran a little longer than I expected and tried to catch it, but I was like three minutes too late, but I checked and there's another train seven 20, it gets in seven 45.

Speaker 25:         00:51:49       I'll definitely be on that one. So hopefully you all get this message and be there to meet me. Ah, okay. Again, sorry about that. Hope I'll see you soon. And then there's 30 or 45 seconds of him fumbling to figure out how to hang up this borrowed cell phone throughout which we can hear the sounds of the bar clearly in the background. And I listened to this message and I just smiled and shook my head and handed it speechless. Lee to my friend. Nick, do you give any sense of what's, when you're not being told something, do you have any feeling for what you're not being told or you just think it's just silly detail? No, you know, I don't, it was, he was just a very secretive guy.

Speaker 6:          00:52:33       Whoa.

Speaker 25:         00:52:34       Um, and we got the sense that, I mean he told me once, you know, the less people know about you, the better off you are.

Speaker 6:          00:52:41       [inaudible]

Speaker 25:         00:52:42       I mean, we weren't supposed to know for a long time that he lived at home with his mother. Um, you know, which is not unheard of, but an embarrassing thing when you're a grown man. And it became really obvious that he did, cause if you called his house sometime you got his mother. Um, and he had a complex cover story about how, oh, well if the phone rang enough times at his house, it was forwarded to his mother's to pick up, which, you know, I had never heard of that. I didn't know the phone company offered that service. So you know, we knew the deal but we weren't going to challenge him on it because it's so clearly it was something he was embarrassed about and eager to conceal.

Speaker 6:          00:53:24       [inaudible]

Speaker 25:         00:53:24       I think probably saw himself and was worried that others would see him as, as you know, marginal or pathetic or losers and you know, we didn't see him that way. We love the guy. It was just one of us. You know, there are conditions that come with every friendship. People are weird and most of the people who are really worth being friends with are weird. And you learn to accept that there are unspoken rules in certain friendships.

Speaker 6:          00:53:56       No,

Speaker 25:         00:53:57       until the day comes when the rules don't apply anymore. Fast forward a few years, Tim has moved to New York. Skelly still is in Baltimore with his, well, his mother had died, but he was living in the same house. I still saw him pretty often. He'd take the train up and we get some beers and some chicken wings. And one day I got a phone call from a friend of mine and he sounded very badly shaken. Tim's friend said that he'd been worried about Skelly cause he hadn't heard from him for a while and then he called work and it turned out he hadn't been there and he knew something was wrong. So he went to his house and um, you know, I think he was able to get the door open enough to see inside and uh, he called inform and he heard nothing and he forced his way in and found him lying on the floor dead.

Speaker 25:         00:54:49       The coroner ruled that that death was drug related. So I went back to Baltimore right away, um, because I assumed they were being a, a memorial service and so on. And for a couple of days, nothing happened at all because he had kept his life so thoroughly compartmentalized that no one knew how to get in touch with his family. Although at the last minute, the day before his funeral, we got in touch with his extended family and they were able to send some people up just before they arrived at occurred to Tim. Well maybe we should go through his house, you know, and just clean up and you know, find out if there's anything there that we should, you know, disappear before his family shows up. And we were talking to the guy who first found him and he said, yeah, well here's the thing. He told them, you guys, you can go back into that house, but I'm, I'm not going back in there. He had warned us, but as soon as we stepped in, it was still shocking.

Speaker 6:          00:55:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 25:         00:55:53       and terrible. What did you see when you walked in? Um, there are aspects about that that I will never tell you or anyone else. But suffice to say that as soon as you walked in, you could tell that someone had ceased living like a human being. I mean, there were heaps of things heaps and he'd stopped throwing things out. There wasn't electricity, there wasn't working plumbing,

Speaker 8:          00:56:25       no plumbing at all. No, no, I don't think so.

Speaker 4:          00:56:31       [inaudible]

Speaker 25:         00:56:32       and words are going to fail me here. I mean, the, the simplest way to say it would be to say it was clearly a place where an insane person had lived for someone who is mentally ill and left. Um, I dunno if that's what to call it because most people who are mentally ill don't know to conceal their mental illness. He was just a very gentle, decent, kindhearted guy. But something horrible had happened. Um, but on some level he had, he had understood that. I mean, it was a secret that he was keeping any, kept it locked inside that house. And I think we were all appalled to realize that something had been so drastically wrong with him all this time. And the single most upsetting aspect of it was imagining how utterly alone he must've felt himself to be.

Speaker 25:         00:57:37       Did you have ever have moments of feeling guilt like I should have, I should have gotten into that place. I shouldn't have no. That I, I don't think there is anything that anyone could have done for him. I mean, he, uh, he, he had so clearly determined not to let people in to that chamber of his, his life. And, and the other thing is that he was so convincing in his dissembling. I mean, we really didn't think there was anything seriously wrong. Yeah. He was his best and most decent and sanest self when he was in our company. But you didn't know so much about him. And I guess I just in, in light of that, I wonder what it means to, to know someone or what it, who exactly it was that you think you knew. Yeah. Well, um, you know, the only people I knew of whoever got mad at him for telling, uh, what they would've called lies were women.

Speaker 25:         00:58:41       I mean, he was a guy, so he was not above trying to impress girls and you know, the, the things he was trying to impress them with where his novel is storied history. And often when they found out that those things were not strictly speaking true, they felt lied to and betrayed and none of his friends ever felt that way. And I always felt that perhaps as patronizing or nasty of me, but I always felt that what those girls were really mad about was that they believed him, they'd fallen for it. But in a sense you and your friends fell for something too? Well, I don't know. I mean what I would say we fell for was the thousands of hours we spent in that guy's company, which seems to me like a more direct and reliable form of knowing than hearing facts either made up or real.

Speaker 25:         00:59:39       I mean, there was a day when I'm Skelly and I drove up to my cabin to check on the place cause there'd been a blizzard, uh, and there is a grove of bamboo trees there and the weight of all the snow had bent them over the driveway so that they formed a kind of continuous arch and we parked and we walked down through that arcade and we would tug on every bamboo tree and it would shake the snow off and it would suddenly spoiling up into the air and fling it's load of snow 50 feet into the sky. We did that with every tree walking all the way down the driveway and it was

Speaker 6:          01:00:29       [inaudible]

Speaker 25:         01:00:29       so beautiful and so much fun that we cracked up like boys. And I'm the only one who remembers that now. That was a moment that only he and I were there for and he's gone. Um, he shared that with me and nobody else ever will. You're imagining it cause I've described it to you, but that's not the same thing. And if you don't know someone by having experiences like that and memories like that with them, then I would submit that you cannot ever know anybody at all.

Speaker 25:         01:01:31       thanks to producer pat Walters and to Tim Kreider whose book, which includes this story is called, we learned nothing.
