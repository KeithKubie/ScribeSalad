00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.870
JAY: So thank you everybody
for coming for the session.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.150
It's very nice that you managed
to take some time for this most

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.810
important event of our life,
that we eventually face.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.680
So I've been very honored
to have Giriraj Swami here

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.230
at Google for this talk
on "Authors" series.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.460
Giriraj Swami started
on the spiritual path

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.640
when he was just a teenager,
doing his graduation

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.530
at Brandeis College in Boston.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.130
And just like many of
us, he was questioning

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.930
about the purpose of life, why
there should be death, and what

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.700
is the goal of life,
and all these questions.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.870
And he came across
the "Bhagavad Gita,"

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.460
which is 5,000-year-old
traditional literature from

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.420
India that explains a
spiritual philosophy of life.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.610
And he immediately
became attracted to it,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.560
and found that it answered all
his questions satisfactorily.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.300
And after his
graduation, he started

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.040
to dedicate himself
completely on the spot.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.280
And of course, his
parents didn't like it,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.760
so his father tempted him
with a $ 1 million check.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.800
Give up your spiritual path, and
I'll give you this right away.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.725
His father was a
very reputed lawyer

00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:26.530
who became, later,
a judge in Chicago.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.396
But such a person which
such integrity that he is,

00:01:31.396 --> 00:01:34.190
Giriraj Swami
said, no, I'm fine.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.060
And then, he
continued on the spot.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.100
And he spent the
rest of his life--

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.510
and he is still
doing-- dedicated

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.330
to the service of educating
others on the spiritual path

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.420
that he has so nicely
been able to utilize.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.470
And his teacher had
very ambitious goals,

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.655
and he had him go back to India.

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:00.460
His teacher came
from India, but he

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.700
had some of his Western
students go back to India,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.530
because India was
losing its culture.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.905
Even though the
spiritual culture

00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:10.380
is so well-known in
India, people hardly

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.030
take it seriously.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.400
And he said, actually, you
should go back and serve

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.140
in India, and see how others
are taking their own culture so

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.940
seriously.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.190
They'll wake up and
take it more seriously.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.430
So he sent him to
several ashrams.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.750
He helped him open
several ashrams in India.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.510
And you know how there is so
much politics, and a completely

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.010
different language, and
mosquitoes, and whatnot.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.340
But he dedicated his entire
youth and a large part

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.700
of his life in helping set
up many of those ashrams,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.600
where people could benefit
from these teachings.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.480
And now, he's spending his time
mostly in Carpinteria, where

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.870
he's writing books about
his life experiences,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.140
and everything he has
learned from both himself

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.850
and he learned from others.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.910
And he gives lectures
at various universities

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.550
worldwide and
other institutions,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.180
on these teachings.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.030
So with that brief introduction,
we are very honored to welcome.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.374
Let's welcome him
with a big hand.

00:03:13.374 --> 00:03:19.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:28.220
GIRIRAJ SWAMI: So I am
pleased to see you all here.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.310
The thought of death
is not very palatable.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.070
In fact, many people tend
to avoid the thought of it,

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.710
so the fact that you've
come is quite encouraging.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.330
Why should the living
think of death and dying?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.900
One entrepreneur
from the area said

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.120
that when he was young,
about 17 years old,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.360
he heard or read that "if you
live each day as if it was

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.600
your last day, one
day you'll be right.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.360
It will be your last day."

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.430
And that statement made
an impression on him.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.390
And in the morning, when he
would look in the mirror,

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:45.420
he would ask himself, if
this were my last day,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.240
what would I be doing?

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.690
Would I be doing what I'm
going to be doing today?

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.900
And he said that if for too
many days in a row, what

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.650
he was going to be doing that
day is not what he would want

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.490
to be doing if it was
his last day, he thought,

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.180
I have to make some adjustment.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.830
So the contemplation
of death can actually

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:27.680
help us bring into focus our
values and priorities in life,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.680
which is very important.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.100
My spiritual teacher
gave the example

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:44.340
that if you are performing
a complicated mathematical

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.910
calculation and you make a
mistake in the first step,

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:57.200
even if you perform all
the other steps perfectly,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.320
you may end up getting
further and further away

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.340
from the actual
answer, because you

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.550
made a mistake in
the first step.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.860
So the "Bhagavad Gita" explains
what is our actual identity.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.150
I mean, pretty much
everyone is interested

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.450
in their self-interest,
which is natural.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.060
You are, I am, everyone is.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.770
But to know what our
real self-interest is,

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:36.120
we have to know what or
who our real self is.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.720
And the "Bhagavad Gita" tells
us that that self, that "atma"--

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:49.590
"atma" means "self"--
is not material.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.725
It's not physical or chemical.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:03.570
Now, you're all logical
and intelligent people.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.790
We can just consider
two possibilities.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:13.230
One is that consciousness arises
from a combination of material

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.860
elements.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.170
And the other is that it
is a distinct energy, which

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:24.440
is not physical or chemical.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.270
Now logically, if
consciousness arises

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:34.440
from a combination
of material elements,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.660
and when that combination breaks
down, which people commonly

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.710
call "death," then we
should be able to restore

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.950
that combination and
bring consciousness back

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.820
into that dead body.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:58.420
But our experience has
shown that we can't do that.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.930
With anything material, you can.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.370
I mean, if your car breaks
down, it's not functioning,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.230
you find the defective part.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:11.290
You can replace it, and
the car will work again.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.820
But once the consciousness
leaves the body, it's gone.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:27.220
At that precise moment,
practically all the chemicals

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.429
or material ingredients
to the body are the same.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.039
That moment when
that consciousness

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:41.049
leaves, the elements before and
after are practically the same.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.640
But some things go on.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:50.920
And that something is the atma.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:59.860
And that is of a different
quality than the body.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.100
The "Bhagavad Gita"
gives the example

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.970
that the body is a machine.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:14.470
And the atma is the person
who animates the machine.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:19.580
As long as the driver is in
the machine, the machine works.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.250
And as soon as the driver
leaves the machine,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:27.040
the machine can't work anymore.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:33.070
So we have to consider
which is more important.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.430
I mean, both are important,
the driver and the machine.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:41.920
But definitely, the
driver's more important.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.670
If there is a car
crash, a disastrous car

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:53.820
crash, and the medics
and police and everyone

00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:00.720
rushes to the site, their first
concern is to save the people.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.260
They'll deal with
the vehicles later,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.170
but they want to save
the people first.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:14.020
So we need to know who we are.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.330
Then, we can really
fulfill our self-interest.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:23.540
And the "Bhagavad Gita" says
that person is the atma.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.400
Now, where does death come in?

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.140
Well, first of all, according
to the "Bhagavad Gita,"

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.730
there is no such thing as death.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:42.300
Because the body, the
machine, is always dead.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.510
It never actually is alive.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.760
But it appears to
be alive, because

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.270
of the presence of the atma.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.610
But that atma has
its own requirements,

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.830
just like the body does.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:07.560
And if we pay too much
attention to the body

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:14.890
and neglect the needs of the
atma, we will feel frustrated.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.290
And many people do.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:27.610
Before writing this book,
I met one of the leaders

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:34.230
in the field of hospice
and palliative medicine.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:39.060
He is, I think, executive
vice president of the American

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.710
Association for Hospice
and Palliative Care.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:47.440
And at the time, he was a
real pioneer in the field.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.500
So I met him, and
I told him that we

00:11:52.500 --> 00:12:00.570
were planning to construct a
hospice in a place in India

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:05.380
where people
especially go to die,

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:11.470
because they consider it's
auspicious for their next life.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:16.550
And a colleague of
mine, who was a nurse,

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.720
mentioned that we
were going to try

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:25.070
to give the patients the
best of care physically,

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:30.150
and emotionally,
and spiritually.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.090
And she expressed her
opinion that in India, people

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:39.120
are a little shy about
dealing with the emotional.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:49.800
And the doctor, Porter
Storey, he replied,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.130
"Focus on the spiritual.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:13:00.020
The physical and mental or
emotional are just temporary."

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:05.260
And I was surprised
and impressed.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:11.960
This regular, Western-trained
medical doctor

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.250
had that realization.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:21.220
But that comes from dealing
with people who are dying.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:26.180
You can actually
perceive, in a subtle way,

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:34.930
how their atma is becoming
detached from the body.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:40.390
And they, themselves--
if they're fortunate--

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:44.355
can actually feel their
spiritual essence.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.040
Yeah.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.350
One colleague of mine-- when
he was approaching death,

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:59.870
he said that, all of our
life, we consider death

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.210
to be something to fear.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.140
But when you get
that close to death--

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.680
he had a degenerative disease
that just leads you inevitably

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:18.180
to death, ALS, or commonly
known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.210
He could feel it.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:26.450
He was just inevitably,
whatever, inch by inch

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.770
approaching that point.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.290
And he said that when you
get that close to death,

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:37.560
you realize that it's not
something to be feared.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.640
It's not something
horrible, but it's actually

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:51.910
a portal, an opening to your
true spiritual identity.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.420
And it's actually a
portal beckoning you

00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:05.790
beyond this world of matter
to new possibilities.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:12.340
And that it also helps you
realize your spiritual nature,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:19.620
which you can fulfill
without leaving your body,

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:24.430
without even coming close
to the point of death,

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:30.450
just by understanding
who you actually are,

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.770
and by being aware of
the fact that death

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.060
could come at any moment.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:46.150
In the "Bhagavad Gita,"
the speaker is Krishna.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:52.780
And he is giving
spiritual instruction.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.010
We call it a spiritual science.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:02.680
It's not a question
of any sectarian view.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.720
The word "Hindu" is nowhere
in the "Bhagavad "Gita."

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.730
It has nothing to do with being
Hindu, or Christian, or Muslim,

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:12.660
or Buddhist.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:18.890
But it's a spiritual science
that applies to everyone.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:23.890
And Arjuna was faced
with the possibility

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.750
of either killing his enemy--
it was on a battlefield--

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.030
or being killed.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:39.280
And Krishna explained
that there is no death.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.530
You cannot kill anyone.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:50.590
So by your warfare, to the
soul may leave the body.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:55.570
Or by their aggression
against you,

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.990
your soul might leave the body.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.640
But actually, there is no death.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.500
That soul-- that
atma, I should say--

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:09.859
that atma has no birth or death.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.540
And this is a very
important point.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:17.160
Not only is it really
us, and not only is it

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:24.060
distinct from matter, but
it has no birth or death.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.515
It has no beginning or end.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.040
It continues.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.190
And that is what everyone wants.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:42.110
They want life
that will continue.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:48.180
Whatever fear we have in this
world, and we all have fears.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:57.180
Fears of getting sick, fears
of losing our position,

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:06.670
fears of being
humiliated, so many fears.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:12.620
But whatever the fear is,
it pales in significance

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.660
compared to the fear of death.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:21.260
We take so many precautions
not to fall ill.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:28.300
But ultimately, what we
really don't want is to die.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:33.600
And that is a fear
that we all have.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.700
But when you realize-- and
that's what my friend said,

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.800
that when you realize
that you're not

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.640
the body, that
you're something else

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.040
and that you'll continue to
exist even after you leave

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.530
the body, then you're
freed from fear.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.260
Fear of death.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.280
If you've freed
from fear of death,

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.430
it means you're
freed from all fear.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.490
And that is a relief.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.100
Can you imagine what a
happy life that would be,

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.600
without fear?

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.720
It doesn't mean that we
don't take precaution.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.920
That's something else.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.720
As long as we're in
the material world,

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.460
we have to take precaution.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.230
But we know that
nothing can touch us.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.640
The great philosopher
Socrates, he

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:36.210
was attacked philosophically and
verbally, and even physically,

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.450
for his belief.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.690
And he would have used a
different word in his language,

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.480
but of the atma.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.320
And so the authorities
apprehended them,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:56.710
and they threatened
him with death.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:11.070
And then finally, they said, how
do you want to be dealt with?

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:16.820
And he said, "First of
all, you have to catch me.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.090
Then, you can deal with me."

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.310
In other words, they
were in possession

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:24.750
of his physical body,
but that wasn't him.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:30.420
And they couldn't
actually touch him.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:36.220
So knowing that we're the
atma, that we're not the body,

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.910
and that the atma
will continue to exist

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:45.840
after the demise of
the body, it is worth

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:53.702
considering where we go
after we leave that body.

00:20:53.702 --> 00:20:58.720
It's just like you're
living in an apartment,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.700
and the apartment is condemned.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.700
You know you're going
to have to leave it.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:12.020
So we don't want to spend
our last days or hours

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:16.460
in the apartment just trying
to enjoy the apartment,

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.020
like the people on
the "Titanic" partying

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.310
until the ship went down.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:27.600
But we want to think, OK, where
am I going to go from here?

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.290
And any sane person
would do that.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:35.440
If they know their
house is condemned.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.870
so the "Bhagavad Gita"
explains what possibilities

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:43.930
exist, as to where
we can go, what

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.590
different destinations exist.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.960
And it also tells us
the means by which

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:57.010
we can reach those
different destinations.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:04.080
And so that's really
our responsibility,

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:10.510
to consider where we want to go
and not just be sort of tossed

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:16.040
helplessly in the ocean
of material existence

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.180
by the waves of
material existence.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.940
But really consider, OK, yeah.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:26.810
I am going to have to leave
this apartment, this vehicle.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.590
Where do I want to go,
and how do I get there?

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.050
And in brief, the
"Bhagavad Gita"

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:43.820
explains that just
as on this planet,

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.410
there are many
relativities of places.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:57.660
Some places are more opulent,
and some are more meager.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.940
Some are more abundant.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.230
Some are more meager.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:07.250
You get different types
of bodies and minds.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:12.640
Some bodies, by
nature, are stronger.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.070
Some are weaker.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:22.050
Some intelligence is
greater, and some is lesser.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:26.280
And you can determine
what body you

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.260
get by your activities in life,
and especially your thoughts

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.110
at the time of death.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.250
The "Bhagavad Gita"
explains that whatever

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.480
you're thinking of
at the time of death,

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:47.320
that determines what state you
will attain in your next life.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:54.280
And so this is a
very critical moment.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.550
It's like the final exam.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:00.620
It's the final exam of
our life, because it

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.630
determines our future.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:10.430
In school, you
may go to classes,

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:17.040
do assignments, and
read, and do everything.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:24.170
But if you fail the
final, you don't graduate.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.930
You have to start
all over again.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.160
So life is also a teacher.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.400
It's a great teacher.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.380
We are meant to learn
important lessons from life.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:43.340
And what we have learned is
tested at the time of death.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:48.690
So if we think of
something eternal,

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:52.680
spiritual, and the "Bhagavad
Gita" gives details,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:59.550
then you will attain to an
eternal, spiritual situation.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:03.300
And if you think of
something material,

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.530
you'll attain to a
material situation.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.790
And there are varieties,
as I've mentioned.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:14.000
You can be materially more
fortunate or materially less

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.760
fortunate.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.250
But as long as you're
in the material world

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:23.080
from one point of view,
you're already unfortunate,

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.290
because you are
going to be suffering

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.290
in this whatever body you get.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:34.400
Whether it's a prince or a
pauper, you're going to suffer.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.210
Birth is painful.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:43.975
Disease, old age, and death
itself can be very painful.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:52.560
So we want to become free
from all of those miseries,

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.510
and that is possible.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:59.720
Now often, when people speak
about spiritual matters,

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:05.340
spiritual goals,
spiritual destinations,

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.220
it can sound impersonal.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:14.050
Like even within the
Vedic literature,

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:19.640
there's a nice example that
the atma is like a spark,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.540
and the jiva-atma
is like a fire.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.530
So when the spark
falls out of the fire,

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.520
it loses its fiery quality.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.120
It's just like a
cinder, a dead cinder.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.360
But that cinder, if it
goes back in the fire,

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.500
it's ignited again.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.585
It dances in the fire.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.750
Yes.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:00.220
But that spark-- this is
the point I want to make.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:08.370
That spark is a person, and
the fire is a big person.

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:15.560
Not persons like the
body, but the atma.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.870
In fact, that big spark has its
own name, which is param-atma.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.330
Now, we can understand
this logically, also.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:32.840
Because again, if we
analyze, personality

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:40.580
could be caused either by the
consciousness-- the atma--

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.840
or the body.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.730
Now, when the atma
leaves the body,

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.330
there's no more
personality in the body.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.560
We love people.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.690
We adore people.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:28:00.510
We hate people, thinking
of them as the body.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:06.010
But when the atma
leaves the body, we cry.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:10.070
I mean, if we love
the person, we cry.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.440
"Oh, my father is gone.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.600
My father is gone."

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.900
Well, why do you say
your father is gone?

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.960
He's right there
lying on the bed.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.020
"No, my father is gone.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.980
My father is gone."

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.410
Because the atma is gone.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.600
That's your real father.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:34.610
During his life, you might have
identified him as the body,

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.150
but when the atma
leaves the body,

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.140
you know that body is not him.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:49.500
So the person is the
atma, not the body.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.740
The eyes, the nose, the years,
the tongue-- all the parts

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:59.090
of the body are there,
but the person is gone.

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:06.480
So that atma is the
person, not the body.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:15.000
And so the param-atma,
the supreme person,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.340
is also a person.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:26.630
And according to the "Bhagavad
Gita," if that supreme person--

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:31.470
if you think of the param-atma
at the time of death, then

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.760
you go to the param-atma.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.130
And because you're
a person, jiva-atma,

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:47.265
and he is a person, param-atma,
so you have a relationship.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:57.085
You can have a relationship
when there's common factors.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.530
I mean, yet in
principle, we could

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:08.430
have a relationship
with an amoeba.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.250
But we don't share
that much in common,

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.380
so we can't have that
much of relationship.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.250
But we can have relationships
with human beings,

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.650
because we have more
in common with them.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.890
And if they speak
the same language,

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.980
the potential for a relationship
is even greater, and so many

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.050
things.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:38.700
So the atma, jiva-atma, has the
potential for a relationship

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:45.390
with the param-atma, because
they're both atmas, spiritual,

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.880
and persons.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.400
And they have a
natural relationship,

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:57.645
because the jiva-atma is like
a part of the param-atma.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:06.200
And we are satisfied in that
position in that relationship.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.856
Otherwise, we're not.

00:31:09.856 --> 00:31:13.160
We're not fully satisfied.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.080
And that Dr. Porter Storey,
who I mentioned earlier,

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:20.690
he said that's one of the
great gifts of dealing

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:24.870
with people who are dying.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:26.690
Because when they
say confront death,

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:32.930
they're not just interested
in accumulating more stuff.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:35.860
There's a common
saying, something like,

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:43.170
"the one who has the most toys
at the end of the day wins."

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:46.030
But it's not true.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.990
Of course, now-- I mean, this
is a little bit of an aside--

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:53.150
but now, there's
a lot of concern

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:56.780
about old people
losing their memories.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.390
This is another big--
the "Bhagavad Gita" says

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.400
we should be aware
of these miseries.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.330
"Janma-mrtyu-jara-vyadhi."
"Janma" means "birth," "mrytu"

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:18.000
"death," "jara," "old age,"
and "vyadhi," "disease."

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.600
According to statistics,
baby boomers--

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:27.600
they're more worried about
losing their faculties

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:33.430
than they are about
dying, because there's

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.882
so many of these diseases,
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, so

00:32:36.882 --> 00:32:39.270
many.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.260
You don't even know who you are.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.610
It's like, I don't need
to discuss in detail.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.910
So one author, sort
of making a play

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:56.580
on that saying that "whoever has
the most toys in the end wins,"

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:04.040
he said, "whoever has the most
marbles left in the end wins."

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:09.620
But actually, at the end, we
lose everything, all our toys,

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.200
all our marbles.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.350
We lose everything.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.590
But the one thing we don't
lose is our consciousness.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:24.490
And if we make that effort
to realize our relationship

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:28.250
with the param-atma,
then that exists.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.275
And that's, in a way,
all that matters.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.280
And that can be realized
even within this very life,

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.630
and in this body.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:50.770
And that process of linking
or reuniting ourselves,

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.750
the jiva-atma with
the param-atma,

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:57.400
is called bhakti yoga.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:03.506
"Bhakti" means-- you could
say "selfless service"

00:34:03.506 --> 00:34:05.870
or "devotional service."

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:11.540
And "yoga" means "to
link or connect."

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:16.840
Like we say to yoke oxen,
that English word "yoke"

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.210
comes from "yoga."

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:30.150
So "bhakti yoga" means to be
connected or united, reunited

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:33.490
with the param-atma or Krishna.

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:43.310
Krishna is a name
for the param-atma.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:47.350
But generally, the param-atma,
when we refer to param-atma,

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:51.070
means "within the heart."

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:55.580
The jiva-atma and the param-atma
are both within the area

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.980
of the heart when
they are in the body.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.980
And Krishna, he's outside.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:11.510
And he has his own spiritual
realm that we can enter,

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:16.380
if we think of him
at the time of death.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:22.710
And so life is like
our preparation

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:27.640
for that final exam.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:37.090
And if we determine that we
want to have a life eternal,

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:40.250
means no beginning
and no and, full

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:47.490
of knowledge and full of bliss,
then that can be achieved.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:56.660
Not in this world of flux,
temporary world of matter,

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:04.960
but in the spiritual
realm with Krishna.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.780
The "Bhagavad Gita"
uses the name Krishna.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:20.010
And the beauty is that
this process makes

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:27.670
us happy in this life, and
it leads to more happiness

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:29.720
after we leave the body.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:38.090
So I've just given a
little summary here.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:43.700
And I'd now like
to hear from you,

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:48.140
if you have any questions
or any points you'd

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.760
like me to elaborate on.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:37:01.380
In a restaurant, the waiter
comes and takes your order

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.630
first, but I sort of did it
the other way around here.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.100
Well, let's say I gave
you the appetizers,

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:14.130
and now, you can
place your order,

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:17.180
if you want to hear more
about any particular topic

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:20.450
or ask any questions.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.880
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your talk.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:27.780
One question is, you said that
a human person has a soul.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:32.090
But do you believe animals--
do they have souls?

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:36.560
GIRIRAJ SWAMI: Yes, that
is a very good question.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.270
So yes, animals do have a soul.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:44.700
And coming back to
the original point,

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:49.500
that consciousness is due
to the presence of the soul.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.320
The "Bhagavad Gita"
gives the example that

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:58.650
just like the sky is
permeated by sunlight which

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:03.300
is coming from the sun
globe, so similarly, the body

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:08.580
is permeated by consciousness,
which is coming from the atma.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:15.640
And when the atma
leaves the body--

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:20.590
I've described the ideal, that
it goes to the spiritual realm.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:25.070
But if it doesn't, it
will enter another body.

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.520
And again, depending on
how we've lived our lives

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.090
and what we've thought
of at the time of death,

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:37.540
it might be the body of
an animal or a plant.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.860
And we know that
the atma's there,

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.050
because they're conscious.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.470
There have been studies
that show, even plants,

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:50.450
they have consciousness.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:52.670
They respond to pain.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:57.010
They respond to good music.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.810
So yes.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:04.060
So we should be careful
with any living creature,

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.320
because within that
creature is an atma.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.510
Just like we're atmas,
they are also atmas,

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:11.520
but they're in
that kind of body.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.780
AUDIENCE: I've heard that
certain sects of Buddhism

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.430
believe in reincarnation,
and they also

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:17.370
believe that women
come below men

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.440
in that reincarnative scale.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.740
Does the "Bhagavad
Gita" also believe

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.227
that if you don't live
your life the right way,

00:39:24.227 --> 00:39:26.060
you might come back as
a woman, in the sense

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.724
that all women
are less than men?

00:39:27.724 --> 00:39:29.140
GIRIRAJ SWAMI: The
"Bhagavad Gita"

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.330
says if you don't live
your life in the right way,

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:37.210
you'll come back, period.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:43.370
So we don't want to come back as
a woman or a man, or anything.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.440
We don't want to come back.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:52.110
It's like saying, if
you fail your final exam

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.200
and have to repeat
the course, is it

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.990
better to do this or that?

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:57.692
Well, no.

00:39:57.692 --> 00:39:58.900
We're not thinking like that.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.230
We're thinking, how do we pass
the final exam and graduate?

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.320
AUDIENCE: Can you speak
to your personal journey,

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.820
like what got you
interested in this?

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:13.180
And why did you decide to write
a book on a topic like that?

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.485
GIRIRAJ SWAMI: Hmmm.

00:40:14.485 --> 00:40:19.070
[CHUCKLES] That's
a good question.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:26.120
Well, as Jay explained in his
introduction, in the '60s,

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.780
I was a spiritual seeker.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:34.530
And fortunately, the
person who I accepted

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:39.230
as my teacher-- and I met
many, really, before I met him,

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:43.520
but I wasn't satisfied
with any of them.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.580
And I think part of
it was because he

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:51.200
said that we are persons.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:56.190
And the Supreme is
a person, and we

00:40:56.190 --> 00:41:00.030
can have a personal
relationship with him.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:04.410
Almost all the others, whether
from the Buddhist tradition

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:08.910
or Hindu tradition, they were
all on the impersonal side.

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:14.000
That the goal is you just
give up your individuality

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.010
and merge, and become
one with the spirit,

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:22.620
or disappear into the void.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:28.570
And he taught something
very different,

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:33.190
that you're a person, and
the Supreme is a person,

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:36.848
and you can have a
relationship with him.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:48.470
And that relationship develops
from the moment you understand

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:53.010
who you are, understand the
jiva-atma and the param-atma,

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:56.640
and the relationship
between them.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:04.700
But there's also a method for
developing that relationship,

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:13.140
and that is to purify
our consciousness.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.710
In other words,
this consciousness

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:17.840
is not something foreign.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.880
It's not like we're trying to
impose something artificial,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:27.320
or that the tradition is trying,
but it's something natural.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:33.840
It's like iron is naturally
attracted to a magnet.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.340
But if it's covered by
rust, it won't be attracted.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:43.050
But if you remove the rust, then
it will naturally be attracted.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:47.810
So the jiva-atma's naturally
attracted to the param-atma.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:49.650
But we're covered with rust.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:57.340
Our minds are covered with
so many misconceptions,

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:02.520
like "I'm the body, and this is
my husband." "This is my wife."

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:09.476
"This is my car." "This is
my investment portfolio."

00:43:09.476 --> 00:43:15.080
But we are not any
of those things.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.200
But even though we may
know that in theory,

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.450
we still may be attached
to those things.

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:24.320
So we really need to
transfer our attachment.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:30.180
And this is a very important
point about the time of death,

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.570
that whatever we
are most attached to

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:38.360
is what we will think of.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:45.270
A friend of mine told a story
that he was driving a car,

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:47.235
and it stalled on
the railway tracks.

00:43:50.432 --> 00:43:51.390
And you know how it is.

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:56.680
He was fiddling with it,
trying to get it to go.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.030
And then, he looked
up, and he saw

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:02.540
the train was just
bearing down on him.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:03.800
He thought, this is it.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.390
It's all over.

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:13.490
And the train hit,
and he was chanting.

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:15.820
I didn't mention
that, but that's

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:23.930
the best process for cleansing,
is a repetition of mantra.

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:27.150
So he started chanting.

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:34.890
And at the last moment, he
thought, what will my wife do?

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:38.000
And then, the train hit, and
he lost his consciousness.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Of course, he lived to tell
the story, fortunately.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.110
So we really have
to become attached

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.120
to the param-atma,
which is natural.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:59.530
But that'll be done by a
process of removing that rust.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:07.260
And that process is
chanting of the mantra.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.590
And the Vedas
recommend specific--

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:13.930
but there are so many, and
even in other traditions.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:18.460
I used to spend
time in Pakistan.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:24.410
And I came across a book there
called "The 99 Names of Allah."

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:30.460
And that book mentioned that the
best thing a pious Muslim can

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:35.870
do at the time of death is to
be chanting the name of Allah.

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:40.590
And the best thing his family
members and loved ones can do

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:42.940
is be chanting
the name of Allah.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:47.000
So if he can't actually chant,
he can at least hear it.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.670
And the same thing is there
in the Hindu tradition.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:54.890
Instead of, say,
"99 Names of Allah,"

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:59.980
they have "Vishnu sahasranama,"
"1,000 Names of Vishnu."

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:04.750
it's the same idea, to chant
the name at the time of death,

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:09.180
or to be surrounded
by people chanting.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.970
But even then, the mind
is very flickering.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.345
So we really want to
just be so attached.

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:20.790
Sometimes there are
stories of mothers.

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:24.070
Their child is hit by
a car or something.

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:28.700
And they're just imbued
with superhuman strength.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.800
They can lift up the
car, the back of the car,

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.030
to get the child out.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.905
Because of that
attachment, which is good,

00:46:36.905 --> 00:46:38.780
a mother's attachment.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:45.410
So if we have that attachment
for the param-atma,

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:52.820
then-- the "Bhagavad Gita"
gives another example

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.155
that the body is like dress.

00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:00.230
If your mind is
fixed on something,

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:01.810
you might be changing
your clothes.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:03.820
You hardly are not
even conscious of it.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.030
You're just, OK.

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:09.440
So that's the real
perfection, when

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.445
we're so attached
to the param-atma

00:47:12.445 --> 00:47:14.770
that the change of
body is like, we've

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:17.040
fixed on the param-atma
in this body,

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.290
and we'll stay fixed
on the param-atma.

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:24.020
That's really the perfection.

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:25.890
AUDIENCE: So as
a word of comfort

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:28.890
when you lose a
loved one, can you

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:33.500
think your memories of them--
in fact, part of their soul

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.710
is now part of your soul?

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.710
GIRIRAJ SWAMI: That's
also a very important part

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:39.896
of this process.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:49.000
Yes, our own final
exam is important,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.710
but dealing with the loss of
loved ones is also important,

00:47:54.710 --> 00:48:02.400
and also helping people who are
grieving for a lost loved one.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:18.830
We can certainly remember
the person who's left us.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:23.810
And if we understand
that the atma is eternal,

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:27.270
we'll know that
that person is still

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:34.900
alive in some other form
and some other place.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:43.530
And it is a fact that when
the atma leaves the body,

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:48.215
it has powers that
were not manifest

00:48:48.215 --> 00:48:49.215
when it was in the body.

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.760
A colleague of mine
mentioned that he

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:02.930
had a friend who was a
real-- I say "agnostic"

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:04.800
just to be polite.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.390
He was really an atheist.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:10.185
But I shouldn't even say
that, because it's not

00:49:10.185 --> 00:49:11.560
that one's better
than the other.

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:16.340
But he was a real skeptic.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:26.290
And when his wife left
her body, she visited him.

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:30.460
And here, this is someone who
had no belief in any of this.

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.890
He though it was all just
in the mind, all just

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:35.920
wishful thinking.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:41.185
And then, he got
back to my colleague

00:49:41.185 --> 00:49:43.600
and told him what happened.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.600
And he said, you
know, I may have

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.940
to conceded that some of the
things that you've been telling

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:54.830
me, which I've been rejecting,
may actually be true.

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:03.520
But if you believe
in prayer, one thing

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:07.520
that you can do that could
only help your loved one,

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.510
departed loved one, is
pray for that person.

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:22.370
Again, prayer is something that
can be met with skepticism.

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:28.530
But there have been real,
controlled experiments

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:30.570
with patients.

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:35.325
And none of the patients
knew whether they

00:50:35.325 --> 00:50:37.600
were being prayed for or not.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:44.060
It was a double-blind
experiment.

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:48.690
And the patients that
were being prayed for,

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:53.780
they really did much
better than the patients

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.510
who weren't being prayed for,
although they had no idea

00:50:56.510 --> 00:51:00.430
that they were being prayed for.

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:05.570
And so much so, that
the beneficial effects

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:10.620
of the prayer was greater
than the beneficial effects

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:13.020
of most of the
medications that had

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:16.110
been tested in
similar experiments.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:23.120
But anyway, that's up to you.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.240
But certainly, whoever
that loved one is

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:35.170
is alive somewhere
in some situation.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:45.150
And if that person goes
to the spiritual realm

00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:55.040
immediately, or maybe after
another time in the class,

00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.840
and you also go there, and
you'll really be reunited.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.290
It's not a fantasy or
just wishful thinking.

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:11.030
And some people, as
they approach death,

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:18.750
it's said that that line
between this world in the next,

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.330
it becomes sort of permeable.

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:25.840
And things from
beyond the border

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.970
sort of come into
their consciousness,

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.950
and they can have
amazing revelations.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:35.220
And there have
been so many books

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:38.610
now about out-of-body
experiences

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:40.500
and near-death experiences.

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:47.142
And so it's possible.

00:52:47.142 --> 00:52:48.600
JAY: Once again,
we'd like to thank

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.830
Giriraj Swami for this
wonderful lecture.

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:52.980
