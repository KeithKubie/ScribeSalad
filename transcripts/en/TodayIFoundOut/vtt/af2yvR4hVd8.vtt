00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
The Moneky Artist Hoax

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:18.830
In 1964, a 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.900
new avant-garde artist was introduced to the
art scene in the Swedish city of Gōteborg.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.300
The fresh new artist was Pierre Brassau and
his work received rave reviews from critics

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.560
and art fans alike.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.040
Brassau featured four paintings in the 1964
exhibition at Gallerie Christinae, and even

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.480
sold one “masterpiece” to a collector
named Bertil Eklöt for $90 (about $650 today).

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.160
The exhibition featured paintings from artists
across Europe, but it was the hot new French

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.969
Artist who stole the show.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.699
One critic in particular, Rolf Anderberg,
was so overwhelmed by Pierre’s talent that

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.850
he wrote the following review about his work,
which appeared in print the morning following

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.980
the exhibition:

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.750
Brassau paints with powerful strokes, but
also with clear determination. His brush strokes

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.880
twist with furious fastidiousness. Pierre
is an artist who performs with the delicacy

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.580
of a ballet dancer.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.759
The reviews were glowing. All but one. One
critic’s review was short and to the point:

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.430
“Only an ape could have done this.”

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.540
The opinion was unpopular among the other
critics, despite that the pieces of art looking

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.570
strikingly similar to “art” you commonly
see stuck to refrigerators, produced by 2

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.729
year olds the world over. It turns out, though,
that the “ape” review more or less hit

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.280
the nail on the head.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.869
Pierre Brassau was actually none other than
a young West African chimpanzee named Peter

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.360
who lived in the Borås djurpark zoo in Sweden.
The mastermind behind the hoax was journalist

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.130
Åke “Dacke” Axelsson. Axelsson worked
for the Swedish tabloid Gotebors-Tidningen

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.630
and came up with the idea of featuring the
primate paintings in an exhibition in order

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.380
to put the critics to the test. Could they
recognize the work of true avant-garde modern

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.530
artists?

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.850
Axelsson convinced Peter’s teenage caretaker
to let the chimpanzee play with some oil paints

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.209
and a brush. Initially, Peter ate more paint
than he managed to get onto the canvasses;

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.550
his favorite “flavor” was cobalt blue,
a color which featured prominently in his

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.900
later work. With some encouragement, Peter
soon began to develop his artistic skills.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.360
Once he finished showing off his artistic
talents, producing several paintings, Axelsson

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.599
chose the four which he considered the most
worthy to be displayed, and set about getting

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.040
them included in the exhibition at the Gallerie
Christinae.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.190
Once the hoax was revealed, the critic who
had previously compared Pierre Brassau with

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.250
a ballet dancer, Rolf Anderberg, doggedly
stuck by his assessment and stated that Pierre’s

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.450
work “was still the best painting in the
exhibition”.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.280
Peter isn’t the only primate to have found
success as an artist. In 2005, the director

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.400
of the State Art Museum of Moritzburg in Saxony-Anhalt,
Dr Kajta Schneider, mistakenly identified

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.239
a painting as the work of Ernst Wilhelm Nay,
a Guggenheim Prize winning artist. In fact,

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.140
the painting was done by Banghi who was a
chimpanzee living at Halle Zoo.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.751
In 2011, Pockets Warhol, a capuchin monkey
currently living in a sanctuary in Toronto,

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:05.751
had his own art exhibition featuring 40 of
his abstract paintings. His paintings have

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:06.751
been purchased by people across the globe
and sell for as much as $300 each. Proceeds

00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:07.751
from the sale of his artwork go to helping
care for the other residents of the animal

00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:08.751
sanctuary where he lives.

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:09.751
In 2010, Jimmy, a 27 year old chimpanzee living
in Rio De Janeiro, earned national acclaim

00:03:09.751 --> 00:03:13.390
for his artistic talents. When Jimmy’s caretakers
realized that he had become depressed, they

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.810
decided to give him some paints to brighten
up his days. Jimmy showed an instant aptitude

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.830
for art and has since become a household name
across Brazil. He even has an art instructor

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.860
who visits him 3 times a week.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.590
In 2009, 3 paintings by Congo the chimpanzee
sold at auction for more than $25,000. Congo

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.730
was born in 1954 and produced around 400 paintings
during his life. He died at age 10 of tuberculosis.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.209
Pablo Picasso is reported to have been a fan
of Congo’s work, and in fact owned one of

00:03:43.209 --> 00:04:03.170
Congo’s paintings, which hung on his studio
wall.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.170
Bonus Facts:

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.170
Pablo Picasso’s actually name was a tad
longer than you might expect. Specifically,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.170
it was Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula
Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.170
de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.189
The most expensive piece of art sold to date
is one of the versions of The Card Players,

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:15.150
by Paul Cézanne, which sold for somewhere
between $250-$320 million to the Royal Family

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.250
of Qatar, who apparently have too much money
on their hands. Qatar is on the Arabian Peninsula

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.090
and has a population of just 2 million people
and only about 250,000 citizens, yet a gross

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.820
domestic product of about $182 billion, giving
it the highest per capita gross domestic product

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.860
of any country in the world. If you guessed
that their little country has a lot of oil,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.400
you’d be right. They also have rich supplies
of natural gas. Not only is it one of the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.750
wealthiest countries in the world per capita,
but it also has one of the lowest tax rates,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.780
including having no income tax.
