00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:22.680
PROFESSOR: OK, OK.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.520
Let's get started.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.160
Going to go right
into the lesson.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.020
Last day we started looking
at kinetics, which was the

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.300
description of rate and

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.550
mechanism of chemical reactions.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.640
We looked at the general rate
law, which shows us that the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.570
instant change in concentration
of species i

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.740
goes as the instant
concentration.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.550
So rate is proportional
to concentration.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.360
And the order of reaction
is shown here as n and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.710
proportionality constant
is the rate constant k.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.150
So we saw that we can make the
rate of reaction increase by

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.720
increasing the concentration
in the reactor.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.940
We saw there was a second way
to increase the rate of

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.390
reaction, and that was to
raise the temperature.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.800
And this is the Arrhenius
relationship that shows that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.350
the rate constant changes with
temperature according to this

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.020
exponential relationship.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.500
In the denominator, we have the
product of the Boltzmann

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.370
constant and the absolute
temperature, which is a

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.840
measure of the ambient thermal
energy that's available to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.250
promote reaction.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.940
And in the numerator we have a
barrier energy, which we call

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.810
the activation energy.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.130
We'll say a little bit more
about that today.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.080
And the constant of
proportionality out here is A,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.800
which is in honor of Arrhenius,
who first

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.970
annunciated the law.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.210
So what I want to do today is to
look at some common orders

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.685
of reactions.

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:52.110
So we're going to look at
the values of n that are

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.990
encountered in not

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.000
insignificant number of reactions.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.680
So let's start with
the simplest one.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.850
The simplest one
is first order.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.100
First order reactions.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.570
That means n equals 1 in this
rate law expression.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.840
And here's an example of
something that we could use.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.230
The decomposition of
N2O5 into NO2.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.970
And gives us half a
mole of oxygen.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.400
And we can write this rate law
in terms of the rate of

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.650
disappearance of N2O5.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.040
So I can write minus
d by dt of--

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.680
I'm going to use square brackets
to indicate the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.592
concentration--

00:02:44.592 --> 00:02:47.030
of N2O5.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.830
And this has been measured.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.450
You can't predict this from the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.520
stoichiometry of the equation.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.410
You have to measure this, and
on the basis of measurements

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.780
it's found that the rate of
change of N2O5 goes as the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.840
concentration of N2O5.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.860
And there's a constant
out here.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.900
The rate constant.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.390
So just to make the point, I'm
going to put a 1 here.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.150
Meaning that n equals 1 and
that's why this is a

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.710
first-order reaction.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.680
But this is messy.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.950
There's too many characters
here.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.270
So I'm going to compress this
and give myself a nicer font,

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:29.110
so I'm going to let the
concentration of N2O5, just in

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.850
this expression, just be c.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.700
Lowercase c.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.680
That way I can speed
this thing up.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.490
So I can rewrite this expression
here as minus dc by

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.850
dt equals k times c.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.540
All right.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.790
And so we know what this
is going to look like.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.980
They all look like this.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.630
If we plot concentration versus
temperature we expect

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.540
to have the maximum value
of this at time zero.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.420
So at time zero I
start off with--

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.120
if you want c-star or c max--

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.900
and you know, this
thing attenuates.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.350
But I can't look at that and
decide whether it's first

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.050
order or not.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.730
The only thing the eye
can really tell

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.350
is a straight line.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.910
So what I want to do is I want
to modify this thing.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.500
I want to map c into
some f of c.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.590
And I want to map t
into some g of t.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.490
So that if I plot f versus
g, I get a straight line.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.790
And then I can take one look at
that and go, bingo, this is

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.690
first order.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.440
Or not.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.880
Or maybe it's first order and
the data are very noisy.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.730
So what we'll do is
we're going to

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.190
integrate that equation.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.760
So I'm going to play with
this a little bit.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.340
So I'm going to transpose.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.630
I'll get minus dc over
c equals kdt.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.830
And then I can integrate this
because I know at time 0, t

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.550
equals 0, c equals
some value--

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.450
I can call it c-star
or c naught--

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.360
and at any arbitrary time later,
I can go down that

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.180
curve and put some value of time
and then I'll end up with

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.300
some arbitrary value
of concentration c.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.340
And I know there's some math
people in the audience who are

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.500
probably horrified that the
limits and the integrand are

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.540
both the same.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.370
So I'll put a little tilde
here that way I

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.790
don't go to math jail.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.820
So now I'm not integrating c.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.460
If I wanted to be a pedant and
really make the math instead

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.080
of me enslaving the math, the
math enslaving me, watch this.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.590
What I could do is I
could make this a

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.480
carrier variable, s.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.180
You know what I'm talking
about now, right?

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.700
But let's get really crazy.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.520
This is how bad the
math can get.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.070
You can do this in
a chemistry book.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.120
Let's use some Greek.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.080
So I'll make this
d xi over xi.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.430
Now I've totally left the
class behind, but it's

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.636
mathematically correct.

00:05:55.636 --> 00:05:58.170
What we will do is we'll
put the t back and put

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.550
a tilde over it.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.950
And now everybody is happy, and
heaven forbid, the student

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.140
might even understand
the lesson.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.470
All right.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.120
So we do that and
what do we get?

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.910
The integral of dc over c
is a natural log of c.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.810
This'll be natural log of c
equals natural log of c

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.310
naught minus kt.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.870
OK, so integrating this thing
gives us this expression.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:31.870
And that means if I plot the
natural log of c versus time I

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.910
should get a straight line.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.750
And furthermore, the slope
is equal to minus k.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.770
So here's an example that's
taken from your book.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.740
It happens to be another
first-order reaction and it

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.850
shows the decomposition
of cisplatin.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.600
This is a compound that's used
in certain cancer treatments.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.040
And you can cisplatin hydrolyzes
to form this

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.540
monster cation plus
a chloride.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.160
And it turns out that the rate
of decomposition of cisplatin

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.030
is first order.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.530
Will you look at that curve?

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.590
That purple line?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.635
I don't know what that means.

00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:05.790
But watch.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.040
If I instead plot the natural
logarithm of the concentration

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.970
of cisplatin as a function of
time, you get a nice straight

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.120
line, and furthermore,
the value of k is

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.210
obvious from the slope.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.490
So this is an indication of the
power of taking the proper

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.000
order of reaction and
then using it in--

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.290
if you'll pardon the pun--
straightening things out.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.920
And a couple other things
worth noting.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.830
I mentioned at the end of last
day, radioactive decay.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.440
Even though radioactive decay
is not a chemical reaction--

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.750
it has to do with nuclear
phenomena-- and we know

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.910
chemistry is restricted to
the life and times of the

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.080
electron, we don't go
into the nucleus.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.310
We simply know there's something
in there, there's

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.150
neutrons, protons, and a whole
bunch of other particles.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.300
But chemistry is about
the life and

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.200
times of the electron.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.590
Radioactive decay turns
out to be first order.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.370
It's good to know that
because then you can

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.620
appreciate what goes on.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.040
So for example, you could
take something like the

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.220
decomposition of uranium-238.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.260
One of its decompositions
gives you

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.740
thorium-234 plus helium.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.140
And it turns out that this is
first order, which means that

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.380
if you were to take a plot
of the natural log of the

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.280
concentration of uranium
versus time, you get a

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.220
straight line.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.030
And this slope would be the
k, the rate constant.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.980
But it turns out that the
nuclear chemists, nuclear

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:46.040
engineers, prefer not to talk
about the rate of reaction in

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.850
terms of k.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.710
But instead, they like to
use the inverse of k,

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.640
which is the half-life.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:09:01.160
So instead, express k
through half-life.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.410
And the half-life, as the name
implies, is the time it takes

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.170
to decrease the concentration
of the species by half.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:14.080
So if I start off here at c1 and
down here I have c2 equals

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.780
1/2 c1, then this is the time
it takes to cut the

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.160
concentration in half.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.410
So through half-life--

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:29.040
and we can go through this
equation here, just put c

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.650
naught over 2 and do a little
bit of manipulation, you'll

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.670
end up with the natural log
of 2 divided by the rate

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:43.140
constant, which is 0.693
divided by k.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.910
So you can see that there's
a direct relationship.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.650
It turns out that the half-life
for this reaction is

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.960
4 1/2 billion years.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.130
4 1/2 billion years.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.090
So that means after 4 1/2
billion years the

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.400
concentration has gone down to
a half, but even then it's

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.420
probably not safe for the
kids to go out and play.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.690
So you really need to think
about it in this way.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.750
So here it is shown
in your textbook.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.220
Concentration as a
function of time.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.120
They could have plotted it log
linear, then you would have

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.250
ended up with this.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.560
But anyways, they're chemists,
so what can you expect.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.190
So here it is.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.860
Here it goes down to a half, and
then this is a half of a

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.750
half as a quarter.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.460
It's the same time interval.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.710
And then half of a quarter is
an eighth, and it's the same

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.810
time interval.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.650
So you get the sense.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.630
And the most important thing
is the half-life is

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.830
independent of concentration.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.070
It doesn't matter what the
starting concentration is-- if

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.150
you know what the half-life is,
you know how much time it

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.400
takes to get to a half.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.450
And you know enough math.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.560
What if I said, well, what if I
didn't want to go to a half?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.680
What if I wanted to go to 10%?

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.380
Well, you can figure out how
to modulate half-life into

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.310
tenth-life.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.150
That's trivial.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.280
But the book, being a chemistry
book, will show you

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.180
a table in which they give
half-life values for orders of

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.930
reactions other than 1.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.790
And it's stupid because except
in the case of first order

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.960
reactions, the value the
half-life is a function of the

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.350
concentration.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.480
So what good is a constant
that's variable?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.010
I don't know, but I didn't
write the book.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.080
The only time I care about
half-life is in the case of a

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.620
first order reaction, which
is when you have

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.970
nuclear decay for sure.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:24.360
All right.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.710
So that's enough about
first order.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.790
Let's go look at second-order
reactions.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.440
So here's an example also
taken from the book.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:40.990
So second-order reaction, which
means that n equals 2 in

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.670
the rate law expression.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.240
n equals 2 in the rate
law expression.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.460
And the example that
they gave was NO2.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:49.870
See, look.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.150
We went from N2O5 to NO2.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.600
And then we can keep the
decomposition going.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:03.100
NO2 goes to NO plus O2.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.070
And again, I'm going to let, in
this case, c will equal the

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.450
concentration of NO2.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.120
And what you end up with in
this case is, if you go

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.610
through the similar analysis,
you get minus dc by dt.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.730
It's been measured that the rate
of loss of NO2 goes as

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.040
the square of its
concentration.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.350
So this is based on experimental
evidence.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.590
It's not because this is a 2.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.250
This is not.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.930
Please pay attention here.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.110
This 2 is not the consequences
of the stoichiometry.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.010
This 2 was determined
experimentally.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.950
I could have just written
this reaction NO2 goes

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.305
to NO plus 1/2 O2.

00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:46.380
That doesn't make this
first order, does it?

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.300
Experimentally in
the laboratory.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:51.580
All right.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.860
So now what we can do is we
can integrate this thing.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.156
And so we'll get minus the--

00:12:57.156 --> 00:12:59.460
let's do it this way.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.600
Boards are cheap, so let's jump
down to the next one.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:09.080
So now I can then put minus
the integral of dc tilde--

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.080
cross multiply--

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:17.050
so dc tilde over c tilde
squared equals k,

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.230
the integral dt tilde.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.340
And we can integrate this from
zero to some time, and this

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.750
will go from c naught to
some concentration.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.960
And that will give us 1
over c equals 1 over

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.150
c naught plus kt.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:36.370
So this is now the new, improved
way of mapping c

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.730
versus t into f of
c versus g of t.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:45.050
So f of c as 1 over c, which
means now if I plot 1 over c

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.110
versus time, I'll get
a straight line.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.325
In this case, it's got
positive slope.

00:13:49.325 --> 00:13:51.360
It's got positive slope,
so that's what it's

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.320
going to look like.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.180
And this is k.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.010
So if I take our data set and
I plot it like this, then I

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.280
can make sense of it.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.670
And I think we've got
some data here.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:07.060
So here's the data from
this decomposition.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.360
And again, what do you see?

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.650
A line that attenuates.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:10.990
Can you look at that line?

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.900
Can you tell that line is second
order, whereas the

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.960
other one that looks like
this was first order?

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.850
Of course not.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.710
The only way you can tell
his to fit it into some

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.280
linearizing function.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.610
So look at that.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.780
What they've done, that's
the least squares fit.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.770
They plugged it into a least
squares fitting equation.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.190
You can fit a straight line
through anything.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.150
It doesn't matter.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.130
But what's that mean?

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.130
I don't know.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.910
So here's the log.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.080
This is really important--

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.040
look carefully.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.590
So somebody took these data and
then plotted them as the

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.880
natural log, which is what you
do if it's first order.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.950
And look at what happens--

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.760
it gets a lot better but it's
still not a straight line.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.830
But if you were in a hurry,
you'd just say, force the fit.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.290
You'll get a straight line and
you'll assigned the value of k

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.220
to it and party on.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.640
And it's wrong.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.980
So now let's try this.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:03.890
Beta.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.770
1 over c versus time.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:06.920
So what do we get from that?

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.660
I get two things.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.360
First of all, the fact that
it's a straight line means

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.520
that it confirms n equals 2 and
the slope of that line is

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.640
the value of k.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.710
So in point of fact, what I've
been doing here is teaching

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.110
you how to determine the
rate of reaction.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.130
So let's do it.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.730
Let's codify this.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:33.120
So determination of
order of reaction.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.120
So in other words, the way the
story goes is I give you a

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.420
data set that looks
like this--

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:41.770
pardon me.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.890
I give you a data set that looks
like this and I say,

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.580
determine the order
of reaction.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.680
So there's two general
ways to do this.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.740
The first one is called
the integral method.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.100
And that's what we've been
doing up until now.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.590
The integral method, it's called
the integral method

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.370
because it's using the
integrated form

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.230
of the radio question.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.130
See?

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.400
This is the integrative form.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.490
This is the integrative form.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:10.440
Hence, the integral method,
and it's trial and error.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.110
That's what we did.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.740
Trial and error.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.580
But we don't say trial and error
because we're at MIT.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.380
So what do we say?

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.210
We have a lofty way.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.540
What's the lofty way of saying
trial and error?

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.340
By inspection.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.510
By inspection.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.770
Never tell anybody you do things
by trial and error.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:27.670
We don't do trial and error.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.646
By inspection.

00:16:29.646 --> 00:16:31.560
It's $50,000 a year.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.880
It's what you get.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.410
OK, so here's what I do.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.300
I'm impatient, so I
try n equals 1.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.510
If I get a straight line
on the log plot, good.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.440
If not, I try n equals 2.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.870
If I got a straight line
on 1 over c, good.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:51.310
If not, go to the second
way of determining.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:51.970
I give up.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.170
Won't waste my time.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.930
It's a two strikes and
you're out thing.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.020
So what's the second method?

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:04.570
The second method is called
the differential method.

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:05.820
The differential method.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.700
And this is fun because it's
data fitting and it gets into

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.380
some nice detail.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.410
So what I want to do is
to define the rate.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.040
What's the rate?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.100
The rate is over here.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.070
Minus dc by dt, right?

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:27.870
You see up in the top left
corner the rate law.

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:32.030
Minus dc by dt.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.740
I'm going to call
that positive r.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.510
I'm just compress-- this
is like French cooking.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.640
I started with this.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.580
Look at all those fonts.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.900
Then I compressed it down
to c, and now I

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.550
compressed it even more.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.030
It's just so much information
compressed in

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.070
that little r there.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.060
Poor little r.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.360
All right.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.110
So now, let's rewrite the
rate law expression.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:56.120
So that's r equals
kc to the n.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.310
There's the rate law expression

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.390
written very compact.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.370
And now I'm going to take the
logarithm of both sides.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.660
So taking the log of both sides,
I can write natural log

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.370
of r, the log of a product
is the sum of the log.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.130
So that's going to be natural
log of k plus the

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.570
log of, da, da, da.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.160
n log c.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:17.870
n log c.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.180
And I don't care what kind
of logarithms you use.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.960
You can make this log base c.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.380
You can make it log base 10.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.720
If you're feeling like you
want solidarity with the

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.860
Mayans, you can make
it log base 5.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.630
I don't care.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.450
But make them the same.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.290
Make them the same.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.840
And then what happens?

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.980
Well, let me show you.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.960
So let's say we've got our data,
start off with this data

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.100
set like so.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.210
So this is concentration
versus time and

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.340
we end up with this.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.710
It comes down, down,
down, attenuates.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.360
Remember, what are we
trying to do here?

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.310
We're trying to take this data
set and figure out, what is

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.520
the value of n?

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.470
We're trying to determine n.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:03.090
So what this thing says is.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:10.230
if I make a plot of r versus c
so that it's on a log scale,

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:15.370
so if I plot log r versus log c,
the slope is going to be n.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.210
So how do I take c versus
t and construct log

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.800
r verses log c?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.870
That's what we're going to do.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:26.920
So here we are and I can start
here that at time zero.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.870
This is time zero.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.320
That's the slope, right?

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.070
The slope here is the rate.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:37.260
So slope, I'm going to
call it r naught.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.350
Because that's the time--

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:46.430
it's dc by dt r naught
at t equals t naught.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:48.320
But there's no t on here.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.570
So what am I going to put?

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:54.860
It's when t equals t naught
and c equals c naught.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.225
So now I'm going to take some
colored chalk and we're going

00:19:59.225 --> 00:20:00.430
to show you how to
construct this.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:05.170
So I've got the slope by taking
minus dc by dt here.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.240
So I'm going to take this value,
r naught, and this

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.150
value, c naught--

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.790
I want to gang them together,
I'll bring over here and put

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:18.030
them right out here-- so
now I've got r naught.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.130
Well, actually I should put the
abscissa first. So this is

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:26.410
going to be c naught r naught.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:27.380
And now let's do it again.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.780
So we'll come down here
to some later time.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.520
Let's call this t1.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.320
And at t1 the concentration has
fallen to c1, and I take

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.170
the slope of this.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.200
Why am I taking the slope?

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.850
Because it's dc by dt.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.220
That's what the rate is.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:48.580
So here now I've got slope
r1 at c equals c1.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.460
r versus c.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.500
Forget time.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.380
Time doesn't belong here.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.870
So take those.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.630
It's a lower concentration,
so it's kind of

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.500
like a lower energy.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.950
So we'll take a lower
wavelength here.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.300
So r1 and c1 come over here.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:08.160
c1, r1.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:08.890
We'll do one more.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.020
Three's a charm.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.130
Come up to here.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.590
This is t2.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:16.210
Concentration has fallen to
c2, and I've got a slope.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.670
You see how the slope is getting
less and less steep?

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:21.470
Because the rate loss says
the concentration

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:22.830
falls, the rate falls.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:27.450
So this is slope r2
at c equals c2.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.626
That's lower energy.

00:21:31.626 --> 00:21:34.040
So I'll get the orange.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.650
Or maybe this is fuchsia.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.605
So we'll take this one.

00:21:37.605 --> 00:21:40.100
And this will put these
two together and bring

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.620
them in like so.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.750
And this is now c2, r2. too
And what's this thing say?

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:46.930
Take the slope.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.580
Look, it's a log, log plot.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.060
If you've got physical data and
you don't get a straight

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.140
line on a log, log plot,
you're incompetent.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.290
You're a complete idiot.

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:56.820
All right?

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.690
There it is.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.510
And the slope here is n.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.540
And where it intersection,
obviously I can't get a

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.680
negative number, so just allow
me to fix this just a wee bit.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.070
So there's the axis, and where
it hits the axis, this is now

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.920
log k isn't it?

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.430
So I determine the order
of reaction.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.790
Good.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.536
So now you know how to do it and
you'll get some practice

00:22:24.536 --> 00:22:27.095
if you work the homework.

00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:27.690
All right.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.600
A couple more things to say
and then we're done.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.230
So last thing, we talked about
increasing the rate of

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:37.620
reaction by increasing the
temperature and increasing the

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.510
concentration.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.250
There's one more thing
we can do.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:47.900
And what we can do is use a
catalyst. Increase rate by use

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.500
of

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.980
catalyst. OK.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.040
How does the catalyst work?

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.250
How does the catalyst work?

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.240
Well, let's go back to
this diagram here.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.010
Where we've got, this is called
the extent of reaction.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.500
Some kind of reaction
coordinate.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.826
And over here we had some kind
of energy coordinate.

00:23:07.826 --> 00:23:09.330
We had this energy coordinate.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.370
Remember, we had this thing?

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.910
This silly thing here?

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.245
So this is the reactions.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.990
And this is the product.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:25.520
And we reasoned that the
activation energy ea is

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.830
sitting here.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.145
And we saw with the box, you had
to get a box up onto its

00:23:32.145 --> 00:23:35.410
ear, otherwise it wouldn't
fall over and so on.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:40.375
And there's a finite amount,
finite fraction of the

00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:42.000
Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.070
So if we plot energy and the
number of particles in the

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:53.270
distribution have of given
energy, we get something that

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.700
looks like this.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.890
Tails off.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:24:00.480
And we said that out
here we have the

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.930
fracture under this line.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:08.060
This is the fraction that has
the energy to jump over the

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.220
activation barrier.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.710
So fa is the--

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:16.680
f is the activated, is the
fraction activated.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.850
And those are the only
ones that can

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.030
participate in the reaction.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.630
These other ones can't surmount

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.390
the activation barrier.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.950
Now, what the catalyst
does is it lowers

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.230
the activation barrier.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.045
Catalyst lowers the activation
barrier.

00:24:31.045 --> 00:24:33.100
It doesn't change
the n points.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.200
The n points represent the
energy state of the reactants

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.840
and the energy state
of the products.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.760
What the catalyst does
is it finds a

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.700
low-energy barrier pathway.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.770
A low-energy barrier pathway,
which on this curve would mean

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:52.070
that if this energy is lower,
then the fraction of any

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:55.830
distribution that has the
requisite amount of energy is

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:56.590
much higher.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.030
Can you see the area?

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:03.400
The blue area is much, much
greater than the white area.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.415
So that means that this
fa catalyzed--

00:25:07.415 --> 00:25:09.530
I'm just going to
write cat here--

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:16.060
fa catalyzed is much greater
than fa in the absence of a

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.070
catalyst. And that promotes.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.090
What's an example of it?

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:23.060
Well, in an automobile
catalyst one of their

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.460
reactions we're trying to
promote is unburned

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.380
hydrocarbons.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:32.300
There's some unburned gasoline
that comes out in the form of

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.600
carbon monoxide.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.310
What we want to do is
convert the carbon

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.380
monoxide to carbon dioxide.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.260
And this occurs on the catalyst
and I'll show you

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.050
more of this at the end
of the lecture.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.670
But these are both gas molecules
and they're zooming

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:45.790
through space.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:48.890
And if they're going to react
with one another, they really

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:55.120
need to somehow move almost on
parallel lines so they get

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.740
close enough to each other for
a long enough period of time

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.480
that they can start thinking
about lower energy state.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.620
And say, well, gee, if we break
this bond and form a new

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.330
bond, it's going to go to--

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.480
you've got to get to know each
other, go have a few drinks,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.240
and da, da, da.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.990
So it's not happening.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.390
In the gas phase it
doesn't happen.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:18.380
So what we do instead is
we provide a service.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.300
This is the catalyst. The
catalyst is a solid surface

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:26.250
and the CO sits down
next to another CO.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:30.610
They sit down and now they're
in place long enough in the

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:36.180
right orientation to then form
CO2 and then desorb.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.070
So this is how the
catalyst assists.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.910
We call this-- especially,
imagine if

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:41.630
it's the other way--

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.350
what if this carbon monoxide
molecule is turn around so

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.450
that the two carbons
are side by side.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.940
That's not going to promote the
reaction at all because

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.540
this thing's got to whip
around and so on.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:53.960
This is a.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.440
Bad orientation

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.320
And what's the Greek idea
for orientation?

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.210
It's stereos.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.740
That's what stereophonic
sound is.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.440
If I close my eyes,
the two speakers

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.340
give me spatial rendition.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.440
So this concept here, where
things are backwards and

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.690
they're not the right place.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.180
It's called steric hindrance.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.580
This is steric hindrance.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.310
One of the functions of a
catalyst is to combat steric

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:19.170
hindrance and put things
in their most favorable

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.880
orientation to facilitate
reaction.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.750
So what are characteristics
of the catalyst?

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.960
The catalyst needs to have the
following characteristics--

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.500
first of all, it has to have an
affinity for the reactants.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.840
In this case, the CO.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.350
It has to have an affinity
for carbon monoxide.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.980
Affinity for reactants, so
they'll be attracted to the

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.990
catalyst.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.860
But there's a second
piece here.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.560
If the catalyst doesn't get rid
of the CO2, can you see

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.030
that after a very short period
of time, the surface of the

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.860
catalyst will be covered with
carbon dioxide and then the

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.460
reaction starves.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.570
It's choked.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:28:00.550
So it has to have a disaffinity
for the products.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.630
Disaffinity for the products.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.430
And in the real world, such as
in the gas exhaust stream of a

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.190
car, it's not just
carbon monoxide.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.710
There's all kinds of other stuff
going on in there, and

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.420
so the third thing that the
catalyst needs to have is

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.950
selectivity.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:28.540
So it doesn't get distracted
by other reactions.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.890
And selectivity, most important
when you have a

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:36.660
mixture of all sorts
of other species.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.230
So that's what the
catalyst does.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.510
Now there's one more thing.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.350
Just one second.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.990
Perfect.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.400
Gotcha just in time.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.480
So one more thing here.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.270
One more thing.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:50.240
We've shown what happens
when you catalyze.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.400
So I'm going to put this.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:56.410
This is ea under the influence
of catalysis.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:56.790
OK.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.250
This is the e of the catalyst.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:03.450
There are other substances that
can retard the reaction.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:04.960
These are called inhibitors.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.960
And what's an inhibitor do?

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.500
It does the complimentary
action.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.690
So it raises the activation
barrier.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.380
So this is ea under the
influence of inhibitor.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.490
And what's the value of that?

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:26.800
Well, if you buy some antifreeze
for use in the

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.260
automobile cooling system.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.990
If you read carefully the label,
it's not just ethylene

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.690
glycol, and water, 50/50
volume percent.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.160
There are other additives.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.250
What are those additives?

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.080
Some of them are called
inhibitors.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.580
Oh, I didn't spell this right.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.120
No wonder you looked
so puzzled.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.920
I thought you didn't understand
the concept.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.170
Inhibitor.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.460
So it inhibits the reaction.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.300
What's going on?

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.350
You've got the iron or aluminum
block of the engine,

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.790
you got the water pump.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.150
It's taking heat away from the
engine, you're heating

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.760
everything up, stirring
it around.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.170
It's a perfect environment
for enhancing corrosion.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:08.760
And we don't want the cooling
system to act as the corrosion

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.640
system for the engine.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:16.240
And so we add components to the
antifreeze too reduce the

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.400
rate of corrosion, to
lengthen the service

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.840
lifetime of the vehicle.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.520
And so what does the
inhibitor do?

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.120
It raises the activation barrier
for the corrosion

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.040
reaction and thereby reduces
its rate of reaction

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.870
substantially.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.435
So this is inhibited.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.610
OK, so this is catalyzed, this
is inhibited, and you can see

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:44.200
that the fraction of active
species over the activation

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.840
barrier, under the influence
of inhibition, is much less

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.050
than the fraction otherwise.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.980
There's a time and a place for
all of these wonderful things.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.180
So that's the story
of kinetics.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.140
That's the story of kinetics,
but it's 11:35 and it's time

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.820
to start a new topic.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.610
And now, we can erase.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:04.860
Thanks.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:05.090
OK.

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:07.850
So let's talk about
something else.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:08.650
Let's talk about
something else.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:11.620
What I want to talk about today
is another topic that

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:15.180
comes from the general area
of rate phenomena.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.220
I want to talk about something
else in rate phenomena.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.470
We're going to talk
about diffusion.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.770
And that's from the general
class of rate phenomena.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.770
That's why it appears with
chemical kinetics.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:33.260
And what do I mean by
rate phenomena?

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.685
Rate phenomena means d
by dt is in the room.

00:31:36.685 --> 00:31:37.460
All right?

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.560
We're looking at time,
domain processes.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.550
You know, chemistry, before you
came into this class, you

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.580
probably thought, I know
what chemistry is.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.510
Chemistry is chemicals
reacting.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.480
That's what people think.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.520
Isn't that what the ancient
Egyptians said?

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.510
khemia That's where the guys
knew how to embalm

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.620
the dead and so on.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.920
It was about chemical
reactions.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.820
We've been talking about
structure, properties, all

00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.300
sorts of things.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.560
Well, now we're talking about
rates of reaction.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.040
If we want to run a reaction,
there's two things that we

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.260
need to move around to
sustain a reaction.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:19.330
So transport of two important
quantities.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.780
One is matter and the
other is energy.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.945
We star something for energy.

00:32:22.945 --> 00:32:25.080
As we just saw, the
thing doesn't go.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.890
And if we starve it for
matter it doesn't go.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:31.690
So energy in motion is
under the general

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.250
rubric of heat transfer.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.150
But we won't talk about heat
transfer because we've only

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:36.370
got 14 weeks.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.380
I'd love to talk about it,
but we're out of time.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:43.410
So instead, we will talk
about mass transport.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:46.620
And mass transport in solids
occurs by diffusion.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:54.400
And we know what's critical.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.050
For example, we know in the case
of the Hindenburg, the

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:00.750
Hindenburg didn't explode.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.590
Why didn't the Hindenburg
explode?

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.410
Because there were 7 million
cubic feet of hydrogen, but we

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.760
couldn't get 7 million cubic
feet of oxygen to the site.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.560
Because of the limitations of
mass transport, 2/3 of the

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.240
people walked off
of that vessel.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.770
It was on fire, and many of
them died because they

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.250
panicked and they jumped
to their deaths.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.730
Very few people were actually
affected by the fire.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.320
So it's a good example of mass
transport, negating the rate

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.470
of what otherwise could have
been an explosive reaction.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.200
So I'm going to look at a
simple example today.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.560
And what I want to do is
look at the doping of

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.930
semiconductors.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.790
You know, we've studied
semiconductors.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:41.820
Dave, could we cut to the
document camera, please?

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.150
So what I've got here
is I'm going to show

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.870
you a silicon wafer.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.570
And the silicon wafer has
got some features on it.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.670
So it's already been doped.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.360
Oh, that's pretty, isn't it?

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.190
So cute.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.950
All right.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:55.640
So what we've got here, remember
this is the 8-inch

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.870
diameter single crystal.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.110
So this was cut from a single
piece of silicon 8 inches in

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.780
diameter, about 2 meters long.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.440
How did they make a
single crystal?

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.000
They immersed the tiny single
crystal into the melt and

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.870
gradually pulled the
single crystal out.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.280
Sort of the way you can grow
rock mountain candy.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.440
And if you're really careful,
the entire giant, 2 meter

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.490
length, 8 inches in diameter,
is one single crystal.

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:25.080
And then we take this and we cut
it with a diamond saw into

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.540
wafers, Each of them about a
millimeter in thickness.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.380
And, of course, the width of
the saw turns into dust So

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.450
your yield [SNAPS]

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:34.190
right off the bat
is about 50%.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:35.100
Because [SAW SOUND]

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:35.785
it's all gone.

00:34:35.785 --> 00:34:36.140
[SAW SOUND]

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.120
it's all gone.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.520
And now what we're going to
do, is we want to dope it.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.550
So how do I get the
boron in here?

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.690
We say, why don't we add the
boron to the melt, but what if

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.110
I want to make pn-junctions?

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:48.510
So I want to get some boron
and some phosphorous.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.210
If I add the boron and
the phosphorous,

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.550
it then goes nuts.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:54.060
I need to have p-type
against n-type.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.940
So how do I get it in here?

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.070
That's we're going
to talk about.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:01.950
We're going to talk about how
we make those features.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:02.810
See those features?

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.480
Because if you're really good,
you start with those features

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.070
and you cut them up and
then you end up with

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.860
this, which is this.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.850
This is a Pentium chip.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:17.690
The amount of material science,
physical chemistry in

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.320
that device is absolutely
phenomenal.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.730
What lies underneath this piece
of gold is absolutely

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:24.190
phenomenal.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:27.830
It's what powers the
information age.

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:29.990
And it all starts with
this stuff here.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:31.260
It's that simple.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.840
So how do we get the boron in?

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.910
Dave, let's leave this up.

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:34.920
It's a pretty image.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.900
It might soothe the natives,
so let's just leave it up.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.080
By the way, that spider network
is all the gold wires

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.400
that are addressing.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.730
It doesn't do you any good to
have a gazillion features

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.520
there but you can't get
information in and out.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.660
So if you've got a gazillion
features, you need a gazillion

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.780
leads to take information
in and out.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.570
That's very, very thin gold.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:35:59.670
How do you do that?

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.920
Not with a paint brush.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.090
It's all with this stuff.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:07.440
That's why I teach you
this instead some

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.010
of the other stuff.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:08.330
OK.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:09.470
So now we're going to dope.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.310
We're going to dope the
silicon with boron.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.700
Number one point to remember--
we're going to dope the

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.540
silicon in the solid state.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.570
We do not add boron
to molten silicon.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:23.050
We're going to add boron
to the silicon

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.370
in the solid state.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.450
So I'm going to draw
this wafer.

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:27.750
Only it's not to scale.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:32.640
It's going to look more like a
hockey puck than a thin wafer.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.370
Anyways, imagine it's this.

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:35.190
OK?

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:39.850
So this is the silicon wafer,
the silicon wafer on edge.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:41.420
And this is where all
the features were

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.920
that I showed you.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.330
So we're going to do is
we're going to try

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:46.045
to introduce boron.

00:36:46.045 --> 00:36:48.730
We want to get boron into the
silicon, we're going to bring

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.720
it in from the surface.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.170
So this is a silicon
wafer, which means

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:55.510
it's a single crystal.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:56.710
It's a single crystal.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:59.120
And we could use Laue methods
to figure out

00:36:59.120 --> 00:36:59.815
which is the face.

00:36:59.815 --> 00:37:01.410
Is that cut on the 0 1 1?

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.440
Is it cut on a 1 1 1?

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.570
And so on.

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:12.000
So now we're going to
dope with boron.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.960
How do we do it?

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.260
We decompose diborane.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.200
We introduce diborane,
it's a gas.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.130
B2H6.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:22.390
And we flow diborane over the
surface at some constant

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.550
concentration.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:26.600
And what happens is that the
diborane decomposes.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.190
B2H6 on silicon.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:31.910
And I'm going to write
silicon with an x.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:33.060
What's the x mean?

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.270
Crystalline.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:35.180
Single crystal.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:38.720
Make sure no one is thinking
this is being performed in the

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.740
liquid phase.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:44.870
And this diborane decomposes
to elemental boron plus

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:47.800
hydrogen gas.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.910
So hydrogen is a gas, and the
boron goes into the silicon.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:54.720
Boron goes into the silicon
where it goes on to the

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.530
silicon sites.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.170
I could just write a rate
constant for this.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:00.240
We just studied kinetics.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:00.640
I don't know.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.000
What is it?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.280
Second order?

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.350
You know, it doesn't have to be
integral order, by the way.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.730
It could be of order 1.5.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:10.160
Nothing is saying it has
to be integral order.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.110
OK.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:15.170
So now what I want to do is I
want to ask, what happens as

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:16.530
the boron goes in?

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:19.560
So that's the next question.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.960
As it diffuses in.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.110
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to draw this little

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.360
cartoon here.

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:31.170
So I want to look at here's the
surface of the silicon.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:36.070
So I've got a gas phase here and
I've got boron going into

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.580
the silicon crystal.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.610
So I'm going to now get a little
bit quantitative, if

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:41.580
you'll permit.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.000
And so it's going to
look like this.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.630
And put it right underneath
here.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.530
So this is x. this
is depth from the

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.660
surface of the silicon.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.650
So this is the free surface
of the silicon.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.390
And I start off with some
concentration surface

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:58.670
value, c sub s.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.450
Meaning concentration
at the surface.

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:03.460
And that's fixed.

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:11.460
So cs fixed by B2H6

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.910
concentration in the gas phase.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:14.660
So that's fixed.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.670
Now, question is, what
does it look like?

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.060
The advance of the boron?

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.190
So this is now the

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:23.560
concentration of boron in silicon.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.860
This is the silicon
crystal here.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:26.840
So what does it look like?

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.440
Well, one possibility is it goes
in like this as a front.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.290
See if I wait, goes in farther
and farther and farther.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:35.510
That doesn't happen.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:36.760
Sorry.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.330
Take that off.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.660
You know what happens?

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.580
Same thing we've been
looking at all day.

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:48.530
So now what's the question?

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.870
Question is, what's the
functionality of this?

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.470
Is this 1 over c?

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:54.570
Is this log c?

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.200
Is this some other
function of c?

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:05.590
I want to map this into some f
of c versus g of x so I can

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.840
get a straight line.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.900
Why do I want a straight line?

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.330
Because I want to
be quantitative.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.900
Because you are in charge of
designing a fab line and they

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.930
want to know what the resonance
time of a silicon

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:18.990
wafer is supposed to be at
billion dollars multiples.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:22.230
You know, the units are in
billions of dollars.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.580
So you don't want to make the
fab line any bigger than it

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.700
needs to be, the resident's
time any longer.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.680
This is only way you're going
to be able to design it.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.710
You have to understand this
because the design

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.460
specification is going to
be dope to a certain

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.490
concentration of a
certain depth.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:43.210
So how long does it take
to get boron in?

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.360
You can tell me.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.040
Set the concentration here
and wait 5 minutes,

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.020
10 minutes, 30 minutes.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.110
Two companies.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.480
One takes 30 minutes to process
the wafer, the other

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.510
takes 10 minutes to
process the wafer.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.370
Guess which company is going
to be in business

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:00.140
two years from now?

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.730
It's not going to be the one
that takes a long time.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:04.320
Hint.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.560
So we need to know what
the rules are here.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.570
And the mathematical
formulation was

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:12.930
set by Adolf Fick.

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:18.440
Adolf Fick, 1855, answered
the question, what is the

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.975
form of that line?

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.010
He's an interesting guy.

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:26.505
He was at the University
of Zurich.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.410
And it's sort of like
the Balmer story.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:32.120
Remember J.J.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.260
Balmer was the school teacher
in Switzerland.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.120
This guy was in Switzerland,
too.

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.930
Something going on there in
Switzerland in the late

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.060
eighteen hundreds.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:39.990
So remember J.J.

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.900
Balmer?

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:45.180
He fit not his own data, he
fit the data of Angstrom.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.610
Angstrom made the measurements,

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:48.080
Balmer fit the data.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.700
Well, same thing here.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.310
Fick did not make the
measurements.

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:56.120
He looked at some data that had
been taken back in 1833 by

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.960
Thomas Graham.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:04.290
Thomas Graham had been making
measurements back in the 1830s

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:08.110
of gases diffusing through
porous membranes.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:16.900
Or just say, through
membranes.

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.270
Obviously, if they
weren't porous

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.160
they wouldn't be diffusing.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:20.760
Redundancy.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.870
Department of Redundancy.

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:23.690
This is diffusing through
membranes.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.290
So what happened was
that he modeled it.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:28.480
And here's what he
came up with.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.300
He came up with--

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.270
oh, by the way.

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:32.710
I didn't mention what he was.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:35.700
He was a physiologist. He
was a medical doctor.

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.430
He just poured through the
scientific literature for

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:41.350
amusement, evidently.

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:41.690
OK.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:45.820
So this is what Fick gave us
as the model for the data.

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:50.760
He gave us what we know as
Fick's First Law, Fick's First

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.166
Law of Diffusion.

00:42:52.166 --> 00:42:56.200
And we'll just call it FFL,
Fick's First Law of Diffusion.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.780
And we'll write Ficks'
First Law J.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:02.190
J, which is the flux.

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:06.710
This is the unit of measure of
mass transport, the flux,

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.390
which obviously is the
mass flow rate.

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:12.700
We said this is mass transport,
so this is the mass

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:18.920
flow right of species i, OK?

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.500
And we're going to say in the
x-direction because things

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.850
diffuse in all directions,
right?

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:27.530
If I open a perfume bottle here,
the diffusion will take

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:28.670
place in all directions.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:30.510
So I'm going to make
this one dimension.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.210
So the flux is a mass flow rate
of i in the x-direction.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:36.840
J sub i in the x-direction.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.850
Remember we said the
Chemical Rate Law?

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:43.310
We said the Chemical Rate Law
was that the rate of progress

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.670
of a chemical reaction goes
as the concentration.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:50.900
Well, Fick studied Graham's
data and he said, the flux

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.980
doesn't go as the
concentration.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:57.120
It goes as the gradient
in the concentration.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.770
That's how you linearize
those data.

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:03.190
So you take the concentration
gradient, which is dc by dx.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.560
OK.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.870
So that's the concentration
gradient.

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:12.820
Gradient in concentration
of i in the x-direction.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.520
You could write this as--

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.430
make this vector--

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:17.650
but we're not going
to do that.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.200
It would make it one-dimensional
here.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.390
And the constant of
proportionality is d sub i,

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:25.470
which is called the diffusivity
or the diffusion

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:26.720
coefficient.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.520
And puts the minus sign.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.010
Why?

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:36.300
Well, you know things move from
high concentration to low

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.950
concentration, right?

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:41.130
So I open the perfume bottle,
the odor gets--

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:44.100
the odor, pardon me-- the
fragrance gets stronger as you

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.240
get closer to the bottle.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.860
Things move from high
concentration the low

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:48.420
concentration.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:51.020
So if I gave you this
concentration profile--

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.290
what's profile mean?

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.830
Profile means--

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.690
this is a concentration
profile--

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:04.830
if I draw someone like this,
this is head on, right?

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.760
And if I do the right view like

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.120
this, this is the profile.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:11.730
Profile.

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:12.220
Side view.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.840
This is profile.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.540
Concentration profile,
obviously, the concentration

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.550
is higher to the left.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.220
So things are moving
from left to right.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.640
But look at the slope.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.720
The slope is a negative
number.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.790
So if the slope is a negative
number, but I want to get a

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:30.860
positive flux, I need to have
the minus sign in here.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.050
Diffusivity is a physical
constant.

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:33.640
It has to be a positive
number.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.900
So this is Fick's First Law.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.470
I'll just give you the units
and then we'll stop.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:44.220
So what are the units?

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:49.070
Well, the units in flux are in
SI units kilograms per second.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.880
And we're going in one
direction, and so as we're

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:56.090
trying to diffuse into this
piece of silicon, we have to

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:58.100
normalize it per unit area.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.980
So it's kilograms per meter
squared per second.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:06.080
You know that concentration is
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.440
d by dx is 1 over meter, which
means then that the diffuse

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.600
coefficient or the diffusivity
has units of length squared

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.970
per unit time.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:19.970
This is the units of the
diffusion coefficient.

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:21.490
And we'll get back to
business next day.

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:24.750
David, may we cut to the
slides again, please?

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.740
OK.

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:36.520
So I talked to you about--

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:36.720
oh, yeah.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.330
There's all this.

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.500
You see they give
you a half-life?

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.410
Crazy.

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:41.420
Forget it.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.010
OK.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.880
There's the book talking about
activated catalog, da, da, da.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.460
This is Fick's First Law.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.820
This is the paper from 1855.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:53.640
Go ahead. "On the Influence of
Diffusion" by Dr. Adolph Fick.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.150
So the number one catalyst
in the world, number one

00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:01.020
application is automotive
catalysts for exhaust. So

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.130
gasoline is octane.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:05.520
C8H18, which we burn in air.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.520
We burn it in air, we
make hydrocarbons.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.880
Pardon me, we burn hydrocarbons,
which obviously

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.610
means the carbon goes to
CO2, ideally, and the

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:16.020
hydrogen goes to H2O.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.870
But sometimes you get incomplete
combustion.

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:18.930
I already showed you that.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:20.580
Maybe we stop it CO.

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.320
But remember, air
is 4/5 nitrogen.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.020
So when you burn hydrocarbons
you also, at these high

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:31.980
temperatures, mix nitrogen
and oxygen and make NOx.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.310
And is was actually the
precursor to smog.

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:39.620
So what we want to do is to
eliminate these imperfect

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:40.570
combustions.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.590
So we want to convert the
unburned hydrocarbons.

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:49.490
There's actually some of the CH
compounds, volatile, then

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:50.190
don't get burned.

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:52.600
We want to burn those
to H2O in water--

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.570
pardon me, H2O in CO2.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:57.670
The unburned CO has
to go to CO2.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.120
You might say, but isn't
CO2 a greenhouse gas?

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:00.660
Yeah, it is.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:04.260
But you know, given the choice
of carbon monoxide and carbon

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.750
dioxide, my advice is go
with carbon dioxide.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:09.590
Carbon monoxide will
kill you at about

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.160
200 parts per million.

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.780
And then NOx, we
want to convert

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.960
that to carbon dioxide.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.960
So GM alone tried over
1,500 catalysts.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:18.950
Why GM?

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:20.240
Why not the auto industry?

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.900
Because the U.S. Government,
in its wisdom back in the

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.400
1970s, invoked the Sherman
Antitrust Act and forbid the

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.360
automobile industry to
collaborate in the search for

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.870
a catalyst. And since they
didn't understand the science

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:36.400
of catalysis it was
trial and error.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.840
By inspection.

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.000
And it's a huge space,
trying things.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.110
But they eventually found,
after 1,500 tests,

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:46.330
platinum-palladium works for
hydrocarbons and CO, and

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:47.680
rhodium works for NOx.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.020
It's almost as though mother
nature said, I'll give you a

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.570
catalyst and it's going to be
the most expensive part of the

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:53.750
Periodic Table.

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:57.730
You buy this stuff at the
jewelry store, you see.

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:00.130
Furthermore, this is an
oxidation reaction.

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:02.030
This is an oxidation reaction.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.660
This is a reduction reaction.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.130
So if I told you I want you in
the same place at the same

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:10.560
time on a vehicle moving 80
miles an hour to conduct

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:14.020
simultaneous oxidation and
reduction reactions with no

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.600
intervention, you'd
say impossible.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.680
They did it.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.130
They did it.

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:22.320
This is the power of selectivity
of the catalyst.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.980
So this is an old diagram
from GM literature.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.360
Now we have fuel injectors,
here, but fuel goes into the

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.520
engine, out to the exhaust.
There's an oxygen sensor,

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.940
which I'll show you next day.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:38.725
Oxygen sensor measures what
composition of the output gas

00:49:38.725 --> 00:49:42.410
is, sends it to an electronic
control module, which then

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:43.890
goes back into the carburetor.

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:47.080
And the catalytic convert
is right here.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:51.180
And Dave, if you show
the document camera.

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.230
This is the monolith.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:56.000
This is a piece of ceramic
because platinum and rhodium

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.470
and all of these other elements
are so expensive.

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.245
See, this thing's having
a hard time.

00:50:00.245 --> 00:50:01.480
So we'll cheat a little bit.

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.450
We'll put this here and
then it'll focus.

00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:04.860
All right.

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:08.000
So what you're looking at,
these are long channels.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.100
And just to give you a scale,
this is about a half of a

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.210
millimeter.

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:15.560
This is about a half a
millimeter square and they go

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:18.570
all the way down for a length
of about eight inches.

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:23.850
And then the walls, the interior
walls, are coated

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:26.400
with a very, very thin
layer of platinum,

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.750
palladium, and rhodium.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.680
Because these are expensive
metals.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.440
And it's a surface effect.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:35.110
So you get no value if you have
an inch deep of platinum.

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:37.180
The only stuff that works
is the free surface.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.390
What you'd really like
is a monolayer.

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:42.130
But a monolayer of platinum has
no mechanical strength.

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:45.710
So you put the platinum,
palladium, and rhodium down on

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:48.820
a catalyst support. and this
stuff is made of a ceramic,

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.180
it's magnesia, alumina silica
that's been extruded like

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.820
pasta, and then fired.

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.340
The technology is absolutely
phenomenal.

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:58.420
Goes into this.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.540
And then to get the
platinum-palladium-rhodium

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.640
they have a very
thin acid wash.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.480
chloroplatinic, chlororhodic
acid, wash, little bit of

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.660
surface tension, holds just a
little bit of water, fire, out

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.680
comes the metal.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.770
Just thick enough.

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.830
If it's too thick, dilute the
concentration of the acid.

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:20.020
But use that precious
metal sparingly.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.540
Platinum hit $2,000 an
ounce last year.

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.950
$2,000 an ounce.

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:26.846
You steal a car, throw
the car away, and get

00:51:26.846 --> 00:51:28.096
the catalytic converter.

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.890
So anyway, that's underneath.

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.310
That's what's going on
underneath the car.

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:41.670
And actually, I'm holding for
you the elements of clean air,

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:42.850
the catalytic converter.

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:45.210
But the catalytic converter
can't work unless we control

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:47.540
the air to fuel ratio,
which we have to do

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:48.570
with an oxygen sensor.

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:49.660
I'll show you next day.

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:51.775
And you've got to feed
it into a CPU.

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:55.300
If you don't have a CPU, it
can't make rapid feedback to

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.610
keep adjusting the air-to-fuel
ratio.

00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:59.770
All right, Dave. Let's
cut to slides and

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:01.870
we'll get out of here.

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:04.800
So I'll show you what
else is in here.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.780
OK, there's that.

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:06.500
So there's the old thing.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.640
There's the engine,
da, da, da.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.500
Exhaust, the control module.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.590
And look, in the old days
they actually had--

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:14.070
they look like little
ball bearings--

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:16.380
cost of these things
was phenomenal.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:20.360
So last thing, we had to
go to unleaded gas.

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.070
Unleaded gas was brought in
because the lead would be

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:27.430
broken down into elemental lead
because lead is volatile

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:28.340
as an oxide.

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:30.230
The lead alloys with
the platinum.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.970
Turns it into a lead
platinum alloy.

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:33.390
Lead has no catalytic value.

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:36.410
Because if it did, we would
use lead and not platinum.

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.750
OK.

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:39.890
We'll see you on Friday.
