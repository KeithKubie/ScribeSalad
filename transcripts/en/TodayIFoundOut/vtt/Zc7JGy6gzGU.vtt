00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:20.130
Stress, in general, comes in a few different
forms- acute, episodic, and chronic.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.390
Acute stress can be very beneficial to you.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.360
Have you ever come face to face with a rabid
puma?

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.500
If so, the ability of your body to react quickly
can be very beneficial.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.770
Too much stress, like in the case of episodic
or chronic, can lead to a host of psychological

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.800
and medical problems.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.050
So what exactly is happening in the body when
you get stressed?

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.450
Stress begins when the danger is perceived.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.020
The signal is initially sent to an area of
the brain called the amygdala; this almond-shaped

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.940
grouping of neurons processes the information,
and if it senses danger, sends a distress

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.540
signal to your hypothalamus.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.540
The hypothalamus plays a critical role in
keeping the body’s many systems in a state

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.860
of homeostasis- basically, acting as a connector
between the endocrine system and the autonomic

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.860
nervous system.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.550
This connection regulates the body’s many
requirements, maintaining them in a state

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.080
of equilibrium, including things like body
temperature, sleep cycles, sex drive, blood

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.880
pressure, heart rate, thirst, production of
digestive juices, and in the case of stress,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.190
stimulating your sympathetic nervous system.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.460
Commonly known as your fight or flight nervous
system, when the amygdala sends its distress

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.159
signal to the hypothalamus, the hypothalamus
responds by sending a message down your autonomic

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.420
nerves to your adrenal glands.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.390
Located above your kidneys, these glands immediately
send out a hormone called epinephrine, sometimes

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.310
referred to as adrenaline.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.940
This hormone also belongs to a class of neurotransmitters
(the things that allow your nerves to communicate

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.130
with each other) called catecholamines.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.500
Epinephrine isn’t the only catecholamine
released in response to stress.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.390
Dopamine and norepinephrine are also secreted.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.330
Together, these neurotransmitters do several
things within the brain.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.820
For instance, they cause the release of a
small protein called Neuropeptide S., which

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.090
decreases sleep and increases alertness, sometimes
giving you sense of anxiety.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.709
They also affect memory by suppressing short-term
memory, while simultaneously signaling your

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.529
hippocampus to store the information in your
long-term memory.

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:20.310
This allows you to react quickly, but makes
it difficult to perform intellectual tasks

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.150
and interferes in social skills and behaviors.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.969
Your body’s other responses to these catecholamines
are both complex and immediate.

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.190
Your blood vessels begin constricting, while
simultaneously your heart rate increases.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.819
Your breathing rate increases, at the same
time small airways in your lungs expand.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.980
Blood sugar is released from the many stored
areas of the body supplying the energy needs.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.680
The result is an increase in blood and oxygen
being pumped to the many muscles and organs

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.760
of the body.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.609
(Very critical if trying to bob-and-weave
to avoid that crazy-cat!)

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.239
Some studies suggest your blood-flow may increase
by 300-400%.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.709
If all this seems like it would take way too
long to happen in a beneficial way, never

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:02.709
fear (pun intended).

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.040
The reactions by your amygdala and hypothalamus
are so fast the neurotransmitters and hormones

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.279
start their cascade-of-security before the
visual centers of the brain have even processed

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.130
the information it just received!

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.159
(Nature’s way of giving you a head start
when faced with the sudden on-slot of a carnivorous-creature!)

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.420
Your hypothalamus causing your adrenal glands
to release catecholamines is only a small

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.469
part of the stress response.

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:32.689
The body reacts to stress, fear, and worry
in a much more all-encompassing way.

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:38.110
Known as your HPA axis, this stress response
involves a connection between your hypothalamus,

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.669
pituitary, and your adrenal glands.

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:45.889
Once the instinctual reactions caused by catecholamines
begin causing you to fight or flight, other

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:50.920
hormonal signals continue giving you all the
benefits needed to maintain your panic-like

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.920
state.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.609
At the same time catecholamines are released,
your hypothalamus also begins secreting corticotropin-releasing

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:57.609
factor.

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.450
This hormone then attaches to your pituitary
gland and causes it to release adrenocorticotropic

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.769
hormone.

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.639
Once in your circulatory system, it attaches
to your adrenal cortex, causing the release

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.479
of Glucocorticoids, primarily Cortisol.

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.329
Cortisol is a steroid hormone.

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.489
Its primary functions include increasing blood
sugar, suppressing your immune system, and

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.340
aiding in the metabolism of fats, proteins
and carbohydrates.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.030
It’s also important in regulating several
body systems including the heart, lungs, circulation,

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.900
metabolism, immune system and skin.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.730
Cortisol also reduces the effects of parts
of the immune system, thereby allowing white

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.100
blood cells and other molecules to propagate
in areas where injury will most likely occur,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.160
like your skin and lymph nodes.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.090
The activation of your fight or flight nervous
system also reduces the effects of your parasympathetic

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.430
nervous system, commonly known as your rest-and-digest
nervous system.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.410
The consequence is a reduction in the effects
of your digestive system.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.530
You might also get a dry mouth and throat
caused by blood-flow being diverted to more

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.960
essential areas of the body.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.480
The resulting skin responses include cool,
clammy, sometimes sweaty skin.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.970
Your scalp will also tighten causing some
hair to stand up.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.900
As you can see by this tour of the science
behind what’s happening in your body when

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.110
you feel stress, if you needed your body to
fight off a crazy-cat, these responses can

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.460
be lifesaving.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.780
However, problems arise when these responses
happen consistently throughout our lives,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.730
or when the stress is perceived and not actual.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.080
As previously mentioned, the stress response
is activated when there is a real, or perceived

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.640
threat to homeostasis.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.210
They can also be external or internal.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.610
Real external stresses can be things like
that mad-mouser, painful stimuli, or stressful

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.140
psychological environments such as poor working
conditions, unhappy marriages, or when one

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.980
is having financial problems.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.270
Real internal stressors can be things like
infection, illness, or inflammation.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.420
Some studies have shown perceived stress,
like when simply thinking or focusing on those

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.250
real stressful situations, or continually
rehashing stresses from the past, cause the

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.860
same cascade of hormone release as actual
stress.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.840
Your endocrine glands appear to be unable
to differentiate between an outside influence,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.590
and the memory induced influences caused by
simply thinking about upsetting things.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.590
Does post-traumatic stress sound familiar?

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.870
Now that you know what effects stress has
on the body, imagine those same responses,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.970
such as overexertion of your cardiovascular
system, on a consistent basis.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.720
(Thus why chronic stress is a risk factor
for heart attacks and strokes.)

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.861
In addition, the perpetual high levels of
cortisol causes impaired cognition, increase

00:06:25.861 --> 00:06:30.820
in abdominal fats, rapid weight gain and a
lowered immune system- no surprise then that

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.590
chronic stress is also a risk factor for diabetes,
coronary artery disease, and why it increases

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.600
your chance of getting sick.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.170
Chronic stress has also been shown to be a
risk factor for countless other health problems,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:46.490
such as depression, insomnia, anxiety, irritable
bowel syndrome, substance abuse, sexual and

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.330
reproductive dysfunctions, headaches and unexplained
muscle and joint pain.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.960
Now that you know the cause, how do you get
rid of stress?

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.200
Simple on the surface but often difficult
to implement, the cure is just to remove or

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.810
reduce the stressful input.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.990
Of course, it’s easy to say “I’m going
to quit my stressful job,” but homelessness

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.810
and the inability to buy food is also extremely
stressful!

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.970
A much more practical way to get rid of stress
in many cases is to find a way to get rid

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.800
of the harmful hormones and metabolites created
by the response.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.870
How do you do that?

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.500
The body already has a natural way to settle
down after a stressful encounter; it begins

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.410
stimulating your parasympathetic nervous system.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:33.370
This “rest and digest” system gets activated
when, you guessed it, you rest or you begin

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.410
digesting the food you just ate.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.440
As you can imagine, if you’re thinking about
stressful situations all day, you’re brain

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.590
and body aren’t really resting.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.520
Strategies to combat chronic stress should
include ways to promote relaxing- things like

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:51.330
meditation, deep breathing exercises, muscle
relaxation exercises, making time for recreation,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.730
and message therapy.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.710
Even owning a pet has been shown to reduce
stress.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.669
Sex is also a great way to stimulate your
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:04.210
For the ladies, eating around 40g of dark
chocolate has been shown to reduce perceived

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.210
stress.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.210
If you’re a particularly adventurous person,
maybe combine a few of these- stare at your

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.210
purring cat while breathing deeply and sucking
on dark chocolate at the same time your partner

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.210
gives you a massage with a happy ending…
though maybe towards the end make the cat

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.210
leave- you staring at it or it at you at such
a time is a little creepy.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.210
If your personality tends towards excessive
emotional responses to everyday things- screaming

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.770
at the cars around you in a traffic jam because
somehow that will make it move faster- countless

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.260
studies have shown we can train our bodies
to respond differently in those situations

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.940
through behavioral therapy.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.690
If relaxing just isn’t part of your daily
routine, there’s another scientifically

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.669
proven method to reduce excess cortisol in
your body while giving you a boatload of other

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:29.669
health benefits- Exercise!

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:30.669
(For a good ultra-science based, non-gimmicky,
simple place to start, see Bigger, Leaner,

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:31.669
Stronger (for guys) or Thinner, Leaner, Stronger
(for girls).

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:32.669
I can’t recommend these highly enough.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.669
So much health and fitness myth debunking
and good science packaged in a relatively

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:34.669
quick, easy read.)

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:35.669
While exercise forces the body to increase
cortisol levels due to our bodies perceiving

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:40.269
this deviation from homeostasis as stress,
regular exercise trains the body to reduce

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:43.110
the amount of cortisol release when exposed
to stress.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.350
For example, if you begin running at a 15
minute mile pace, your body will release the

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.199
appropriate amount of cortisol for that experience.

00:08:50.199 --> 00:08:54.490
As you continue getting in better shape, less
cortisol is needed to perform the same task.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.529
When you come across stressful encounters
in other aspects of your life, less cortisol

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:00.870
is released in response to that input.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.510
The effect isn’t limited to people who exercise.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.740
Several studies have shown those who regularly
are more active, see a decrease in cortisol

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.350
release when exposed to an emotional situation
compared to those who are sedentary.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:17.209
This is very similar to the results psychologists
are hoping for when they attempt desensitization

00:09:17.209 --> 00:09:22.339
techniques- continually exposing you to your
stress in an attempt to have less of a reaction

00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:23.339
to it.

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:26.949
Other things that have been shown to increase
cortisol release are caffeine, alcohol, tobacco,

00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:29.850
sleep deprivation and irregular sleep patterns.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.320
From this, you don’t have to be a rocket
surgeon to realize if you decrease your caffeine

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.870
intake, stop drinking so much, and get better
sleep, you will reduce the amount of cortisol

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.319
circulating around your body.

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:45.990
Grandma’s advice has never been more correct-
eat right, get plenty of exercise, don’t

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:54.170
drink or smoke, go to bed on time, and find
a way to make money doing what you love.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.949
If grandma’s advice seems a little too tame,
you can always try the scientifically proven

00:09:58.949 --> 00:10:17.170
method of combining sex and chocolate!
