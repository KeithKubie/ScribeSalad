00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.566
- [Voiceover] Hey guys,
so in the last video

00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.842
I was talking about how
you can define a function

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:05.350
whose graph is a plane,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.230
and moreover a plane that
passes through a specified point

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.077
and whose orientation
you can somehow specify.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.758
And we ended up seeing how
specifying that orientation

00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:16.938
comes down to certain partial
derivative information.

00:00:16.938 --> 00:00:19.654
And first let me just kind of
repeat what the conclusion was

00:00:19.654 --> 00:00:22.186
but I'll put it in more abstract terms

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:24.994
since I did it in a very
specific example last time.

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:27.270
So basically if you want
some kind of function

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.222
which gives you a plane that

00:00:29.222 --> 00:00:30.706
passes through a certain point.

00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:32.218
Well first let's see
what that point is right.

00:00:32.218 --> 00:00:36.200
Let's say the point was x
nought, y nought, and z nought.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.963
So these are constant values

00:00:37.963 --> 00:00:39.891
and this is my way of
abstractly describing

00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:41.563
a single point in space using

00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:43.979
x nought to represent a constant x value,

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.067
y nought to represent constant
y value, that kind of thing.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:49.899
So what it is, is it's gonna
be some sort of other constant

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.982
a multiplied by x minus x nought.

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:57.703
So this white x here is the variable

00:00:57.703 --> 00:00:59.651
and then x nought is just a constant.

00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:04.111
Now let me go ahead and
make that parentheses there.

00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:07.028
Then we add to that b multiplied by

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:09.775
and then b is just some other constant

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:11.423
just like a is some other constant

00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:13.756
multiplied by y minus y nought

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:18.419
and then all of that you add z nought.

00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:21.295
And now if you were just
presented this as it is

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:22.291
it's kind of a lot right,

00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:24.267
there's five different constants going on.

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:26.055
But really what this is saying is

00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:29.163
you want something where
the partial derivative

00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:31.139
with respect to x is just some constant

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:33.715
and you want to be able to
specify what that constant is.

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:35.398
And similarly, the partial derivative

00:01:35.398 --> 00:01:37.225
with respect to y is another constant.

00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:38.713
And you just want to ensure that this

00:01:38.713 --> 00:01:41.361
passes through this point
x nought, y nought, z nought.

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:44.585
And if you imagine plugging in
x the variable equals x nought

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:46.745
the constant this part goes to zero.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:48.697
Similarly plugging in y nought the constant

00:01:48.697 --> 00:01:50.181
makes this part go to zero.

00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:52.017
So this is a way of
specifying that when you

00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:55.361
evaluate the function x
nought y nought equals z nought,

00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:57.313
and that's what makes sure that the graph

00:01:57.313 --> 00:01:58.937
passes through that point.

00:01:58.937 --> 00:02:01.097
So with that said let's
start thinking about

00:02:01.097 --> 00:02:03.905
how you can find the
tangent plane to a graph.

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:06.437
And first of all let's think
about what that point is,

00:02:06.437 --> 00:02:08.433
how you specify such a point.

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:11.125
Instead of specifying any
three numbers in space,

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:12.521
because you have to make sure the point

00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:13.961
is somewhere on the graph,

00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:15.633
you instead only specify two.

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:18.161
You're basically gonna say
what's the x coordinate

00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:21.065
and in this case let's say
the x coordinate was one,

00:02:21.065 --> 00:02:23.433
and then the y coordinate which

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:25.173
looks about like negative two.

00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:28.265
To make it easier I'm just
gonna say it is negative two.

00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:29.797
Then the z coordinate is specified

00:02:29.797 --> 00:02:31.097
because this is a graph.

00:02:31.097 --> 00:02:33.837
Z coordinate is forced
to be whatever the output

00:02:33.837 --> 00:02:36.669
of the function is at one negative two.

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.245
So this is gonna be whatever
the output of our function is

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:40.912
at one negative two.

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.101
And f here, f is going to be whatever

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:45.725
function gives us this graph.

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:48.533
So maybe I should write
down the actual function

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:50.089
that I'm using for this graph.

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:54.089
In this case f which is
a function of x and y

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.319
is equal to three minus one third

00:02:59.821 --> 00:03:03.257
of x squared minus y squared.

00:03:03.257 --> 00:03:05.253
So this is the function that we're using

00:03:05.253 --> 00:03:06.761
and you evaluate it at that point

00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.337
and this will give you your
point in three dimensional space

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:10.965
that our linear function,

00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:13.589
that our tangent plane
has to pass through.

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:15.445
So we can start writing
out our linear function.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:18.117
We can say okay so our linear function

00:03:18.117 --> 00:03:20.138
has a function of x and y.

00:03:20.138 --> 00:03:21.735
It's gotta make sure it goes through

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:22.856
that one and that negative two,

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:24.493
so this is gonna be some constant a

00:03:24.493 --> 00:03:25.957
that we'll fill in in a moment,

00:03:25.957 --> 00:03:28.533
multiplied by x minus that one,

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:32.993
plus and then b also a constant
we'll specify in a moment,

00:03:32.993 --> 00:03:35.466
times y minus that negative two,

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:37.799
so it's minus a negative two

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.318
and then the thing that we add to it

00:03:41.318 --> 00:03:43.686
is f of one negative two.

00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:45.310
Now let's just go ahead and evaluate that.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.054
Let's say we plug in one to negative two.

00:03:47.054 --> 00:03:51.221
So if we go up here and we plug
in three minus one third of

00:03:54.554 --> 00:03:56.714
if x equals one, one third of one squared,

00:03:56.714 --> 00:03:58.850
so that's one third one squared,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.262
and then y is negative two.

00:04:01.262 --> 00:04:04.929
So that would be minus
negative two squared.

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:09.195
So that's three minus a third minus four

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.874
so the whole thing is equal to

00:04:12.874 --> 00:04:15.614
three minus four is negative
one minus another third

00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:17.614
is negative four thirds.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.254
So that's what we add
to this entire thing.

00:04:21.254 --> 00:04:23.504
We add negative four thirds

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.458
or maybe I should just kind of

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:28.802
make clear the separation here.

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:31.730
So this is our function but we
don't know what a and b are.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.818
Those are things that we need to plug in.

00:04:33.818 --> 00:04:35.814
Now the whole idea of the tangent plane

00:04:35.814 --> 00:04:38.554
is that the partial
derivative with respect to x

00:04:38.554 --> 00:04:41.038
should match that of
the original function.

00:04:41.038 --> 00:04:42.410
So if we go over to the graph here

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.754
and start thinking about
partial derivative information.

00:04:44.754 --> 00:04:47.446
If we want the partial
derivative with respect to x

00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:50.234
then you imagine moving purely
in the x direction here.

00:04:50.234 --> 00:04:54.114
This intersects the graph
along some kind of curve

00:04:54.114 --> 00:04:56.134
and what the partial
derivative with respect to x

00:04:56.134 --> 00:05:00.301
at this point tells you, is
the slope of the tangent line,

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.020
in that direction of that point.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.320
So that's what the partial
derivative with respect to x

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.804
is telling you and what
you want when you look

00:05:12.804 --> 00:05:15.984
at the tangent plane is
that the tangent plane

00:05:15.984 --> 00:05:17.772
also has that same slope.

00:05:17.772 --> 00:05:19.144
If I lined things up here,

00:05:19.144 --> 00:05:21.580
you'd want it also to
have that same slope.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.436
So you can specify over here and say a.

00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:28.012
You want a to be equal
to the partial derivative

00:05:28.012 --> 00:05:30.916
of the function with respect to x

00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:33.816
evaluated at this one negative two.

00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:38.027
Evaluated at that special
point, one negative two.

00:05:38.027 --> 00:05:42.027
And similarly b for pretty
much the same reasons

00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:47.553
and I'll draw it out here
so let's erase this line.

00:05:49.722 --> 00:05:53.506
So instead of intersecting
it with that slice

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:56.038
let's see what movement in
the y direction looks like.

00:05:56.038 --> 00:05:58.362
So in this case it looks
like a very steep slope right

00:05:58.362 --> 00:06:01.589
because in this case the
tangent line in that direction

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:05.349
is a pretty steep slope
and now when we bring in

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.229
the tangent plane it
should intersect with that

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.709
constant x value plane
along that same slope.

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:15.149
Made it kind of messy there

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:18.145
but you can see the line formed

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:20.001
by intersecting these two planes

00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:22.185
should be that desired tangent,

00:06:22.185 --> 00:06:23.997
and what that corresponds to in formulas

00:06:23.997 --> 00:06:27.665
is that this b which represents
the partial derivative of l,

00:06:27.665 --> 00:06:30.449
l is the tangent plane function,

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.933
that should be the same as if
we took the partial derivative

00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:37.137
of f with respect to y at that point,

00:06:37.137 --> 00:06:39.809
at this point one negative two.

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:41.897
And this is stuff that we can compute

00:06:41.897 --> 00:06:43.061
and that we can figure out.

00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:45.405
So let's start plugging that in.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.799
First let me just copy this function

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:49.132
because we're gonna need it.

00:06:55.295 --> 00:06:57.462
Now let's go on down here.

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:01.475
I'm just gonna, let's paste it down here

00:07:01.475 --> 00:07:03.423
in the bottom because
that's what we'll need.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.071
So let's compute the
partial derivative of f

00:07:05.071 --> 00:07:06.723
with respect to x.

00:07:06.723 --> 00:07:09.415
So we look down here, the
only place where x shows up

00:07:09.415 --> 00:07:12.991
is in this negative one
third of x squared context

00:07:12.991 --> 00:07:16.379
so the partial derivative
of f with respect to x

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:19.027
is gonna be just the
derivative of this little guy

00:07:19.027 --> 00:07:20.955
which is negative, we bring down the two,

00:07:20.955 --> 00:07:23.038
negative two thirds of x.

00:07:25.087 --> 00:07:28.339
So when we go ahead and
plug in x equals one

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:31.171
to see what it looks like
when we evaluate at this point

00:07:31.171 --> 00:07:35.327
that's just gonna be equal
to negative two thirds.

00:07:35.327 --> 00:07:36.675
So that tells us that a is gonna

00:07:36.675 --> 00:07:38.531
have to be negative two thirds.

00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:39.415
Now for similar reasons,

00:07:39.415 --> 00:07:41.343
let's go ahead and compute the

00:07:41.343 --> 00:07:43.711
partial derivative with respect to y.

00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:46.011
We look down here, the
only place that y shows up

00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:49.051
in the entire expression
is this negative y squared.

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:53.555
So the partial derivative
of f with respect to y

00:07:53.555 --> 00:07:57.138
is equal to negative
two y, negative two y.

00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:01.170
And now when we plug in
y equals negative two

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.494
what we get is negative two
multiplied coincidentally

00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:06.612
by negative two, didn't
have to be the case

00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:10.541
that those were the same, and
that whole thing equals four.

00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:14.469
So the partial derivative
of f with respect to y

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:16.033
evaluated at this point one negative two

00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:17.357
is equal to four.

00:08:17.357 --> 00:08:18.865
So if we were to plug
this information back up

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:20.653
into our formula we would replace

00:08:20.653 --> 00:08:22.257
a with negative two thirds.

00:08:22.257 --> 00:08:24.650
It would say negative two thirds.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:29.293
And we would replace b with
four, replace b with four.

00:08:29.293 --> 00:08:33.221
And that would give us the full formula,

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.580
the full formula for the tangent plane.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.232
And this can be kind of
a lot to look at at first

00:08:38.232 --> 00:08:42.248
because we have to specify the
input point one negative two.

00:08:42.248 --> 00:08:43.456
And then we had to figure out where

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:45.544
the function evaluates at that point.

00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:46.984
And then we had to figure out both of the

00:08:46.984 --> 00:08:50.328
partial derivatives with respect
to x and with respect to y.

00:08:50.328 --> 00:08:51.976
But all in all, there's not actually

00:08:51.976 --> 00:08:54.672
a lot to remember from how
you go about computing this.

00:08:54.672 --> 00:08:55.808
Looking at the graph actually makes

00:08:55.808 --> 00:08:57.620
things seem a lot more reasonable

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.896
because each of those terms
has an actual meaning.

00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:03.168
If we look at the one and negative two,

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:04.632
that's just telling us the input,

00:09:04.632 --> 00:09:06.444
the kind of x and y
coordindates of the input

00:09:06.444 --> 00:09:07.952
and of course we have to evaluate that

00:09:07.952 --> 00:09:10.180
because that tells us the z coordinate

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.548
that will put us on the graph
corresponding to that point

00:09:13.548 --> 00:09:15.872
and then to get a tangent plane

00:09:15.872 --> 00:09:17.079
you just need to specify the two bits of

00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:19.027
partial differential information

00:09:19.027 --> 00:09:20.839
and that will tell you how this graph

00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:22.231
needs to be oriented,

00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:23.903
and once you start thinking
of things in that way,

00:09:23.903 --> 00:09:26.227
geometrically, even though
there's a lot going on here,

00:09:26.227 --> 00:09:28.291
there's five different
numbers you have to put in,

00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:31.335
each one of them feels like
of course you need that number

00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:33.539
otherwise you couldn't
specify a tangent plane.

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:35.327
There's kind of a lot
of information required

00:09:35.327 --> 00:09:37.883
to put it on the appropriate spot.

00:09:37.883 --> 00:09:39.938
So with that I will see you next video.
