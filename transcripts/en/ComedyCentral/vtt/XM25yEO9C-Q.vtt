[mimics gun cocking]

There are seven security guards

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:17.016
And I go, "Wow, wow,
who's the asshole now?

Who's the asshole now?"

I'm your host, Roy Wood Jr.

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:28.161
We all have that special woman
in our life,

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.196
the one we like to put up
on a pedestal.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.697

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.066 align:start position:0%
- Aw, thank you, Mom.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.101

- This lady I'm bringing
to the stage,

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.635
it is an honor and a pleasure

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.070
to share a microphone with her.

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:12.472
You know her
from her comedy special

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.639
"Bothering Jesus."

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.281
- My mom was turning 65,

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:25.218
and the way my parents
have drank and smoked,

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.087
you know, 65, I thought, "This
could be the last big one."

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.589
So I said--

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.157
I mean, there had been
no indications,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.926
but I don't know,
70 would be a long shot,

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.762
and I said,
"Well, you're turning 65.

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.431
Is there anything
you really want?"

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:41.467
And she said, "Yeah,
I've never left the country,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.669
and I want to go
to Paris and Rome."

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.605
I said, "Well, you and Dad
should do that."

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.307
She goes, "No, no,
your father won't go

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.277
'cause he's still really mad
about the war."

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.347
[laughter]

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:57.116
I go, "But he wasn't even
in a war."

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.352
And she goes,
"No, it was their behavior.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.787
"He's never gonna get over it.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.756
"The Italians went bad,

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.424
"and the French wouldn't do
their part,

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:06.959
and he's not gonna go."

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:09.629
I said, "Are you serious?
Like, he will not?"

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.697
She goes, "No, he won't go."

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.199
I said, "All right, well,
I'll go.

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:14.467
I'll--I'll go with you."

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.801
And I have six siblings.

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:17.703
I go,
"Ask whoever you want,

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:19.639
"and then we'll--
let's get four.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.307
That's fine for this trip."

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.009
So she said, "All right."

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.877
She asked my younger sister,
who's ten years younger

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.712
than me and
diabolically opposite--

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:29.515
blonde hair, blue-eyed,
the happiest human.

00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:31.350
Just a yellow lab
running at you.

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:36.489
Just says, "Hi, hi, hi!

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:37.890
"Hi, it's Tuesday.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:39.325
"Oh, my God,
I'm so lucky on Tuesdays.

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:40.793
I love Tuesdays."

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:43.296
Like, there's--
we have nothing in common

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.664
except we're sisters,

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:46.532
and then she invited
my sister-in-law,

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:48.000
who is a perfect planner.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:49.035
I go, "Great."

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.370
So Amy--
my sister is named Kate.

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:53.005
Yes, we have the same name.

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:56.175
That's a different joke
I won't go into, but...

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.811
Amy the sister-in-law,
that's the one I'm counting on.

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:00.846
Great, 'cause my mom
has a bad knee,

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.315
so she may be walking slowly.

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.150
One of her teeth
is kind of falling out.

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:05.585
We don't know
if it's gonna make it.

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.086
This could be a shitshow,

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.822
but if I have help,
it's gonna be fine.

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:12.858
Well, my mom called before
we left, and she said,

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:14.760
"Oh, your sister-in-law
canceled,

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:17.263
so I invited Daisy."

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:20.333
I go, "Daisy the--
your--your neighbor?"

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.701
She goes, "Yeah, Daisy."

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.569
I go, "How old is Daisy?"

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:27.373
She goes, "Well, she's 79,

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:29.208
but she does yoga."

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:31.877
And I go, "So, great.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.779
"If we need something
from the backseat,

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:35.381
"she can reach it.

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:39.452
That'll be fucking great, Mom."

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.053
Well, Daisy's really excited

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:43.289
because she's never left Kansas
or Missouri

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:46.892
so this is gonna be a really
fun thing for Daisy.

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:48.261
And I said, "All right."

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:50.096
You know, it's her birthday.
Fine.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.898
I don't really know Daisy,
but she seems lovely.

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.268
So I have a 79-year-old
and a 65-year-old

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.237
and I have not my sister-in-law
that I wanted.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.276
I have my sister,
who's not really present a lot.

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.244
So we go to Paris,
said she wanted to go

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:06.946
to Paris and Rome.
We get to Paris.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.414
We're gonna go down
the Champs-Elysées,

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:10.049
the most big shopping street.

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:12.918
Everybody's all gung-ho.
I don't really give a shit,

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:14.820
but I'll go along with this.

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:16.922
My sister says,
she walks ahead of us,

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:21.093
and comes back, and there's
two giant Asian people.

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:22.962
They're huge--they're like--

00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:25.164
like, they're like, 7 feet,

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:26.632
5,000 tall.

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:28.734
I've never seen Asian people

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:29.935
this tall,
and they're beautiful.

00:04:29.968 --> 00:04:31.337
They look like models.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.105
And my sister
comes running back.

00:04:33.138 --> 00:04:36.809
She goes, "That man just asked
to kiss me."

00:04:36.842 --> 00:04:39.245
I go, "What?"
She goes, "I swear to God.

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:41.781
Walk by him
He'll go 'Kiss me.'"

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:44.650
I said, "This is fucking"--

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:46.852
I go, "Okay, I just want to see
if it will happen."

00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:49.288
So I walk by him, and he said,
"Excuse me."

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:52.658
I said, "No, Kate,
he said 'Excuse me.'"

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:55.995
And now--now my mom and the
other--Daisy have caught up,

00:04:56.028 --> 00:04:57.797
and these two Asian people--

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.498
my sister goes,
"I think they're Japanese."

00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:02.134
I go, "Well, then, they're
the tallest Japanese people

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:04.003
"that have ever walked Earth,

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:05.638
"and we should get a picture
with them

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.306
"and an Instagram video.

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.308
They're not Japanese.
They're Chinese."

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:12.111
And they handed us
a laminated menu,

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:14.213
which I've--
like a Friday's menu

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:17.616
except it had purses on it
from the Louis Vuitton store.

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:19.819
[laughter]

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:21.320
And they were
Chinese nationals

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:22.955
'cause the lady's English
was terrible.

00:05:22.988 --> 00:05:24.323
She goes...
[with Chinese accent]

00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:26.025
"We need you to go
buy the purses

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:27.660
"in the Louis Vuitton.

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:30.129
"We cannot.
Because we are Asian,

00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:34.533
we cannot buy the purses."

00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:37.837
And I go,
"What? What the fuck?"

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.372
This is bullshit.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:44.243
Like, this is a scam.
Like, how dumb are we?

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:47.747
My sister and my mom both go,
"No, Kathleen, she's right

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.215
"because at
the Lake of the Ozarks

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.083
"in Missouri
at the outlet mall,

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:53.018
"the Asians were buying
too much stuff

00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:55.721
in the Ralph Lauren store,
so they've banned them."

00:05:55.754 --> 00:05:58.491
So I go, "What?

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:01.861
Are you telling me an Asian
person can't walk in the"--

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:04.497
"Well, not just Asians,
but they started it,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.098
and that's what started it."

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:09.268
And I said, "I don't think
the Lake of the Ozark

00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:14.874
"outlet mall in Missouri rules
apply to the Champs-Elysées.

"We are in Paris.

We are--what is the matter
with you people?"

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:22.548
And my sister goes, "This is

00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:24.683
"always your problem.
You're so cynical,

00:06:24.716 --> 00:06:27.186
"and you're mean, and you--

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:29.622
"you didn't go to
Catholic school long enough.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:30.890
"You don't have a heart.

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:32.258
"You're not doing
the right thing.

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:33.926
"These people
are being punished

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:36.595
because they're Asians.
We should do it."

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:38.431
[laughter]

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.566
I said, "How are we
going to buy the purses?"

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:42.435
The lady goes, "Oh, I have
the money."

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:46.405
And she opens a bag,
and there's $10,000

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:48.073
in the bag, cash.

00:06:48.106 --> 00:06:52.077
I go, "Okay, guys, this
ain't enough to show you

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.713
"that there's something
very wrong?

00:06:54.746 --> 00:06:57.716
I'm just saying."

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:01.253
I said, "I also don't think,
just for the record,

00:07:01.286 --> 00:07:05.157
that we look like we belong
in the Louis Vuitton store."

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.660
And my--my sister goes,

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:10.296
"Why? Why don't we look
like we belong in the Louis"--

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:12.598
I go, "Well, we could start
with the fact

00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:16.268
"that Daisy's sweatshirt says
'I love dachshunds.'

00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:21.240
I don't--
I don't think that..."

00:07:21.273 --> 00:07:24.310
[laughter]

00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:28.180
I said, "Have you guys
ever been in one?

00:07:28.213 --> 00:07:30.282
"It's gonna be a purse museum.

00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:32.117
"There's gonna be five purses
under glass,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.786
"and we don't look appropriate.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:34.954
"That's an aside.

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:36.121
This is a scam."

00:07:36.154 --> 00:07:39.625
"No, no, you're an asshole.

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:42.795
You're mean."

00:07:42.828 --> 00:07:43.996
I said, "Fine."

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:47.533
I go, "Okay, Chinese people,

00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:49.034
what are we supposed to do?"

00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:50.803
Because clearly
I've been outvoted,

00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:52.104
and we're gonna do it.

00:07:52.137 --> 00:07:54.974
We're gonna do--
we're gonna do

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:57.643
whatever the fuck is--
and the lady goes...

00:07:57.676 --> 00:08:00.312
[in Chinese accent]
"Oh, we gonna give you $10,000.

00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:02.515
You buy"--and she points
to four purses.

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:05.551
One--the one that caused
the most trouble

00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:07.152
was called the Papillon.

00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:09.321
I wanted to put a picture of it
up tonight,

00:08:09.354 --> 00:08:13.826
but Cheetahs doesn't have good
AV equipment.

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:15.361
But you can Google it.

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:18.330
Just Google
"Louis Vuitton Papillon purse."

00:08:18.363 --> 00:08:22.001
It's a cylinder-type
little bag.

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:23.068
And I said, "Okay."
So we walked in

00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:24.570
the Louis Vuitton store.

00:08:24.603 --> 00:08:27.506
Clearly none of us look like
we belong there.

00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:30.075
There's about eight purses
under glass

00:08:30.108 --> 00:08:32.578
like they're museum pieces,
and my mom,

00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:34.980
when she can't speak
the language of wherever

00:08:35.013 --> 00:08:38.350
she is, chooses to speak
English with flair

00:08:38.383 --> 00:08:41.654
of the accent of those people.

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.822
[laughter]

00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:46.525
So she walked up
to the counter.

00:08:46.558 --> 00:08:48.928
'Cause I said, "Who's gonna--
who's gonna commit the crime?

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:51.063
"I'm just curious.
Who--who's gonna--

00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:52.932
"who's gonna let this go down?

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:55.200
"Because I'm not touching
the money,

00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:57.770
"and I'm not touching
this Chinese lady's purse.

00:08:57.803 --> 00:09:00.172
I'm not doing shit."

00:09:00.205 --> 00:09:02.041
My mom goes, "Well, I want
to buy the purse."

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:04.043
I go, "What if the money
is counterfeit?

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:06.412
Has anybody thought
about that?"

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.080
And my sister goes,
"Well, who cares?

00:09:08.113 --> 00:09:09.281
"I just want to go
in a Louis Vuitton store

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:11.216
"and spend $10,000, Kathleen.

00:09:11.249 --> 00:09:13.953
That's the fun of it.
Don't you see the fun of it?"

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:17.890
And I go, "No, I don't.
I don't. I don't.

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:19.124
"I don't see any fun.

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:20.693
"This is our afternoon,

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.895
"and we're bargaining
with people about purses

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:24.563
on a laminated menu?"

00:09:24.596 --> 00:09:26.632
No. No.

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:27.933
But I'm an asshole.

00:09:27.966 --> 00:09:29.468
I know,
that's been established.

00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:32.237
But asshole--
I'm gonna go along with it.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.039
So my mom walks up
to the counter

00:09:34.072 --> 00:09:37.409
and points at the first one
that the lady told us to buy,

00:09:37.442 --> 00:09:39.745
'cause they're all $2,500
according to the lady,

00:09:39.778 --> 00:09:40.913
so we have $10,000.

00:09:40.946 --> 00:09:42.081
We can afford four purses.

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:43.749
My mom points at the glass

00:09:43.782 --> 00:09:45.818
and looks at this super
beautiful French woman.

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:47.319
She goes...

00:09:47.352 --> 00:09:49.054
[with French accent]
"I would like to buy..."

00:09:49.087 --> 00:09:50.723
[laughter]

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:54.426
I'm like, "Oh, my God,

00:09:54.459 --> 00:09:58.130
you did not just
say that like that."

00:09:58.163 --> 00:09:59.632
And she goes,
"Shut up, Kathleen.

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:02.434
"Shut up, you're cynical.

00:10:02.467 --> 00:10:05.504
[with French accent]
"I would like to buy

00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:07.640
one Papillon."

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:09.441
[laughter]

00:10:09.474 --> 00:10:12.578
So the French lady--
I couldn't believe--

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:15.648
I thought, "Do we get that one,
or is there more in back?"

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.282
Like, I don't even
know how this works.

00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:19.985
The lady pulls
this sacred purse out

00:10:20.018 --> 00:10:21.654
and puts it on the thing
and says,

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:24.957
[with French accent]
"I will need $2,500 from you."

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.659
My mom whips out the cash.

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.327
Like, it's in bunch--
just cash,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.162
like we're the biggest rednecks
on Earth.

00:10:30.195 --> 00:10:32.631
We just walk in with cash
in sacks

00:10:32.664 --> 00:10:35.267
that say "I love Paris,"
like, whatever.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.269
She puts it down.
I immediately hear...

00:10:37.302 --> 00:10:39.104
[mimics gun cocking]

00:10:39.137 --> 00:10:43.175
There are seven security guards
in black with machine guns.

00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:46.812
And I go, "Wow, wow,
who's the asshole now?"

00:10:46.845 --> 00:10:48.180
[laughter]

00:10:48.213 --> 00:10:50.049
"Who's the asshole now?"

00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:52.718
[applause]

00:10:52.751 --> 00:10:54.186
I can't stop laughing.

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:55.654
My mom goes, "Don't you
laugh at this!

00:10:55.687 --> 00:10:57.823
This is serious!"
I go, "Oh, I know.

00:10:57.856 --> 00:11:01.527
"I know, I said it was serious
45 minutes ago

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.963
"on the street when I wanted
to have a beer at a café.

00:11:04.996 --> 00:11:10.169
We've been looped into this
caper of enormous proportions."

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:13.172
She goes,
"I--this is not my money."

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:14.406
"You will follow us."

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:16.175
And they take us to a room.

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:19.011
I go, "Bullshit."
I go, "They're not even cops."

00:11:19.044 --> 00:11:21.013
What the fuck--wait, what have
we done that's illegal?

00:11:21.046 --> 00:11:23.515
My dad is--was a lawyer
and a judge his whole life.

00:11:23.548 --> 00:11:25.250
All I heard my whole life
was, say,

00:11:25.283 --> 00:11:26.418
"Are we under arrest?"

00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:28.020
And if you're not, shut up.

00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:29.521
And then the other thing
you say is,

00:11:29.554 --> 00:11:32.024
"I do not recall,"
and "I need an attorney."

00:11:32.057 --> 00:11:34.560
I said, "Now, listen.

00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:36.695
"Listen.

00:11:36.728 --> 00:11:39.031
"Mom, Kate--not Daisy.

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:41.166
"She's from Kansas.
She's excused.

00:11:41.199 --> 00:11:43.102
"But you two have lived
a lifetime

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:44.570
"with a lawyer and a judge.

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:47.673
We are not under arrest.
This is bullshit."

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:50.442
"Well, do you--you are gonna
do what they say, Kathleen.

00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:52.044
"We are gonna follow
these people.

00:11:52.077 --> 00:11:53.545
We are in a lot of trouble."

00:11:53.578 --> 00:11:54.947
"Okay, great."

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.216
So we go in the conference room
or wherever--

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:59.518
we're taken to, like,
a mini jail type thing

00:11:59.551 --> 00:12:01.053
in the Louis Vuitton store.

00:12:01.086 --> 00:12:02.621
They have their own jail.

00:12:02.654 --> 00:12:04.890
And...

00:12:04.923 --> 00:12:06.458
they're rambling on,

00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:08.393
and my mom said,
"Tell them we're not criminals.

00:12:08.426 --> 00:12:09.728
"You took seven years
of French.

00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:11.230
Speak to them."

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.065
I go, "I did take seven years
of French,

00:12:13.098 --> 00:12:14.566
"and here's all I can say:

00:12:14.599 --> 00:12:16.769
"'Do you have a beer
in your library?'

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:19.438
That's all I can say."

00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:21.573
And I can only speak
in the past tense

00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:23.075
'cause I didn't understand
the present

00:12:23.108 --> 00:12:24.610
or the futuristic tense.

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:29.214
So whatever I say
had to have already happened

00:12:29.247 --> 00:12:31.784
or it's not gonna make
any sense.

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:34.854
[laughter]

00:12:36.588 --> 00:12:39.892
These fake cops,
security people--

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.093
it's Louis Vuitton security.

00:12:41.126 --> 00:12:42.761
This is why I'm so offended.

00:12:42.794 --> 00:12:44.263
Like, why--why am I--

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:45.464
why are we getting busted?

00:12:45.497 --> 00:12:48.167
You clearly know what we did,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.602
and you're, you know,
pissed off at us.

00:12:50.635 --> 00:12:52.437
Well, you know,
go out on the street

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.140
and get your Chinese people
you're so angry with.

00:12:55.173 --> 00:12:58.777
They said,
"That's the Chinese mafia,

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.413
and what they do is
they look for idiots."

00:13:01.446 --> 00:13:04.950
Clearly us four

00:13:04.983 --> 00:13:06.285
that look semi-nice,

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:08.287
so Midwest-y,
American, dumb.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.855
We fit the mold.

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:13.258
"Then they have
the purses that they chose,

00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:16.595
"or the spring premiere
debut bags.

00:13:16.628 --> 00:13:18.630
"They take 'em back to China.

00:13:18.663 --> 00:13:20.966
"They mass produce them for
the super rich Chinese people,

00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:23.468
and then they mass produce
for everyone else."

00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:25.871
So Louis Vuitton is
very angry about this.

00:13:25.904 --> 00:13:29.441
And they said, "We're gonna
need you ladies to take

00:13:29.474 --> 00:13:31.877
"that money back to
the Chinese people

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.380
"on the street so we can
identify them, and then

00:13:35.413 --> 00:13:37.382
we will follow them
and we will arrest them."

00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:40.319
I go, "I bet you do need us
to do that,

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:41.887
"but what we do we get?

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.960
"Like, a purse or...?
Like, I don't get--

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:50.462
"why am I part of your sting?
This is bullshit.

00:13:50.495 --> 00:13:52.965
"I could walk out of here
with this money

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.366
"and give it back

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:56.134
"and have nothing to do
with you people.

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:57.669
"Like, I don't understand why

00:13:57.702 --> 00:14:00.239
"you're gonna have
a 79-year-old from Kansas,

00:14:00.272 --> 00:14:02.374
"a 65-year-old with no knee,

00:14:02.407 --> 00:14:04.076
and we're part
of your goddamn sting."

00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:08.247
I said, "We're also returning
without the purses,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.750
"so what if the Chinese people
get pissed

00:14:11.783 --> 00:14:13.886
"and say,
you didn't do the agreement

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:15.487
"that I never agreed to

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.522
but these three wackadoodles
are all in on?"

00:14:17.555 --> 00:14:21.059
And they said, "No, you will
not be in any danger."

00:14:21.092 --> 00:14:23.929
I said, "Well, I don't know
that I trust that."

00:14:23.962 --> 00:14:26.932
But then my mom goes, "No,
we're gonna do what they say.

00:14:26.965 --> 00:14:29.534
I'm petrified, and we're gonna
do what they say."

00:14:29.567 --> 00:14:32.170
Fine, so we walk back out
on the street,

00:14:32.203 --> 00:14:34.940
and there's
our Chinese friends.

00:14:34.973 --> 00:14:37.910
And we walk down, and we hand
them the money.

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:40.579
Now, I'm expecting police,

00:14:40.612 --> 00:14:42.714
or something's going to happen.

00:14:42.747 --> 00:14:45.584
And my mom--
my mom decides to lecture 'em.

00:14:45.617 --> 00:14:50.022
"What you did was wrong.
You wrong, wrong."

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:52.925
And then she throws her Asian
accent in, which is appalling.

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.894
[with Asian accent]
"You lied to us.

00:14:55.927 --> 00:15:00.899
You lied to us.
Bad, bad, bad."

00:15:00.932 --> 00:15:02.567
[laughter]

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.372
I said, "Stop, stop speaking.
Stop talking.

00:15:07.405 --> 00:15:10.042
This has been
a horrible enough day."

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:12.811
So we walked away,
and then my mom goes,

00:15:12.844 --> 00:15:14.579
"They were very angry
at what I said,

00:15:14.612 --> 00:15:16.248
"and we didn't get
their purses,

00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:20.118
and now I'm afraid the whole
mafia knows about us."

00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:22.421
But she--I could tell,
she can get really,

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:23.922
weirdly upset,

00:15:23.955 --> 00:15:27.326
and she said, "I don't
feel safe here anymore."

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:32.564
I said, "Safe meaning, like,
the Champs-Elysées, or Paris?"

00:15:32.597 --> 00:15:36.134
"France. I don't feel safe here
anymore, Kathleen.

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:37.602
"I'm not leaving the hotel room

00:15:37.635 --> 00:15:39.237
"unless your father
comes over here,

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.939
"which we know he won't,

00:15:40.972 --> 00:15:43.241
or we need to leave."

00:15:43.274 --> 00:15:45.610
And I go, "You're serious.
Like, we're gonna"--

00:15:45.643 --> 00:15:47.112
"Yeah, let's go to Italy
right now--

00:15:47.145 --> 00:15:48.780
change the plans."

00:15:48.813 --> 00:15:50.615
I said fine, 'cause I'm not
gonna put up with this.

00:15:50.648 --> 00:15:52.451
It's too much.
It's crazy.

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:53.752
So we go to Rome.

00:15:53.785 --> 00:15:55.420
She wants to go to the Vatican.

00:15:55.453 --> 00:15:57.522
There's a big square
somewhere in Rome.

00:15:57.555 --> 00:16:00.792
It's getting dark,
and there's a man selling

00:16:00.825 --> 00:16:04.463
all the knock-off purses
of the Louis Vuitton bags,

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:07.632
and she goes, "You know, after
everything we've been through,

00:16:07.665 --> 00:16:10.435
I think, for my birthday,
I want that bag."

00:16:10.468 --> 00:16:13.138
[laughter]

00:16:13.171 --> 00:16:15.974
I said, "Then you go get it.
You go ask him how much."

00:16:16.007 --> 00:16:17.442
She walks over.
She walks back.

00:16:17.475 --> 00:16:19.611
She goes,
"No, he wanted $60.

00:16:19.644 --> 00:16:22.447
"I'm not paying $60.
I'm not paying $60--

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.815
I'll pay $25."
I said,

00:16:23.848 --> 00:16:25.484
"Well, you should've
said that."

00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:27.152
She goes, "I don't like
to negotiate."

00:16:27.185 --> 00:16:28.887
So I said, "I'll do it."

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.655
And then I realized
I was running--

00:16:30.688 --> 00:16:32.324
I couldn't find him.
He had gone away.

00:16:32.357 --> 00:16:33.892
And I'm looking for this man,

00:16:33.925 --> 00:16:36.328
and I'm waving money,
running down an alley,

00:16:36.361 --> 00:16:38.730
thinking, at the moment,
how dumb am I?

00:16:38.763 --> 00:16:41.166
I'm literally screaming,
I have money,

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:45.504
I have money, and I'm alone
in an alley in Italy.

00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:47.072
Like...

00:16:47.105 --> 00:16:48.840
But I found him.

00:16:48.873 --> 00:16:51.376
And I said, "Look, I can--
I will only give you $25."

00:16:51.409 --> 00:16:53.378
He goes, "$40."
I said, "Fine, sold."

00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:55.080
She'll never know.
And I took it--

00:16:55.113 --> 00:16:59.651
I took it back, and I go
"Happy fucking birthday, Mom.

00:16:59.684 --> 00:17:01.186
"This is the hardest
I've worked

00:17:01.219 --> 00:17:03.822
"for any present ever,
and for the record,

00:17:03.855 --> 00:17:05.924
it's not even real."
So...

00:17:05.957 --> 00:17:07.192
[laughter]

00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:08.393
That's the story.

00:17:08.426 --> 00:17:09.661
Thank you guys for hanging out.

00:17:09.694 --> 00:17:10.729
[cheers and applause]

00:17:10.762 --> 00:17:12.965
