00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.980
One way of shaping traffic is with what's called a Leaky Bucket Traffic

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.120
Shaper. Where each flow has its own bucket. In a Leaky Bucket

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.129
Traffic Shaper, data arrives in a bucket of size

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.560
beta. And drains from the bucket, at rate rho. The parameter rho

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.600
controls the average rate. Data can arrive faster or slower

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.920
into the bucket. But it can not drain at a rate faster than rho. Therefore, the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.260
maximum average rate that traffic can be sent

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.930
is this smooth rate, rho. The size of the

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.820
bucket controls the maximum burst size that a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.290
sender can send for a particular flow. So

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.790
even though the average rate cannot exceed rho,

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.610
at times, the sender might be able to send

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.770
at a faster rate, as long as the total size of the burst does not exceed

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.220
the size of the bucket. Or does not

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.800
overflow the bucket. The leaky bucket allows flows

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.070
to periodically burst, and the regulator at the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.400
bottom of the leaky bucket ensures that the

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.230
average rate does not exceed the drain rate

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.140
of the bucket. For example, for an audio application,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.510
one might consider setting the size of the

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.710
bucket to be 16 kilobytes. So, packets of

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.220
one kilobyte would then be able to accumulate a burst of up to 16 packets in

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.460
the bucket. The regulator's rate of eight packets per second, however,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.280
would ensure that the audio rate would be smooth to an average

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.110
rate not to exceed 8 kilobytes per second or 64KBps.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.590
Setting a larger bucket size can accommodate a larger burst rate. Setting

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.430
a larger value of rho can accommodate or enable a

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.980
faster packet rate. The leaky bucket traffic shaper was developed in 1986

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.490
and soon to follow was a technique called RT traffic shaping.
