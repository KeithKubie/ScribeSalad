00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hubble will die one day.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.799
Obviously Hubble the person is already dead, but the Hubble telescope will die one day.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.240
And we have to both be mentally and astronomically prepared.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.240
Something will wear out on Hubble space telescope basically.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.920
Either calibration lamps or ...

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.020
...some of the fuel to change which direction it's pointing in, it will eventually stop working.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.660
We will no longer be able to get images from Hubble.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.580
[Sunrise over the Hubble space telescope...

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.820
...illuminating the golden solar arrays, those arrays to be retracted for the final time a few hours from now.]

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.769
Nasa, ESA,  as a new space telescope, have got a new Hubble in the pipeline.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.589
It's called James Webb Space Telescope and...

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.859
...this is what it looks like. It's infrared not optical, unlike Hubble so it's not really a true follow-up...

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.339
...because Hubble looks in the UV and the optical and an infrared, whereas James Webb will look out the very far...

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.398
...infrared. James Webb will be at the Lagrange 2 point, so I know that Sixty Symbols is done a...

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.200
...Lagrangian video before but basically a Lagrange point is a stable point in a two-body system.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.400
So we have the sun and we have the Earth...

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.220
...going around the sun and basically there are five points in those orbits at which, if you put something...

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.409
...it wouldn't move relative to the Earth and Sun.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.600
So it would stay where it was. So L2 is sort of beyond Earth, away from the Sun. And basically it will have a...

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.520
...365-day year, the same as the Earth, but it will be orbiting further around. It will be...

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.960
...launched in an Ariane 5, which is a really really successful ESA Rocket.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.220
[Allumage EAP, dÃ©collage]

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.240
And then they're gonna give it a little bust. And then they'll get it enough energy to get to L2...

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.420
...but really really slowly. So what they'll do is...

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.760
...is kind of like going up a hill, if you will. So they'll give it enough energy to boost it up the hill...

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.980
...but so much so it will slow down, slow down, slow down,...until it reaches the very top, at which point it will stop.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.980
Just like it was a really good putt?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.600
Yeah! Like a really, really good putt, yeah.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.960
And it'll just sort of stop at the edge and then just fall in.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.980
In that time, the antenna will fold out, so it can talk to Earth. And then the whole thing moves upwards as well...

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.080
...and it's called a spacecraft "bus", they call it.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.300
The whole thing will move up and make room for all of the equipment down below.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.400
The sun shield will all fold out as well.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.873
This is this huge tennis-court sized, five-layer, intricate sun shield.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.740
This, which we call the secondary mirror, ...

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.440
...so as light comes in here, bounces off here, bounces onto the secondary and then...

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.790
...into the center, where it's detected. That will also be up here during launch and will get folded down to the right position.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.630
The mirror itself, so this segmented array, ...

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.100
...will also fold out from being folded up inside the rocket.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.339
So what they've had to do is they had to design the shape of the mirror...

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.970
...so that it is the wrong shape at room temperature...

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.269
...but by the time that it gets to, like, the vacuum of space it will cool and warp to the right shape.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.500
It feels like they've made this too complicated, like they seem, like, they've been too ambitious. Am I wrong?

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.060
I get that feeling as well, but I think it's because I...

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.180
...I'm not an engineer, a space scientist engineer, so I can't...

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.070
...comprehend what is too complicated, you know. Let's leave it for the rocket scientists to tell us...

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.260
...you know, what's too complicated. They have such belief that this will work.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.880
So the astronomical community, you know, has faith in them and says...

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.000
"OK, well, this is what I want to do with it".  There's...

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.900
...a huge long list of things that could go wrong. It could...

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.000
...just blow up being... trying to be launched.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.640
The antenna couldn't even fold out. The sun shields might not deploy properly.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.600
The mirror might not fold out properly, the secondary mirror might not fold out properly, the whole thing might not move up, it might jam.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.080
Like, the cryostat, to cool everything, might not come on.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.860
The electronics might be fried, it might get shook up too much than it might not work.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.600
I mean, it's kind of terrifying trying to list everything that might go wrong, but also exciting.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.040
Because they've had to...

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.560
...think about "how can we stop that from happening?"

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.800
There's about 10...

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.240
...brand new technologies that've gone into the JWST that haven't been tested before.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.080
Everything's already built. You know, everything's being tested repeatedly...

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.880
...at NASA Goddard, which is in the Washington DC area.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.600
They're vibration testing, they are testing the solar shields, how they pull out.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.220
Someone said to me that, the test they've seen, it happened through the day, but it took two weeks for the solar shields to fully...

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.040
...open up, they said it was like watching paint dry. Okay, you'd go for lunch, come back, and they were like they haven't moved at all.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.460
It's going, undergoing, so much rigorous testing to make sure that everything can stand up to the launch and...

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.780
...fold out in the, y'know, the sort of situation that it needs to.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.340
Hubble was optical and UV. It had...

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.260
...stuff that it could specifically do. But it's limited. It can only see so far, and that's because, obviously...

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.260
...if you imagine stars and galaxies are always giving us optical light, ...

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:20.600
...the further away they are the more that light is redshifted and so Hubble can't actually see the very distant galaxies.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.900
Because there's nothing really in the optical...

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.780
...wavelengths that it can see anymore.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.040
So we have to look in the infrared.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.020
I've printed out these to show you... So this is...

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.880
...the optical image of the Eagle Nebula, taken by Hubble. It is my favorite Hubble image, it is beautiful.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.580
It's of a star forming region in the Milky Way. You can see all the dust clouds. It's absolutely beautiful.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.960
On your...right?... yeah, OK...

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.126
...is the infrared image from Hubble as well.

00:05:50.126 --> 00:05:54.700
And although the optical one is more sort of visually spectacular...

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.720
...the infrared one is more scientifically spectacular...

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.220
...because you can see through all the dust and the gas that's in this nebula, and so you can...

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.080
...learn more from the infrared image than you can from the optical.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.080
Obviously, to get enough light from an object you have to stare at it incessantly and...

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.320
...the idea with James Webb is that it's got such a big mirror...

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.060
...(6.5m, as opposed to, you know, Hubble's 2.4)...

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.880
...that you don't have to stare for very long at all. So that, uh... one of the...

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.280
...quotes I remember was that if you took the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is...

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.500
...infrared as well... it did an entire survey of...

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.240
...galaxies, and it took something like 550 hours of observing time...

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.420
...that's just actually staring at the sky, that's not including all the time it takes to repoint the telescope.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.880
If you end up doing the exact same survey again with James Webb, it would take 30 minutes!

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.180
The other thing it's gonna be able to do...

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:02.020
...or people hope it will be able to do, is to detect the first signs of life in our universe...

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.900
...y'know, beyond our own planet, obviously.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.020
I mean, I'm not talking about sort of you know contacting ET or little green men here.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.660
What I'm talking about is...

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.900
...biosignatures.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.640
Y'know, this is the idea that you will be able to detect in that atmosphere, say, water or oxygen or...

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.440
...carbon dioxide.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.040
Something that, we know, on Earth...

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.340
...is a signature that life is here.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.040
The way that they've detected exoplanets in the past is to have...

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.340
...the exoplanet's star here... if you're sort of the Kepler Spacecraft, which is the one that's been detecting exoplanets...

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.340
...and I am the star... then what happens is, you're observing light from me, and you're like "Yep...

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.300
...there's a star there, there's definitely a star there". And then a planet moves across...

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.440
...my face and basically it will produce a tiny little dip...

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.460
....in my brightness.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.260
In which case you'd be like "Oh! A planet there!"

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.460
What they do now is they'll wait for it to transit...

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:03.420
...and they'll wait for the the light from the star to pass through a teeny tiny bit of the atmosphere of that planet...

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.520
...and then they will take that light and split it into its rainbow, into its spectra.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:15.840
They'll take off the light from the star and they'll be left with the absorption spectra of the atmosphere of that planet.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.600
Even if we were very confident that we had detected signs of life in an atmosphere...

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:29.920
...and we said "OK, this is definitely, sort of, like Earth"... the most Earth-like we could possibly ever find.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:37.780
Say it's a star exactly like the sun, and it's at Earth's size and at Earth's, y'know, radius planet and everything...

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.380
...and it's got ozone, and it's got hydrogene, it's got CO2, everything...

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.540
...it might be 10,000 light years away.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.180
And if we were ever gonna have a conversation with these people...

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.180
... I call them people... with this life...

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.060
...if they were intelligent life...

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:59.420
...it would take us 10.000 years to send a signal and for them to receive it, and 10.000 years to come back.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.200
So it would be a 20-thousand-year wait for the other side of the conversation.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.120
In the paper, there's, you know, the most Earth-like planet every six months.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:15.180
And that'd be the most Earth-like from its mass or from its radius or from the distance it orbits around its star...

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:15.590
I that'll be the most earth-like from its mass or from its radius or from the distance it orbits around its star or the fact

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.860
...or for the fact that the star is the same as the sun.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.880
We've never really found one that fits all of those...

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.720
...criteria at once. It's pretty scary because it won't launch till October 2018...

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.100
...but they already have science proposals in. If you want to do something very specific...

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.780
...that's your science, the call for proposals is November, this year!

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.480
So everybody is already starting to think...

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.460
"What will I do? How will I observe this? How long will it take me?"...

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.900
...'cause you have to put all that in the proposal before someone decides "Yes or no, you don't get time"...

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.640
...before it's even launched.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:57.040
Before it's even gone to the launch site, like, it won't even be in French Guiana before people put in...

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.140
...telescope proposals.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.140
I bet those people are going to be nervous when they'll launch it, too?

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:07.720
Yes! Definitely! If your, sort of, scientific career future prospects of...

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.040
...you know, depend on you getting the James Webb Space Telescope time, ...

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.860
...you need that thing to work.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.800
...portion of the spectrum.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:21.460
We feel right now that there's probably no real science that we can do with the wide-field camera at this time.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.380
And I'll stop there.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.660
The thing about Hubble is that it was launched into low Earth orbit and...

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:36.040
...it was always intended that it would be visited by astronauts. And so a few years later one of five...
