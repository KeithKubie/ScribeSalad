00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Everyday

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.240
I just learned a lot about a really cool gym here in Dallas. More about that later

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.540
But for now I'm going to get a ride from Kenny right?

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.040
Oh yeah!

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.240
And what's magical about you riding me somewhere?

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.600
I drive with no feet.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.120
And one arm

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.980
-That's pretty impressive
-There's two just one's plastic

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.400
So you can operate all the controls

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.640
Everything. I've got a different hand I can use when I drive.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.900
Please say it interfaces with a stick shift or something.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.860
No no no it doesn't do that.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.660
Boy that's pretty crazy right there.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.360
So you can operate.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.640
-Everything on the truck

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.820
On that monster truck right there. And that's your truck.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.600
Yep and that's my truck.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.920
Okay so I've got, this isn't a joke. I have to go an hour away and you're going to drive me an hour away.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.640
Yup

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.660
Okay. Cool let's get in the truck.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.320
Show me how you do it man, how you get in.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.760
Good thing is I can put things on the floor board cause I don't step on it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.680
And I just hook my crane up.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.520
How do you not hit your truck here?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.020
Magic.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.060
Oh! oh man.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.560
I hit it sometimes.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.820
Do ya?

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.660
Oh man I was really concerned. It's such nice truck.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.280
That's pretty rad dude.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.160
So it's slow for a reason. That's just a linear actuator lifting it up there.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.680
Yeah.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.500
-And does it just hang onto it now?
- Yep.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.640
This one just raises me up.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.520
Oh that's cool.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.480
Do my sexy pose. It gets sexier as I go up.
-Which is what?

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.560
-Just leaning back as I go up like this.
-Just so people know, "I still got it."

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.340
So the lift isn't just on your truck to make it look like a big truck it's to hide that compartment.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.280
Yeah it's an actual. I put the lift on the truck because I bottomed out on that box and that thing cost like $8000.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.640
Oh my goodness.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.340
So it not something I want to break regularly

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.180
Got it!

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.980
I've got a different hand I use when I drive.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.600
And so you just clamp it down?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.100
Yep.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.580
You just rotate this. So you got your seatbelt on.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:55.240
And I just wrench it down because when I used to use just the motor... I was in traffic in San Antonio

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.200
and my hand slipped off. It came off the hand controls and that's not cool when you are in traffic.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.760
Right. So what does this do?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.860
This? I push this in. It's connected to the brake.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.700
Okay.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.700
Whenever I pull it. [Engine roars]

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.240
Wait that was two different axes

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.120
Do it one more time. Push. Okay...

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.300
-Brake.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.580
So you rotate?

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.080
This setup; I can actually push down and I can power brake if I wanted to.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.080
OKay, slowly rotate.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.080
Go ahead.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.080
[Engine Revs Up]

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.360
Got ya! There's a mechanical linkage there. Man I want to take your truck apart so bad!

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.780
So that rotation movement....

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.900
I see what's happening. That rotation is going into a translation.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.900
-Yes. 
-That's pretty cool!

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.100
That's amazing.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.100
Alright, let's do this.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.420
So you're gravy once you're locked in?
Oh yeah!

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.300
The funny thing is,  when I got my license I never learned to use these hand controls.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.520
The hand controls I originally had were on my right side.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.160
And I steered with my left hand. Well after getting my license and realizing that

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.360
if I had a wreck and had my left arm attached to the steering wheel and the air bag went off

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.920
I'd be eating a carbon fiber arm...

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.180
and I'd rather not do that.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.800
So I went to the type that I have now, which the first time I ever used them

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.000
Was when I went and picked the truck up after they had put them on.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.360
Really?
So I pulled a little too hard on the gas

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.360
and I did a burn out going backwards.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.140
What do you want people to know about triple amputees driving?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.820
It gives you back your freedom.
Really?

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.560
Like this is just a freedom to me. I used to love-

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.440
When I lived out in California I'd go drive up the Pacific Coast Highway

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.440
This kind of stuff gives you back your independence.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.600
Okay, so there you go. 
That's how to drive with one hand.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600
Is that I get 25% off- No i get 75% off this taxi ride!

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.320
[laughing]

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.300
Ya see I've asked for manicures and they won't give me half off.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.300
That's not right.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.220
Why'd I have to meet you at the gym to come here?

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.720
Because I wanted you to see the place that brought me out of a funk.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.740
Yeah?

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.680
And brought me back the person that I truly am.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.040
What do you mean you were, "in a funk"?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.400
So what? did you start feeling sorry for yourself or something?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400
It's not so much that I felt sorry for myself

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.940
It's just I knew what my body was capable of

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.740
and I was never able to find a place where I could go and workout

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.440
and actually truly get a workout
Because you go to other gyms and

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.980
It's nice. They mean well, but you got people coming up. "Oh you're such an inspiration!"

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.980
So they feel sorry for you.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.820
They felt sorry for me.
But they wouldn't say it right?

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.440
No they're trying to be nice and I don't mind that happening, but I can never truly get a workout

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.920
-As where I go in there it's all about working out.
-Got it.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920
-And making myself better
-Got it

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.760
I want to talk to you about
 this gym that got Kenny out of the funk

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.680
Now I know you just watch this video because you want to see how to drive a car with one hand

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.540
but I think this is really cool

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.520
Former NFL player David Vobora started a gym for elite athletes when he got out

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.360
and then he realized something when he met a guy named Travis Mills

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.160
Quadruple amputee from the wars in Afghanistan

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.180
When they started working 
together something magical happened

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.240
Long story short, David created a
 gym around people that had lost limbs

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.240
or had some kind of complication with their body

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.080
so that they can just totally pound through the things that they think they can't do

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.740
and exceed and excel onto things they can do

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.340
It's really really cool and my buddy
 George told me to visit. So we did!

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.940
This is where?

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.200
This is where we punish cripples

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.200
with the best of intentions.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200
Is this true?

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.520
-Yes.
-Is it?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.180
Alright, so I am here in Dallas and i'm at David's gym

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.500
and this is exactly how you want the world to view your gym, right?

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.960
-Where you punish cripples.
-The Adaptive Training Foundation

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.580
Where we restore hope through movement.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.420
You're doing a specific thing, right?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.120
Yeah it started with athletes and then I started meeting these warriors

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.040
These wounded guys that got hit over there.
Lost limbs, spinal cord injuries

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.440
and I realized, after rehab where do they go?

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.520
Can they go to a normal gym?
Well, maybe wheel themselves around, but

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.080
It's not ideal. They're not able to push it they're not able to compete.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.080
People say, "How did you get into adaptive training?"

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.320
It's no different, right?

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.680
If you're a pro athlete and you have knee surgery we're going to avoid that knee

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.060
while it heal so that we can still get optimization. We still workout.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.940
So a lot of our equipment. For example: Concept Two

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.960
We can attach a quadriplegic hand onto this thing

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.260
He can now do the motion.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.340
Self propelled treadmills because these guys on their prosthetics

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.700
You know their gate training they can't continue to move with a belt that's moving.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.420
They need to be able to supply the force.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.020
-This is the High Trainer?
-This is the High Trainer.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.220
-What does it do?
-We call this "The Come to Jesus Machine"

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.220
because you will whisper the Lord's name.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.700
After doing an interval system on this.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.560
Really great for Travis Mills, quadruple amputee

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.760
-Uh huh.
-He can hold on by his prosthetics hooks here

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.060
and he can whip his legs and get a heart rate that is ridiculous.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.100
This has force plates, left and right. It tells me up to the second how hard Im pushing

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.400
-Woah!
[laughter]

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.400
Bit off more than you can chew

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.520
Yeah! That wasn't on purpose!

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.280
I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.100
I made it for three reasons; Number one

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.780
I wanted to know what it was like to drive with one arm. That was really cool

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.800
Number two: I wanted you to know more about the Adaptive Training Foundation

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.060
It has changed the way I think about people with disabilities.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.460
They don't need my pity.
Kenny said he just want's to be treated like a normal dude

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.600
and so I'm probably going to do that from now on.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.180
and number three: I want to give them money. 
These jokers need more weight.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.620
So if you want to support Smarter Every Day so I can do that

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.880

if you listen to this book, it's going to help you suck it up butter cup

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.780
and realize you can power through and get over yourself

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.520
and just get on with getting on

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.200
Thanks to David Vobora starting here at 
the Adaptive Training Foundation

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.720
I was able to come in, workout, get my life back on track

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.380
