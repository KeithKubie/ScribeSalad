majority rule elections rather than
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.670
majority rule elections rather than
proportional elections and that tends to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
proportional elections and that tends to
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.110
proportional elections and that tends to
leave them to have to sort of competing

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120

well there's one lesson to learn from

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130
well there's one lesson to learn from
 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.450
well there's one lesson to learn from
them and that is that the the two

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
them and that is that the the two
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.510

now and and what they did was they move

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
now and and what they did was they move
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.230
now and and what they did was they move
they they took a much more moderate

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240

within the Labour Party took a much more
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.449
within the Labour Party took a much more
moderate stance and that's what's

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459
moderate stance and that's what's
 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:42.919
moderate stance and that's what's
happening on the Conservative Party a

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929
happening on the Conservative Party a
 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.230
happening on the Conservative Party a
more moderate leadership even within the

more moderate leadership even within the
same range a less extreme in a more

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729

moderate leadership has has softened
some of the edges otherwise it's a

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219
some of the edges otherwise it's a
 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.010
some of the edges otherwise it's a
system in many ways very similar to ours

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
system in many ways very similar to ours
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.760
system in many ways very similar to ours
and the degree of differences are really

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
and the degree of differences are really
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.859
and the degree of differences are really
quite similar between the two parties if

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
quite similar between the two parties if
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.609
quite similar between the two parties if
you go to other systems in which there

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619
you go to other systems in which there
 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.859
you go to other systems in which there
are multiple parties it's odd but it

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
are multiple parties it's odd but it
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.410
are multiple parties it's odd but it
still tends to break down that two

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
still tends to break down that two
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.980
still tends to break down that two
parties generate most of the leadership

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990
parties generate most of the leadership
 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.660
parties generate most of the leadership
of the system even though there are

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670
of the system even though there are
 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.510
of the system even though there are
multiple parties around so for example

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520
multiple parties around so for example
 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.370
multiple parties around so for example
in Israel which has

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380
in Israel which has
 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.070
in Israel which has
election laws that should lead to the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080
election laws that should lead to the
 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.510
election laws that should lead to the
largest number of parties and indeed

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520
largest number of parties and indeed
 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.680
largest number of parties and indeed
there are quite a large number of

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690
there are quite a large number of
 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.070
there are quite a large number of
parties in that system for many years

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080
parties in that system for many years
 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.040
parties in that system for many years
labor and the could were the only source

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050
labor and the could were the only source
 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.860
labor and the could were the only source
of prime ministers leaders of the of the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870
of prime ministers leaders of the of the
 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.470
of prime ministers leaders of the of the
country and they took opposite positions

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480
country and they took opposite positions
 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.660
country and they took opposite positions
and it looked kind of like a two-party

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670
and it looked kind of like a two-party
 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.820
and it looked kind of like a two-party
system embedded in a and a multi-party

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830
system embedded in a and a multi-party
 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.560
system embedded in a and a multi-party
system in which there were many people

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570
system in which there were many people
 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.960
system in which there were many people
had voices in the Knesset there there

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
had voices in the Knesset there there
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.420
had voices in the Knesset there there
Congress but only two were effectively

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
Congress but only two were effectively
 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.380
Congress but only two were effectively
governing the country

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390
 
 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.260
 
not not not easily right and not in the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270
not not not easily right and not in the
 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.330
not not not easily right and not in the
short run the principal so the principal

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340
short run the principal so the principal
 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.949
short run the principal so the principal
problem is that is not it so we had two

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959
problem is that is not it so we had two
 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.690
problem is that is not it so we had two
things that happen one of them was just

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700
things that happen one of them was just
 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.550
things that happen one of them was just
sorting I talked about Southern

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560
sorting I talked about Southern
 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.170
sorting I talked about Southern
Democrats essentially you know in the

Democrats essentially you know in the
 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.240
Democrats essentially you know in the
gained Republican Party in some sense

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250
gained Republican Party in some sense
 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.280
gained Republican Party in some sense
that's just taking you know members of

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290
that's just taking you know members of
 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.570
that's just taking you know members of
Congress who were painted bloom we

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580
Congress who were painted bloom we
 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.690
Congress who were painted bloom we
repainted them red and in New England

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700
repainted them red and in New England
 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.520
repainted them red and in New England
you just did the reverse you know Reggie

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530
you just did the reverse you know Reggie
 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.290
you just did the reverse you know Reggie
painted blue but but and that's just a

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300
painted blue but but and that's just a
 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.820
painted blue but but and that's just a
restoring and that's fine and everything

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830
restoring and that's fine and everything
 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.940
restoring and that's fine and everything
would be you know much easier if that

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950
would be you know much easier if that
 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.470
would be you know much easier if that
was the only thing that happened the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480
was the only thing that happened the
 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.090
was the only thing that happened the
thing that got more problematic was that

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100
thing that got more problematic was that
 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.699
thing that got more problematic was that
it became harder and harder for

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709
it became harder and harder for
 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.070
it became harder and harder for
moderates to win elections and so not

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080
moderates to win elections and so not
 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.340
moderates to win elections and so not
only did you cert people differently in

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350
only did you cert people differently in
 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.160
only did you cert people differently in
two reds and blues but you move them

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170
two reds and blues but you move them
 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.860
two reds and blues but you move them
apart and so you left you let you took

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870
apart and so you left you let you took
 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.110
apart and so you left you let you took
out a range for moderates it's very very

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120
out a range for moderates it's very very
 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.350
out a range for moderates it's very very
few moderates now that's why people are

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360
few moderates now that's why people are
 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.940
few moderates now that's why people are
so focused on for example people like

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950
so focused on for example people like
 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.590
so focused on for example people like
Olympia Snowe she's one of the few you

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600
Olympia Snowe she's one of the few you
 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.420
Olympia Snowe she's one of the few you
know Republicans from the basically

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430
know Republicans from the basically
 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.840
know Republicans from the basically
Democratic era area and thus has the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850
Democratic era area and thus has the
 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.930
Democratic era area and thus has the
kind of appeal that can go you know she

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940
kind of appeal that can go you know she
 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.469
kind of appeal that can go you know she
can win elections as a Republican in

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479
can win elections as a Republican in
 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.719
can win elections as a Republican in
what might otherwise be a Democrat area

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729
what might otherwise be a Democrat area
 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.310
what might otherwise be a Democrat area
because she's one of the few people

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320
because she's one of the few people
 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.990
because she's one of the few people
there in the center and there and

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000
there in the center and there and
 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.159
there in the center and there and
they're just so few of them that's

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169
they're just so few of them that's
 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.870
they're just so few of them that's
that's been the difficult part the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880
that's been the difficult part the
 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.280
that's been the difficult part the
question is how would you how would we

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290
question is how would you how would we
 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.960
