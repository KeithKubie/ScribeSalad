00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.310
To solve this problem, we want to use power divided by root for each of our

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.430
factors. So for x we'll have 7 divided by 3. For y we'll have 5 divided by 3.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.708
And for z we'll have 10 divided by 3. Since 7 divided by 3 is 2 remainder 1,

00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:18.788
we'll have x squared on the outside and x to the 1 on the inside of our cubed

00:00:18.788 --> 00:00:25.325
root. For y, we'll have 1y on the outside and we'll have y squared left on the

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:30.890
inside. And finally for z, we'll have z cubed on the outside, and 1z on the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.500
inside of our cube root. This is our final result. We could have also

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.680
completely expanded this radicand. Once we have all the factors listed out, we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.490
want to find the factors that appear three times. That means we can pull it

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.732
out. Here's a group of three xs. And here's a group of three xs. So we can pull

00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:53.915
out an x and an x. We can also pull out one y, and we can pull out three zs.

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:58.131
These other factors don't appear in a triple, so we leave them inside of our

00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:03.821
cube root. X, y squared, z. And finally, we just rewrite the front part of our

00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:09.673
radical to get x squared y z cubed times the cubed root of xy squared z.
