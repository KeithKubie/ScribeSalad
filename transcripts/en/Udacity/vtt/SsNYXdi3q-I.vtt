00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.420
If you watched the solution video, you would have noticed that I

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.380
used two different methods for transforming our variable. The first method used

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.450
a wrapper right around the variable, and then the second used a

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.130
scaling layer. Let's look at the differences between these two plots and

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.560
see what the two adjustments really do. I'm going to save this first

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.700
plot into log scale and I'm going to save the second plot into

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.660
count scale. I'm going to use each of these variables and pass it

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.950
to grid.arrange, so that way I can plot them side by side, and

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.730
that's why the ncal is equal to two. Running this code,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.680
we can see that we get our two histograms. When looking

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.240
at the two plots, we can see that the difference is

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.742
really in the x axis labeling. Using scale_x_log10 will label the axis

00:00:38.742 --> 00:00:42.750
in actual friend_counts. Whereas using the log10 wrapper will label the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.640
x axis in log units. This is just something to keep

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.380
in mind as you make more plots. In general, I think

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.208
it's easier to think about actual counts, so that's why I prefer

00:00:51.208 --> 00:00:54.020
using the scale_x_log10 as a layer. Now, this does

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.540
mean that you'll need to learn the ggplot syntax, but

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.605
don't worry, you'll have plenty of practice in lesson

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:01.480
four, and if you're feeling really adventurous, you can add

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.780
a layer to any of the plots that you

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.010
create. So, take our original histogram for friend count. Let's

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.319
just add scale_x_log10 to it, and there you go. You

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:13.163
have it, the new histogram transformed using log base 10.
