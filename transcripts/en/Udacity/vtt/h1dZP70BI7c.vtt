00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.090
To round things out, let's have one last quiz on transforming logarithmic

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.700
functions. So here's a graph you've seen before, f of x equals log base 4 of x.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.960
Starting with this function, what function will we get if we did a reflection

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.130
in the y axis? And second, what function will we get if we shifted f of x three

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.419
units to the left?
