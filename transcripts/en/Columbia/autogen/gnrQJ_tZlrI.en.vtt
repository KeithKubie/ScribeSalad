billion of us lived at that density that
 

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.420
billion of us lived at that density that
we would all fit in the state of Texas

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:55.430
we would all fit in the state of Texas
 

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.130
we would all fit in the state of Texas
right so we sort of live in this world

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:58.140
right so we sort of live in this world
 

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.199
right so we sort of live in this world
of a population explosion people talk

00:17:00.199 --> 00:17:00.209
of a population explosion people talk
 

00:17:00.209 --> 00:17:02.180
of a population explosion people talk
about it by 2050 we're supposed to go to

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:02.190
about it by 2050 we're supposed to go to
 

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.790
about it by 2050 we're supposed to go to
9 billion people well that's Texas and a

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:04.800
9 billion people well that's Texas and a
 

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.549
9 billion people well that's Texas and a
little bit of New Mexico right so

00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559
little bit of New Mexico right so
 

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:10.069
little bit of New Mexico right so
liberals have a place to live too but

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079
liberals have a place to live too but
 

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:14.900
liberals have a place to live too but
the point is right that vertical density

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:14.910
the point is right that vertical density
 

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.090
the point is right that vertical density
is the future it is the wave of the

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100
is the future it is the wave of the
 

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.069
is the future it is the wave of the
future is the wave of the future all

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079
future is the wave of the future all
 

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:22.819
future is the wave of the future all
across the planet and as we all look to

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:22.829
across the planet and as we all look to
 

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:24.890

strategic way to live and work we will
 

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.840
strategic way to live and work we will
need more vertical visit density which

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:29.850
need more vertical visit density which
 

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.230
need more vertical visit density which
means we will need more developers write

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240
means we will need more developers write
 

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.240
means we will need more developers write
that fundamentally when you talk about

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:35.250
that fundamentally when you talk about
 

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.919
that fundamentally when you talk about
vertical density you are talking about a

00:17:36.919 --> 00:17:36.929
vertical density you are talking about a
 

00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:38.930
vertical density you are talking about a
professionalization of the industry and

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940
professionalization of the industry and
 

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.790
professionalization of the industry and
if we need more developers and we need

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:40.800
if we need more developers and we need
 

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.650
if we need more developers and we need
smarter developers we need developers

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660
smarter developers we need developers
 

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.910
smarter developers we need developers
