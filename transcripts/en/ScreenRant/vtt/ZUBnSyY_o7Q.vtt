00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.420
Some Superheroes and their powers are integral
to ensuring the world will continue rotating

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.450
while also keeping citizens safe from all
of the supervillains who are always trying

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.809
to stir up some trouble.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.490
These Superheroes usually possess one or a
few effective powers and the ability to utilize

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.040
them in just the right way.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.540
However, not all powers superheroes were given
are equally handy.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.060
With so many heroes and even more powers,
it almost seems unavoidable to have a few

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.610
pointless and often laughable abilities.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.470
Be prepared to be perplexed with 10 Completely
Useless Superhero Powers.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.010
Archery
An aptitude for archery may be enough to beef

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.109
up someone’s application to Harvard or to
impress someone on their first date but for

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.399
a super power, it is a bit of a yawn.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.089
Hawkeye and the Green Arrow share this rather
useless superpower with little else to assist

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.129
them in fighting evil.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.170
Lucky for them, they have friends with much
more impressive superpowers.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.370
Sure, arrows can slow someone down, but is
it really going to do as much damage as almost

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.250
any other weapon- based power?

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.250
Not so much.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.930
Unless these superheroes are planning on entering
The Hunger Games, they should probably let

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.060
the real superheroes do their jobs.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.890
Even as Hunger Games tributes, they may be
less skilled at Archery than Katniss who never

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.060
claims Archery is a superpower, she just happens
to be good at it.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.890
Power Ring
When wearing the ring, the superhero has numerous

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.230
abilities proving to be the most practical
accessory for anyone trying to save the world

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.930
There is a major problem with this superpower,
since the power comes from the ring itself,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.521
it can be attained by anyone who is sneaky
enough to sneak it off the fingers of the

00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:37.570
likes of The Green Lantern and The Wonder
Twins, rendering the heroes useless.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.100
No matter how much can be gained from adorning
any power accessory, the likelihood of losing

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.680
or being separated from it, makes it a bit
of a risky power.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.230
Cryokinesis
There is nothing chilling about contending

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.160
with a superhero with the power of Cryokinesis.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.650
The only ones who know how to use Cryokinese,
the ability to control the cold, effectively

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.990
are the villains.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.910
While Killer Frost freezes her victims with
a kiss and Captain Cold can wreak havoc on

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.500
entire downs paralyzing countless people with
his Icy antics, the heroes seem to only be

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.750
equipped with the less than exciting cryokinesis
powers.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.190
Captain Planet can generate ice but so can
a working freezer.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.840
Aquaman’s unnecessary sidekick, Aqualad
can generate cold energy from his hands but

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.120
so can a lot of grandmothers.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.290
Cryokinesis is a decent superpower for villains
but for superheroes, it is just not cool.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.510
Enhanced Sight:
If enhanced sight seems like an indispensable

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.280
power, try telling that to Daredevil.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.370
Hawkeye has keen eyesight but seems to have
issues with seeing things right in front of

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.370
him.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.750
Wolverine also has enhanced vision, but he
also has superhuman healing and retractable

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.870
bone claws so who cares if he excels reading
an eye chart.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.370
For superheroes with additional powers, exceptional
vision will not increase their odds of defeating

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.370
their enemies.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.680
Enhanced sight is mostly useless because there
is rarely an instance where it is an essential

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.880
resource that could not easily be replaced
with a pair of good quality binoculars.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.980
Chlorokinesis:
Chlorokinesis is the ability to control plants

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.980
with your mind.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.870
Captain Planet uses it for good, Poison Ivy
uses it for evil and Groot uses it to grow

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.200
himself an entire forest but he is a plant
so it seems fair and much more desirable for

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200
his situation.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.620
Guaranteeing oxygen and vegetation on earth
without using water or depending on the elements

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.959
may be the best use of Chlorokinesis.

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.800
While it may be beneficial to understand the
inner workings of nature and even be capable

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.260
of telling them what to do and when to grow,
it is not an especially useful power.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.840
However, Chlorokinesis may have helped out
the characters from The Happening.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.410
Danger Sense:
Knowing when danger is near is not exactly

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.489
the most difficult exercise in intuition,
so while Peter Parker’s Spider Sense is

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.680
tingling, the use of other superpowers are
getting things done.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.569
Elektra uses her danger sense to get better
use of her super stealth, but considering

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.400
her martial arts capability and weapon skills,
showing up late to the party would not be

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.670
a major complication.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.540
The danger sense is also redundant for those
with the natural ability to be aware of their

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.540
surroundings.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.489
Being ultra-aware of trouble looming certainly
allows superheroes the advantage of not being

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.129
blindsided but in the end, danger sense is
the alarm to the stolen car that is already

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.510
halfway down the street.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.730
Elasticity:
Being ultra-flexible has plenty of advantages

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.670
like being able to show off your talent at
your yoga class, or getting a prime spot as

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.900
a contortionist for the circus, but to call
it a superpower is a bit of a stretch.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.320
To be fair, elasticity is a bit more than
just flexibility, it usually involves the

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.290
hero’s body to form and stretch their body
beyond normal human capability.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.880
There may be occasional benefits of being
able to get between tight spots and reach

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.540
the top shelf, but that is not saying much.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.910
Elastigirl and Mr. Fantastic use their powers
to expand, give themselves extra reach and

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.780
even take a hit like a champ, but even with
their knack for making the best out of a less

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.199
than thrilling superpower, it can’t feel
especially ego boosting to be a walking, talking

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.840
Stretch Armstrong.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.850
Power Absorption-
Initially, the power of absorption may seem

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.120
pretty great when coming in contact with superheroes
and supervillains who possess a power you

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.370
want, but if that is a hero’s only ability,
they may not want to run into a disgruntled

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.180
Batman in a dark alley as Bruce Wayne has
no superheroes to steal.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.220
Rogue’s absorption powers would be considered
an exception to this typically useless ability

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.550
as she can absorb a person’s memories, talents,
and energy whether they are superhuman or

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.550
not.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.060
In most scenarios, power absorption is not
an ideal power even more so when considering

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.449
all of the other terrible abilities out there
that could be absorbed.

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.130
Precognition:
Knowing the future may be appealing for some

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.620
but terrifying for others.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.410
Captain Marvel and Psylocke have this ability
but considering their other many much more

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.050
valuable powers, it is mostly just a nuisance.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.830
This ability typically comes in the form of
a dream, or may be ignited by seeing or touching

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.830
something.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.470
In theory, the power could be useful but it
typically backfires creating, even more, problems.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.201
Seeing the future only causes a hero to attempt
to change the outcome of events which may

00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:47.919
be impossible or changed resulting in a butterfly
effect causing even more of a disaster.

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.570
The worst aspect of precognition is the vision
is rarely clear and more of a confusing mess

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.510
of images that most likely means something
completely different than the hero originally

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.690
understood which was proven the case in the
season 3 finale of Agents of Shield after

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.150
a seemingly homeless man with his own precognition
provided Daisy with momentary precognition.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.280
Omnilingualism:
Having the ability to speak any language no

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.440
matter how rare and the ability to communicate
with every person not just on Earth but the

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.259
entire Universe would be a pretty nifty gift
for us boring humans, but for superhumans,

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:18.259
it is a bit of a disappointment.

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:20.960
For Dr. Manhattan, omnilingualism is just
one of his many powers and for DC’s Starfire,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.220
it would barely even be worth mentioning on
her resume considering she can fly.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.389
The handiest use of Omnilinguilasm may have
been Glory from Buffy the Vampire Slayer as

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.169
she was able to speak to humans and every
specie and sub-specie of demon.

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.590
However, such a power was still low on her
list of exceptional skills.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.600
When you consider that a majority of the power
could easily be duplicated with a few phone

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.530
Apps, the power is fairly useless.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.530
There are many more useless superpowers out
there, which one did we forget?

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.940
Which powers have you chuckling to yourself
or just leave you scratching your head?

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.729
