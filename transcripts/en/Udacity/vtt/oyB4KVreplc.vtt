00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.190
Let's discuss linear equations.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.922
Calvin is a car salesman and
his base pay each month is $1000.

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:13.800
Each month he also receives a 15%
commission on each car he sells.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.798
If Calvin sold cars with a total of
$80,000 in the month of January,

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:20.510
what is his pay for January?

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.990
Enter your answer in this box.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.490
I've already included a dollar sign.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.200
Don't worry about including commas,
either.
