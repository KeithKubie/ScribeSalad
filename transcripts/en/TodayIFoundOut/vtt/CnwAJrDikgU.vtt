00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.120
Developed over the course of decades, GPS
has become far more ubiquitous than most people

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.120
realize.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.690
Not just for navigation, its extreme accuracy
in time keeping (+/- 10 billionths of a second)

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.399
has been used by countless businesses the
world over for everything from aiding in power

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.010
grid management to helping manage stock market
and other banking transactions.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.810
The GPS system essentially allows for companies
to have near atomic clock level precision

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.079
in their systems, including easy time synchronization
across the globe, without actually needing

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.470
to have an atomic clock or come up with their
own systems for global synchronization.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.270
The problem is that, owing to a quirk of the
original specifications, on April 6, 2019

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.750
many GPS receivers are about to stop working
correctly unless the firmware for them is

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.030
updated promptly.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.159
So what’s going on here, how exactly does
the GPS system work, and who first got the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.340
idea for such a system?

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.420
On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched
Sputnik.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.460
As you might imagine, this tiny satellite,
along with subsequent satellites in the line,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.510
were closely monitored by scientists the world
over.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.130
Most pertinent to the topic at hand today
were two physicists at Johns Hopkins University

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.140
named William Guier and George Weiffenbach.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.790
As they studied the orbits and signals coming
from the Sputnik satellites the pair realized

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.650
that, thanks to how fast the satellites were
going and the nature of their broadcasts,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.469
they could use the Doppler shift of the signal
to very accurately determine the satellite’s

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.469
position.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.290
Not long after, one Frank McClure, also of
Johns Hopkins University, asked the pair to

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.980
study whether it would be possible to do this
the other way around.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.320
They soon found that, indeed, using the satellite’s
known orbit and studying the signal from it

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.500
as it moved, the observer on the ground could
in a relatively short time span determine

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.660
their own location.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.480
This got the wheels turning.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.840
Various systems were proposed and, in some
cases, developed.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.500
Most notable to the eventual evolution of
GPS was the Navy’s Navigation Satellite

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.380
System (also known as the Navy Transit Program),
which was up and running fully by 1964.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.750
This system could, in theory, tell a submarine
or ship crew where they were within about

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.280
25 meters, though location could only be updated
about once per hour and took about 10-15 minutes

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.310
to acquire.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.780
Further, if the ship was moving, the precision
would be off by about one nautical mile per

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.380
5 knots of speed.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.970
Another critical system to the ultimate development
of GPS was known as Timation, which initially

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.160
used quartz clocks synchronized on the ground
and on the satellites as a key component of

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.510
how the system determined where the ground
observer was located.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.480
However, with such relatively imprecise clocks,
the first tests resulted in an accuracy of

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.229
only about 0.3 nautical miles and took about
15 minutes of receiving data to nail down

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.630
that location.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.250
Subsequent advancements in Timation improved
things, even testing using an atomic clock

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.090
for increased accuracy.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.840
But Timation was about to go the way of the
Dodo.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.009
By the early 1970s, the Navigation System
Using Timing and Ranging (Navstar, eventually

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:45.380
Navstar-GPS) was proposed, essentially combining
elements from systems like Transit, Timation,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.310
and a few other similar systems in an attempt
to make a better system from what was learned

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.000
in those projects.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.220
Fast-forward to 1983 and while the U.S. didn’t
yet have a fully operational GPS system, the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.470
first prototype satellites were up and the
system was being slowly tested and implemented.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.620
It was at this point that Korean Air Lines
Flight 007, which originally departed from

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.280
New York, refueled and took off from Anchorage,
Alaska, bound for Seoul, South Korea.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.130
What does this have to do with ubiquitous
GPS as we know it today?

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.320
On its way, the pilots had an unnoticed autopilot
issue, resulting in them unknowingly straying

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.970
into Soviet airspace.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.600
Convinced the passenger plane was actually
a spy plane, the Soviets launched Su-15 jets

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.160
to intercept the (apparently) most poorly
crafted spy plane in history- the old “It’s

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.630
so overt, it’s covert” approach to spying.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.160
Warning shots were fired, though the pilot
who did it stated in a later interview, “I

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.550
fired four bursts, more than 200 rounds.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.650
For all the good it did.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.100
After all, I was loaded with armor piercing
shells, not incendiary shells.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.720
It’s doubtful whether anyone could see them.”

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.280
Not long after, the pilots of Korean Air 007
called Tokyo Area Control Center, requesting

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.910
to climb to Flight Level 350 (35,000 feet)
from Flight Level 330 (33,000 feet).

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.670
This resulted in the aircraft slowing below
the speed the tracking high speed interceptors

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.790
normally operated at, and thus, them blowing
right by the plane.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.730
This was interpreted as an evasive maneuver,
even though it was actually just done for

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.730
fuel economy reasons.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.390
A heated debate among the Soviet brass ensued
over whether more time should be taken to

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.330
identify the plane in case it was simply a
passenger airliner as it appeared.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.510
But as it was about to fly into international
waters, and may in fact already have been

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.250
at that point, the decision was made to shoot
first and ask questions later.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.520
The attacking pilot described what happened
next:

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.580
“Destroy the target…!”

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.530
That was easy to say.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.530
But how?

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.530
With shells?

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.700
I had already expended 243 rounds.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.730
Ram it?

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.940
I had always thought of that as poor taste.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.470
Ramming is the last resort.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.430
Just in case, I had already completed my turn
and was coming down on top of him.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.560
Then, I had an idea.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.330
I dropped below him about two thousand metres…
afterburners.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.290
Switched on the missiles and brought the nose
up sharply.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.290
Success!

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.760
I have a lock on.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.130
Two missiles were fired and exploded near
the Boeing plane causing significant damage,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.400
though in a testament to how safe commercial
airplanes typically are, the pilots were able

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.760
to regain control over the aircraft, even
for a time able to maintain level and stable

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.760
flight.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.590
However, they eventually found themselves
in a slow spiral which ended in a crash killing

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.180
all 269 aboard.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.080
As a direct result of this tragedy, President
Ronald Reagan announced on September 16, 1983

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.090
that the GPS system that had previously been
intended for U.S. military use only would

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.780
now be made available for everyone to use,
with the initial idea being the numerous safety

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.650
benefits such a system would have in civil
aviation over using then available navigation

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.680
tools.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.450
This brings us to how exactly the GPS system
works in the first place.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.830
Amazingly complex on some levels, the actual
nuts and bolts of the system are relatively

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.030
straightforward to understand.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.930
To begin with, consider what happens if you’re
standing in an unknown location and you ask

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.460
someone where you are.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.670
They reply simply- “You are 212 miles from
Seattle, Washington.”

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.680
You now can draw a circle on a map with radius
212 miles from Seattle.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.900
Assuming the person giving you that information
is correct, you know you’re somewhere along

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.320
that circular line.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.630
Not super helpful at this point by itself,
you then ask someone else, and they say, “You

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.010
are 150 miles from Vancouver BC.”

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.900
Now you’re getting somewhere.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.200
When you draw that circle on the map, you’ll
see it intersects at two points.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.910
You are standing on one of those two points.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.169
Noticing that you are not, in fact, floating
in the ocean, you could at this point deduce

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:43.380
which point you are on, but work with us here
people.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.740
Instead of making such an assumption, you
decide your senses are never to be trusted

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.870
and, after all, Jesus stood on water, so why
not you?

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.150
Thus, you ask a third person- they say, “You
are 500 miles from Boise, Idaho.”

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:00.800
That circle drawn, you now know exactly where
you are in two dimensional space.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.730
Near Kamloops, Canada, as it turns out.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:08.389
This is more or less what’s happening with
GPS, except in the case of GPS you need to

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:11.910
think in terms of 3D spheres instead of 2D
circles.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:16.090
Further, how the system tells you your exact
distance from a reference point, in this case

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.930
each of the satellites, is via transmitting
the satellites’ exact locations in orbit

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.200
and a timestamp of the exact time when said
transmission was sent.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.449
This time is synchronized across the various
satellites in the GPS constellation.

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:34.020
The receiver then subtracts the current known
time upon receiving the data from that transmission

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.510
time to determine the time it took for that
signal to be transmitted from the satellites

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.729
to its location.

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:43.459
Combining that with the known satellite locations
and the known speed of light with which the

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:48.480
radio signal was propagated, it can then crunch
the numbers to determine with remarkable accuracy

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.650
its location, with margins of error owing
to things like the ionosphere interfering

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.010
with the propagation of the signal, and various
other real world factors such as this potentially

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.980
throwing things off a little.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.519
Even with these potential issues, however,
the latest generation of the GPS system can,

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:08.579
in theory, pinpoint your location within about
a foot or about 30 centimeters.

00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:11.230
You may have spotted a problem here, however.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.550
While the GPS satellites are using extremely
precise and synchronized atomic clocks, the

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:20.089
GPS system in your car, for example, has no
such synchronized atomic clock.

00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:25.240
So how does it accurately determine how long
it took for the signal to get from the satellite

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.240
to itself?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.420
It simply uses at least four, instead of three,
satellites, giving it the extra data point

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.709
it needs to solve the necessary equations
to get the appropriate missing time variable.

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:39.240
In a nutshell, there is only one point in
time that will match the edge of all four

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.060
spheres intersecting in one point in space
on Earth.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.589
Thus, once the variables are solved for, the
receiver can adjust its own time keeping appropriately

00:09:47.589 --> 00:09:53.220
to be almost perfectly synchronized, at least
momentarily, with the much more precise GPS

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.220
atomic clocks.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.410
In some sense, this makes GPS something of
a 4D system, in that, with it, you can know

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.319
your precise point in not only space, but
time.

00:10:02.319 --> 00:10:05.949
By continually updating its own internal clock
in this way, the receiver on the ground ends

00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:10.829
up being nearly as accurate as an atomic clock
and is a time keeping device that is then

00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:15.149
almost perfectly synchronized with other such
receivers across the globe, all for almost

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:19.550
no cost at all to the end users because the
U.S. government is footing the bill for all

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.509
the expensive bits of the system and maintaining
it.

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:26.490
Speaking of that maintanence, another problem
you may have spotted is that various factors

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.620
can, and do, continually move the GPS satellites
off their original orbits.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.850
So how is this accounted for?

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.250
Tracking stations on Earth continually monitor
the exact orbits of the various GPS satellites,

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.089
with this information, along with any needed
time corrections to account for things like

00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:44.990
Relatively, frequently updated in the GPS
almanac and ephemeris.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.660
These two data sets are used for holding satellite
status and positional information and are

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.129
regularly broadcast to receivers, which is
how said receivers know exact positions of

00:10:54.129 --> 00:10:56.190
the satellites in the first place.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.050
The satellites themselves can also have their
orbits adjusted if necessary, with this process

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:05.220
simply being to mark the satellite as “unhealthy”
so receivers will ignore it, then move it

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.600
to its new position, track that orbit, and
once that is accurately known, update the

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.559
almanac and ephemeris and mark the satellite
as “healthy” again.

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:18.209
So that’s more or less how GPS came to be
and how it works at a high level.

00:11:18.209 --> 00:11:22.360
What about the part where we said many GPS
devices may potentially stop working very

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.360
soon if not updated?

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.589
Near the turn of the century something happened
that had never happened before in the GPS

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:30.999
world- dubbed a “dress rehearsal for the
Y2K bug”.

00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:35.230
You see, as a part of the time stamp sent
by the GPS satellites, there is something

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.619
known as the Week Number- literally just the
number of weeks that have passed since an

00:11:39.619 --> 00:11:43.100
epoch, originally set to January 6, 1980.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.050
Along with this Week Number the number of
seconds since midnight on the previous Saturday

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:51.610
evening is sent, thus allowing the GPS receiver
to calculate the exact date.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.420
So what’s the problem with this?

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:59.569
It turns out every 1024 weeks (about every
19 years and 8 months) from the epoch, the

00:11:59.569 --> 00:12:04.800
number rolls back to 0 owing to this integer
information being in 10 bit format.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.450
Thus, when this happens, any GPS receiver
that doesn’t account for the Week Number

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:13.459
Rollover, will likely stop functioning correctly,
though the nature of the malfunction varies

00:12:13.459 --> 00:12:17.889
from vendor to vendor and device, depending
on how said vendor implemented their system.

00:12:17.889 --> 00:12:21.899
For some, the bug might manifest as a simple
benign date reporting error.

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:25.600
For others, such a date reporting error might
mean everything from incorrect positioning

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.410
to even a full system crash.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.209
If you’ve done the math, you’ve probably
deduced that this issue first popped up in

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:37.410
August of 1999, only about four years after
the GPS system itself was fully operational.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.220
At this point, of course, GPS wasn’t something
that was so ubiquitously depended on as it

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:47.960
is today, with only 10-15 million GPS receivers
in use worldwide in 1999 according to a 1999

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.310
report by the the United States Department
of Commerce’s Office of Telecommunications.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.540
Today, of course, that number is in the billions
of devices.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.800
Thankfully, when the next Week Number Rollover
event happens on April 6, 2019, it would seem

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.519
most companies that rely on GPS for critical
systems, like airlines, banking institutions,

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:10.769
cell networks, power grids, etc., have already
taken the necessary steps to account for the

00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:11.769
problem.

00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:15.220
The more realistic problems with this second
Week Number Rollover event will probably mostly

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.939
occur at the consumer level, as most people
simply are not aware of the issue at all.

00:13:19.939 --> 00:13:23.629
Thankfully, if you’ve updated your firmware
on your GPS device recently or simply own

00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:28.209
a GPS device purchased in the last few years,
you’re probably going to be fine here.

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:32.589
However, should you own a GPS device that
is several years old, that may not be the

00:13:32.589 --> 00:13:37.429
case and you’ll most definitely want to
go to the manufacturer’s website and download

00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:41.570
any relevant updates before the second GPS
epoch.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.350
That public service announcement out of the
way, if you’re now wondering why somebody

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.720
doesn’t just change the specification altogether
to stop using a 10 bit Week Number, well,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.449
you’re not the first to think of this.

00:13:51.449 --> 00:13:56.529
Under the latest GPS interface specifications,
a 13 bit Week Number is now used, meaning

00:13:56.529 --> 00:14:02.519
in newer devices that support this, the issue
won’t come up again for about a century

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:03.519
and a half.

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:13.009
As the machines are bound to rise up and enslave
humanity long before that occurs, that’s

00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:27.029
really their issue to solve at that point.
