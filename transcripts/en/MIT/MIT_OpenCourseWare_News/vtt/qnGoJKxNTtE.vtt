MIT OpenCourseWare is a
free and open publication

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.550
of material from
thousands of MIT courses

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.860
covering the entire
MIT curriculum

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.410
and used by millions of learners
and educators around the world.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.800
OCW Educator is a faculty
inspired initiative

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.070
to share teaching
approaches and materials

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.180
from MIT with educators
everywhere, for free.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.700
Instructors share their
instructional insights

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.070
via discourse at MIT sections of
their OCW course publications.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.470
These sections illustrate how
the course was taught on campus

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.020
and include a course overview,
course outcomes, curriculum

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.340
information,
student demographics

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.390
and personal interviews
with faculty about how

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.570
they taught the course.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.560
Many MIT instructors share a
variety of teaching materials

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.890
with educators,
including resources

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.615
like lecture notes, video
lectures, exams and assignments

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:03.690
and special elements,
like demonstrations.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.740
These materials, like
all materials on OCW,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.510
are made for sharing.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.930
Download files for later, share
with students, modify, remix

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.650
and reuse in your teaching.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.570
Just remember to cite
OCW as the source.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.270

making it easier

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.430
to find the teaching materials
and instructional insights you

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.110
need, faster.

You can search by
instructional approach.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.180
Or you can search for teaching
materials by subject area.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.640
