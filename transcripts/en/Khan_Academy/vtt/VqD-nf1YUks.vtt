00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.830
- [Instructor] Let's say
we're trying to understand

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.070
the relationship between
people's height and their weight.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.380
So what we do is we go
to 10 different people,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.980
and we measure each of their heights

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.200
and each of their weights.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.510
And so on this scatter plot here,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.830
each dot represents a person.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.590
So, for example, this dot
over here represents a person

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.350
whose height was 60
inches, or five feet tall.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.870
So that's the point 60 comma,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.280
and whose weight,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.280
which we have on the
y-axis, was 125 pounds.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.650
And so when you look at this scatter plot,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.430
your eyes naturally see
some type of a trend.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.380
It seems like, generally speaking,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.740
as height increases,
weight increases as well.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.200
But I said generally speaking.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.610
You definitely have circumstances

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.970
where there are taller
people who might weigh less.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.690
But an interesting question
is can we try to fit a line

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.220
to this data?

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.820
And this idea of trying to fit a line

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.070
as closely as possible to as
many of the points as possible

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.700
is known as linear,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.493
linear regression.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.180
Now, the most common technique
is to try to fit a line

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.590
that minimizes the squared
distance to each of those points,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.200
and we're gonna talk more
about that in future videos.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.930
But for now, we want to get
an intuitive feel for that.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.340
So if you were to just eyeball it

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.900
and look at a line like that,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.680
you wouldn't think that it would
be a particularly good fit.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.090
It looks like most of the
data sits above the line.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.310
Similarly, something like this
also doesn't look that great.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.980
Here most of our data points
are sitting below the line.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.630
But something like this
actually looks very good.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.990
It looks like it's getting
as close as possible

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.200
to as many of the points as possible.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.030
It seems like it's describing
this general trend.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.490
And so this is the actual regression line.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.100
And the equation here, we would write as,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.450
we'd write y with a little hat over it.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.740
And that means that we're
trying to estimate a y

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.840
for a given x.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.730
It's not always going to be
the actual y for a given x.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.610
Because, as we see, sometimes the points

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.070
aren't sitting on the line.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.440
But we say y hat is equal to,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.810
and our y-intercept, for this
particular regression line,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.450
it is negative 140

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.710
plus the slope 14 over three

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.440
times x.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.210
Now, as we can see, for
most of these points,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.780
given the x-value of those points,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.780
the estimate that our
regression line gives

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.430
is different than the actual value.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.600
And that difference between the actual

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.570
and the estimate from the regression line

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.620
is known as the residual.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.453
So let me write that down.

00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:48.863
So, for example, the
residual at that point,

00:02:48.863 --> 00:02:50.500
residual

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.240
at that point is going to
be equal to, for a given x,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.360
the actual y-value

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.920
minus the estimated y-value

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.800
from the regression line for that same x.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.370
Or another way to think about it is,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.690
for that x-value, when x is equal to 60,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.620
we're talking about the
residual just at that point,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.940
it's going to be the actual y-value

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.940
minus our estimate of what the y-value is

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.100
from this regression
line for that x-value.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.070
So pause this video,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.080
and see if you can
calculate this residual.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.620
And you could visually imagine it as being

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.423
this right over here.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.290
Well, to actually calculate the residual,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.060
you would take our actual
value, which is 125,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.730
for that x-value.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.140
Remember, we're calculating
the residual for a point.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.410
So it's the actual y there minus,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.480
what would be the estimated
y there for that x-value?

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.270
Well, we could just go to this equation

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.660
and say what would y hat
be when x is equal to 60?

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.250
Well, it's going to be equal to,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.250
let's see, we have negative 140
plus 14 over three times 60.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.120
Let's see, 60 divided by three is 20.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.880
20 times

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.950
14 is

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.770
280.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.603
And so all of this is going to be 140.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.600
And so our residual, for this point,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.600
is going to be 125 minus
140, which is negative 15.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.290
And residuals indeed can be negative.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.580
If your residual is negative,
it means, for that x-value,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.950
your data point, your actual
y-value, is below the estimate.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.960
If we were to calculate the residual here

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.070
or if we were to calculate
the residual here,

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.130
our actual for that x-value
is above our estimate,

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.720
so we would get positive residuals.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.400
And as you will see later
in your statistics career,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.770
the way that we calculate
these regression lines

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.770
is all about minimizing the
square of these residuals.
