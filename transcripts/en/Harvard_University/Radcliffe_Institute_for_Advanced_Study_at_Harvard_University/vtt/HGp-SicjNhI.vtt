[RHYTHMIC TAPPING AND CLAPPING]

00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:26.619
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:39.044
- Ho.

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:20.372
[LAUGHING]

00:03:59.704 --> 00:04:03.183
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.940
- Thank you, everyone.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.370
It's so great to be here.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.680
Thank you, Professor Hisa,
and thank you to the Radcliffe

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.740
Institute for the
opportunity to be here,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.130
and to be a part
of this conference,

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.880
in this marvelous
place of learning.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.350
Boy, and my stamina
somehow left the room.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.970
And also, such an honor and
a privilege to both be here,

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.720
but also to share the stage
with these extraordinary artists

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.660
that I am blessed
to call colleagues.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.580
Ayodele Casel, and
Antoine Hunter.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.800
You have your
programs, so I think

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.930
you can read more about these
extraordinary people there.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.880
And I'd love to just dive
in to this conversation

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.480
about embodied practice,
embodied knowledge,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.010
and research in our field
that we're pretty attached to,

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.060
called dance.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.170
But if you find dance
somehow conjures up

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.950
a bad performance of
some kind, experience

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.190
that you were forced to
watch on PBS or something--

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.450
which, I love those programs.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:28.950
But allow, perhaps the idea of
motion and movement, and again,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.750
this theme of
non-verbal communication

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.505
to be conjured up as
we talk about dance.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.750
So what you just witnessed
was how we speak in dance.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.140
And we often talk
to our students

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.440
about, writing in dance is
dancing, choreographing.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.620
Making a performance public
is our version of publishing.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.460
So thinking about our
practice in those terms.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.680
And you know, what
does embodied language

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.980
look like for each one
of us in this room,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.830
based on our experiences?

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.650
And for us as dancers, our
life experience, but also

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.410
the teachers, and
the environments

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.350
of learning that we came up
through, and the traditions,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.760
the challenges, the triumphs.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.880
And so I thought that'd
be a good place to start,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.770
is to talk about each of
their histories with dance.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.318
And so maybe we can start with
that, maybe Ayodele, to star.

00:06:33.318 --> 00:06:35.860
Wondered if you could tell us
a little bit about how you came

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.100
to dance, who you're
influential teachers were,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.530
or what your influences
were and are.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.830
What came to this moment
of our expression?

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.490
- Oh yes.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.710
- Here at Radcliffe.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.460
- Well, what came to
that is my intense desire

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.045
to communicate, and to be
in communion with people.

00:06:55.045 --> 00:06:56.920
Not just people that I
shared the stage with,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.090
but the people that
are here in the space.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.620
I actually started tap
dancing much later, as far as

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.210
like, you know, most kids start
when they're very, very young.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.510
I was a sophomore in college.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.910
I was an acting major at NYU.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.180
And my senior year
in high school,

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.110
I became really obsessed
with old movies, specifically

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.030
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.530
I loved them.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.420
And I wanted to
be Ginger Rogers.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.518
So much so that I even
bought a prom dress that

00:07:27.518 --> 00:07:28.810
looked like one of her dresses.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.893
And it didn't really look
like it, but in my mind,

00:07:30.893 --> 00:07:33.370
I was like, I'm
Ginger Rogers today.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.358
But had that was my first
real curiosity, other

00:07:37.358 --> 00:07:39.400
than when you're a child,
and you're just dancing

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.650
in your room for fun, you know.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.350
And so my sophomore
year, I had this chance

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.600
to really take this class.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.920
I just was so excited.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.363
And I loved it.

00:07:50.363 --> 00:07:51.280
And it was the basics.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.062
It was my flaps, and my
shuffles, in my Maxi Fords.

00:07:55.062 --> 00:07:57.520
And I was the best in my class--
which is not saying a lot,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.562
because we were just a
bunch of actors in a room,

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:02.990
and they didn't want to be
there in the first place.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.600
But I was living my
dream, doing this

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.700
very by rote sort of material.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.330
And then, about
a year into that,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.490
I met a young dancer
who was a freshman,

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.190
his name was Baakari Wilder.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.730
And he had grown up dancing,
he was what we call, I mean,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.125
he was a hoofer.

00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:28.780
And he was working with Savion
Glover on a show called,

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.720
Bring in 'da Noise, bring in
'da Funk, which was premiering

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.940
at the Public Theater.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.080
And we had a mutual
friend, and he said--

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.830
we happened to be
walking down the street,

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.580
and he said, "Oh my
God, you're both here.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.590
Baakari, you have
to meet Ayodele.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.410
Ayodele, you tap dance,
and you tap dance,

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.610
and you all should
get together."

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.530
And I was so thrilled,
because I'm like, yeah,

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.026
because I'm good, right.

00:08:49.026 --> 00:08:50.450
[LAUGHING]

00:08:52.813 --> 00:08:53.980
He goes, let's get together.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.840
So we go, and we rent a space.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.358
And I'm putting on my shoes,
and he puts on his shoes,

00:08:59.358 --> 00:09:00.400
and he starts warming up.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.028
And what and this
is what I hear.

00:09:02.028 --> 00:09:03.570
I'm putting on my
shoes, and I hear--

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.550
[SCATTING]

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.968
And I just remember
going, wait a minute.

00:09:09.968 --> 00:09:12.260
That is not what I was doing.
'Cause I had been doing--

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.040
[VOCALIZING]

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.570
And so that really quickly
turned into a private lesson.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.070
It was supposed to
be a jam session.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.900
But it was like, no, you
don't know what you're doing.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.400
But you know, he started to
tell me, like, oh wait a minute,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.807
you don't tap.

00:09:26.807 --> 00:09:29.140
It was the first time that I
understood that tap dancing

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.730
wasn't a series of steps.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.250
And that it wasn't
just vocabulary,

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.753
that it was a mode
of expression,

00:09:34.753 --> 00:09:35.920
and a mode of communication.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.290
And specifically, that it
was attached to history,

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.840
and that it was attached
to a legacy that

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.700
I had been previously
unaware of.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.240
And so for me, it completely
turned everything on its head

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.570
and I became super
obsessed with wanting

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.020
to learn everything about it.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.390
And from an identity
perspective,

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.607
as a black and Puerto Rican
woman, who in the '90s--

00:09:58.607 --> 00:10:00.940
this is, we're talking about
before the Latin explosion,

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.565
before diversity and
inclusion was even

00:10:02.565 --> 00:10:04.885
something that was on the
tips of people's tongues.

00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:06.260
I didn't see much
representation.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.920
And so to find out
that this thing

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:14.290
that I was so attached to,
and that drew me to it,

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:18.670
was really heavily steeped in a
rich, wonderful, sophisticated,

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:25.420
elegant, beautiful expression
of black people in this country.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.170
It really, it burst
open my heart.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.760
And I have been
with it, and trying

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:36.190
to do my absolute best to
represent it as much as I can.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:41.260
But that is how I came in to
tap dancing in a nutshell.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.540
- Thank you.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.040
Antoine.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.820
- So for me, my story's
slightly different.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.660
Well, just before I get started.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.640
I want you to copy me.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.674
Do this hand shape here.

00:10:57.674 --> 00:11:00.070
Now do like this.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.310
That means yes.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.830
Now do this hand shape.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.370
There you go.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.840
Now do this movement.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.530
That means no.

00:11:16.345 --> 00:11:17.720
So if I say, "Do
you understand?"

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.140
You can say yes or no.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.020
So communication is
important for me.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.263
So do you guys
understand so far?

00:11:26.263 --> 00:11:26.930
All right, good.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:27.888
We're on the same page.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.010
I was born in
Oakland, California.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.370
We had a value of community.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.833
And that community was
shared with language as well,

00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:43.625
as well as culture.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.190
My family identifies
African American.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:57.350
Oakland is home of the Black
Panthers, a lot of advocacy,

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.740
rights movements.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.190
So it was difficult
and different

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.620
for me to be the only
person who was deaf,

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.980
and communicates
with sign language.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.660
So my single mom, she was
trying to pick up language

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.100
here and there to communicate.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:17.250
Oftentimes I wouldn't have
that access to signing.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.760
So whether it was a deaf role
model, or adults, or programs,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.980
I wasn't exposed to that.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.700
So it was difficult for me.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.420
I couldn't follow what was
going on on television.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.730
But I did see something
on television.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.250
There wasn't captioning
at that point.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.470
People would be laughing,
and I'm like, oh,

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.570
that's my cue to start laughing.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.340
But not actually know
what I was laughing at,

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.730
or be off-cue, and know
what's actually going on TV.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:49.320
So I had that experience of not
being able to express myself.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.600
Then there was a chance I
went to the Oakland ballet.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.210
I think I was about
eight years old.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:58.720
It was so beautiful,
colorful, vibrant.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:07.980
The men and women, the
performers on stage.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.750
I laughed.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.300
I laughed so hard I
almost blurted out,

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.270
and people were
all looking at me.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.450
And I saw, oh wait, they're
laughing too, at the same time.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.300
I felt at home.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:26.010
Dance was a way for me to
communicate, to understand

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.220
what was going on.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.800
My mom couldn't
afford, at that time,

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.045
for me to go to dance class.

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:37.080
So I had to wait
till high school.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.840
And then it was at
Skyline High School.

00:13:42.522 --> 00:13:44.230
You know, it's the
same, just by the way,

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.660
it's the same high
school Tom Hank went to.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.210
Just saying.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.220
So as a performing artist.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.070
I was so involved with all
the club activities and such.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.670
I tried to be very
involved and engaged.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.530
But it's difficult,
because I was, again,

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.111
the only deaf person
within the dance group.

00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:05.640
So think about that.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:12.650
So how would I be able to have
a date, develop a best friend.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.570
But guess what?

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.300
Everyone in the
dance class, they

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:23.260
were so focused on dancing,
so I couldn't get a date.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.850
So check that off my list.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.480
I tried to just be a part of
the group and participate.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.560
My dance teacher at that point
wanted us to work on a dance,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.082
and we did some group work.

00:14:40.082 --> 00:14:42.040
So I was like, oh hey,
I want to work with you.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.540
No?

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.810
Can I work with you?

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.150
You?

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.400
No one wanted to work with me.

00:14:50.862 --> 00:14:52.070
And they said, you know what?

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.903
My teacher, said go
ahead, and why don't you

00:14:53.903 --> 00:14:56.990
develop and choreograph a solo.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.790
So I had to pick
music at this point.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.390
You guys might know this song.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:10.756
(SINGING) And I will
always love you.

00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:12.684
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:12.684 --> 00:15:14.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.400
So you know it?

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.070
OK.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.750
So I had to work
on my interpreter,

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.550
have him do that
vocal, but, you know.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.650
Who sings that song?

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.880
- Whitney Houston.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.740
- Whitney Houston.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.630
That's my wife too.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.770
Just so you know.

00:15:40.116 --> 00:15:43.100
So I was dancing to
that song, and I just

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.380
felt so much
emotion, and a rush.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.630
And people were looking at me.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:56.140
And I just remember, something
changed in them as my audience.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:00.037
My dance teacher asked, "What
do you guys feel from him?"

00:16:00.037 --> 00:16:01.370
And I was nervous at that point.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.890
But the students say,
"We felt you were cold.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:10.280
I felt that you were evoking
that you were alone."

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.590
And that was that,
actually just it.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:16.780
I communicated, and I
had that connection,

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.500
and I wasn't alone anymore.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.320
At that moment, that's
when dance was my love,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.293
and I just fell in love
with it, and continued

00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:26.710
with all different
types of dance.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.370
I realized through all
that different engagements

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.660
of the different types of
dance, there is no limit.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.670
And I love it.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.530
And here I am today.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.410
- Thank you, thank you.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:50.380
What I'm struck by is the
themes of home, understanding,

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.300
and meaning come through
what you're talking about.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.410
And I think it's a special
quality that dance holds.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.580
It's a non-verbal art
form that can hold all

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.260
of this space for all of this.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:07.900
There isn't a limit to that,
which is a special thing.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.950
And thinking, again, about
this idea of language.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:16.359
How has language shaped
how you see the world,

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:19.720
and how you approach your
creative artistic and aesthetic

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.220
work?

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.410
So language, it could be
the language of dance,

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.310
but also because we
have multiple points

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.490
of entry and relationships to
different kinds of language.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.100
So it's not just
verbal language,

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:38.920
but how has language
writ large affected

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.300
your creative and aesthetic
and artistic work?

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:50.700
- So the other reason I am also
really attached and connected

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.850
to this art form is because
of my own personal struggle

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.860
with language.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.918
When I was nine years
old, I moved to--

00:17:57.918 --> 00:18:00.210
I was sent to live with my
grandparents in Puerto Rico,

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.950
and I did not speak
Spanish at all.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.970
And it was right as, I think,
a month the school year

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.140
had already started.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.613
So I was also just taken
straight to school,

00:18:10.613 --> 00:18:12.780
and put in this environment
where I literally cannot

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.890
communicate.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.000
I knew one word.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.400
I knew how to say
Hola, and that was it.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.500
And I remember the
feeling of isolation,

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.700
and the anxiety attached to
feeling, having thoughts,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.960
and having emotions, and
not being able to say it.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.340
And even if I said
it in English,

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.810
it wouldn't be understood.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.420
And so that was, I
remember that journey,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.345
of even my grandmother really
teaching me how to speak again.

00:18:39.345 --> 00:18:40.470
Going through the alphabet.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.840
[GOING THROUGH ALPHABET IN
 SPANISH]

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.030
And I remember
just that struggle.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.323
And then, of course, like
children, we learn language.

00:18:50.323 --> 00:18:51.240
We pick it up quickly.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.280
And so I became
really good at it.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.690
I was there for six years.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.690
But then I moved back
to New York City,

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.660
where I hadn't been
practicing my English.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.380
And I went into 10th grade,
a public school in the Bronx.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.110
And I had the same
experience, where

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:14.040
I felt very isolated and
fearful of saying anything,

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.870
because I didn't want to
mispronounce something,

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.780
or just say the wrong thing.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.060
I remember I was playing
Trivial Pursuit with my mom,

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.393
and the thing said,
it was silver screen,

00:19:27.393 --> 00:19:29.560
because you know, the silver
screen Trivial Pursuit.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.720
And it said, "What couple had a
famous 'rendezvis' at a thing?"

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.950
And my mom was like, what?

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.430
Said, "What couple had a famous
'rendezvis?'" And she was like,

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.190
let me see that.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.430
That's rendezvous.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.140
And I just remember feeling
like, oh, this sucks.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.765
But I became really
obsessed with like,

00:19:47.765 --> 00:19:49.140
not wanting to
feel that anymore.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.520
And I got a pocket
sized dictionary,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.920
and a pocket sized thesaurus,
and I carried this with me

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.680
all the time, just so that I
could not have that barrier.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.700
So when I found tap dancing,
I didn't realize initially

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.830
that that was the other
thing that it had given me.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:08.730
It gave me an opportunity to
express myself in this way,

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.500
without having to say a word.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.620
So that I could be in any
room, in a room like this,

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.280
in any room.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:14.940
And I can go--

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.390
[SCATTING]

00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:27.450
And like, what you
would connect with would

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.400
be the feeling of that,
you know what I mean?

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.780
And not the words.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.680
And I think that
that is something

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.350
that is really powerful.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.228
I think that what I love about
that kind of communication

00:20:44.228 --> 00:20:46.020
and language, when we
choose to communicate

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:53.190
in this way, nonverbal, is
that there's no barrier.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.850
I also think that rhythm is
innate and it's in all of us,

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.450
and we connect to it.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.130
And I think that we--

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.990
I think tap is magic.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.652
I think there's something in it.

00:21:05.652 --> 00:21:07.110
There's something
in that exchange,

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.840
and that listening of rhythm
that people are really

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.680
curious about.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.240
And I want to think that
everybody wants to try it.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.780
That there's nostalgia
there for many, many folks,

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.370
and that there's curiosity.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.380
And I'd like to tap into that.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.390
And I think that I have seen,
in my personal experience,

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:31.590
it's the one thing that
crosses gender, age, ethnicity.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.260
Yeah, it's like
it doesn't matter.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:41.980
We all can connect on
this, the power of rhythm.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.720
- Thank you.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.420
Antoine.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.900
- For me I could be--

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.542
can you guys understand me?

00:21:51.542 --> 00:21:52.042
Ah.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.992
I know there's some people,
it's like, yeah, some, but some.

00:21:58.992 --> 00:22:00.700
All you guys, obviously
you're from here.

00:22:04.125 --> 00:22:07.810
But sometime when I speak,
people just start going--

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:14.940
I can't understand, you know.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.370
People sometimes didn't
want to take the time

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.277
to learn sign language.

00:22:19.277 --> 00:22:20.360
It's a beautiful language.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.610
It's just all [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.220
So me trying to
connect with people,

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.980
it's so difficult for like,
a monologue, you know.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:41.630
And I already mentioned
before, before the solo

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.680
I felt so alone.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.840
I forgot to say that it was
that low moment of my life,

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:54.390
where I could have took
myself out of the world.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.940
I felt very, very
suicidal, because I

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.860
couldn't connect with people.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:05.650
And people were making me
feel my deafness was a curse.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.870
What's wrong with me?

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.100
Deaf, and a man of color.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.500
But growing up, it was supposed
be bad, when it should be,

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.570
really, the biggest gift to me.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:27.528
And my ASL, oh, it's so
beautiful, it get me ahead.

00:23:27.528 --> 00:23:29.320
Let me tell you how it
get me to understand

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.030
myself a little bit better.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.310
If you put your hand like this.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:35.060
And it goes--

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.560
[VOCALIZING]

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.060
Fire.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.810
That represents fire.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.160
Take your hands like this.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.340
Here's the motion.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.550
That is water, or the ocean.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:56.020
Now do this, and this movement.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.770
That is the air, or wind.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.770
Now do this.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.890
These two hand shapes
together represent earth.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.300
So for me it is so important
to know my history,

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.185
to know my roots.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.780
As you know, well-rooted
in African dance

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.985
has such a rich meaning.

00:24:20.985 --> 00:24:23.360
And it's the same thing with
my language of American Sign

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.940
Language.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:25.690
And I'll show you.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.920
Did you feel it?

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.420
- Yes.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.200
- This was part of me
finding my own identity,

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.320
that journey through dance
has just communicated.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.240
It's part of my DNA.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.070
It is who I am.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:22.540
As well as my rich roots,
and African American history,

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.980
and those traditions.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.560
Got it?

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.500
Do you understand?

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.160
- I love how this also
feels like a motorcycle.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:32.945
Yes.

00:25:32.945 --> 00:25:36.130
[LAUGHING]

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.910
So it's to state the
obvious to say that dance

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.530
is a nonverbal art form.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:46.660
It's a field of practice,
it's a field of research.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.020
And it could be said that there
is a certain kind of economy

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.720
to nonverbal communication,
when compared

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.760
to verbal communication.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.280
And so I wondered if you might
talk a little bit about what

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.610
for you are the unique
opportunities for communicating

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:05.920
through and with dance or
embodied communication.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.743
And is that something you think
about when you're making work,

00:26:08.743 --> 00:26:09.785
or even in your teaching?

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:19.250
- Yes, I mean, I think
like I said before, it

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.710
closes the gap between people.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:35.710
I tend to use literal words too,
in my work and storytelling.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:41.790
I feel like, I want
people to get it.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.030
I feel like tap dancing is
one of those things that,

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:49.710
because of its history,
sometimes like, the minstrelsy,

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:53.300
and how they would depict--

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.150
like Bill Robinson just
like, grinning and smiling.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.970
And it's the entertainment
portion of something.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.243
People look at it as like
a circus act sometimes,

00:27:02.243 --> 00:27:04.160
like, it's like that fun
thing that people do.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:09.230
And sometimes when I speak
to people, they'll go,

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.810
"Oh you do the--" you know,
and they sort of make fun of it

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:12.800
in that way.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.320
And for me, that is not cool.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:23.080
Because I know just
how deep, and what

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.850
was at stake, and
why it was created.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.660
And so for me, I feel
like every opportunity

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.470
that I get to dance, and to
create work, and to show work,

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:37.910
I feel a responsibility
to bring its dignity back.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:42.930
And sometimes I
don't want that--

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.640
I don't want it to
be misinterpreted.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.740
So I will not only give you the
seriousness and the complexity

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.353
of the rhythm, but I want
you to know these names.

00:27:53.353 --> 00:27:55.020
I want you to know
that this is history.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.430
I want you to know
what this came out of,

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:57.985
that this is an
American art form,

00:27:57.985 --> 00:27:59.610
that it's an African
American art form.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.340
That it came out of African
people being brought here,

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.323
and their communication,
their drums being taken away,

00:28:05.323 --> 00:28:06.240
their source of power.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.670
The fact that black
people could start

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:13.200
revolts across plantations
through rhythm.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.160
And that when that was found
out, they were silenced.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.780
And what happens
to you when that's

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.340
taken away, what happens?

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.905
That violent, violent act.

00:28:21.905 --> 00:28:22.530
What do you do?

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.500
What do you do when you can't
hit something, what do you do?

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.460
[TAPPING]

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.580
You do that because you have to.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.780
And so to me, if there's
something at stake

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.100
every single time.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.760
So it's a time step, but
it's not a time step.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.410
It's a flap but it's not a flap.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.770
To me, you have to do that.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.930
And I don't want that
to be confused with.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.090
I mean, that's
pretty too, right.

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:09.150
But that's not all
that it is, you know?

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.720
And so I find myself having
to literally say these things,

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:18.310
so that there's no room
for miscommunication.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:24.610
And so my work tends to just
talk about the history a lot.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.500
So that we don't
forget those names.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.990
So that it's not just-- because
who is the most famous tap

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.370
dancer, you think?

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:32.348
Fred and Ginger, right?

00:29:32.348 --> 00:29:34.640
That's like most people think
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.300
They think, we think
Eleanor Powell,

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.800
some people even
say Shirley Temple.

00:29:40.527 --> 00:29:41.900
[LAUGHING]

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.780
And they are certainly a
part of the history of it.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.350
But for me, like, I want
people to know "King" Rastus

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:52.085
Brown, and John Bubbles,
and and and Bill Robinson,

00:29:52.085 --> 00:29:53.960
and the Nicholas Brothers,
and Gregory Hines,

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.460
and Jimmy Slyde,
and Baby Lawrence,

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.880
and Sammy Davis, Jr, and on and
on we go, and Savion Glover,

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.140
and boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:06.560
And then for me, the
issue in that list

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.774
is that there were no women.

00:30:08.774 --> 00:30:11.090
[LAUGHING]

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:14.330
And that was problematic for me.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.480
And so then now, I would
say, like the last--

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.570
what I find myself doing
in my work, to be clear

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.490
is to let you know
that there were women.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:26.870
And I had to go through a
deep, deep, deep excavation

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:29.780
to find these women,
specifically these black women.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.340
Because I knew
Ginger Rogers, that's

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.260
how I started tap dancing.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.400
But I wanted to know
who looked like me.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.680
Because that's a
different experience.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.400
And there was no
YouTube at the time.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.590
I had to really go
through that search.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.340
- Was it in New York City
Public Library, did you go?

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.370
- Well, I'll tell
you I happened to be,

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.520
I was on the cover of
this Village Voice thing.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.040
And the article was
called "The Hidden History

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.200
of Black Women in Tap Dance."

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:05.420
And I called the paper, and
I got the author's number.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.690
And then I called
her, and then she

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.240
told me that one of the women
in the article, Jeni LeGon

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.233
was still alive at the time.

00:31:13.233 --> 00:31:15.650
And Jeni LeGon was the only
black woman to dance with Bill

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:18.070
Robinson-- other
than Shirley Temple--

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.010
the only grown woman.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.135
Like, no other woman had
ever been paired with her,

00:31:21.135 --> 00:31:23.780
other than Shirley Temple,
who was a child, and white.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.910
And then she was the
first black woman

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:27.950
to be signed to any
major Hollywood studios.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.260
She was signed to MGM,
first black woman.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.180
And she was alive.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.480
She was in her 80s,
and I called her.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.140
I was like, "Jeni, Ms. LeGon.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.120
My name is Ayodele, and I'm
a tap dancer from New York."

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.850
And I was able to go--

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.710
she was so surprised
that somebody

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:46.160
had reached out to her.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.672
And I found her, and
I went to see her.

00:31:48.672 --> 00:31:49.880
And then I found other women.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.052
And I don't want to talk
forever and ever, amen.

00:31:52.052 --> 00:31:53.510
But I just, because
I have to bring

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:54.950
their names into
the space, I want

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:56.158
to tell you who else I found.

00:31:56.158 --> 00:31:59.840
So I found Jeni LeGon, Lois
Bright, Louise Madison,

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.260
Juanita Pitts, Mildred
"Candi" Thorpe, Baby Edwards,

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.640
I found Ludie, Jones.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.180
I mean, I found Alice Whitman,
I found Juanita Pitts,

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.200
I found Cora LaRedd.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.115
I found all of these women who
were right there with the men.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.090
And more, than I can't--

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:18.230
I mean.

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:21.743
But that was just, it's
really important to me.

00:32:21.743 --> 00:32:22.910
It's really important to me.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:26.540
So when you see me
dance, I feel like I

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.880
want people to acknowledge
that it's not just me,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.460
that I come with a legacy.

00:32:37.053 --> 00:32:38.970
- Thank you for bringing
them into this space.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:39.762
Thank you for that.

00:32:39.762 --> 00:32:41.985
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.520
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.820
I can do 10,000
tendus, over and over.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.190
I believe in the
technique of the work.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.330
But I don't want people
to trivialize it,

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.410
and say, oh, this
deaf person can dance.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.410
No, there's work behind it.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:22.910
Work.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.940
As opposed to just being
viewed as someone who's deaf,

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.523
there's so much more
for you to share.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:43.050
The Urban Jazz Dance Company,
they have a deaf dancer.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:52.100
And he does on point, more
of a theatrical dance.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.780
A lot of professional
trained dancers,

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.630
and there's very high
expectations for them.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.090
But sometimes it's
a lower expectation,

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.160
and say, that's OK.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.540
But if you want a
job to dance, you

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.179
want to dance for
these larger companies,

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.310
you've got to work at it.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.250
You can't be passive
and just accept

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:22.370
that one view of being labeled
as someone who is deaf.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:25.010
So again, thousands
and thousands of those

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.884
tendus, till you bleed.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:41.000
What I would say was,
I think dance saved me,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.554
being a black deaf dancer.

00:34:45.554 --> 00:34:50.449
But I remember one time,
there was a front page article

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:52.489
that I came across.

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:57.660
And the headline says,
"Antoine Hunter, leading man."

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.570
His body is incredible.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:04.250
Look at those
muscles glistening.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.710
He did an incredible jump.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:11.600
And also, he had
some sloppy feet.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.050
And that was real.

00:35:22.103 --> 00:35:23.270
It was pretty bad, actually.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:24.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.270
Didn't have that great footwork.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:30.650
But it was because prior, no
one at that point previously,

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.380
had been able to address
me directly, and give me

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.450
that feedback.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.840
It's a huge deal in your
profession, in your craft.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.230
But no one told me the truth.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.720
People wouldn't hire me
because of that item.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:50.570
So I had to work
at it, tirelessly.

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.600
And I try to bring that
back to my dancers.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.100
When children come
to my class, I

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.560
don't singly just praise them.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.630
I say, I want more.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.210
Put your hands like this.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:02.450
Copy me.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:06.890
This is another sign in American
Sign Language, represents more.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.620
You know how you teach
those little kids that.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.440
But it's a great word.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.380
Just say, hey, you're doing
great, but guess what?

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.040
I want more.

00:36:24.985 --> 00:36:26.360
So it's one of
those things where

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.230
we want to be taken seriously
as our hearing colleagues,

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.570
and not be viewed as
just a deaf person.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:36.410
Therefore, my product, my
craft will be inferior.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:37.790
My dance will be inferior.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.930
I want to be on par
with those colleagues.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:45.170
Just the fact that we dance,
and can do so at a high level,

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:49.670
as a deaf person,
now you can see

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.850
the meaning and the
metaphors behind my dance.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:00.380
One time, I
choreographed a dance

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:03.215
about a deaf person going
through the justice system.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.520
But they couldn't see the
message, because all they saw

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.640
was, oh, it's a
deaf person dancing.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.000
And didn't see the meaning.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.950
But after that, I
acknowledged, OK,

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:23.570
do they really
understand the message,

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:24.680
and how critical it was?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.660
I don't want to use
the term greedy,

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.250
but yeah, no, I want more.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.580
I want more.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.350
Does that make sense?

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.080
OK, all right.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.360
Thank you for reaffirming that.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.840
- I love that, especially with
students, the work of dance

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.740
is also, that's a
nonverbal equalizer.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.760
That the seeking of that
work across a whole host

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.790
of different ways that
people come to dance,

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:04.110
that that is a very powerful
nonverbal piece to what we do.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:07.440
So when you're
developing choreography,

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.190
what is the process of creating
the movement vocabulary?

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:13.320
We talk about nonverbal
communication,

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.560
and we have physical vocabulary.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.940
How do you create that
movement vocabulary?

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:23.280
Do you have a unique aesthetic
that you work with each piece?

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.750
Or is the body of your
work a certain aesthetic,

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:28.950
and you develop the
vocabulary from there?

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:32.670
How do you develop vocabulary
when you're making new work?

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:42.080
- I would say for me, I'm
fortunate to have American Sign

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.260
Language, which has an
inherent movement to it.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:51.240
You guys saw with fire,
wind, earth, those elements,

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.495
how I was able to incorporate
that within dance.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.375
Music itself is a language.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:08.105
I do a lot of jazz music,
hardcore, Miles Davis.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:15.230
Dizzy.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:17.210
You know those folks.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:18.530
Folks I looked up to.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:22.470
So I would be at home,
turn that music up,

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:25.210
and I would be jamming.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.610
I would then incorporate
that to my soul and my body.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.650
And then I would move.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.900
Some people would say, oh
yeah, as a deaf person,

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.280
you can tell the
vibration, right?

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.870
But when you're
dancing, you cannot.

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.440
You don't have that advantage.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.920
Especially if you're
in a leap or a jump,

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.350
you're transitioning in air.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:45.270
You don't have that ability.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:50.770
But it has to be within
you, and then go with it.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.690
So that's part of the work
that we have to incorporate.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:59.440
It's another way of just
taking the experience

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.580
of the community, and kind
of just breathe it in,

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.470
and expressing that language.

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.900
So it's kind of just a
reflection of what's happening

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.780
globally, and within society.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.980
It's about just being honest
and having that real dialect.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:20.320
Not just the superficial,
and the fairy tales.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.230
But those icebreakers
to really get down

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:28.350
to that real nitty-gritty,
to have those conversations.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:31.930
There's a lot of things that
we don't want to talk about,

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:35.730
therefore we can't
talk about it.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:36.770
But if we start moving.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.470
At one point it was a
very dark process for me.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:48.990
But dance has the power to
heal, from my perspective

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.265
and experience.

00:40:50.265 --> 00:40:52.645
It has the power to bring
a community together.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:00.410
The language of dance.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.348
I mean, I can go deeper
than that, for sure.

00:41:03.348 --> 00:41:04.640
But that's what it means to me.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.910
- Thank you.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:07.050
- I love that.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:10.880
Yeah, I love the music aspect,
and I love those references

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.260
of jazz because.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.600
Tap dancing and jazz
grew up synonymously.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.420
I mean, right next to each
other in this country.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:22.370
So yeah, music informs a lot
of how we start, what groove,

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:30.890
what feeling you want to convey.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:34.310
When I work with other dancers,
I always ask them who they are,

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:38.600
what culture they come from,
what are their traditions.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.890
And I like them to explore that.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:42.500
I, having grown
up in Puerto Rico,

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.230
Latin music is a huge
influence in my life.

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:48.300
I love dancing to it.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.080
And because it brings
me so much joy,

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:56.963
I tend to want to
work with it a lot.

00:41:56.963 --> 00:41:58.880
I think that that's
another way that we reveal

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.240
who we are in our medium,
is by actually bringing

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:06.820
in our traditions,
and how we grew

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.900
And finding those commonalities,
and exploring that.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:14.343
And there's power
in that exploration.

00:42:14.343 --> 00:42:16.760
I worked just recently, I did
a show called Diary of a Tap

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.500
Dancer, and there was a young
tap dancer, super talented,

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.120
his name is Andre Imanishi.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.830
And he's Japanese and
Jamaican, born in the Bronx,

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.560
but grew up in
Japan, and came back.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.180
And he has all of these things.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.292
And he's young, and
he's trying to process.

00:42:34.292 --> 00:42:35.750
He's an incredible
tap dancer, he's

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:36.917
processing all these things.

00:42:36.917 --> 00:42:40.100
And I asked him, I said,
what do you want to bring in?

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.890
And he hadn't
thought about it yet.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.560
And so he thought,
there's the Taiko drum.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.620
And he explored that.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.480
And then, by his exploration,
then he shares it with people,

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.270
and that's just another
way that we all connect.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:00.740
So I think who we are,
literally who we are,

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.360
what our experiences
are, I always

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.640
try to bring that to
what I choreograph,

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.195
and the work that I make.

00:43:08.195 --> 00:43:09.320
I don't know any other way.

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.060
I think it's so interesting.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.090
I love asking people
where they're from.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:16.470
Hopefully I'll get to know
all of you after this.

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.410
But I love that.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:23.580
I just feel like so many people
don't make the effort to have

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.060
an in, to make that connection.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.730
And all it takes is just to
say, where did you grow up?

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:32.812
And then see what
happens from there.

00:43:32.812 --> 00:43:33.520
- Thank you both.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.730
And I'm reminded of a quote,
I think it was Yo Yo Ma.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:39.380
And maybe he was borrowing
the quote, but in any case,

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:43.280
heard it from him,
of art is borderless.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.930
So the experience of the young
dancer you're working with,

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:49.670
dance can--

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.840
it doesn't even observe
those boundaries.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.860
Those are sort of fake
structures of commerce,

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.960
as opposed to the power
of what you're both

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.655
talking about in dance.

00:43:58.655 --> 00:43:59.780
- If I could add a comment.

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:00.630
- Certainly.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:06.680
- For me, the language, it
took time to really develop.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.290
Sign language and dance move,
two combinations together

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:15.620
that people get
like, distracted.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.060
You saw the Africa, what's
a little bit easier,

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.675
because that's in
my DNA for sure.

00:44:20.675 --> 00:44:24.250
The fire, earth, water.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:26.480
It's already in African Dance.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.620
Now ballet, on the other hand.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.500
Well, that's like this.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.830
[LAUGHING]

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:39.920
So I incorporate a lot, and
I try to develop the twine,

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:45.200
and make sure I mix
that to deaf culture.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.200
You know, like, pure, my
language, which you saw.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:53.780
Power, gentle, area, make
sure it's very clear for that.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:56.960
And then plus, hearing
people, to try to get it,

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:01.670
have that respectfully, respect
the technique and the form

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:03.560
that I learned traditionally.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.390
You know, like, respected
like in a emotional way.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:08.390
Honor that past.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:10.910
You know what I mean.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:14.850
But I had a lot of
training from Paul Taylor.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.872
[VOCALIZING]

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.560
And I've never really
want to just do it my way.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.700
No, he gave it to me, and
want to make sure that there.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:34.220
And my language too in
there, but respectfully.

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.170
That takes so much time.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:40.910
I fight with myself with that.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:47.410
It's a debate, where who do I
want to please in my language?

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:50.050
Community or me?

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:52.900
Sometime I have to
say, I love you guys,

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:56.620
but it's about me now.

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.410
And then oh, I want
you guys to learn.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.150
OK.

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:03.340
Fire, water, and that.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.250
I don't understand it.

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:13.640
Ah, I understand it.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.000
You understand it?

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.355
You know what I mean.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.390
Just to continue teaching
myself, and teaching people

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.360
out there.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.740
I think it's really cool.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.230
But whoa, it's
just a lot of work.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.730
- It is.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.430
Well, and I think that's one
of the interesting things

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:39.020
that dance can offer in terms
of nonverbal communication,

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.680
is relationship to time that
is different than our sort

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:46.520
of speedy, phone, digital
culture can offer.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.530
It is a different relationship.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:53.120
It takes so much time
to craft this language.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.410
And it's analog.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.380
No matter how able the body, it
takes the time the body takes.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.870
there's no app to
develop what either

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:02.660
of these two extraordinary
artists are talking about.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.900
And I think that's something
that we in particular can offer

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:09.010
as a kind of antidote
to the speedy, you know,

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:12.490
the sort of lowercase i in front
of everything in our lives,

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:13.145
you know.

00:47:13.145 --> 00:47:15.830
I have two final
questions, one perhaps

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:18.890
we can spend a little time
on, and then a preface

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:22.260
to the second question.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.700
Ayodele, I know that you've
been doing a lot of town halls,

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:29.630
especially with young people
and speaking about identity,

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:30.980
and owning your story.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.500
And Antoine, I know
part of your work

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:37.940
is working with abused
women in your community.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:41.000
And so I wondered if you
might both speak a little bit

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.610
about how you've
used dance in what

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:46.340
can seem like an unlikely way.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:50.480
How have you used this language
to transfer beyond the field

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:50.980
itself?

00:47:53.528 --> 00:47:54.570
- That's a good question.

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:04.670
It all seems so connected.

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:07.104
I just feel like--

00:48:07.104 --> 00:48:10.740
I mean, it's kind of like
what I was saying the last,

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.660
about Andre, for
example, young dancer.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:21.200
Always, for me, when I
work with young people,

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:26.750
especially young people of
color-- black, Latino, brown--

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:31.430
I'm constantly.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:41.780
Jeanine Tesori, who's one
of my mentors and friends,

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.450
when she won the Tony, she
said, you know, for young women,

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:46.040
you have to see it to be it.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.630
You know, you have
to see it to be it.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:51.470
And I think that I'm
so aware of like what

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:54.430
my own experience was,
growing up in the Bronx,

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:56.870
and when I came
back to New York.

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:59.120
I remember going to my
guidance counselor, and saying,

00:48:59.120 --> 00:48:59.983
I want to go to NYU.

00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:01.400
And the first thing
he said-- this

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.233
is a person who's
supposed to like, guide me

00:49:03.233 --> 00:49:05.000
to the next thing,
and encourage me.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.060
He said, oh, that's a very
hard school to get into.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.940
And I also remember--

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.400
so when I got in, he was
the first person I went.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.880
I was-- bam.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.530
Take that.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:22.850
But because society was
constantly telling us

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:27.650
that we weren't as intelligent,
or our communication

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:29.150
skills weren't great.

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:31.580
Our language wasn't enough.

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:36.800
The way we looked, we didn't
measure up to what was popular.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:41.270
There was no representation
whatsoever on screen.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:42.200
Or very, very little.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:46.550
Rosie Perez was the only
Latino actress at the time.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.842
And that was my only reference.

00:49:47.842 --> 00:49:49.467
I would talk, and
people would say, oh,

00:49:49.467 --> 00:49:51.200
you know, you remind
me of Rosie Perez.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.450
I don't think I look
like Rosie Perez.

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:56.780
Nor did I think I really
sounded like her exactly.

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.760
But I just felt how
limiting that was.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.030
How limiting it was that that
I kept getting these things.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:06.252
And so, not wanting that to
be anybody else's experience.

00:50:06.252 --> 00:50:08.210
And also having seen my
life, and where my life

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:11.420
has gone despite all of that.

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:14.810
right despite those stereotypes,
and despite those expectations

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:16.448
or lack thereof.

00:50:16.448 --> 00:50:17.990
I feel like every
time I get in front

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:20.300
of a room with
young people, I hope

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.130
that I am that
person that they go,

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:26.780
oh, I'm not just my
corner of my block.

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:32.780
I'm not just the string of
bodegas where all they offer

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.850
is, you know,
$0.25 potato chips.

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:37.910
And you know, there's
no Whole Foods in sight.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.820
You know, our communities
don't look like you

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:41.900
know wealthy communities.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:46.370
And so I want them to know
that they can be anything

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:47.480
they want to be, right?

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.130
And then part two
is that they already

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:51.590
hold that dance, social dance.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.870
Those kids, they have it down.

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:54.830
I mean, they teach us.

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.465
You know, we were downstairs
doing all kinds of nae naes.

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.800
But they have it in them,
they have it in them.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:09.410
So I feel like I'm always trying
to let them know that they

00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:11.780
are their own source of pride.

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:18.640
And that anything
that they create

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.710
will most likely be
copied, because I

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:25.150
feel like a lot of black culture
is co-opted very, very quickly,

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:27.170
and brought to the mainstream.

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:31.430
So I think that's in short.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.784
- I'll try to be really short.

00:51:36.784 --> 00:51:42.610
I remember there was a
father, that my son is a boy.

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:46.480
And, he was like, "I'm a girl."

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.280
Well, father, no,
my son is the boy.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.720
And everyone's coming
out of nowhere,

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.730
jumping in the conversation,
jumping in the conversation,

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:58.270
and going, ladies and
gentlemen, boys and girls.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:00.610
They decide you when
to create a ba, ba, ba.

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:04.300
You come over here, you come
over here, you come over here.

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:07.040
I'm here to tell you, it
don't have to be that way.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.860
You can choose
your own identity.

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.360
You can be he or she or it.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:16.870
Or maybe a spider, or maybe a
butterfly, or maybe a unicorn.

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:18.865
Because with that
connection with yourself,

00:52:18.865 --> 00:52:21.640
it helps you understand
yourself better,

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.730
able to love yourself better.

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:28.000
That ability can connect
parent to children, teacher

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.680
to student, boss to worker.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.670
Connecting, the beautiful thing.

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:37.450
To learn about
yourself is growth.

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:41.440
When you take the time
to listen, and listen,

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.670
you grow together
in the community.

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:49.110
Then that understanding,
there won't be so much war

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:50.920
with each other.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.040
And with ourself, because we
keep telling, fight, fight you,

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.600
my identity.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.070
This is who I am,
that's who I am.

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:00.165
Listen to me.

00:53:00.165 --> 00:53:02.290
They decide to try to tell
me I'm hearing impaired,

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:03.160
I need to be fixed.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.800
But I say, I'm deaf,
and I'm beautiful.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.450
That's who I am,
that's my identity.

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:11.600
Please love me for who I am.

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:16.610
That father, he
had a second look.

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:18.760
He had the time to think.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.160
I don't know what the
change happened after that.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:25.690
But I saw a process, you
know, something going on.

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:27.900
Because he was so resistance.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:31.280
The movement in
me, with the dance.

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:37.765
I think, better than hearing
it, he saw, bah, bah, bah.

00:53:37.765 --> 00:53:41.080
And it have to be grow.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.840
It was outside, it
outside the show.

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.590
And having the communication.

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:51.466
I hope something positive
came out from it.

00:53:51.466 --> 00:53:53.160
That's one example.

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:53.950
- Thank you.

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:55.810
Thank you.

00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:59.350
To give a little context
to the final question.

00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:01.750
We've been talking about
our collective mission,

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:05.560
both here at the Dance Center,
but also these two colleagues

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.810
have helped to advance
that mission here.

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:11.650
But also, this is a collective
mission that we share,

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:15.940
and sort of our calls
to action collectively.

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:17.780
So to give context to
this last question,

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.470
we're thinking about what
creates the conditions

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:25.510
and spaces for humanity,
equality, and dignity for all.

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:29.620
What constitutes
welcome in a space?

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:32.740
What is what the ICA
now, and many people

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.810
are calling a radical welcome?

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:37.030
What is the embrace look like?

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:39.970
Not in a singular way at
a learning institution,

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:41.350
or where we're teaching.

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:44.710
But what is embrace look
like for everyone we want

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:48.280
to embrace, which is everyone?

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.980
Thinking about how does
dance make a true incursion

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:52.790
into the culture?

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:55.780
How do we support,
champion, advocate,

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:58.572
activate, expand, foster--

00:54:58.572 --> 00:55:01.030
and that word always reminds
me of Professor Deborah Foster

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:02.447
who is here in the
audience, who's

00:55:02.447 --> 00:55:04.930
a phenomenal artist
and educator--

00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:08.470
fostering progressive cultural
change in the field of dance,

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:10.330
and in the greater culture?

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:13.570
And how can we learn
from this enterprise?

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:15.640
How can this
extension and exchange

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:20.080
through and with our field
expand knowledge in our field,

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.230
create the change in
our field, and create

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.780
greater cultural change?

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.540
And then promoting agency
for students, artists,

00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:31.960
student artists, professional
dancers, choreographers,

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:36.460
audiences, communities,
citizens, our fellow neighbors.

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.320
And a few quotes.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.470
From Dr. Cornel
West, "Deep education

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:44.170
requires a habitual
vision of greatness."

00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:48.985
I would say these
two exemplify that.

00:55:48.985 --> 00:55:50.860
And I know we're short
on time, so I'm trying

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:53.500
to truncate on the fly here.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.750
Dr. Cornel West
also says, "You have

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:59.380
to be a thermostat rather
than a thermometer.

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.290
A thermostat shapes
the climate of opinion,

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:06.130
a thermometer just reflects it."

00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:08.290
Rabbi Joshua Heschel,
"Our goal should

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:12.125
be to live life in
radical amazement.

00:56:12.125 --> 00:56:14.500
Get up in the morning and look
at the world in a way that

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.720
takes nothing for granted.

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.580
Everything is phenomenal.

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.410
Everything is incredible.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.450
Never treat life casually.

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:26.290
To be spiritual
is to be amazed."

00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:28.390
Two last dance quotes.

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:32.500
Judith Jamison, who is a dancer,
choreographer, and director.

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.190
"You have to dance unencumbered.

00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:38.140
There is no other way to move.

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.570
The idea of dance is freedom.

00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:45.280
It is not exclusiveness,
it is inclusiveness.

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.190
Dance is bigger than
the physical body.

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:50.020
When you extend
an arm, it doesn't

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:53.320
stop at the end of your fingers,
because you are dancing bigger

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:54.280
than that.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.410
You are dancing in spirit."

00:56:56.410 --> 00:57:00.040
And I would say, in an
ecumenical non-denominational

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:00.910
way.

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:03.940
And then lastly, Pina Bausch,
who's a choreographer famously

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.610
said, "I'm not
interested in movement.

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:09.070
I'm interested in
what moves people."

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:13.720
And so to that end, I ask
you both what moves you?

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:22.265
[LAUGHING]

00:57:22.265 --> 00:57:22.890
- Those quotes.

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:31.820
- I mean, first of all, get
out, get out there in the world.

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.100
And just copy me.

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.670
There.

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:13.270
For me, this is a way
to tell the world,

00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:19.190
and to state emphatically
about inclusion.

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:22.910
Being part of one energy.

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:25.300
We don't have to be isolated.

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.610
But together, being one.

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:32.610
And together, not single
flames of a candle,

00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:36.560
but together, being
one fire of energy.

00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:38.090
As I've said before,
dance is a way

00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:41.360
to communicate to the world,
communicate with ourselves

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.900
internally, no matter the
demographic or the dynamic.

00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:54.530
We have to be careful in knowing
there's so much to learn,

00:58:54.530 --> 00:59:03.760
whether it's movement, that
dance that we all can express

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.000
is individual.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.220
It's individualized.

00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.590
Therefore it's
unique, so you have

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:10.510
to have a relationship with it.

00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:14.390
You have to embrace it.

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:16.340
So take time to
listen to yourself,

00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:20.060
have a conversation with
yourself through art.

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.320
Do you understand?

00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:30.120
- Thank you.

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.747
- I love that so much.

00:59:31.747 --> 00:59:32.580
I love that so much.

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:34.673
I was going to say, I
think what moves me--

00:59:34.673 --> 00:59:36.840
and I don't think I've ever
really articulated this,

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.030
but I feel it often.

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:43.320
What moves me, I
love, to this day,

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.258
I love putting on my tap shoes.

00:59:45.258 --> 00:59:46.800
I get like a little
kid, I can't wait

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.990
to like lace it
up, and hear what

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:50.370
the first sound is going to be.

00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:53.040
I'm that in love with it.

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:58.530
But what moves me is
the power that it has.

00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:02.118
To know that we enter
a room, and that nobody

01:00:02.118 --> 01:00:03.660
knows what's going
to be experienced.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.330
Some people are
skeptical, or tired,

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:09.550
or you know, maybe not
really into the dance

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:12.150
thing that's going to happen
after such a long day.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:15.450
And that by the end of the day,
by the end of that experience,

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:18.540
and that exchange,
that you lean in,

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:21.760
that you lean into what
it is that we are sharing.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.550
That A, you see
yourself, and you

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:26.130
see that it sparks
something in you.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:35.050
And that that you start to look
at art and artists differently.

01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:37.270
Not as this thing,
this performance thing

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:40.330
that's out there, but as
something that we share,

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:43.690
and that we're all
in it together.

01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:45.480
I love that.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.990
- I'm moved by both
of you, and truly,

01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:51.460
to have this
opportunity to be here.

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:52.470
Thank you once again.

01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:54.990
And I think we can turn
it over to a few questions

01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:56.760
from the audience.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:01.620
Should we make sure that we can
translate or interpret properly

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.500
with questions?

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:05.610
Well, there's a
mic here, perfect.

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:07.470
And perhaps we can use--

01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:10.690
choreographer Liz Lermon is a
big inspiration to all of us

01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:11.190
here.

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:16.680
And she has a process called
critical response process

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.900
for artistic process.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:22.170
And in giving feedback,
and asking questions,

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:26.040
I wonder if we might consider
not having an embedded opinion,

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.830
but offering an opportunity
to answer a question that

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:31.360
would be an exchange.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.080
So fire away, anyone
that has any questions.

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.040
- Hi.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:36.850
- Hi.

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:39.512
- You mentioned
that dance was very

01:01:39.512 --> 01:01:41.470
helpful for you in learning
how to communicate,

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:44.260
but also a way of
feeling less isolated.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.870
And I'm just wondering
what you think

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.470
the relationship between dance
and mental health could be,

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:52.300
or potentials you see in that.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.332
- Do either of you want to--

01:01:57.810 --> 01:01:58.535
- Great question.

01:01:58.535 --> 01:02:00.285
I think it would have
a tremendous impact.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:11.390
I can recall one woman, and
she had very unique challenges

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:16.580
in trying to find
strategies for coping,

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.920
and for managing her
stress and anxieties.

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:28.370
So she started in movement,
just weird movements.

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:31.820
Not really choreographed,
just movements, sporadically.

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.240
And I spoke with someone
earlier here today,

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:43.360
actually, sometimes that
we just over think things,

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.930
and you're just in the hustle
and bustle of the city.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:52.630
But thinking outside of this
urban, crazy, hectic area.

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:56.020
Just visualize taking
a peaceful nature

01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:01.750
walk, just away from
that hustle and bustle.

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:04.210
Just something as simple as
that can have such an impact,

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:08.530
and be so helpful, just for
an individual to feel free.

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:15.460
Free to move, not to be judged,
and not to be restricted.

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:19.240
And be able to evoke
those various emotions.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.870
And it's powerful, whether it's
happiness, joy, sadness, fear.

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:32.490
And if you don't, it's almost
like a feeling of being insane,

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:36.050
and you need to
express yourself.

01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:38.298
And it's so helpful
for so many people

01:03:38.298 --> 01:03:39.590
when it comes to mental health.

01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:48.530
I've seen people who are
trying to physically learn

01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:51.200
to walk again, they're going
through physical therapy,

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.992
and perhaps it's not
being successful.

01:03:53.992 --> 01:03:55.700
But guess what, here
comes that movement.

01:03:58.948 --> 01:03:59.490
I've seen it.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:09.210
And that starts that process.

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:11.415
And then, walking
again because of dance.

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:18.570
- I would say it's also a
community practice for the most

01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:19.260
part.

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:22.320
There are times when we get
in the studio and work alone.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.870
But I've seen the effects,
both even as professionals,

01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:28.050
even for us to get into
the room and start moving

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:30.870
helps our mental health too.

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:33.810
I think being in motion
actually sometimes helps

01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:37.440
to clear some of
those thought clouds,

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.308
and the anxiety around thinking
about what might happen.

01:04:40.308 --> 01:04:41.850
And especially with
students, I would

01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:46.230
say it's particularly impactful
for being a de-stressor.

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:48.060
Because you're with
others, and there's

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.400
a kind of vulnerability,
and a tenderness

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.530
to being in that
physical practice

01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:54.360
with other people in
a safe environment.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.960
That can be really helpful.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.630
And I think that's
transportable.

01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:59.940
You don't have to be
in a particular place

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.600
to create that with a group of
people, it could be anywhere.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.070
Do you have anything?

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.460
- I echo both of those things.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:10.970
I agree, dance.

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:12.300
- Hi.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.890
I'm very, very
grateful to all of you.

01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:21.140
I'm an artist also, I'm
a classical musician

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.230
and a pianist.

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:25.770
I also improvise in other
styles, and I love dancing,

01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:27.600
and I totally agree
with it rhythm

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:31.260
is at the bottom of so
much of what we are,

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.900
and how we connected the
universe, and to each other.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:41.720
I also grew up as an
oppressed minority member

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.750
where I came from.

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:44.940
I'm an Armenian from Turkey.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:48.960
And I got into
classical music partly

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:55.860
because Armenian identity was
so suppressed, and oppressed,

01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.170
and co-opted, I think.

01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:01.680
I mean, this is making
me think of that.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:06.800
But I also do agree that
it is possible to express

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:14.490
all the universal feelings and
experiences through any medium

01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:20.130
that one works on
and tries to master.

01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:22.300
And I have I do have a question.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:27.390
A problem I have since becoming
politically more aware and more

01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:32.040
active is that I find myself
often compelled to get

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:37.980
into the verbal arena,
and want to investigate,

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.440
want to look at things,
you know whether it's--

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.320
usually it is hidden,
deceitful things--

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.850
whether it's at the town level
or at the national level.

01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:48.570
It's not what is obvious
that everyone is discussing,

01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:52.620
but little things that
are being glossed over.

01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:57.200
And I find that distracting
to my self as an artist,

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.640
as somebody who
just wants to be.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.810
And I also like to write about
science, but that's different.

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:06.390
That's kind of it
connected thing.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:12.120
I just want to
know if any of you

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:17.670
have felt a similar
conflict of expressing

01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:25.022
political involvement
verbally, and in an alone way.

01:07:25.022 --> 01:07:28.830
And not only through your art,
and how you have resolved that

01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:29.670
conflict.

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:30.510
Thank you.

01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:33.220
- Thank you.

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.860
- I mean, I think
there's probably not

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:40.850
a person in this room that can't
relate to that feeling of going

01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:44.930
down the rabbit hole
of social media,

01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:48.247
where you start engaging with
people you don't even know.

01:07:48.247 --> 01:07:49.955
You want to let them
know what you think.

01:07:49.955 --> 01:07:51.830
[LAUGHING]

01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:54.040
Next thing you know, your
hair is standing on end,

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.780
you're like, who am I?

01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:00.080
And I think that that's
just part of life,

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.700
and how can you avoid that?

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:08.640
But I will say that you
have to go back to your joy.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.740
That's how I do it.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:16.710
I have to physically remove my
self away from the computer,

01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:19.569
and into a space that
I know is healthy,

01:08:19.569 --> 01:08:20.910
that will reinvigorate me.

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:27.220
And that will just sort
of fill up the joy meter.

01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:36.040
Because along with that is the
sanity, and the love, and the--

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.779
I don't know.

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:39.092
You can't ignore that.

01:08:39.092 --> 01:08:41.050
And you can't neglect
that, that's what I mean.

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:42.620
You can't neglect it.

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:47.833
And so always go back to--
go back to your music.

01:08:47.833 --> 01:08:49.000
Because I feel like that's--

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.819
when we operate from that
place, is where we can actually

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:54.010
make the most change, right?

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:56.229
I feel like we can't really--

01:08:56.229 --> 01:09:00.279
if you're tight,
it's hard, you know.

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:02.534
If you're open.

01:09:02.534 --> 01:09:03.534
- Yeah, joy is generous.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:10.600
I think we have time for one
more question as the clock goes

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.100
zero.

01:09:13.768 --> 01:09:15.310
- First I just want
to say thank you,

01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:18.189
just to witness not just
the technical proficiency,

01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:20.470
but beyond that, the
exuberance with how you dance

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:21.729
was a joy to behold.

01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:24.729
So thank you for
sharing that with us.

01:09:24.729 --> 01:09:27.003
I'm a psychiatrist by trade.

01:09:27.003 --> 01:09:28.420
And one of the
things that I do is

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.810
I work with professional
musicians that have dystonia.

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:35.109
And when that happens, there's
a break in the ability to play.

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:38.620
And since artistic communication
through music for them

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.689
is an inherent part
of their identity,

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:44.109
I wanted to draw the parallel
for, as a professional dancer,

01:09:44.109 --> 01:09:44.920
for you.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.440
What if come tomorrow,
you all of a sudden you

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.229
lost the vehicle of your mode
of communication, your identity.

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:51.700
You couldn't dance.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:54.535
How would you tap into that
same exuberance and joy,

01:09:54.535 --> 01:09:56.410
and that mode of
communication would you use?

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.480
- It's a great question.

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.700
Do you want to--

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:06.940
It's a scary question too.

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:14.610
Oh you're thinking.

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:15.110
OK.

01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:19.140
No, it's OK.

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:29.720
- I mean we don't have to
think to dance, but move.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.700
Move.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:35.240
You know, to breathe is to move.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:39.680
Like the fish, when it
sleeps, it's still moving.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.750
The gills, they're still moving.

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:43.330
You know what I mean?

01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:51.760
So the molecules in
everything, it's alive.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.700
There earth's constantly moving,
whether you hear it or not,

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.338
whether you feel it or not.

01:10:57.338 --> 01:10:58.630
It's still shifting and moving.

01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:06.530
I think awareness,
whenever the challenge is,

01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:12.400
continue to look at
what's happening.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.490
Keep looking at that.

01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:16.280
What's that feeling,
what's that growing?

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:20.750
My community, with people
with disabilities, who's deaf,

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:29.176
we're constantly exploring our
own movement, our own words.

01:11:29.176 --> 01:11:33.960
When you find it,
that's your truth.

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:37.545
That's your key.

01:11:37.545 --> 01:11:39.170
People trying to take
my sign language,

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:41.860
and that's the way,
say, that's not dance.

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:44.810
But the truth is, it was mine.

01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:47.760
I had to own it, and
teach then, why it's mine.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.670
You know what I mean?

01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:54.360
I'll leave it like that.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.565
- I mean, I think finding
community would be--

01:11:57.565 --> 01:12:03.180
joy is not career-specific.

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:07.050
So I think it would depend
on the ability, could

01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:08.670
be continue to move or not.

01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:15.540
But even then, that feeling,
that soul craft of joy,

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.890
you know it when you feel it.

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:19.480
So to find, maybe it
would be a redirection,

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.910
but it would be community.

01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:24.360
And I think we cultivate
that so much as dancers

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.040
of our community, and wanting
that to extend beyond it as

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.330
well.

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:33.660
So I think finding
those shining eyes that

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.220
resonate with the
same kind of joy,

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.600
I think it would be
something in there.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.010
But thank you for
the opportunity

01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:39.330
to think about that.

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:43.170
It's at once daunting and
vulnerable, and also important.

01:12:43.170 --> 01:12:46.620
And I think with that, I'll hand
it over to Professor Kuriyama

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:47.250
once again.

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:49.480
But thank you so
much for being here.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.170
Thank you for the opportunity
to be here, Ayodele and Antoine.

01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:53.910
Thank you to our interpreters.

01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:56.760
Thank you also.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:57.850
The floor is yours.

01:12:57.850 --> 01:13:00.646
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:08.440
- So to conclude, I want to
teach you one Japanese phrase.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:12.250
Probably most of you
haven't studied Japanese.

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.350
But if there's one phrase--

01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:15.893
it isn't sayonara.

01:13:15.893 --> 01:13:16.739
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:20.920
It's a little more complicated,
but you can repeat it with me.

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.540
Ichi-go ichi-e.

01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:25.020
- Ichi-go ichi-e.

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:26.468
- Ichi-go ichi-e.

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.180
- Ichi-go ichi-e.

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:31.900
- And what it means,
it's an expression

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:32.905
from the tea ceremony.

01:13:32.905 --> 01:13:37.330
And it literally means one
encounter of one lifetime.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:40.330
And it expresses the
idea of the tea ceremony,

01:13:40.330 --> 01:13:43.420
where, your tea
master serves tea

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.090
to a small number of guests.

01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:50.080
And sometimes they're
the master's friends.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.380
But the idea is that you
serve, and you concentrate

01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:58.420
in the ceremony as if this
is the one and only time

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:01.600
that you'll be able
to do this, right?

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.380
And you treat each encounter
as a precious thing,

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:07.420
as lasting for a lifetime.

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:10.180
I think this last
session exemplified

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.710
precisely that spirit.

01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:16.000
And I think it's true
for all of our speakers.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.910
And I'd like to first
thank all of our speakers

01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:24.740
for being such wonderful
presences with us today.

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:28.870
I'd also like to thank
Becky Wasserman, who,

01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:31.990
you can't imagine the
incredible other work that she

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:34.680
put into making this possible.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.619
So I'd like to give a big hand.

01:14:36.619 --> 01:14:39.930
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:45.020
I'd like to thank all of you
for coming, and certainly

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:47.090
for staying to the end.

01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:51.500
I know many of you have
wanted to discuss more

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.170
with our presenters.

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:57.890
And so I'd like to invite
you all now to the reception

01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:00.620
to pursue further
conversations, and engage more

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:02.730
with our presenters.

01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:04.250
So thank you all very much.

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.450
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:09.400
[MUSIC PLAYING]
