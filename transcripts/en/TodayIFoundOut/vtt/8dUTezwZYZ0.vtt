00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:20.240
At first glance the idea of the UK being simultaneously
addicted to both trashy soaps and tea to such

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.789
an extent that the country’s national power
grid experiences a massive surge of usage

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.030
every time one ends seems like it must be
a gross exaggeration stemming from a pair

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.410
of stereotypes.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.210
As it turns out, though, this is not only
a readily observable phenomenon in the UK,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.019
but it’s such a normal part of daily life
for the National Grid operators that they

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.920
have to keep track of what’s going on in
the plot of upcoming popular soaps and other

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.199
shows to help predict ratings.

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.530
They also keep TVs in office to watch said
shows so they can see precisely when a given

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.769
episode ends.

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.960
This is all necessary in order to keep the
power grid fully operational during the very

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.320
brief surges.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.429
This phenomenon, officially dubbed TV Pickup
by the engineers at the National Grid, is

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.780
largely thanks to a unique combination of
the UK Citizens’ long standing love affair

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.130
with soap operas, the country’s enjoyment
of a good cup of tea (and more recently instant

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.310
coffee), and the almost universal adoption
of electric kettles throughout the UK (a relatively

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.899
power intensive device, typically using around
1,000-1,500 watts).

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.770
The result is that for about 3-5 minutes after
the end of a popular show, there’s a rather

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.170
large uptick in demand for electricity across
the country.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.610
As you probably guessed, this is roughly the
amount of time it takes to boil a full kettle

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.190
of water in such an electric kettle.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.909
The reason why these surges pose such a large
problem is because, to quote an energy operations

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.439
manager from the National Grid, Alan Smart:

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.450
The way to think about it is to imagine you
are in your car and your challenge is to keep

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.929
the car at exactly 50 miles an hour.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.869
You press on the accelerator as you go up
the hill, and you ease off on the other side.

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.149
We can’t store electricity in any great
quantity, so we have to forecast second by

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.929
second, minute by minute.

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.140
In a nutshell, the system as it stands today
has limited capacity to ramp up electricity

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.240
generation fast enough to deal with large
unpredicted surges and it’s quite expensive

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.050
to dump off excess electricity from the grid
if overproducing.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.360
For instance, even newer nuclear and coal
plants can take hours to ramp up to full capacity

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.800
and hours to ramp back down, with older plants
even less nimble, sometimes taking more than

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.690
a day for such a ramp up.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.150
Diesel and gas plants are much faster (and
much more expensive), but still need several

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.480
minutes to a half hour to ramp up.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.501
So how do the engineers deal with the demand
placed on the grid by as much as 1-2 million

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:41.111
electric kettles being switched on at more
or less the exact same time and only for a

00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:42.111
few minutes?

00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:46.450
In short, as previously mentioned, the National
Grid first starts by pre-planning, keeping

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.290
track of what major sporting events are coming
up as well as what’s going on in various

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.060
shows and general time tables of when said
popular shows will probably end; this is an

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.870
extremely tricky thing with sporting events,
but even for TV shows it’s a difficult proposition.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.880
While the BBC does give the National Grid
the times when the shows are scheduled to

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.790
end, these are rarely perfectly accurate-
and perfect accuracy is what the grid operators

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.350
need to prevent brownouts or overproduction
of power.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.900
With all this entertainment information, and
using data from previous years, what they

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.580
know of how weather affects power usage (and
generation, with the UK projected to have

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.190
30,000 Megawatts of wind power alone by the
early 2020s), etc., their energy forecasters

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.430
come up with the estimated power demand throughout
a given day, including potential spikes and

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.430
lulls.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.490
They then prioritize where they’ll be getting
the needed power from in order of expense-

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.370
cheapest power sources first for a given area
of the grid.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.001
However, even with all this pre-planning,
as previously mentioned, there is simply no

00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:47.440
way to ramp up the power fast enough for these
TV Pickups using the normal base-line sources,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.820
unless they just wanted to expensively dump
the excess created before and after the spike

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.660
just to accommodate the 3-5 minute surge.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.410
So how do they keep the kettles on at a relatively
reasonable price?

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.400
They maintain a series of power stations that
are equipped with pumped storage reservoirs.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.350
These (essentially) hydroelectric “batteries”
are capable of going from zero to peak production

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.720
in under a minute.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.360
They do this by releasing massive amounts
of water stored high up to power generators

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.360
below.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.329
For instance, Dinorwig Power Station in Wales
has one of the fastest response times of any

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.970
pumped storage facility in the world; they’re
able to take the power output from nothing

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.210
to maximum production- about 1800 MegaWatts-
in roughly 16 seconds.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.760
If necessary, they can then sustain that for
approximately six hours before the water runs

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760
out.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.450
At night when usage is low and electricity
is at its cheapest (remember, they prioritize

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.540
energy production based on cost- so as demand
dies, more expensive sources get turned off),

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.220
the operators have the water pumped back up
to the storage zone.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.510
For long term generation this is relatively
expensive electricity compared to many base-line

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.510
sources.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.120
On top of that, these reservoirs are largely
supposed to be reserved for major outages

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.540
(and thus only used when strictly necessary
otherwise).

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.250
However, these stations also provide the engineers
a great way to keep the grid seamlessly operational

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.210
during brief spikes, like TV Pickups, where
ramping up base-line sources just to service

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.560
a few minutes would be a bit of an overkill,
or in the case of an unexpected spike, an

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.560
impossibility.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.880
As for exact timing, engineers have small
televisions tuned to the various TV channels

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.220
so that they can note the exact moment popular
shows end and use the seconds it will take

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.090
viewers to walk to the kitchen to initiate
production of the excess power that they expect

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.090
they’ll need.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:40.139
You can see this in action in this clip from
a BBC documentary, Britain from Above, where

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.060
the engineer reacts to the ending theme of
the soap, Eastenders, so that he can ensure

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.680
the frequency of the grid remains as close
to 50 Hertz as possible.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.020
So how big are the TV Pickups?

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.139
The largest TV induced spike occurred in 1990
directly after the semi-final World Cup match

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.180
between England and Germany, which was watched
by an estimated 25-26 million people in the

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.180
UK.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.210
(For reference, at the time the country’s
population was estimated to be about 57 million.)

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.120
The match ended in a penalty shootout, meaning
that almost half the country was watching

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.520
a live event to the end, with that end’s
timing being unpredictable.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.419
Needless to say, the National Grid operators
had their eyes glued to the match as well.

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.020
When it did end in a German victory, an estimated
1.2 million Britons headed to the kitchen

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.080
to drown their sorrows in a cup of tea, to
the tune of an almost instant demand of an

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.860
additional 2,800 Megawatts of power from the
National Grid.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.120
For reference here, the normal total demand
on the entire grid during peak times that

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.919
time of year is about 40,000 Megawatts.

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.020
(And if you’re curious, “peak of peak”
on the grid in the year is roughly 60,000

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.020
Megawatts.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.500
On the other end, in the night in the summer
usage typically drops to closer to 20,000-25,000

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.500
Megawatts.)

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.169
Runner’s up for largest TV Pickups include
directly following a January 22, 1984 airing

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.830
of The Thorn Birds (2,600 Megawatts), the
World Cup quarter-final between England and

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:03.510
Brazil in 2002 (2,570 Megawatts), the end
of the Royal Wedding of Prince William and

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.371
Kate Middleton in 2011 (2,400 Megawatts),
and the end of an episode of the popular soap

00:07:09.371 --> 00:07:15.610
Eastenders revealing which character shot
another in 2001 (2,290 Megawatts).

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.320
Thankfully for the awesomely titled Energy
Forecasters at the National Grid, the rise

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.241
of streaming services like Netflix and BBC
iPlayer among other on demand services, as

00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:29.180
well as increased usage of time-shifting recording
devices, has resulted in a noticeable drop

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.949
in the size of these TV Pickups.

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:34.930
It’s thought that the combination of more
of such media being made available to consumers

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.370
in this way will eventually put an end to
this somewhat unique British phenomenon.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.020
However, the National Grid still reports that
although popular shows no longer (usually)

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.710
cause as large of a surge in demand as they
once did (with reports from 2016 indicating

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.150
that average spikes at the climax of shows
today are about a third of what they were

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:58.220
15 years ago), the National Grid still regularly
see spikes of 200-400 Megawatts after popular

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.220
shows.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.580
And if a given episode is particularly hyped
for whatever reason, such as season or series

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.710
finales, the TV Pickup will generally be closer
to 700-800 Megawatts.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.410
In either case, this is more than enough to
cause power grid problems if they’re not

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.790
addressed immediately by grid operators.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.550
National Grid representatives also note that
major sporting events and the like still have

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.419
the power to pull the massive spikes of yore
when they end and citizens head to the kitchen

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:23.790
for a good cuppa.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:29.419
Contrary to what you might think, the highest
tea consumption per capita is not found in

00:08:29.419 --> 00:08:35.969
the United Kingdom, but rather Turkey at 7.682
kg per person per year.

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:40.450
The U.K. rings in at number 5, and has actually
been on the decline of late, with a 6% drop

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.069
in tea sales in the last year alone in the
U.K., which has only continued the recent

00:08:45.069 --> 00:08:46.069
trend.

00:08:46.069 --> 00:08:49.102
On the flipside, coffee sales are rising in
the U.K. at about the same rate as the tea

00:08:49.102 --> 00:08:51.860
sales are falling annually.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.980
The TV Pickups don’t always go as planned.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.149
For instance, the National Grid once anticipated
a massive surge in demand following an episode

00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:02.610
of the popular reality show, The Great British
Bake Off, directly after it was moved from

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.240
BBC2 to BBC1 in 2014.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.420
However, according to a representative from
the National Grid “Nobody in the entire

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.339
country moved from the TV screen.

00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:12.660
There was no pick-up at all.”

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.430
You see, at the end of the show the first
week when they expected the spike, the BBC

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.839
scheduled a nature documentary just after
it featuring baby pandas.

00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:23.529
From the lack of spike, it would seem most
everybody stuck around to watch the pandas

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:27.420
frolic in the immediate aftermath and then
slowly ceased watching over time rather than

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.310
one massive migration to the kitchen.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.379
Another big surprise was the November previous
during the airing of The Day of the Doctor,

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:38.209
which had a massive audience (over 10 million
people watching live in the UK).

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:44.689
But, as energy forecaster Jeremy Caplin noted,
the predicted TV Pickup inexplicably didn’t

00:09:44.689 --> 00:09:45.999
occur.

00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:48.720
TV shows aren’t the only events that can
cause weird power spikes.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.990
For instance the largest spike of all time
on the National Grid occurred on August 11,

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:58.910
1999 directly following a solar eclipse, where
a massive 3,000 Megawatt spike was observed

00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:59.910
for a few minutes.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:05.360
A half hour before the eclipse, the total
demand across the entire grid was about 35,500

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.360
Megawatts.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.700
During the eclipse, usage dropped to about
33,000 Megawatts.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:27.269
A few minutes after the eclipse ended, it
was up just over 36,000 Megawatts.
