[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.170
BOB MEESE: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.500
My name is Bob Meese.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.840
As Tod said, I'm the head of
games business development

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.760
for Google Play.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.520
And I'm here to
talk to you today

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.800
about running a successful
games business with Google.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.820
I'll primarily talk about
two different things--

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.980
so talking about the various
Google services that we believe

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.780
are most helpful
to game developers

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.080
in building your business.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.460
And then I'll also highlight
some of the best practices

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.410
from the various developers
in the ecosystem.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.720
And I want to thank the
developers that helped

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.240
me put together that material.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.910
So let's begin.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.610
And first you'll see some of the
slides that many of us present.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.636
Greg presented this too.

00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:44.260
But there's a couple
reasons why you'll

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.090
see these over and over again.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.655
And one is because they're
very important metrics that

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:51.110
lay the foundation
for the platform,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.024
and also because we're
very proud of some

00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:54.690
of these accomplishments
of the platform

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.410
overall that we've achieved
with all of your help.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.590
But first, you should
all know that Android

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.950
is a very big platform.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.260
There's more than 1 billion
monthly active Android users

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.950
globally now, which creates a
huge opportunity for everyone.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.830
As we've said, more than
three in four of those people

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.674
are playing games.

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:14.340
And so when you combine
those two facts,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.820
you have a huge user base--
many of whom are playing games.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.570
That's the largest
group of people playing

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.120
games on any platform ever.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.409
And then finally what that
translates then to you--

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.200
last week we announced
that we had paid out

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.730
more than $7 billion to
developers over the past 12

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.520
months.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.865
So there's a very clear
commercial opportunity

00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:32.740
for developers today.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.480
And that number keeps
rising and rising.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.950
And so in terms of the
main agenda for today,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.990
I first want to share a few
tips on working with all of us.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.890
Then I want to talk
about recommendations

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.130
that we have across the life
cycle of all of your games,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.400
from development to
operation of all your games.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.620
So first working with us--
here's the team we're growing.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.730
So if I had shown you this
slide three years ago,

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.660
it would have been just
Yoshiko and myself.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.900
It was just the three of us.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.770
But now here's the team.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.870
A couple of key points to
mention in the Bay Area here.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.530
Mountain View would've been
hiring some world-class game

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.930
experts in APAC.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.970
What started with just
an office in Japan

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.950
has now expanded into Korea
and Taiwan in Southeast Asia.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.754
And Europe-- we're growing
the team there as well.

00:02:23.754 --> 00:02:26.170
Unfortunately, Mobile World
Congress is this week as well.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.860
But Adema is still here
to join us from Russia.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.020
And then we should note that
we hired Regina late last year

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.620
as our head for Latin America.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.380
And we've recently expanded
to a new continent.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.680
And so the key message here
is that wherever you are,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.472
we're hiring people and
building teams to support you.

00:02:44.472 --> 00:02:46.680
And I also want to talk
about expanding our developer

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.750
support as well, too,
because hiring people is not

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.930
the end goal.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.590
It's important that we
improve our online tools

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.990
because email and
LinkedIn inboxes can't

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.390
be the final answer to this.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.840
for us, I know that it's hard
to manage that overall process.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.040
And so I want
everybody to know here

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.550
that we're investing in
our online tools that

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.260
help us further qualify new
developers that we work with.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.450
And so if you go to this
short link right here,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.290
you can fill out a
short form that'll

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.340
help us better work
with all of you.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.840
And the key point
here is that we're

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.880
investing in improving
the overall communication

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.571
channels between Google
and the developer community

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.695
because we really do care
about everyone's success.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.367
In terms of the life
cycle of game development

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:36.450
in the various Google
services and best practices,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.850
first I want to start
with pre-launch.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.392
And so pre-launch is you're
about to launch your game.

00:03:41.392 --> 00:03:42.850
You haven't yet
launched your game.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.450
You hopefully have this
mountain of traffic

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.710
that's about to come your way.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.292
And game launches are
getting bigger and bigger.

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:50.750
And at this moment,
you really want

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.110
to make sure that you've
tested your game fully

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.192
so that if you're
lucky enough to get hit

00:03:55.192 --> 00:03:56.650
by this mountain
of traffic, that's

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.850
a positive experience that
doesn't crush your game.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.940
And we will note that
the game launches

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.900
are becoming bigger and bigger.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.270
They're in some cases even being
compared to Hollywood movies.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.370
I was talking to
Wooga recently, who

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.272
launched a big game last week.

00:04:11.272 --> 00:04:13.480
And they'll be featured
later on in the presentation.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.896
It was the first game that
they had launched in 18 months.

00:04:15.896 --> 00:04:18.240
They actually spent 18
months developing this game,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.329
but they had talked about
all of the activity that

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.078
was going into it.

00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:22.930
They invested all that time.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.510
And now that it was launching,
they had a big budget.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.399
They had a big press outreach
plan that was happening.

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:29.940
And they said 18
months ago when they

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.460
had launched their
previous game,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.820
all they did was publish the
game and issue a press release.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.900
And so we definitely see
these launches changing--

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.270
becoming bigger and bigger.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.800
And so in that environment
it's even more important

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.600
that developers are doing proper
beta testing for the games.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.060
And so in this case we do
offer Google Play beta testing

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.810
as a key offering.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.800
It's been around for a while.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.050
But it's very important to us.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.175
We want to encourage as
many developers as possible

00:04:55.175 --> 00:04:56.000
to use it.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.660
And so in terms of some of
the basics of that service,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.020
it is a private, invite-only
beta testing group

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.820
that helps you all work on play
testing and technical readiness

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.070
of your games.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.260
We really focus on the
communication channels

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.170
that we both enable and
disable during this process.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.382
And so it's important to know
that ratings and reviews don't

00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:19.340
exist during this time.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.780
It's not appropriate
during the beta test period

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.430
that people be able to publicly
rate and review their game.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.010
And so that's impossible.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.760
However, we really do
optimize the channel

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.920
between the beta testers
and the developer itself.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.070
This is all enabled
through Google Groups.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.360
And we really focus on having as
much communication as possible

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.450
between testers and developers.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.700
And then we should note that
two tracks are available.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.465
And so we have both an alpha
and a beta testing track

00:05:43.465 --> 00:05:44.840
in case developers
wanted to have

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.921
multiple versions of their games
being tested at the same time.

00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:51.420
So as I mentioned, this service
has been around for a while.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.270
We want more
developers using it.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.390
We're seeing some developers
like Matt and Ralph

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.710
from Vector Unit that have
Google Play beta testing

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.130
as a standard part
of their workflow.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.120
And we want to see more and
more developers have this state.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.960
They're also nice
enough to-- in November,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.970
they wrote a blog
post for GammaSutra

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.290
that provided a lot of
detail on their experience

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.680
with Google Play beta testing.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.810
So I encourage all of
you to go check that out.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.070
In terms of this summary
in a quick slide,

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.454
they encouraged a
lot of developers

00:06:24.454 --> 00:06:26.870
to think about a couple of
different things-- one of which

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.575
was really choosing
your audience wisely.

00:06:29.575 --> 00:06:30.950
And so in their
case, I mentioned

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.640
they did both an alpha
and a beta channel.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.240
But they found that the beta
channel was much more popular

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.870
just because the game was
more stable in that channel.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.090
And so in their case
in the alpha channel,

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.490
it was a more unstable process.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.990
And so their friends
and family were

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.070
very happy to use that version.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.630
But they noticed that the
vast majority of players

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.510
were on the beta channel.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.190
Also, setting expectations
early is very important.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.150
And so there it is important to
know that your beta testers are

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.340
using software that can
be unstable in some cases.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.774
And so it's important
to lay that foundation.

00:07:04.774 --> 00:07:06.190
Also, it's very
important that you

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.064
let people know that
you really want feedback

00:07:08.064 --> 00:07:09.350
during this process.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.680
And so being very
clear, the part

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.195
of the exchange
on the players is

00:07:13.195 --> 00:07:16.950
to provide as much clear and
detailed feedback as possible.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.560
And then, finally, this
beta testing process

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.030
is all about feedback.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.910
And so encouraging as
much feedback as possible

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.570
is really the goal.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.070
Here there are things that
you can do as a developer

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.490
to help enable it as well too.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.830
And so within the forms, if you
can reply very quickly to posts

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.060
to help your
community feel alive.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.490
Matt and Ralph found that was
really valuable-- and even

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.335
going so far as to
thank those people that

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:42.300
are leaving critical
feedback, as long as it's

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.442
constructive and
detailed and clear,

00:07:44.442 --> 00:07:47.025
because that's really what you
want out of this whole process.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.030
Next I'll talk about
pre-registration.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.250
And so as I talked
about with beta testing,

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.390
there's going to be
a group of people

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.950
who want to play your game
no matter what state it's in.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.980
But pre-registration is
largely about that next group

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.870
of people-- the fans that
want to play your game as

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.350
soon as it's publicly launched.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.120
And so the basic part
of pre-registration

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.060
is a way for you to notify
the fans of your games

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.680
when your game first
becomes available.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.120
And also our APAC team
has been telling us

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.790
about pre-registration
for a while.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.290
It's a practice that's
very popular in leading

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.782
markets like Korea and Japan.

00:08:25.782 --> 00:08:28.240
And we believe that it is a
practice that will increasingly

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.480
be popular worldwide.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.580
Here are a few examples
in Korea and Japan.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.299
On your left, there's an example
of a small Korean developer.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.360
In case your Korean
is not as good

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.710
as those who are in Korea,
what's being offered here

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:52.070
is there's an offer of about
$10 of in-app items for free

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.860
for anybody who pre-registers
the game before launch.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.050
This game is about
to launch very soon.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.810
And this small
developer has already

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.480
registered 10,000
people for the game.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.160
And so for a small developer to
have that momentum for launch,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.800
it's a big advantage
versus someone

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.866
who hasn't gone
through this process.

00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:10.240
And then on your
left, you'll see

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.570
Konami, who's a very
successful Japanese developer.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.150
And this is an example of
pre-registration for their game

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.449
"Power Pro Baseball."

00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:18.990
And you might see
on the bottom here,

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.320
you can see one,
three, five, and ten.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.000
And so these are
different tiers or targets

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.780
to pre-register, in total,
10,000, 30,000, 50,000,

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.840
and 100,000 people.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.080
And if those goals
are met, you can also

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.370
see a cascade of
various in-app items.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.470
And if those goals are met, all
of the pre-registered players

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.970
will receive those
items at launch.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.300
And so this creates
a referral system

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.330
that encourages pre-registered
players to go get their friends

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.300
to also pre-register.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.030
And so that's one of the
more intermediate systems

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.860
within pre-registration.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.390
And so this is a quick recap.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.180
Pre-regristration-- so
the basic functionality

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.170
is notifying your fans
that the game has launched

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.580
and offering them
some type of reward.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.980
A more intermediate system is
introducing referral systems

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.530
so that people
have an opportunity

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.560
to invite others and spread
the word for your game.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.450
And then, finally, there's
even some more advanced systems

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.240
where they have
interactive events

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.380
with Japanese
developers, including

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.230
gotcha mechanics in the games
that allow players to win

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.930
rare items in the game,
so they have an advantage

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:30.240
even before the game launches.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.115
Next I want to talk
about user acquisition.

00:10:33.115 --> 00:10:35.240
Here there's many things
that developers are doing.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.730
But we bear some of the
responsibility as well.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.840
And so when we think about
the Play Store listing page,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.900
we did a nice redesign last
year basically adopting

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.960
the material design principles
within the Play Store itself.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.380
You can see "Leo's
Fortune" pictured both

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.250
on the left and the right--
the left before the redesign

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.030
and then the right
after material redesign.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.750
And what you'll
notice is that there's

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.690
several of the elements on
the page that are really

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.273
helpful to learn more about the
game that are brought to life.

00:11:03.273 --> 00:11:06.230
And so here on the
right, the video

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.440
that's featured right
there at the top.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.100
And then, also, the
short description

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.040
at the bottom that's
above the fold

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.970
is very visible as
well, too, is really

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.460
called out in more
prominence in the new design.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.950
So going into a bit more
detail on the listing pages,

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.820
the icon, as many developers
know, is very important.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.000
You put a lot of time and
effort into your game.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.100
It's important that
your icon reflect

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.664
the quality of your
game and the creativity

00:11:32.664 --> 00:11:34.330
and the personality
of the game as well.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.220
And with Leopold here, I
think that this developer's

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.770
done a great job.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.777
On the right here
with the description

00:11:40.777 --> 00:11:42.360
it is important to
quickly communicate

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.170
the value of the game
to your audience.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.980
And so here I'm
adventuring through

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.460
a gorgeous, handcrafted world
to recover your stolen gold.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.810
It sounds pretty good to me.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.810
I think the developer
has used that space well.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.300
On the bottom here, video,
as we were talking about,

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.200
is very important.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.480
It's the best way to
capture the attention

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.100
of your potential audience.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.520
And then to
complement the video,

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.930
we have screenshots
on the right here.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.820
In these screenshots,
you can do other things

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.855
like layering on text here.

00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:10.480
So in this case, the
developer's really

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.110
focusing on some of the
critical acclaim and the awards

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.440
that they've won.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.160
So we find that to
be very valuable.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.310
Next, I want to talk about a
best practice of A/B testing

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.260
icon design before
your game goes live.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.550
And so here, this
is an example of Glu

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.520
and their game
"Deer Hunter 2014."

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.680
And so in this case, they
had all these different ideas

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.396
and permutations on what
their icon could look like.

00:12:33.396 --> 00:12:35.770
They really wanted to make
sure that they were converting

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.020
as many people as possible
from the store listing page

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.902
and just the people who had
viewed the icon down to those

00:12:41.902 --> 00:12:42.860
who installed the game.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.450
And so through that
process-- through A/B testing

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.890
of the various icon
types-- they ended up

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.580
with the version of
the icon at right.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.100
And you'll notice if you
check out the game now,

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.800
this A/B testing continues
through launch as well.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.765
They have a fully
different version

00:12:57.765 --> 00:13:00.160
of the icon than any of these
right now in the game too.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.630
And so being very thoughtful
about your icon in A/B

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.810
testing it and optimizing for
conversion is quite important.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.530
Next, I'll keep it
short and sweet.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.230
But we encourage you
as a best practice

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.830
to keep your file sizes small.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.047
We notice a clear
correlation between the games

00:13:15.047 --> 00:13:16.630
that have smaller
file sizes and those

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.060
that get the most installs.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.910
And so please, if possible, try
to keep your games below the 50

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.480
megabyte OTA limit.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.070
Next, I'll talk about the Google
Play referral flow report.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.236
And this is something where
developers often ask us.

00:13:29.236 --> 00:13:31.424
They say, I would love
to know more about what

00:13:31.424 --> 00:13:32.840
is happening during
the conversion

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.280
funnel in the Play Store.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.350
I'd love to know how many
impressions I'm getting

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.076
and how that's
converting to installs.

00:13:39.076 --> 00:13:41.450
Some developers don't know
that's actually available now.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.940
And so what you need
to do to do that is you

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.760
connect your Google
Analytics account

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.030
to your Google Play
Developer Console account.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.160
And by doing that,
you can get data

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.040
about the number of
impressions that you're

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.980
getting to your Play
Store listing page,

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.660
the number of installs
you're getting

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.840
from Play-- the number of opens
that you're getting from that.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.930
So it's a valuable
source of data

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.690
that I don't think enough
developers know about.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.560
And so I wanted to
highlight that here today.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.110
Also.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:10.310
it's very exciting.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.170
I made an announcement last week
about sponsored search results

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.790
and Google Play.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.490
It's a pilot that we'll roll
out in the next few weeks.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.750
And so I should note that it's
still a very early stage pilot.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.900
We don't have a timetable
for greater roll out.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.680
But over the long
term, it is a project

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.210
that we're very excited about.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.090
And then finally
in this section,

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.750
video as I've talked about
is a very engaging medium.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.830
YouTube is obviously a great
source of video content.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.760
And so here we see
developers saying

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.080
that video is working
for them in general

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.060
and that Machine Zone
has gone a step further.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.480
And they said that the players
that they are acquiring

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.390
through YouTube are higher-value
players than any other video

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:49.890
platform.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.460
And so it's something that
the developer should certainly

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.139
be looking at.

00:14:55.139 --> 00:14:56.930
That's it for the user
acquisition section.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.960
Next up is engagement retention.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.760
And so here I had
mentioned Wooga earlier.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.735
But they're really an
example of the best practice

00:15:04.735 --> 00:15:07.740
of frequent content updates
to help engage and retain

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.610
your players.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.970
And so this is Jens here
saying, "Like the best

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.470
TV, in 'Agent Alice' we deliver
a new episode every week."

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.390
They have really found
that investing in story

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.870
is really important for
them-- that the narrative

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.060
of their previous games has
been one of the elements

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.360
that their core players
and their target audience

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.960
really enjoys about the game.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.900
And so it builds up a sense of
expectations and anticipation

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.470
that keeps players coming back
over a very long time period.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.300
And that's the goal.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.150
And so just a quick, one-slide
overview of Wooga's most

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.760
recent game, "Agent Alice."

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.870
And so here you can
see on the upper-left,

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.310
as Jens mentioned, they take
a TV series approach where

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.140
a new episode of the game
is available every Thursday.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.610
They keep players coming back
and expecting that new episode.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.230
On the upper-right, you can
see that the developer layers

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.850
on a variety of
different length arcs.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.580
And so you have the
core weekly arc that's

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.810
built around the episode.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:06.060
But then you have the
mid-arcs of the games.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.330
And so you have Agent Alice
Wallace and all of her friends

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.070
and all of the various
things that they're

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.770
doing in the game that keeps
people engaged over a longer

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:15.562
time.

00:16:15.562 --> 00:16:17.770
And then, finally, you have
the main arc of the game.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.240
And so Wooga is building this
game and staff and the content

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.742
production of it
to last over years.

00:16:23.742 --> 00:16:25.450
And so it's really
important that there's

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.160
a way to connect that basic
weekly cycle with a much

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.810
longer time horizon.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.510
Of course, I should note
that investing in content

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.170
like this is not cheap.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.580
And so here Wooga is investing
20 person hours a week

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.780
into content production.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.430
So while this is a very
effective strategy,

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.499
it comes at an expense.

00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:48.040
But what that provides a very
rich character set in the game.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.810
And so they have more
than 100 characters

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.570
already in the game at launch
with three new characters

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:53.420
coming every week.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.930
So I think this example
of Wooga's "Agent Alice"

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.920
is a great example of frequent
content updates as a way

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.917
to engage and
entertain your players.

00:17:02.917 --> 00:17:05.250
Next I want to talk about
Google Play Games or our games

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.464
network, which is
growing very rapidly.

00:17:07.464 --> 00:17:09.089
One of things that
we're excited to see

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.637
is that Google Play games is
becoming an essential part

00:17:11.637 --> 00:17:12.720
of more developer's games.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.960
More developers are adopting
the services overall.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.365
And that's helped fuel
the overall growth.

00:17:17.365 --> 00:17:18.740
And one of the
things that we see

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.510
is that signed-in
players are consistently

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.609
more valuable than other players
within developer's games.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.190
And as Ben and others
have talked about before,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.760
we're investing into adding
more and more services on top

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.490
of the core of Google
Play Games to make

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.950
the services increasingly
valuable over time.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.730
So here is Oliver from
Hothead Games saying

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.410
that Google Play Games have
become an essential part

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.700
of their games.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.070
And when you think
about why that is,

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.120
here's one of their games,
"Rivals at War-- Firefight."

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.830
And they point out that sign-in
players have 30% greater

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.050
playtime per player and 2.3x
greater premium currency spent

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.080
per DAU.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.820
And when you're seeing
results like this,

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.150
that really helps people
understand that there's value

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.340
in implementing these services.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.080
Also, I'd like to do a quick
recap of player analytics.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.790
It's something where
Ben presented it now

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.480
and John Burge will actually
give a lightning talk on it

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.147
in a little bit.

00:18:13.147 --> 00:18:14.979
But it's something we're
very excited about.

00:18:14.979 --> 00:18:16.570
I want to go into
a bit more detail.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.340
And so as we talk about,
there's managing targets.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.160
And so what happens here is that
you're setting revenue goals

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.140
and you have a
daily feedback loop

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.720
to be able to check your
progress against those targets.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.950
You can identify hotspots.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.330
And so we help you compare
your game to similar games

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.240
and identify areas where your
game is doing particularly well

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.356
and areas where
you have some gaps.

00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:38.230
And then, finally,
understanding your players

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.290
and so getting a
better sense for when

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.320
people are leaving
your game and where

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.550
people are leaving your game.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:49.900
And so here the core of player
analytics is a set of reports.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.060
And so as we showed here,
managing your targets

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.020
with the business
drivers dashboard,

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.669
identifying your hotspots with
the business drivers report,

00:18:58.669 --> 00:19:00.710
and understanding your
players with the retention

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.030
table in the player
progression report.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.030
So as I said, we'll go
into more detail on that.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.529
But it's something
where it's early,

00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:09.270
but we're very excited
about the potential here.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.530
Within managing targets,
you set a revenue goal.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.712
You can check daily progress.

00:19:14.712 --> 00:19:16.670
If you're exceeding your
goals, which is great,

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.990
then you may even
consider raising them.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.400
But if you're not
hitting your goals,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.730
then you want to
look for hotspots.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.780
And that's where we move
into identifying hotspots.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.610
And so here one of the key
benefits of player analytics

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.820
is comparing your game to
similar games across a variety

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.090
of different cohorts
of players who

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.510
have been in the game for
various amounts of time

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.090
and across various key
metrics like engagement

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.140
and monetization--
and there being

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.790
able to drill down for each
of these different cells that

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.300
are there-- each state
is in one of five states.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.219
So from deep red if you're
underperforming to deep green

00:19:54.219 --> 00:19:55.260
if you're overperforming.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.380
And so we provide
you with a quick way

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.690
to visualize your relative
performance in your segment.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.560
And then finally looking
at understanding players.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.900
So having the retention
table to understand

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.150
when your players are leaving
the game-- how long they

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.297
are sticking around.

00:20:09.297 --> 00:20:10.880
And then the player
progression report

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.749
to understand how many
achievements players are

00:20:13.749 --> 00:20:15.540
completing before
they're leaving the game.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.140
And so as I said,
this is something

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.389
that we're very excited about.

00:20:18.389 --> 00:20:20.760
And we encourage everybody
to look into player analytics

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.130
when it's available
in a few weeks.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.940
Next thing I want to talk
about-- monetization.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.850
And so here, like I said,
it's an important number

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.829
that we're very proud
of that last week we

00:20:31.829 --> 00:20:33.370
announced that we
paid out $7 billion

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.850
to developers over
the past 12 months.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.250
One of things that
has fueled that growth

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.860
has been our investment
in the payments platform.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.010
And so here, as we
mentioned, we're

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.350
investing in relationships
with direct carrier billing,

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.320
expanding our gift card
support, and introducing

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.120
Paypal in the last year.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.090
Just a bit more
detail on that too.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.720
So direct carrier billing
is now available in 32

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.010
different countries.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.770
And one thing to note there
is that since about the middle

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.170
of last year we really
focused on where

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.600
are the regions where we most
need direct carrier billing?

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.480
And so since the
middle of last year,

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.470
we've turned on a half dozen
countries in Southeast Asia

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.850
to help improve the
monetization of that region.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.640
In the case of Google
Play gift cards,

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.570
they are now available in
28 different countries.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.330
If you're not
following this closely

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.650
as some of the people on
that team, at this time

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:26.180
last year, only seven countries
had Google Play gift cards.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.940
And so in the course
of one year, there's

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.330
been a 4x increase in the
number of countries that are

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.580
Google Play gift card enabled.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.570
And so that's feeling big
advantages and improvements

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.300
in the overall
payments platform.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.508
And then, finally, Paypal
which only became available

00:21:39.508 --> 00:21:41.142
in the last year is
now available in 19

00:21:41.142 --> 00:21:43.350
different countries focused
on the parts of the world

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.805
where Paypal is most popular,
including Western Europe

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.524
and North America.

00:21:48.524 --> 00:21:50.190
Next I want to talk
about premium games.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.750
So as you can see from
the top grossing charts,

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.059
in our purchased games,
free-to-play games

00:21:57.059 --> 00:21:58.600
are driving most of
the top grossing.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.030
But that does not mean that
it's the only thing that

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.100
succeeds on the platform.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.070
And so for us, you look
at what are the games that

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.319
are most successful right now.

00:22:05.319 --> 00:22:06.380
And you have "Minecraft."

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.846
You have "Trivia Crack"--
the paid version--

00:22:08.846 --> 00:22:10.470
and you have "Five
Nights at Freddy's."

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.950
And those are three examples
of recently successful premium

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.140
games.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.950
What we believe is that even
if this category of games

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.940
is not the major driver
of platform revenue,

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.560
we really do believe
that there are

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.081
many developers out there that
love creating premium games.

00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:27.830
And we believe that
there are many players

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.370
in the platform that love
playing premium games.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.980
And so it's important
for us that this category

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.050
continue to exist and do well.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.860
And so I just wanted to leave
you with those two things

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.860
that if you're
making premium games,

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.110
we believe that the
category is important.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.070
And so know that.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.380
But also know that if
you look at the trends,

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.760
even if you look at "Minecraft"
in its top grossing rank,

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.730
it has declined over
the last year or so.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.140
So just recognize that the
overall trend in monetization

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.650
is not with you,
but that we want

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.099
to find ways to support a very
healthy ecosystem measured

00:22:58.099 --> 00:22:59.890
a bunch of different
ways and that includes

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.848
premium games being
successful in the platform.

00:23:04.129 --> 00:23:05.670
Furthering the story
on monetization,

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.110
I next want to talk about ads.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.360
And so here we want developers
to have the flexibility

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.800
to monetize through
in-app purchase,

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.549
through upfront payments
in premium games,

00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:14.450
and also through advertising.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.670
Here we'll call out that AdMob
is the largest mobile ads

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.790
platform in the world with
more than 650,000 app and game

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.940
developers monetizing
with AdMob every month,

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.920
including some of the
notable game developers

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.780
at the bottom of the page here.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.450
And so clearly there's this
great momentum behind AdMob.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.530
Talking about how
developers earn with AdMob

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.100
and some of the momentum.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.410
And so we're seeing
growth in CPMs

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.400
over time, which is a
great sign of the health

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.521
of that ecosystem.

00:23:44.521 --> 00:23:46.520
And the developers are
earning significant money

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.040
with ads as well with
more than $1 billion

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.210
being paid out over
the last two years.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:55.240
Also, we're investing in
making it easier for all of you

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.470
to get AdMob into
your games, including

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.337
the creation of plug-ins getting
into game engines like Unity

00:24:00.337 --> 00:24:00.920
and Cocos2d-x.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.800
Next I want to talk about
international-- a very

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.383
important topic when you think
about those billions of devices

00:24:09.383 --> 00:24:12.110
that are out there with
Android, many of them

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.880
are obviously not
in this country.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.592
And so developers
ask us what are

00:24:15.592 --> 00:24:16.800
the most important countries?

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.180
What are the countries
that are growing

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:18.920
that I should be targeting.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.920
And here's a couple of
different categories.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.080
So developers may be familiar
with the largest revenue

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.930
markets, but maybe not as
much with those countries

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.420
where you have the largest
install base or the fastest

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.680
growing install bases.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.300
And so the countries in
those latter two categories

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.410
of large install
bases-- fastest growing

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.810
install bases-- are countries
like Mexico and Brazil

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.839
and Turkey,
Indonesia, and Russia.

00:24:40.839 --> 00:24:42.880
So if you're not targeting
those countries today,

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.490
we encourage you to do so.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.070
We're seeing a great
amount of growth there.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.260
And really when I talk
about how developers

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.950
start to expand
internationally, I

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.370
was having a really good
conversation with a leading

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:55.880
developer on Friday.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.030
And they talked about
how they had expanded

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.470
their international strategy
over time where it was really

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:02.620
a three-step process.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.510
At first they were just
focused on succeeding

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.550
in their domestic market.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.920
And they felt they were doing
a good enough job there.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.690
And so then they started
to expand internationally.

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.180
But the second
stage for them was

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.270
going international where it
was kind of an even approach

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:16.820
everywhere.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.970
And that's not something that
can always be successful.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:23.270
Some games are
lucky enough to be

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.630
able to address all
international audiences fairly

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.730
evenly, but this developer was
calling out the third stage

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.040
that they were at
right now as targeting

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.680
international
audiences, but really

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.290
thinking very specifically
about each one-- the way

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.690
that their games should
be different in Brazil

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.660
versus Russia, for example,
because those audiences are

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.040
obviously different.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.180
And they want and deserve
different content.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.380
And so with that I'll go
into a bit more detail.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.620
It's always interesting
to look across the world

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.100
about the games that are
popular on Google Play

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.050
and start to assess how you
might think about your games

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:58.410
and which markets are relevant
for you given your game.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.880
But in the United States-- we
see a great amount of diversity

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.810
still in the United States
with games from casual games

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.770
to strategy games to
social casino games

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:12.370
to action RPGs-- from developers
all across the world--

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:16.560
European developers, US-based
developers, developers

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.300
in Israel-- developers in Asia.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.730
So we certainly believe that
success in the United States

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.250
is still a goal for many
different developers.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.710
So that's part of what
fuels the diversity

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.420
and the greatness
of the content here

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.380
is that developers
from all over the world

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.431
are trying to be successful
in the United States.

00:26:34.431 --> 00:26:36.180
Next, if you look at
Google Play in Japan,

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.470
you'll notice "Monster
Strike" and "Puzzle &amp; Dragons"

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.730
have been doing very, very
well there for awhile.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:45.670
And so you'll learn that
the Japanese love dragons.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:49.370
But then you'll also notice
that combining different game

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.690
systems is actually
quite important.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.860
So with "Puzzle &amp; Dragons,"
taking a puzzle game and adding

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.370
RPG elements is
really significant.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.760
With "Monster Strike,"
taking an RPG and adding

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.870
slingshot mechanics is
their path to success.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.680
So more complex gaming
systems that are combined

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.150
has been quite popular
in Japan for some time.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.800
One thing we will note too
is Japan really stands out

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.250
for being a relatively
tough market

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.040
for international
developers to crack.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.990
If you look here, you're seeing
a whole bunch of Japanese games

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.880
plus "Clash of Clans."

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.260
But even in the
case of Supercell,

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.310
while they've had
some success in Japan

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:31.330
relative to some of the other
markets where they've been in,

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.430
even for them it's
not easy to get there.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:35.570
So it's something
where as attractive

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.560
as the Japanese market could
be, the Japanese developers

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.530
have set the bar very high.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.387
And the Japanese
consumers have grown

00:27:42.387 --> 00:27:43.470
accustomed to those games.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.640
So it's important to be
very thoughtful in terms

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.300
of launching into Japan.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.190
In terms of Korea-- so here,
historically, the Korean market

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:54.160
has focused on a bunch of
cute characters and animals

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.090
in its games largely through
the success of local developers.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.690
However, that is
starting to change

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:04.550
with more and more international
games seeing success in Korea.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.230
One example is Supercell
with "Clash of the Clans,"

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.471
where we could feel very
tangibly that whenever

00:28:11.471 --> 00:28:13.970
"Clash of Clans" hit number one
top grossing in that market,

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.110
that it did start
to change perception

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.930
in an exciting way
about the opportunities

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.580
for international developers
to succeed the local market.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.060
And it is actually
having an impact

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.870
on some of the strategies
and tactics of how developers

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.260
promote their games
in Korea where there's

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.200
a lot more TV and out-of-home
advertising that's

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:31.780
taking place.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.190
And it's influencing a
greater number of developers

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.740
to have bigger
campaigns themselves

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.270
in this local market.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:39.960
Next we'll focus on Taiwan.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.530
Taiwan, if you'll notice here,
there's a great diversity--

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.500
again, similar to the
US-- where there's

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:48.480
Japanese games, Korean
games, local Taiwanese games,

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.210
Western games, Chinese games.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.280
There's a lot that's here.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.080
One funny characterization
too has been

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.240
Taiwan is the Canada of APAC.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.890
And we say that as
a way for developers

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.520
that are looking to
beta test their games,

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.740
it's a great first landing spot.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.170
If you're looking to
target APAC overall,

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.340
Taiwan can be a great
test market for you

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.180
because, obviously, there's
a great diversity of content

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.880
that this audience
is interested in.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.350
If you're looking to
acquire some of these users,

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.930
prices in Taiwan
are still cheaper

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.630
than many other markets.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.050
And then finally in
this section, in Russia,

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:28.820
there definitely are some
differences in certain markets.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.592
Russia is very characteristic
in terms of the games that

00:29:31.592 --> 00:29:32.300
are played there.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.040
And so you'll see
a greater focus

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.490
on hardcore games in Russia.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.270
And so you do have "Hay
Day" here, but outside

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.170
of that, not much casual games.

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:41.750
In the top of the
charts in Russia--

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.450
a greater focus on some of
the best games that are there

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.340
domestically and in terms of
a "World of Tanks" and war

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.020
gaming.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.170
But in general there's
some clear themes

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.860
towards more hardcore gaming
in markets like Russia.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.940
And so if that's what
you make, that's great.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.773
However, if that's not
your games are about,

00:29:57.773 --> 00:30:00.850
then you may want
to look elsewhere.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.100
So anyway, I really hope
that this was valuable to you

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.990
in terms of tips
for working with us

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.490
and the various recommendations
that we have across the life

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.860
cycle of your games in terms
of pre-launch-- in terms

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.440
of user acquisition-- in terms
of engagement and retention,

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.355
monetization, then
international.

00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:17.313
And I really encourage
you guys to stick around

00:30:17.313 --> 00:30:20.530
for the lightning talks,
which will happen very soon.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:21.820
And just thank all of you all.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.736
We'll be around through
the course of the day.

00:30:23.736 --> 00:30:26.111
So I hope you enjoy the
Goggle Developers Day today.

00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:30.930
