00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.220
So we have our scale again.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.892
And we've got some masses on the
left hand side and some masses

00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:05.850
on the right hand side.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.580
And we see that our
scale is balanced.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.540
We have the same total
mass on the left hand side

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.450
that we have on the
right hand side.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.000
Instead of labeling the mystery
masses as question mark,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.309
I've labeled them all x.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.600
And since they all have an x on
it, we know that each of these

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.770
have the same mass.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.220
But what I'm curious about
is, what is that mass?

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.060
What is the mass of
each of these mystery

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.660
masses, I guess we could say?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.970
And so I'll let think
about that for a second.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.140
How would you figure out what
this x value actually is?

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.870
How many kilograms is the
mass of each of these things?

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.760
What could you do to either one
or both sides of this scale?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.760
I'll give you a few seconds
to think about that.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.040
So you might be
tempted to say, well

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.810
if I could end up with just one
mystery mass on the left hand

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.900
side, and if I keep my scale
balanced, then that thing's

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.400
going to be equal to whatever
I have on the right hand side.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.750
And that part would actually
be a true statement.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.640
But then to get only one
of these mystery masses

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.890
on the left hand side, you
might say, well why don't I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.390
just remove two of them?

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.594
You might just say, well
why don't I just remove--

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:15.260
let me do it a good
color for removing--

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.780
why don't I just remove
that one and that one?

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.030
And then I'll just be left
with that right over there.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.470
But if you just
removed these two,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.740
then the left hand side
is going to become lighter

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.580
or it's going to have a lower
mass than the right hand side.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.350
So it's going to move up
and the right hand side

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.232
is going to move down.

00:01:32.232 --> 00:01:33.940
And then you might
say, OK, I understand.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.232
Whatever I have to do
to the left hand side,

00:01:36.232 --> 00:01:37.690
I have to do to
the right hand side

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.390
in order to keep
my scale balanced.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.220
So you might say,
well why don't I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.440
remove two of these
mystery masses

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.801
from the right hand side?

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:46.300
But that's a problem
too because you

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.810
don't know what this
mystery mass is.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.420
You could try to
remove two from this,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.669
but how many of these blocks
represent a mystery mass?

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:53.540
We actually don't know.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.990
But you might then
say, well let's see,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.920
I've got three of
these things here.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.850
If I essentially multiply
what I have here by 1/3

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.010
or if I only leave a
1/3 of the stuff here,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.090
and if I only leave a
1/3 of the stuff here,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.820
then the scale
should be balanced.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.390
If this has the
total mass as this,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.470
then 1/3 of this
total mass is going

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.710
to be the same thing as
1/3 of that total mass.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.480
So let's just keep
only 1/3 of this here.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.792
So that's the equivalent
to multiplying by 1/3.

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:26.500
So if we're only going
to keep 1/3 there,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.130
we're going to be left with
only one of the masses.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.150
And if we only keep
1/3 here, let's see,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.140
we have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.110
nine masses.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.330
If we multiply this by 1/3,
or if we only keep 1/3 of it

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.880
there, 1/3 times 9 is 3.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.750
So we're going to remove these .

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.580
And so we have 1/3
of what we originally

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.927
had on the right hand side
and 1/3 of what we originally

00:02:48.927 --> 00:02:50.010
had on the left hand side.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.170
And they will be
balanced because we

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.470
took 1/3 of the
same total masses.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.610
And so what you're
left with is just one

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.900
of these mystery masses,
this x thing right over here,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.370
whatever x might be.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.182
And you have three kilograms
on the right hand side.

00:03:05.182 --> 00:03:06.640
And so you can make
the conclusion,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.223
and the whole time
you kept this thing

00:03:08.223 --> 00:03:12.456
balanced, that x is equal to 3.
