00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.059
We live in a pretty cool neighborhood: the
Milky Way galaxy. We’re out in the suburbs,

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.120
sure, but it’s still an interesting place,
buzzing with activity. Stars, nebulae, stellar

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.590
clusters of various sorts, the occasional
supernova. It’s a happening place.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.260
In the earliest part of the 20th century,
astronomers were just starting to figure this

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.210
all out. But there were a handful of objects
that were puzzling: Dotting the sky here and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.630
there were faint fuzzies displaying a variety
of shapes. Some were round, some elongated,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.430
and some even seemed to have spiral arms.
Even with big telescopes they looked smoky,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.210
so they were simply called “nebulae.”

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.370
Their existence was puzzling, though. What
were they? How did they form? Were they big,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.010
small, near, far? Eventually, astronomers
had uncovered the key to these objects, and

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.399
in one fell swoop our Universe got a lot bigger.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.969
A LOT.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.319
In 1920, there were two competing ideas about
the Universe. One was that our Milky Way was

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:14.130
IT, and that everything we saw was in it.
The other was that the “spiral nebulae”

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.610
seen in the sky were also like our Milky Way;
“island Universes” in their own right.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.910
Two astronomers debated this controversy in
that year. Harlow Shapley argued that the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.250
Milky Way was all there is, while Heber Curtis
was of the opinion that we were one of many

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.920
galaxies. It wasn’t a debate as such; more
of a presentation of ideas. And there was

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.000
no clear winner; both sides had fragmentary
data and – we now know – some shaky observational

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.130
evidence that turned out not to be correct.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.270
For example, Shapley noted that one of the
spiral nebulae had been seen to rotate, so

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.880
it must be small. It turns out that was just
wrong, dead wrong. On the other hand, Curtis

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.039
noted that if galaxies were as big as Shapley
claimed – hundreds of thousands of light

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.590
years across – then other galaxies must
be impossibly far away. But, HELLO, galaxies

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.360
really are that big, and they truly are mind-numbingly
distant.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.470
The observation that finally unlocked this
mystery was made just a few years later when

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.040
Edwin Hubble and Milton Humason observed the
great spiral nebula M31 in Andromeda, using

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.140
what was at the time the largest telescope
in the world. They found dozens of pulsating

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.900
stars in it, literally stars that changed
their brightness in a regular, periodic fashion.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.620
These are called Cepheid variables, and they
were critically important, because it was

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.260
known that the time it took them to pulse
was directly related to their luminosity,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.360
how much energy they emitted. That means if
you can measure their period, you can determine

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.240
how far away they are simply by measuring
their apparent brightness.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.360
The distance they found to M31 was 900,000
light years: Clearly outside even the largest

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.350
estimates of the size of the Milky Way. They
also resolved “swarms of faint stars,”

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.120
cinching the fact that the Great Andromeda
Nebula was actually…the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.240
At that moment, our understanding of the Universe
swelled in size, and we’ve never looked

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.510
back.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.040
We’ve learned a lot about galaxies in the
ensuing century or so. Each is a collection

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.930
of at least hundreds of millions — or even
trillions — of stars, and most contain some

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.130
amount of gas and dust. They range in size
from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.430
of light years across, and they come in a
variety of shapes.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.490
We use these overall shapes to classify them.
Broadly speaking, there are four major types

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.790
of galaxies: Elliptical, spiral, peculiar,
and irregular.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.930
Spiral galaxies we’ve seen: We live in one!
These are characterized by broad, flat rotating

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.330
disks of stars, gas, and dust; a central bulge
of older, redder stars, sometimes with a long

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.200
cylindrical or rectangular bar of stars as
well; and a huge extended halo of older stars.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.720
Some spirals have large central bulges and
some have much smaller ones. Most have bars

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.160
of stars extending across the central part
of the galaxy; our Milky Way does. The spirals

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.250
come in a variety of flavors as well. Grand
Design spirals have magnificent, well-organized

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.709
spiral arms that extend from the very center
out to the visible edge of the galaxy. Others

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.200
have choppy or patchy arms — these are called
flocculent spirals, resembling tufts of cotton.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.880
Some spirals have wide-flung arms, while others
are tightly wound.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.690
Spirals take on wildly different appearances
depending on their angle to us. Some we see

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.430
face-on, and these may be the most magnificent
objects in the entire sky. Huge and sprawling,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.620
their structure is obvious and easy to see.
Star-forming nebulae are laid out like beads

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.560
on a string, colored pink by the characteristic
glow of warm hydrogen. Young, massive, luminous

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.710
stars blaze blue, tracing the spiral’s form.
Filigrees of dust clouds align with the arms

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.490
as well, and the central bulge or bar glows
an eerie reddish yellow, the star formation

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.490
there long since ceased, the bluer stars all
exploded, leaving only the redder stars behind.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.550
When spirals are more tilted to our line of
sight some of this structure is hidden. And

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.800
when they’re edge-on we see them as the
flat disks they truly are. Dust clouds are

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.600
tightly restricted to the mid-plane of spiral
galaxies, and we sometimes see them bisecting

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.320
the galaxy like a racing stripe right down
the middle.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.060
The reason for this is the same reason our
solar system is flat: Galaxies probably formed

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.300
from huge clouds of gas, billions of years
ago. As a cloud collapses, small eddies in

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.680
the gas would get amplified, and would create
an overall spin. This naturally leads to a

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.810
flattening of the cloud, and by the time the
stars in the galaxy were starting to turn

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.120
on, the overall structure of a flat disk was
in place.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.780
Elliptical galaxies are, well, elliptical.
Kinda. Some are nearly spherical, gigantic

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.570
cotton balls of billions of stars. Others
are more elongated, shaped like cigars or

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.270
American footballs. They tend to have no overall
structure as spirals do; ellipticals are puffy.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.990
And they range in size dramatically; some
are what are called dwarf ellipticals just

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.880
a few thousand light years across, to monsters
that hugely outmuscle our own Milky Way.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.270
Besides their shape, ellipticals are characterized
by a lack of gas and dust in them, and also

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.730
are populated with older stars. Apparently,
star formation in ellipticals came and went

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.690
eons ago. And all the young, massive stars
have long since exploded, and all that’s

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.600
left are less massive, redder stars. This
makes them similar to the stars in the central

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.130
bulges of spiral galaxies.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.270
It’s not exactly clear how ellipticals form.
Current thinking is that they are the products

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:18.120
of — and this is mind blowing — galactic collisions.
Yes, you heard me: Entire galaxies COLLIDE.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.620
When galaxies collide it’s a train wreck
on a cosmic scale.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.940
Galaxies are huge structures, and with hundreds
of billions of stars in them, their gravity

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.699
is pretty strong. If two galaxies get close enough
together, they can draw each other in and collide.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:37.190
A galactic collision is a weird event. Even
though the collision speeds can be hundreds

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.190
of kilometers per second, the event plays
out over hundreds of millions of years — remember,

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.169
we’re talking about distances of tens of
thousands of light years here.

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.260
In the early stages of the collision, tidal
effects can be strong. Stars on the side of

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.070
the galaxy near the other one get pulled toward
it more strongly than the stars farther away,

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:00.360
so the galaxies can get stretched, and long
tendrils of stars and gas get drawn out.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.919
Generally, collisions aren’t head-on, but
more of a sideswipe, so there’s some sideways

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:10.020
motion. When that happens, the tidal streamer
can become curved; a long, graceful arc. Colliding

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.750
galaxies in this stage form all sorts of bizarre
and spectacular shapes.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.610
Sometimes the galaxies separate,
and then together again.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.100
When that happens, the main bodies collide.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.260
But this isn’t like two cars crashing together.
Stars are very, very small compared to the

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.060
space between them, so even though hundreds
of billions of stars can be involved, the

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.520
odds are good that no two stars will ever
physically hit each other!

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.000
Space is weird.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.699
Gas clouds, though, are huge, and they DO
collide. They slam into each other, collapse,

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:44.419
and form stars at a furious rate. Colliding
galaxies can glow pink and blue as stars are

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:47.430
born and light up the hydrogen clouds around
them.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.930
Sometimes the two galaxies will collide at
high enough velocity that they pass right

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:56.120
through each other! But even then, in most
cases, they’ll slow, stop, then recollide.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.070
Eventually they merge, their huge energies
of motion absorbed by the orbiting stars,

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:07.060
puffing them up into vast, sweeping orbits.
The results, so we think, are elliptical galaxies.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.580
Not all collisions result in galaxies becoming
ellipticals. If a big spiral collides with

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.340
a much smaller galaxy, it can tear apart the
interloper and literally absorb it into itself.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.220
Sooo, galaxies are cannibals!

00:08:19.229 --> 00:08:24.710
We think most large galaxies grew to their
current bulk by consuming smaller galaxies…

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.440
including our own Milky Way. In fact, we have
proof: we’re currently in the process of

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.229
eating several smaller galaxies right now!
Terzan 5 is a small knot of stars that may

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:39.129
be the leftover core of a galaxy cannibalized
by our own, and two huge, looping streams

00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:44.459
of stars circling our galaxy are parts of
the Sagittarius and Canis Majoris dwarf galaxies

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:46.429
being torn apart by the Milky Way.

00:08:46.429 --> 00:08:51.429
This brings us to the third type of galaxies:
Peculiars. These are not shapeless, really,

00:08:51.429 --> 00:08:56.769
but have a shape that’s weird. Peculiar
galaxies are essentially all due to collisions;

00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:01.660
colliding galaxies clearly have structure,
but can be all sorts of odd, distorted shapes.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.759
Sometimes a small galaxy will plunge right
through the heart of a much larger galaxy.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:10.110
The gravity of the smaller galaxy draws in
stars and then flings them away in the bigger

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.999
one, like ripples in a pond. The result is
a ring galaxy, sometimes with the culprit

00:09:14.999 --> 00:09:19.850
intruder seen nearby. The famous Cartwheel
galaxy is a fine example of this. Another

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:25.089
is Hoag’s object, though to be honest it’s
not completely clear if this bizarre galaxy

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:29.629
is a product of a collision or some other
process. It’s peculiar either way!

00:09:29.629 --> 00:09:35.009
Finally, we come to galaxies that truly are
shapeless, called irregular galaxies. These

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:39.819
tend to be small, and chaotically shaped.
Bigger ones may be victims of collisions,

00:09:39.819 --> 00:09:45.069
their shapes distorted so much that the structure
was lost. Smaller ones may simply be too tiny

00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:48.079
to collect themselves together into a recognizable
shape.

00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:53.829
Many galaxies have companion, satellite galaxies.
The Milky Way has a couple of dozen such satellites.

00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:58.709
The two biggest are the Large and Small Magellanic
Clouds, visible from the southern hemisphere.

00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:03.369
Both are irregular in shape, though the Large
Magellanic Cloud is barely coherent enough

00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:09.209
to qualify as a disrupted, though small, barred
spiral. Both are riddled with gas and dust.

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:14.209
The Large Cloud sports the biggest and most
active star forming gas cloud in any nearby

00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:18.989
galaxy: the Tarantula Nebula. It’s producing
so many stars that astronomers think it may

00:10:18.989 --> 00:10:21.829
be in the process of forming a globular cluster!

00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:26.709
There are other types of galaxies as well.
Some, called active galaxies, pour out far

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:31.220
more energy than normal ones. And galaxies
aren’t just scattered evenly across space;

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.679
they tend to be found in clusters, some containing
thousands of galaxies. We’ll get to all

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:37.059
that in the next episode.

00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:41.579
We now know that the Universe is far, far
larger than just our Milky Way galaxy. It’s

00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:45.600
a recurring theme, isn’t it? We thought
the Earth was the center of creation, and

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.040
then the Sun, and then the galaxy. But every
time we investigate these situations earnestly,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.829
and engage in honest debate, we find that
we’re smaller and farther removed from the

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:59.110
action than we thought -- or than we thought
we deserved.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.819
Astronomy is really, really good at putting
us in our place. But it’s also really good

00:11:03.819 --> 00:11:07.879
at showing us just how grand and awe-inspiring
that place is.

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:12.449
Today you learned that the Milky Way is a
galaxy, one of many. Containing gas, dust,

00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:18.119
and billions of stars or more, galaxies come
in four main shapes: elliptical, spiral, peculiar,

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:22.559
and irregular. Galaxies can collide, and grow
in size by eating each other.
