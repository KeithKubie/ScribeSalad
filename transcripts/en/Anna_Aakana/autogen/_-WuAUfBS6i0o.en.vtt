[Drum set solo]

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.360
I got six cats, but one ran away
Pretty fitting that Ghost was her name (she ghosted!)

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.960
Had a boy crucify my heart on Christmas
Spent the new year feelin’ real twisted

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.400
But now I’m ten times more ambitious
My career's going motherfucking vicious

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.880
(ahh) And that boy about to be a witness
To the limitlessness of how I kill business

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.160
Pretty girls, pretty girls don’t cry
We fall down drunk and we fly up high

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.780
Pretty girls, pretty girls don’t cry 
Even when the boys we love say bye bye

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.580

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.380
(Good Riddance!)

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.080
Been working on my fitness (yeah)
Mindful when I’m doing the dishes

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.360
Baby I can go the distance
Be such a miracle

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.860
I’ll be turning you religious (Jesus)
And he’ll be seeing me on billboards

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.400
Tryin’ to forget me with some dumb whores (What?)

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.960
Just kiddin’ I love other women and if you want to get with my ex then get with him

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.280

We be taking over this whole town~
Uh huh

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.920
We deserve black hearts instead of purple

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.340
You know what I’m saying girl, this movement’s universal

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.440
It’s about damn time for a (re) reversal of this patriarchal rehearsal

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.040
My coven is the sickest, my girls are my witches

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.760

[Anna talking]
Can I just make like trumpet sounds?

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.420
With my mouth 'cause I don't really know if we can afford like an actual trumpet person

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:19.420
[Impromptu trumpet sound and drum solo]

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.140
