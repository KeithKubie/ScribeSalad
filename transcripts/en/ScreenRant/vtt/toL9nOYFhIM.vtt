00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.050
In this age of Hollywood sequels, prequels,
remakes and reboots, it�s easy for moviegoers

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.970
to become jaded, demanding more original stories
and franchises.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.789
But just because an old property is being
revived for a new audience, it doesn�t mean

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.320
the studios are completely out of ideas.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.530
Some revamps offer creative and exciting new
spins for everyone to enjoy.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.900
Here are Screen Rant�s 5 Movie Reboots That
Surprised Everyone.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.399
Batman Begins

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.469
After Batman &amp; Robin killed the Caped Crusader
on film, fans weren�t exactly hungry for

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.010
a new take on the Dark Knight � especially
one starring an unknown Welsh actor from a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.610
director untested in blockbusters.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.460
But Batman Begins revitalized the character�s
popularity instantly, with a dark and gritty

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.059
origin tale that stayed incredibly faithful
to the comic mythology.

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.860
Performances from respected actors like Michael
Caine and Liam Neeson gave the project healthy

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.559
doses of credibility, showing that a �comic
book movie� could be taken seriously, if

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.800
handled properly.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.420
After being burned by Joel Schumacher, iot
was exactly what fans � and the genre � needed.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.420
Casino Royale

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.580
James Bond was in danger of losing his license
to sell tickets after Die Another Day proved

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.170
a critical dud, and The Bourne Identity had
forever changed the spy thriller genre.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.090
Eon Productions opted to reboot the character,
taking 007 back to his literary roots, controversially

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.150
casting Daniel Craig for Casino Royale.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.790
Despite the outcries of �Bond purists,�
the film arrived on schedule, fast becoming

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.240
one of the franchise�s best entries.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.000
Director Martin Campbell grounded an emotional
story in reality, not outlandish stunts, making

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.790
Bond more relatable and human than ever before.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.869
The film�s sleek design and memorable action
sequences were also a hit, showing audiences

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.020
that 007 could still compete with the world�s
top spies.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.150
Star Trek

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.700
Following the failure of Star Trek: Nemesis,
Paramount went back to the drawing board,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.200
bringing in director J.J. Abrams, and cutting
loose the cast established on TV - recruiting

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.310
a younger generation for the daunting task
of rebooting The Original Series.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.370
Some die-hard Trekkies were less than thrilled
at the new version�s emphasis on Star Wars-esque

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.799
action, but it was just shot in the arm Star
Trek needed.

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.569
The cast proved up to the task as well, escaping
the shadows of their predecessors to earn

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.799
their rightful place on the Enterprise.

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.269
After some bumps in the road, Star Trek found
a way to live long and prosper after all.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.260
Rise of the Planet of the Apes

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.549
The original film is one of science fiction�s
most respected, but modern audiences didn�t

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.909
care much about ANY Planet of the Apes when
Tim Burton�s ill-advised remake failed to

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.400
leave an impact.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.931
Ten years later, Fox took another crack at
a reboot told from the perspective of the

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:47.860
first modified ape, Caesar.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.749
Few expected it to be a worthwhile film, but
Rise would become the sleeper hit of 2011,

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:57.079
as Andy Serkis earned rave reviews for his
groundbreaking performance as Caesar, ushering

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.510
in a new era of motion-capture performance.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.720
The movie wasn�t short on substance, either,
telling a cautionary tale about scientists

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.120
playing God, but rooted firmly in Caesar�s
search for home, family, and his place in

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.959
a new world.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.939
Dredd

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:26.069
With the unforgettable disappointment of Sylvester
Stallone�s 1995 turn as Judge Dredd combined

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:34.730
with a plot that seemed derivative of The
Raid, few expected 2012�s Dredd to be anything

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.730
more than a soulless remake.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.049
Instead, it was a shockingly entertaining
action film, full of slick visuals and practical

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.199
stunts and effects that made each gunfight
hit like a sledgehammer.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.140
Karl Urban turned out to be perfect for the
faceless hero, delivering a Dredd that was

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.489
completely faithful to the no-nonsense executioner
comic fans first made a cult icon.

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.530
The film may have not been a box office hit,
but the team�s passion for doing the material

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.489
justice was one of the most pleasant surprises
in years.

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.919
Those are our picks for movie franchise reboots
that surprised us.

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.209
