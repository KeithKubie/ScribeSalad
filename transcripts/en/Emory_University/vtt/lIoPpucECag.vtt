00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.300
An allergy is a type of hypersensitivity
reaction where patients become overly

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.580
sensitive to something that's benign in
the environment. So for example dogs or

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.140
cats or pollens -- they're really nonharmful substances, but some people

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.210
develop a hyperactivity or response to
this, and as a result their allergy cells

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.140
or mast cells will release a variety of
different chemicals that cause several different types of symptoms --

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.860
itchy, drippy, watery, nasal congestion, drainage in the back of the throat, things like that.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.300
What we know now about asthma is it's a

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.480
spectrum disease -- there's lots of
different flavors or phenotypes of

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.370
asthma. However the most common form of asthma actually is allergic asthma.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.380
About 60% of patients with asthma have
allergic asthma, where it can be

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.480
triggered by exposure to different
allergens -- cats, dogs, dust, pollens, things of that nature

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.680
can induce their asthma symptoms -- so coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.720
In order to help prevent your symptoms

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.440
one area would be to employ what we call
"allergy avoidance measures."

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.320
So to try to avoid being outside on days when the pollen counts are elevated.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.810
When you come in from the outside, rinse everything, off change your clothes, and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.880
wash your hair. Frequently change your
air filters in your home. Drive with your

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.640
car windows up, sunroof closed. And
also try to keep your house windows and

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.240
doors shut. And limit your time outside
when we know pollens will be at their highest

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.260
generally, which would be sunny days and windy days, as these pollens can

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.280
blow throughout the air. Generally the
best time to be outside would be after a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.320
rainstorm, when the pollen has been
washed away.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.920
Here in the metro [Atlanta] area we actually had a very extended pollen season just due to our

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.360
wonderful warm and humid environment, so we generally think that tree pollens

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.640
bloom anywhere from late February up
through May. Grass pollens generally bloom

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.229
in the summer time, so May and June.  And then we hear about weed pollen --

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.300
that generally blooms anywhere from the end of August through October.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.760
The most common and conventional method would be to do actually skin prick testing,

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.239
where we poke with a sharp piece of plastic and introduce different allergens into

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.190
the skin and measure your allergy cell
reactions. A second type of test we do is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.540
a blood test, which can be very useful,
but generally we would prefer to do

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.280
skin testing, as it is more accurate.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.520
Allergy shots are unique in that they allow patients to over time become less sensitive to the things that they are allergic to.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.340
So let's say you are allergic to oak pollen.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.660
We'd start off with a very low concentration, and over a period of weeks to months and build up.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.560
Once we get to a certain threshold, that's when your immune system actually

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.780
starts to become less responsive, and we continue you on that dose anywhere from

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.300
a year to several years

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.740
Step one is see your allergist, discuss with them and see if they have any specific recommendations.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.880
You'll speak with your allergist and undergo an extensive history where they ask you

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.220
multiple questions about your previous
exposures, your life, the symptoms that

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.500
you're having, and what previous
therapies you've tried.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.900
Afterward, they'll examine you and see what types of signs and symptoms related to allergies

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.970
you may have. We have medications
approved for ocular symptoms, nasal symptoms

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.070
and asthma symptoms, as well as long-term treatment with allergy shots

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.060
or immunotherapy to make patients less
allergic over time.
