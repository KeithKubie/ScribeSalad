00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.810
According to the 2016 fiscal year budget request,
NASA wants 18.5 billion dollars.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.810
What would happen if we…

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.810
I dunno.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.380
Doubled it?

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.059
Hey space rangers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.989
NASA is owned by the people of the United
States of America.

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:21.619
If you pay taxes here, you're helping support
space exploration.

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.560
When NASA landed on the moon, we the people
did that.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.240
The thing is, excepting the Space Race (which
was during cold wartime), the U.S. has spent

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.620
roughly the same amount on NASA every year,
between one-half and 1 percent of the Federal

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.620
budget.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.680
Currently, that's about 18 billion dollars.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.400
Americans spend 27 billion on pizza annually,
for comparison, and 97 billion on alcohol.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.050
So, we got to thinking, what would NASA do
if the government gave them a few billion

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.050
extra bucks?

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.560
Well, according to Jeff Matthews of the Space
Frontier Foundation, a well-funded NASA could

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.160
send more crew to the International Space
Station, provide money for Commercial Spaceflight,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.650
boost deep-space human missions, and help
us send a robotic mission to Europa.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.240
Because of the current budget, we don't even
staff the ISS fully.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.090
Matthews wrote, "we are missing out on direct,
near-term science," Meaning, there are more

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.060
science proposals submitted then there are
crew on the International Space Station to

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.249
carry them out.

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:21.950
If NASA's budget were doubled, or tripled,
that would still leave it 10 billion less

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.100
than the Department of Education, or 12 billion
less than the intelligence budget.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.740
And as Micah Walter-Range of the Space Foundation
wrote to DNews, if money were no object, NASA

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.929
could "invest heavily in developing new technology…"

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.619
They could, say, maintain the ISS after 2024
when it’s slated to be abandoned AND fund

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.119
the human spaceflight program -- right now
it's either/or.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.259
It would be great to have both, as the ISS
can provide more research and support as we

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.850
venture into deep space.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.100
As Walter-Range wrote, "There’s a huge need
for more biological research if we are going

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.740
to try to send people to live away from Earth.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.020
We may even need to do some tinkering with
our physiology in order to survive in different

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.020
levels of gravity."

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.770
Unfortunately, a fully-funded NASA probably
isn't in the cards.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.500
Previously cuts have reduced NASA's public
outreach, the office dedicated to helping

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.580
the American people understand what NASA is
doing with tax dollars.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.500
And, in 2015, Congress cut the Earth science
budget, the department that looks at the "the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.730
Earth as a whole system [to] understand how
it is changing."

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.180
Interestingly, "earth science" is where Climate
Scientists get much of their data…

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.200
Congress cut that budget...

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200
? Huh.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.460
The Space Frontier Foundation's Policy Director
Aaron Oesterle wrote to DNews that NASA is

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.810
used as a "political football by various special
interest groups… [meaning] people will cheer

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.230
NASA on and support programs that could result
in dead ends, when what is needed is a real

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.570
discussion about goals and strategies."

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.400
Instead, According to Matthews, a tripled
budget could get a manned Mars landing in

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.130
the late 2020s, sustained exploration, and
"significant value for the American public

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.010
and other beneficiaries of NASA."

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.010
What beneficiaries?

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.010
Glad you asked!

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.760
Well, the taxpayers for one, but also private
companies like SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, Boeing,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.370
Raytheon, Orbital ATK, Lockheed Martin, and
dozens of others who are all contracted with

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.370
NASA.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.730
Meaning, there’s a real return on investment
for these tax dollars.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.100
And yet, alas, NASA's next human mission to
Mars, and the new rocket that will take us

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.110
there are both "slated for significant cuts
under the proposed" budget for 2017.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.730
Look, as Dr. Tyson says, NASA costs Americans
half a penny per tax dollar.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.400
That fraction of a dollar bill is not enough
from the edge to reach the ink.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.410
Increases like this could restore and boost
standard missions like weather, atmospheric

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.600
and earth sciences, while accelerating and
securing contracts for new launch systems,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.190
human and biological study, as well as robotic
and human-based missions to the edges of our

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.190
imagination.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.320
Wouldn't that be awesome?

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.320
Yeah, it would.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.320
Sponsorship?

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.370
If you're as into space as we are at Discovery
then make sure you tell your phone to remind

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.900
you about global premiere of Telescope, Saturday,
Feb 20th at 9/8c on Discovery channel.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.330
If you're thinking, all this sounds great,
but what would all this do for me?

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.330
Guess what.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.330
A lot.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:17.209
Check this video here for all the ways space
exploration has benefited you, right now.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.220
Special thanks to both the Space Frontier
Foundation and the Space Foundation for their

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.459
help with this story!

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.750
How much money would you give NASA?

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.750
What would you fund?

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.430
Let us know in the comments!
