JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Hey, everyone.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.850
How are you?

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.350
Monday-- Monday
lunchtime, are we awake?

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.380
Yeah.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.826
Hello.

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:17.620
Idina, thank you so much
for being here and sharing

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.940
with us at Google.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.190
We could not be more thrilled.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.120
And as you can see, you
got a huge lunchtime crowd

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.945
coming out.

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:28.070
IDINA MENZEL: I'm only
focusing on the empty seats.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.750
Where are those people?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.791
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Yeah.

00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:30.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.380
IDINA MENZEL: My manager hates
me because whenever I play,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.004
I'll play like a
packed house, and I'll

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.570
see two people in the front
that just probably their kid got

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.520
sick and they couldn't make it.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.603
And I'm like, why didn't
we sell those two fucking

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:40.434
seats in the front?

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:41.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.150
He's like, I did!

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.620
I swear to God!

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.130
I hate it.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.130
It just makes me insecure.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.089
Anyway, sorry, am I
allowed to curse at Google?

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.130
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Yeah.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.900
Yeah, you're good.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.608
This is an adult
audience, so we're good.

00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:52.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.690
Nobody here has ever
cursed in their whole life.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.320
I can see it now.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.420
So thank you for coming.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.790
You have a new album out
and one that is, I think,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.100
somebody has told me
deeply personal to you.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.800
And would love to lead off
there of your journey and sort

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.709
of what led you to this album.

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:16.500
IDINA MENZEL: I think
most people's album's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.490
deeply personal.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.930
Everybody asks me that.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.470
And it is.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.970
It's true.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.790
But I don't know.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.690
It's like whose album do we
love that isn't deeply personal?

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.440
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Right, one would hope.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.165
IDINA MENZEL: But mine is.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.960
Yeah.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.170
The last three
years, I guess, I had

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.050
like a lot of
conflicting dynamics,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.330
I guess you could say.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.200
I was simultaneously
going through a divorce

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.650
while "Frozen" was going on
its whole crazy trajectory.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.200
So I literally would go
from singing at the Oscars

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.150
to heading to a
mediation agreement,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.009
discussing like
visitation about my son.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.080
So it was just
professionally speaking,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.790
an incredible time, and
personally speaking,

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.790
very complicated.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.640
So I had a lot to write about.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.210
And it just felt like a good
time to get back in the studio

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.782
and put it into some music.

00:02:33.782 --> 00:02:35.240
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
That's awesome.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.080
Thank you for going there so
early in the conversation.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.780
IDINA MENZEL: Personal.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.238
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
It was amazing.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.180
And as you were sort of building
the album as well and just

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.870
being the theater
geek that I am,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.640
I'm thinking about the time and
place we are in theater right

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.940
now, with what's happened with
"Hamilton," what we're seeing

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.640
and sort of transformative.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.480
And you've really been a part of
some of the most transformative

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.250
shows in theater, period.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.875
Everybody, "Rent," right?

00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:02.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.616
Right, there's the applause.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.520
Yeah.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.180
Right?

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.763
And not to mention
"Wicked," yeah.

00:03:08.763 --> 00:03:10.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.120
There we go, just
two right there.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.550
IDINA MENZEL: I do one every
10 yeare-- one zeitgeist

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.380
kind of project every 10 years.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.437
And the rest I starve,
and I go into obscurity.

00:03:22.437 --> 00:03:24.020
And then all of a
sudden, I get a job,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.830
and it's like, oh,
that's a big deal.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.255
And then I'm back on top again.

00:03:28.255 --> 00:03:29.630
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
You basically

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.662
just drop the mic constantly.

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:34.870
IDINA MENZEL: I wish I was
cool enough to actually do

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.290
a mic drop like that.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.970
But, no, I've been
really, really lucky.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.910
But I also have experienced
the ebb and flow

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.820
of this industry,
which I think is

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.000
why I am able to really enjoy
it when those moments happen,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.750
because I know how
fleeting they can be.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:03.250
So I actually, more than
ever, can get on stage

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.064
and take in the moment and
realize how lucky I am.

00:04:09.064 --> 00:04:10.980
And who knows what's
going to happen tomorrow.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.580
And, wow, people showed up.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.230
But that all started with my
first professional experience,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:25.760
which was "Rent" and that
entire mindset of our composer

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.630
passing away on the
night of our first--

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.820
I think it was our
invited dress, which

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.490
is like the night
before an audience.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.690
Actually, no, it was
the first preview,

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.550
because there was-- no,
invited dress, yeah.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:49.660
Anyway, so when your career
starts with that kind of event,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:58.130
it kind of dictates how you
see this industry and your art

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.974
and gives you a perspective.

00:05:01.974 --> 00:05:03.890
And I was lucky because
we were at a young age

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:04.681
that that happened.

00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:08.600
And we could of like lost
perspective and objectivity.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.500
But instead of getting caught
up in all the magazines

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.410
and the accolades,
our cast actually--

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.300
I've never worked in any
show that this has ever

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.980
happened since.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.790
Not one person missed a show
for at least six months--

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.540
eight shows a week, singing
at the top of our lungss--

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.360
because we were so committed,
whether we were sick or not,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.110
to getting up there and making
sure we put out his message.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.520
That was the most
important thing.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.690
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Wow, that's amazing.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.900
And with that-- I hadn't
even thought about that

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.351
actually in the context
of that question.

00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:52.350
Before that moment, you've
talked about the ebbs

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.860
and flows.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.640
And obviously, that
was both, again,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.140
at the same time that sort of
trajectory, which you talked

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.690
about actually up top with
your album now as well,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.044
the conflicting
emotions of the high

00:06:03.044 --> 00:06:05.460
and the low at the same time,
which is the same thing that

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.920
happened with "Rent."

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.420
Up to that point,
which is the stuff

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.840
we can't really Google is before
"Rent," what was the seed that

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.530
got planted in you
wanting to do theater,

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.080
wanting to sing all the time?

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.580
What was that
driving force for you

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.950
that led you to that sort of
first big professional moment

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.470
of "Rent" that you feel
prepared you for-- or did it?

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.760
IDINA MENZEL: Oh, yeah,
there are different ones.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.040
It's kind of like saying
what your first love was.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.606
Was it the kid in
kindergarten that like

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:39.980
kissed you on the
cheek or was it

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.270
the guy you first had sex with?

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.220
What's first love,
really, right?

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.080
So that's a really bad example.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.694
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:49.860
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: It's OK.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.680
We're just getting real here.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.470
IDINA MENZEL: No, but I do.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.630
I always think about that.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.421
It's like when people
say first love, well,

00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:56.630
I think I really loved
this kid Evan Beller when

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.590
I was in kindergarten,
but I certainly

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.760
didn't let him go up
my shirt or anything.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.760
Do you know what I mean?

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.314
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.100
Is it-- how early--
I think I'm tired.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.940
The album came out
this week, and I've

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.110
been like surprising drag shows
and gay clubs at midnight.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.410
And I'm like, I don't know
what time zone I'm on.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.392
So you're going to get
me a little delirious

00:07:25.392 --> 00:07:29.610
and stick foot
directly into mouth.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.270
What was the question again?

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.950
Oh, yeah, first,
like moment, right?

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.760
Well, yes, so my
point being, it could

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.740
either be when my Grandfather
Nathan, Grandpa Nat would

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.760
put a fake toy microphone
in my hand when I was five

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.330
and do shows with me
in the living room.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:55.560
Or it could be when I
sang at this talent show.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.640
We're up in the Catskills,
where the Jews all go.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.930
And it was a family
trip, and our parents

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.600
sent us to the day camp, and
we did this little talent show.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.550
And I say "The Way We Were" with
a full-on Long Island accent.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.090
But everybody's percolating.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.430
People turned to my parents and
said, oh, she could be special.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.480
So like I don't know.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.150
There's those times.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.837
And that was about
theater, yeah.

00:08:26.837 --> 00:08:29.170
Oh, it could have been the
time when my grandmother took

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.760
me to see "A Star is Born"
with Barbra Streisand and Kris

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.990
Kristofferson.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.659
That kind of changed
my life, that idea

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:38.510
of being put on a stage
and having to win over

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.760
an audience of people that were
booing you, and being so good

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.110
and captivating, that it stopped
them all in their tracks.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.930
Something about that
was amazing to me.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.500
And then parents got divorced
when I was a teenager.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.050
And my mom was dating this
cool guy that really believed

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.410
in me a lot and said,
you should write music,

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.210
and knew some guy that was
in the wedding/bar mitzvah

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.520
scene in Long Island and
helped me lie about my age,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.300
because I was 15 and illegally
driving to all of these gigs,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:19.940
and got me a gig with Tony Syeda
and the Echoes in Oceanside.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.165
And I knew like three songs.

00:09:22.165 --> 00:09:26.120
It was "What a Feeling" from
"Flashdance," "Evergreen,"

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:32.440
and I forget that song--
like the sunshine song.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.994
[HUMMING]

00:09:33.994 --> 00:09:35.160
Anyway, I can't think of it.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.470
But and then I started doing
weddings and bar mitzvahs

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.280
and having to learn
all this music.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.970
And it was like an
education for me.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.680
I had to learn like Motown and
Aretha and jazz, Billie Holiday

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.014
and Ella Fitzgerald.

00:09:50.014 --> 00:09:51.430
And all of a sudden
then, I didn't

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.760
want to necessarily do theater.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.540
I wanted to be like a rock star.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.410
So I went back and forth between
"Annie," when I was little,

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:03.430
and "Peter Pan" and then wanting
to write my music and record

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.310
and all that.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.570
And so it's been
a constant dance

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.700
for me, even till this
day, sitting here with you,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.530
trying to get people
to accept my desire

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:19.270
to cross over from the
theater and have integrity

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:24.230
as a rock or a pop
singer/songwriter.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:29.860
It's just followed
me, this little dance,

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.332
trying to straddle both places
and be accepted in both.

00:10:34.332 --> 00:10:35.790
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
And do you feel

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.170
like that's really--
by the way, I'm

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.420
just picturing you singing
at bar mitzvahs in my head.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:48.060
And did you feel like with this
album, and even just looking

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.720
at the track list
and people's comments

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.770
really picking up on your
pop track in a real way,

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.360
the intentionality there
of all the genre crossing

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.500
because of your influences, what
was your thought process there?

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.440
And what do you hope, as
we all listen to the album,

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.140
what we hear from you
as part of that journey?

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.820
IDINA MENZEL: Yeah,
thanks for asking that.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.700
Well, it's funny.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.340
I've done a couple
albums before this

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.060
that it meant more to me,
this whole crossover thing.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.180
And it didn't happen.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.240
I got dropped, or I sold like
three albums or whatever.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.510
So at this point in my
life, so many things

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.390
have happened that I'm proud of.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:31.130
And I get up on stage
and I do a concert,

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:38.190
and the setlist is a
chronology of my life

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.470
of the songs in my life.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.730
And some of it's "Defying
Gravity" from "Wicked."

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.870
And some of it's an
old Joni Mitchell song

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.900
because it inspired me.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.610
And then there's "Let
It Go" from "Frozen."

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.100
And then there's original music.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.270
And I used to worry that that
was confusing in some way

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.550
and didn't have the cohesion.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.030
But now I realize the cohesion,
the common denominator,

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.130
is me and all of my experiences.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.247
And I'm 45 years old, and
that is this is who I am.

00:12:03.247 --> 00:12:04.330
This is the life I've led.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.383
And so I kind of stopped
trying to worry-- I've

00:12:08.383 --> 00:12:10.180
got to stop worrying about it.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.130
And so when I went in
the studio this time,

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:17.440
I picked producers that I love
that I have worked with people

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.250
that I really admire.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.950
But once we got
in there, we just

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.380
wrote music and hung
out and recorded,

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.330
and I stopped
worrying about that.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:33.470
All I cared about was that
they supported me being honest

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.640
and trying different things.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.720
But what I think
has happened is it

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.620
has a really cool, current,
mainstream kind of sound.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.100
And so hopefully-- I just want
to expand my audience, really.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.287
That's all.

00:12:48.287 --> 00:12:49.620
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: I love that.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.250
And it's really
interesting also,

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.310
given the context,
interestingly,

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.050
of this groundbreaking
theater you've

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.630
been a part of that sort of
bent also what is theater

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.700
and what the music is
that isn't theater.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.180
I'm thinking about
"Rent" rock and "Wicked"

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.857
really taking us into like
full Broadway big belt number,

00:13:10.857 --> 00:13:13.190
and thinking even about the
trajectory of theater itself

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:18.150
right now, with "Hamilton" and a
lot of experimenting happening,

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.650
and also with the
advent of digital.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.360
We're here at Google and
thinking about all the artists

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.230
that are sort of genre
crossing, because there's

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.792
no box you have to live in.

00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:29.250
IDINA MENZEL: Exactly, and we
have more control as artists.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.340
We can put ourselves
in self promote.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.080
We don't have to rely just on
our label understanding us.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.620
We can trust the public to just
want to hear music, love music.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.730
And like so many of the
theater fans I have,

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.410
there are amazing
music aficionados.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.750
They love music.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.136
They're not just theater kids.

00:13:48.136 --> 00:13:49.010
They love everything.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.801
They just love good
music and good writing.

00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:56.140
So why not just put it out there
and let the people find it?

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.480
So that's really
empowering for artists now.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.090
Back in the day, when I was
trying to get a record deal

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.655
and playing down at the
Bitter End in the Village,

00:14:07.655 --> 00:14:10.030
it was all about just getting
a record deal and the label

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:11.740
and being accepted
by these people.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.834
And now, as long
as you can tour,

00:14:13.834 --> 00:14:15.500
which is the most
important thing to me,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.550
to be able to make a
paycheck and go out and sing

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.060
and on a stage for people,
then I have the power back,

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.715
which is exciting.

00:14:24.715 --> 00:14:26.090
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
It's amazing.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.700
I feel like if I took a poll
right now of the audience,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.040
how many of you are just
obsessed with this woman's

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.550
voice in general, right?

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.310
Exactly, I think your
voice, not to say, defy,

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.718
but it does, it defies
like any particular-- yeah,

00:14:40.718 --> 00:14:42.770
I know the pun was too easy.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.510
But it really does defy
any particular genre.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.097
I think we're all
obsessed with your voice

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:50.680
and what you're
bringing as an artist.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.280
So I think in that
way, this is--

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.810
IDINA MENZEL: Well, I've
been working with a voice

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.180
teacher for over 20 years.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.720
She's not the kind of
teacher that you would think.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.200
Before her, when I was
younger, I studied classically.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.457
But then when I started listing
to all of the other music,

00:15:10.457 --> 00:15:12.040
I thought, well, I
don't want to sound

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:18.234
like that, like a
lot of people sound

00:15:18.234 --> 00:15:20.150
when they've been overly
trained and then they

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.700
try to sing soulful
music or whatever.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:32.360
Her technique is
actually the untraining.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.080
She prepares me how
to breathe and keep

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.760
my voice so I can do eight
shows a week and not hurt myself

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.120
and I can build my range
and all that stuff.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.557
So we definitely have a
regiment that I can explain,

00:15:41.557 --> 00:15:42.890
if anybody's interested in that.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.700
But the point being
it's about singing

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:50.170
from a place of speaking as
opposed to (FANCY SINGING).

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.400
That doesn't sound like
any of us talk, right?

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.910
So nothing against
that kind of singing.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:16:01.860
But what I gravitate to
is coming from speaking,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.920
even if it's the way I would
yell to you on the playground

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.240
if I was a kid, that's just
my higher part of my voice.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.010
But it all comes from
how we would communicates

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.070
as humans, our real voice.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:20.270
And I believe that
that's what makes

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.540
gives an audience a real
connection to somebody's

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.620
because they're really
talking and not performing,

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.230
over-producing this sound.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.100
So I don't know why
I told you that.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.070
I forget what you said.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.260
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: No,
that's perfect because we're

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.570
just having a conversation.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.952
So here we are.

00:16:36.952 --> 00:16:37.910
IDINA MENZEL: So sorry.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.050
I keep drinking the coffee.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.230
It's not really helping.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.605
Maybe it is helping, and I'm
just like, blah, blah, blah,

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:43.149
blah.

00:16:43.149 --> 00:16:44.690
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
No, it's amazing.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.370
I think everybody's
enrapt, like sort

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.660
of just shaking their head
in agreement with you--

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.270
that relatability.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.730
And like you were saying
earlier, this sort of artifice

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.510
between you and the audience
has disappeared in so many ways,

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.030
that that connection of what
you're talking about, really

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.970
singing in a way that's
accessible to human speaking--

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.290
IDINA MENZEL: Yeah, the only
thing working against that

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:10.050
is that we all listen
to music that's

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:14.210
been fixed and auto-tuned
so much, that now

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:20.079
what is perfect and
imperfect can be debated.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:23.000
And when you go
to a live concert,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.359
are you really
hearing people or not?

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.089
And so when you
actually hear someone

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:32.220
that chooses to actually sing,
even when she has a bad cold

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.780
or it's that time of month
or she was up at 3:00

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.450
in the morning with her son
or fighting with her boyfriend

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:46.030
and I don't sound
perfect, it's taken some

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.140
of the love out of it for me.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.900
The social media
takes a lot out of it

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:55.190
because I read it,
like an asshole.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:59.430
And you know that people
can just go on there

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.290
and immediately talk
about everything.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:07.380
And so it's made it
harder to enjoy it.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.960
I have to really kind of
like turn it off and find

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.990
the love of singing,
and also remember

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:18.400
that there have been many shows
where I've sung and not been

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.331
at the top of my game, and
people still are in tears

00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:22.330
or still feel something.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.870
And I remember, oh,
it's not because I

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.244
hit a really high note that
makes someone feel something.

00:18:26.244 --> 00:18:29.160
It's because what you're
communicating as a person.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.460
So I have to remember that.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.427
But my whole life has been
about-- my entire identity

00:18:33.427 --> 00:18:35.760
has been based on the fact
that when I was a young girl,

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.170
I had this voice.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.590
And so as I've
gotten older, I've

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.290
had to understand that I have
a lot more to offer the world

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.390
than just being a singer.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.785
But sometimes I forget myself.

00:18:47.785 --> 00:18:49.160
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Well, it also

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.534
comes from even
the earlier days.

00:18:50.534 --> 00:18:52.790
You were saying you
were sort of taught

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.800
to think about
songwriting very early on,

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.190
which I would imagine has
actually helped in terms

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:03.150
of thinking beyond just where
the pigeon holes might be

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.480
with people thinking about you.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.590
And with that, were
there any, for you,

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:14.720
defining moments in your career,
either joyous or really tough?

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.220
I know we talked a
bit about "Rent."

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.900
But has there been any
other moments for use

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.420
that just really stand out as
an artist, or maybe in a moment

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.000
there you suddenly
felt like you had

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.630
defied maybe one of those boxes
that somebody had maybe put you

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.290
in?

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.890
IDINA MENZEL: Yeah, well,
the success of "Let It

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:39.360
Go" and "Frozen" because you
said like with "Rent," that it

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.784
was this rock-pop musical.

00:19:42.784 --> 00:19:45.200
And you would think that then
that would open doors for me

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.370
to be able to walk between
all of these lines.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.960
But it wasn't.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.380
Whenever I'd go into a recording
studio with a big-time producer

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.730
or a songwriter, they'd
sort of admonish me

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.960
and say like, oh,
you're too expressive.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.850
It's all that Broadway training.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.070
Or you have to sound
more like Sheryl Crow.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.950
Throw it away.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.455
So, I'm sorry.

00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:12.580
I lost my train of thought.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.229
So then-- help me.

00:20:15.229 --> 00:20:16.770
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Defining moments,

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:17.890
where you sort of broke the box.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:18.380
IDINA MENZEL: Oh, yeah.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.130
And so they would have
all of these rules,

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.250
like theater people
are never going

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.870
to get on the radio
on a pop station.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:28.940
And then all of a sudden, cut
to like 15 years later, I'm

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.800
taking my kid to
school and Z100's on,

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.330
and I hear "Let It Go."

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.160
I'm like, what the hell?

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.530
You can't worry
about those rules.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.150
And I did for a long time.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.630
You've just got to keep
moving and going and taking

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.450
work that makes you feel good.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.050
And surround yourself with
people that teach you stuff,

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.470
and just keep going.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:49.900
Because the trends
and the rules,

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.250
they always break
and move and change.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.790
And all of a sudden,
you hear like a bridge.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.590
Like, what's a bridge
in "Let It Go?"

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.570
It's like a, "frozen
fractals all around."

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.070
There's like these
crazy lyrics that

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.654
would never be in a pop song.

00:21:02.654 --> 00:21:04.320
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
The word "fractals?"

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.115
IDINA MENZEL: Yeah.

00:21:05.115 --> 00:21:06.851
Who rhymes with fractals?

00:21:06.851 --> 00:21:07.350
Not me.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.300
I didn't write it.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.080
But you know?

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.980
But it's become like this
huge pop culture moment.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.020
So go figure and fuck all those
people that like wrote me off.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.930
So that was a big defining
moment, a teaching moment

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:27.417
for me, just to know you just
can't keep following a trend.

00:21:27.417 --> 00:21:29.750
Because by the time you get
there, it's changed already.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.200
So just keep doing your thing.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.940
This album's a big
deal just because I

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:43.050
was with my ex-husband for--
we were married a long time,

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.510
but together even
longer, so like 16 years

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:49.630
and grew up together.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.060
So to figure out how
to separate yourself,

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.610
who you are separate
from that person

00:21:54.610 --> 00:22:01.110
and to be creative without
worrying about what he would

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:07.440
think was interesting and
liberating, too, to just get

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.430
in the studio and
go and not worry--

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.730
and figuring out how to stop
regretting all of that stuff

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:22.340
and pave the way for some
new exciting stuff to happen.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.555
I got engaged recently.

00:22:25.555 --> 00:22:28.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.240
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Congratulations.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.259
IDINA MENZEL: Thanks.

00:22:32.259 --> 00:22:34.300
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: With
that, just thinking even

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.020
about "Let It Go"
and the new album

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.960
and where they came
from, the journey,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.370
I think, at least
from what I've seen,

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.360
and I work a lot on inclusion
issues and representation

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.302
issues as part of my day job.

00:22:47.302 --> 00:22:49.260
IDINA MENZEL: I was just
in the bathroom stall,

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.070
and there's a thing
about inclusion

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.950
as I was sitting on the toilet.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.224
You put a thing in front
of me about inclusion.

00:22:55.224 --> 00:22:56.890
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Learning on the Loo.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.870
IDINA MENZEL: Learning
on Loo, OK, got it.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.269
Well, I was reading it.

00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:01.810
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
It was effective.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.974
If somebody's in here
who did that-- fantastic.

00:23:04.974 --> 00:23:07.170
[INAUDIBLE] at Google.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:11.070
And the fun part
about that is we

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.600
work with a lot of
artists who are viewed

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.900
as role models in the industry.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.420
And as our friend Gina Davis
says, if you can see it,

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.890
you can be it.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.570
And given "Frozen," you brought
up "Frozen" and "Let It Go,"

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.640
and now actually, sort
of defining yourself

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:30.180
entirely in this way with the
album in this new moment, who

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.990
was a role model in your life?

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.660
And have you felt that
that idea of a role model

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:41.380
fall on you now, given how
many little girls and boys kind

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.030
of latched on to your music, who
may have not known you before?

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.690
What's that been like,
and can you trace it

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.870
to somebody in your own life?

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.409
IDINA MENZEL: Yeah, well,
first of all, my sister's

00:23:52.409 --> 00:23:53.450
a huge role model for me.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.930
She's my younger sister-- 3
and 1/2 years younger than me.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:24:00.630
But she got married
and had kids before me,

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.780
so our roles reversed
in a lot of ways.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.670
I'd go to her for the
wisdom of certain things.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:14.330
And she got remarried, so she
went through a bunch of crap

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:18.420
and handled it so gracefully.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.020
She was single and had these two
little tiny boys at the time.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.070
And because she grew up with a
sister, that was always like,

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.550
I know what I'm
doing with my life.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.290
I'm singing, I
want to be famous.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.420
And she was like, I
have no idea what to do,

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.180
and I have this
annoying sister's shadow

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.800
to walk around in.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.440
It took her longer
to figure out what

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.731
she wanted to do with her life.

00:24:38.731 --> 00:24:40.710
And then she did.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.150
She's this amazing
teacher and a writer.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.010
She's writing a
book, but she did it.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.899
She went back to school
and got her masters

00:24:47.899 --> 00:24:48.940
with the two little kids.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:54.320
And so anyway, just
her strength and grace,

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.865
really, has been an
inspiration to me.

00:24:57.865 --> 00:25:02.300
She's super, super
smart and eloquent.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.640
The role model thing with
me and the characters

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.460
I played, and they're always
connecting to young audiences

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:13.070
is a beautiful thing, and it's
also a daunting responsibility.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.420
One, is that the
age disparity is

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.790
getting even bigger and bigger.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:23.900
So now, like the "Frozen" thing,
there's like six-year-olds,

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.310
and then there's me coming.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.830
So like I do a concert.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.347
I'm on stage, talking
like a truck driver.

00:25:29.347 --> 00:25:30.930
And then I look down,
and there's just

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.170
like mom with a little girl in
a blue dress in front of me.

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:38.212
And I'm talking about how
so and so went up my shirt.

00:25:38.212 --> 00:25:40.910
And then I realize, oh, fuck.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:41.710
And then I do that.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:46.370
And then it's like, it's
just a constant mess.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.606
And the manager's like, could
you please watch your mouth.

00:25:49.606 --> 00:25:50.730
There are these young kids.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.270
I'm like, I've got to be me.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.280
And so it's hard.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.600
Also, there's that.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.110
But then there's also the
part of just all these

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.760
amazing characters
I've gotten to play

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:13.460
about young women
finding themselves,

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.690
embracing this
thing in them that's

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:20.810
super unique and beautiful,
but sort of looked down

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.270
upon by society.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.750
And then they finally
harness it, embrace it,

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.970
and do amazing things with it.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:32.470
That whole idea is great.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.910
But it's not always who I am.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:39.870
So I specifically put "Creep"
by Radiohead in my set

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.870
last year when I was on tour
because it was an opportunity

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:46.250
to just sing a song about
feeling completely despicable

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:50.910
and letting them know that I
don't always feel letting it go

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.000
or "Defying Gravity."

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.107
It's not easy to wake up every
day and sing songs like that,

00:26:55.107 --> 00:26:56.190
and you shouldn't have to.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.565
Sometimes you just want to
feel really sorry for yourself

00:26:58.565 --> 00:27:01.698
and stay in bed,
and that's OK too.

00:27:01.698 --> 00:27:05.192
That's how I've been
grappling with it.

00:27:05.192 --> 00:27:06.650
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
That's awesome.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.540
I just had this
vision of you in bed,

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.330
and the Creed song
playing life over.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.235
And it's so real.

00:27:13.235 --> 00:27:15.360
I think this is a truth,
by the way, with everybody

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.910
we've talked to in that space,
is this sort of pressure to be

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.700
on for especially
the little kids

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.704
and how to balance that
with being a real human.

00:27:25.704 --> 00:27:27.870
And that maybe showing them
that you're a real human

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:32.760
is actually even a
more impactful thing.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.520
And with that, in
that vein, just doing

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.540
a little bit of research
on you before this,

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.630
there was some
exciting real work

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.740
that you've done with kids
and also in the philanthropy

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.542
and activism space,
which I didn't

00:27:45.542 --> 00:27:47.000
want us to go
without talking about

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.090
because it's so important.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:52.010
Weird factoid-- my high school
was the first high school

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:55.190
outside the city of New York to
support Broadway Cares Equity

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.410
Fights Aids in
Marietta, Georgia, where

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.300
LGBTQ rights were not
very welcome at the time

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.370
that we started
collecting donations.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:06.990
And so I was particularly moved
by your activism in that space.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:08.560
So thank you.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.070
And would love if you'd like
to talk a little bit about what

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.903
you've done and what
you've been working on,

00:28:12.903 --> 00:28:14.720
maybe what's to
come in that space.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.370
IDINA MENZEL: Well, I was
lucky enough as a kid.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.280
My parents would send me
away to sleepaway camp.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.750
It's a Jewish East
Coast thing to do.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.670
And it was a privileged thing.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.270
But it was a wonderful
experience, an opportunity

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:32.880
to escape, to kind of
rewrite yourself as a kid

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.240
if you didn't enjoy
your school year.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.140
It's a place to bond
and make new friends

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.180
and find yourself, really.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.960
And I always wanted
to have a camp.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:49.150
And then as I got
older and I started

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:53.200
to have these experiences
and these projects where

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:59.180
it was connecting to
young women, especially,

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.980
young women trying
to find their voice,

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.500
I realized that the camp
had to be more than just

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.080
what I experienced
when I was younger

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.310
and be more
meaningful than that.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:12.490
And so my college roommate,
who's much smarter than me,

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.670
and was sick and
tired of hearing me

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.660
talk about this pipe dream.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.480
And so she galvanized
the whole thing.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.730
She's a business major,
lawyer, type-A person,

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.180
got the thing together.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.090
And it's called The Broader Way.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:29.210
And we're going on
our seventh year.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.020
It's a 10-day
program, where we take

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.610
a bunch of inner-city
girls, mostly

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:36.700
from Harlem and the
Lower East Side,

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.650
up to the Berkshire Mountains
in Massachusetts for 10 days

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:45.210
to like a college campus that
we lease the property for now.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:49.260
Eventually, hopefully,
we'll have our own place.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.100
And we sing, and we
dance, and we swam.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:57.020
And Jeanine Tesori, who's an
incredible Broadway composer,

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.810
wrote "Fun Home"
and a ton of things.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.160
She's kind of like
my creative director.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.680
And we bring up amazing
veteran performers

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.140
that come and work with them.

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.780
But the whole thing is not
to put on like "Oklahoma"

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.040
with these girls.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.900
We encourage them
to write a lot.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.550
They do a lot of spoken word.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.270
They write their
own songs, lyrics.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:22.660
They choreograph
their own movement.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.530
And so at the end
of the 10 days,

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:29.400
they come back into New York
to a theater that's usually,

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.380
thankfully, given
to us for the night.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:35.270
And we put on a recital,
concert, if you will,

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:48.550
that's a complete collage
of their original work.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.720
So it's-- and so we started
with 30 girls the first year.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.490
And now it's become
a four-year program.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:57.980
And we're now at the point
where our original girls

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.160
came back and were
CITs, only the ones

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.759
that we thought were
capable of doing that,

00:31:05.759 --> 00:31:07.050
because they still are only 15.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:13.810
Yeah, and so now we're up to
like 80 girls or something.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:18.760
And that's a huge
responsibility.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.590
And it's hard-- all the fund
raising and all that stuff

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:26.360
and also wanting to keep tabs
on them through the year.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.120
Because I always
find, even as adults,

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.280
when we're involved in
a really amazing project

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.100
and then we're finished,
we kind of crash.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.760
And so I imagine
these girls, who

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.950
have these kind of shitty
home life, a lot of them.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:40.520
And they go from this magical
10 days, and then they go back.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.010
And so I want to make sure
they felt like it wasn't over.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:47.430
And through the year,
we do little reunions.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.710
And they go see shows
together, and we

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:53.590
go see art and tap dance.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.370
We have like dance
things and whatever.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:32:01.316
Anyway, so it's a constantly
evolving foundation.

00:32:01.316 --> 00:32:02.690
We want to get to
the point where

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.450
we have college funds for
them and things like that.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.782
But that's all in the future.

00:32:07.782 --> 00:32:09.240
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
That's amazing.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:09.600
IDINA MENZEL: Thanks.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.730
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
That's really awesome.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:11.910
IDINA MENZEL: Thanks.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.480
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
And it just gets

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.209
me thinking also about sort of
this journey you were talking

00:32:18.209 --> 00:32:19.625
about earlier about
role modeling,

00:32:19.625 --> 00:32:23.170
because in a way, that's a
place where you're becoming very

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.930
human to them and them to you.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:29.190
And I think that's really
awesome and remarkable.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:32.120
And with that, I want
to do two more questions

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.100
I'd be remiss if not asking.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.605
I would like to do some word
association before we turn it

00:32:36.605 --> 00:32:37.480
over to the audience.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.984
This should be fun, everybody,
especially given the coffee.

00:32:39.984 --> 00:32:41.400
IDINA MENZEL:
--that I'm so tired.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.190
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Yeah-- chug.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:50.540
And also, I had
one more in here.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.150
Before you do that,
what's the one thing--

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.310
we do work at Google.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:57.340
What's the one thing that
we couldn't Google search

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.298
about you?

00:33:03.442 --> 00:33:05.150
IDINA MENZEL: So
there's a lot out there.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.275
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: I know.

00:33:06.275 --> 00:33:07.524
I know.

00:33:07.524 --> 00:33:08.835
IDINA MENZEL: I don't know.

00:33:08.835 --> 00:33:10.210
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Or you'd like

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:14.466
us to know that you wouldn't
normally talk about.

00:33:14.466 --> 00:33:16.590
IDINA MENZEL: Because, as
you see, I'm a open book.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:21.183
So it's like I don't
hide that much.

00:33:21.183 --> 00:33:26.630
But I'm pretty much
a slob at home.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.600
I'm not dirty.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.610
There's a difference
between dirty and messy.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:34.360
I don't like oatmeal like
left out for ants to eat.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.170
I don't like that.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.461
I like the counter to be clean.

00:33:36.461 --> 00:33:38.560
But like my clothes
are everywhere.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.530
The bathroom's a mess--
the towels, the things.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.120
The bed's hardly ever made
unless people are coming over

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.330
and I want to pretend
that it's clean.

00:33:52.087 --> 00:33:53.920
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: I
love that, by the way.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.340
I also a messy and dirty.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.030
There is a distinctive
difference.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:57.240
IDINA MENZEL:
There's a difference.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:57.420
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Yeah.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.061
IDINA MENZEL: We
shower all the time.

00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:00.560
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Yeah, thank god.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:00.990
IDINA MENZEL: My hair's clean.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.990
I just don't like
putting things away.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.547
I'm not very organized.

00:34:04.547 --> 00:34:06.880
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: If you
take anything away from here,

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.510
we both showered today.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.734
IDINA MENZEL: Yes, we did.

00:34:09.734 --> 00:34:11.150
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: But
we don't make the bed.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.066
IDINA MENZEL: Exactly.

00:34:12.066 --> 00:34:14.050
I showered last night
and this morning.

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:18.360
I brushed my teeth even, which
is a lot for a mother, who,

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.130
by the way, got up.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.540
My son slept at
dad's last night,

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.540
but he couldn't take him
to school this morning.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.750
And I didn't want
the nanny to do

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.280
that because I had enough time.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.342
So I got up, made his
lunches, because dad never

00:34:32.342 --> 00:34:33.300
makes his good lunches.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.170
I do.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:40.670
And then drove over there, which
is 10 minutes away, completely

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:44.190
in my pajamas, didn't brush
my teeth, rolled out of bed.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:46.199
Yet, I did it on Friday,
and the paparazzi

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:51.210
got a picture of me doing
that, which was really nice.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:52.679
I was dropping him off at dad's.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.580
And they said I was going to
daycare for dropping him off

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.330
at daycare, and it was
actually his house.

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:58.220
It was Taye's house.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.775
It was like get
your facts straight,

00:35:00.775 --> 00:35:02.800
But anyway, what was I saying?

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.712
So I was just a
mess this morning.

00:35:04.712 --> 00:35:05.670
The lunch is the thing.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.180
Got him to school
10 minutes late.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.050
Every mom at the school
is like perfectly coiffed

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.810
with like three kids and a job.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:12.410
I don't know.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:15.520
Me and like Amy Poehler,
we both go to this school.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.130
And she's the only
one I know, like I

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.600
can tell she rolled
out of bed in her PJs

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.990
and got the kid to school like
within a second of being late.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:27.230
And I'm like, thank god, for
Amy, because these other moms

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.912
are so annoying.

00:35:28.912 --> 00:35:30.089
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:30.089 --> 00:35:31.880
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Respect-- respect that.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.630
I see some heads nodding
in the room, yes?

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.430
We all love that.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.240
We've been there.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.160
Right on.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.140
I see some hands.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.600
IDINA MENZEL: Yeah, you've got
to sleep in like cool sweat

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.410
pants that with like a
cool rock-and-roll boot

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:44.260
looks like you meant
it, but you just slept,

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.165
and you wear the PJs to school.

00:35:47.165 --> 00:35:48.790
Put on the cool boot,
and it's like you

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:50.671
meant it to happen that way.

00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:52.296
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
These are pro tips.

00:35:52.296 --> 00:35:53.670
IDINA MENZEL: Yes.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:54.740
And I only have one kid.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.130
Some of these moms have three.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.900
So I don't know-- and they're
skinny, you know what I mean?

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.471
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
That's LA, man.

00:36:02.471 --> 00:36:02.970
That's LA.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.050
We can't explain it.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.110
IDINA MENZEL:
Can't explain that.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.100
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
I'm telling you.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.600
And then you get to New
York, and all you want to do

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.380
is eat a bagel.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.645
I'm like, can we please?

00:36:09.645 --> 00:36:10.520
IDINA MENZEL: I know.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.030
That's like the
minute I get there,

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.910
I have to order from this deli.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:19.500
I still know the phone number
by heart-- (212)993-3373.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.630
It's Bagel On The Corner Deli.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:22.850
It's crazy.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.610
I have to have a bagel with
cream cheese, a black and white

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:26.670
cookie.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.530
It's like going to the movies
and you have to have popcorn.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:30.300
As soon as I get to New
York, that's what I have.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:30.950
Anyway, I'm sorry.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:31.540
This isn't interesting.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.070
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
I respect that.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:32.470
No.

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:33.590
Did we all write
down that number?

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.150
I feel like that was a really
good bagel rec for all of us

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.280
here.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.610
We have a huge New York office.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.809
So this is actually great.

00:36:40.809 --> 00:36:43.100
And so with that, before we
turn it over to the honest,

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.300
I'm sure there's a lot of
burning questions, a quick word

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.650
association.

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:49.940
One word-- first one
that pops in your mind.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.228
Are you ready?

00:36:51.228 --> 00:36:51.936
IDINA MENZEL: No.

00:36:54.282 --> 00:36:55.490
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Progress?

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.310
IDINA MENZEL: Oh, I'm
going to be honest?

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:03.810
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Yeah, be honest.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.890
IDINA MENZEL: The name
of my boyfriend/fiance--

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:06.680
I hate that word.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.310
His name's Aaron.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.280
Progress-- I don't
know why he popped in.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:16.640
I think because he's-- yeah,
because I think he makes me

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.060
a better person.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.700
He used to be an actor.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.290
But now he's this amazing
addiction specialist

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.090
and has his master's
in psychology

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:29.430
and works in this rehab.

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:35.190
And he's a Neanderthal,
but he communicates well.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:41.770
And he's just-- I feel like I'm
my best self when I'm with him.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:45.200
So I hate that I made it
about a man, but I did.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.450
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Here we
are, progress [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.870
We'll try another one-- music.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.220
IDINA MENZEL: Walker came
into my mind, my son, Walker,

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.745
because I finally-- he
hates Mommy singing.

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:01.495
He hates "Frozen."

00:38:01.495 --> 00:38:03.870
He hates it all.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.200
But I got him to sit down
at the piano with me.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.050
I just shipped my piano from
New York to my new house in LA.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.630
And I got him to sit with me.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.600
You can't tell my
son to do something.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.870
He has find it on his own.

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.910
Otherwise, he's
like-- but we started

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:24.250
writing a little song
on the piano together.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:31.750
And we titled it, and it was
called-- what was it called?

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.669
"The Fire House" or something.

00:38:33.669 --> 00:38:34.210
I don't know.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.560
Anyway, it was a lot
of scary bass notes

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.800
because he's into
zombies and werewolves.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.390
But that was music
to me, because I've

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.870
been waiting to have a
moment where I could somehow

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:47.190
inspire him with my musicality.

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:49.661
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: I love that.

00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:50.160
Theater?

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.210
IDINA MENZEL: Home.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:02.070
Theater is home to me.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:05.700
No matter what has happened
in my career, ups and downs,

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.940
I always can go back.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.520
And I end up falling
into a wonderful show.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.930
Whether it's hugely
successful or not,

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:15.982
I have this experience
with a cast and community.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.410
Recording music is sort of more
of more solitary experience.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:32.440
And theater is family,
so, yeah, home.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.870
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: And time?

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:35.078
IDINA MENZEL: Time-- T-I-M-E?

00:39:35.078 --> 00:39:37.594
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Yeah, time.

00:39:37.594 --> 00:39:44.530
IDINA MENZEL: (SIGHING)
Time-- I'm blanking.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:52.220
Time-- time for me is age maybe.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.140
Yeah, the man wants
me to have a baby,

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.880
and I'm like, just
forget it, man.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.750
So it's time.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.220
Like is there enough time?

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:07.260
And if there is, do I even
want to do that with this time?

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:12.630
Or do I want to travel
and have a life now?

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.771
So it's kind of about
the clock ticking time.

00:40:15.771 --> 00:40:17.020
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: I love it.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.601
One last one-- joy.

00:40:18.601 --> 00:40:19.350
IDINA MENZEL: Joy?

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.400
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Yeah.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.941
IDINA MENZEL: Yeah,
joy is jumping on

00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:26.130
the-- it's the trampoline that
I built at my house-- jumping

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:29.270
both boys, total
release of energy,

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:32.730
just jumping on a trampoline.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:35.960
It's like so much fun.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.210
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: I love it.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:39.120
And with that, I'd love to
turn it over to the audience.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.830
We have some mics in the middle.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:42.874
Anybody want to come
up and ask a question?

00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:46.450
Oh, we already have one.

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:47.240
Excellent.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.031
IDINA MENZEL: It's
funny you have the mics.

00:40:49.031 --> 00:40:50.570
You probably can just ask me.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:52.519
I probably don't even need this.

00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:53.310
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.410
My name is Shannon.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.310
First of all, I just want
to make a comment before.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:59.430
Thank you for coming out.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.350
And I just want to
tell you that I grew up

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:04.120
like just so looking up to you.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.080
I lived in Arizona.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.560
And I'm sure we
all listened to you

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.550
and maybe didn't get
to see you on Broadway.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.910
And it was so cool because
you came here to the Greek.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:13.743
It was your first time,
I think, performing.

00:41:13.743 --> 00:41:15.070
And I came and saw you.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.910
And it was awesome
because you were so real.

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.580
I loved even just the
times in between the music

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.480
more than like your
actual singing.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.180
So it's cool to see
you, to be honest.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.590
IDINA MENZEL: I appreciate that.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.820
AUDIENCE: So I just say,
like I'm sure, in case

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.870
you don't hear it
enough, because you

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:32.480
said about the social
and I'm sure there

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.771
are people saying good and bad.

00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:37.010
But like keep being like
you and authentic and real

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.310
because like people
do respect that.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:41.137
IDINA MENZEL: Thank you.

00:41:41.137 --> 00:41:42.720
AUDIENCE: Now I'll
get to my question.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.180
So I'm always fascinated by like
how people prepare for roles.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.310
And so I'd love to hear about
when you prepared how was it

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.450
like preparing for like Maureen
an Elphaba and that time

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.710
in your life versus
preparing for like Liz, which

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.930
was like you're kind of
come back to New York,

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:01.840
and maybe that character
reflected more of like you?

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:02.650
Or I don't know.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.700
I'm just maybe guessing.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.880
And then how you prepare
for like your album,

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.610
like how does it like juxtapose
the preparation for a character

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:12.947
versus like--

00:42:12.947 --> 00:42:15.030
IDINA MENZEL: Well, there's
technical preparation,

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:18.190
which if it involves
music, then there's

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:20.510
like the singing
aspect, literally

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:25.020
the athleticism of
what that entails

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.880
and preparing that, which means
the teacher I told you about.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.284
It means like treating
myself, like if you were going

00:42:32.284 --> 00:42:33.950
to run the marathon,
you wouldn't go run

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:35.540
26 miles out of nowhere, right?

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.280
You'd build up.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.590
So I do all of this preparation.

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:39.554
I meet with her.

00:42:39.554 --> 00:42:40.720
We go through all the music.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.850
We pick all the things.

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:44.200
Like, oh, that's going
to be hard on a matinee.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.999
And like I start singing
a certain amount of time.

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:51.540
I literally little time myself--
15 minutes a day for a week.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.760
And then I start to move it up.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.509
And all of a sudden,
my voice gets bigger,

00:42:54.509 --> 00:42:55.940
and the range gets bigger.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.780
And so I treat that
like an athlete.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.830
And then as far
as characters go,

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:04.930
it's changed because
I feel like I

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:08.481
have more of a technique and a
process as I've gotten older.

00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:10.230
When I was younger, I
used to kind of just

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:11.280
throw it out there.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:20.650
But how do I prepare?

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.430
It's more to me
about the words, less

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:31.140
about worrying about how does
it feel to wear green makeup.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.090
I mean, I went and
watched "The Wizard of Oz"

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:40.490
and like watched
Margaret Hamilton.

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:45.440
But that was just to kind of get
some cool ideas to play off of

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.840
and a fun cackle and
her laugh, whatever.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:55.050
But for the most part, it's
about the language, the words,

00:43:55.050 --> 00:44:01.310
knowing them in such a way that
it's like song in a way, to me.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:06.310
It's like jazz, so I can just
be in the moment and riff off

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:06.820
of that.

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.030
Yeah, it's about knowing that
so well, that you can just

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.150
be open and receive.

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:23.060
So I'm not giving a good
explanation of that.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.435
AUDIENCE: No that
was good, yeah.

00:44:24.435 --> 00:44:25.840
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: I
think that was great.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.673
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:26.673 --> 00:44:28.358
IDINA MENZEL: Thank you.

00:44:28.358 --> 00:44:29.358
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Yes?

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.750
AUDIENCE: So when you are in
the middle of a run on Broadway

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.730
or something, what is
your daily routine like?

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:41.850
What's it really like?

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:44.090
Are you one of those
people that rolls out

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:45.917
of bed at noon and then--

00:44:45.917 --> 00:44:46.750
IDINA MENZEL: I was.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.645
AUDIENCE: Because
you work late, right?

00:44:48.645 --> 00:44:50.160
IDINA MENZEL: Yeah, that's
what's so hard about it.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.750
AUDIENCE: What is
that day really like?

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:51.950
I'd like to get a picture?

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.066
IDINA MENZEL: OK,
well, there's pre-baby,

00:44:54.066 --> 00:44:55.190
and then there's post-baby.

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:57.270
AUDIENCE: Well, also,
secondarily, I'm

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:58.870
sure it was
different now than it

00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:59.920
was when you were doing "Rent."

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.711
IDINA MENZEL: Yeah.

00:45:00.711 --> 00:45:06.040
No, it's sleep, sleep, sleep is
the best feeling for a voice,

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:10.090
first of all-- so as much
they pursue possible always.

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:12.370
But sometimes you can't.

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.814
And if you're nervous, you
don't sleep well either

00:45:14.814 --> 00:45:15.730
like the night before.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:19.190
But when you're in like
a routine, I come home.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:20.160
I watch a movie.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.880
I'm wound up.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.200
So I get home, and I'm
up late because I still

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:25.980
can't go to sleep.

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.070
I just did a performance.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:29.960
So that adrenaline
is still wearing off.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.170
So then, yeah, sleep in,
I steam all the time.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:35.190
I'm like a big steamer.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.199
So I will sit like in a shower.

00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:38.365
I'm not good for California.

00:45:38.365 --> 00:45:39.700
I waste a lot of water.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.510
But I like steam.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:51.110
I vocalize and then make
my way over to the theater.

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:54.000
But with the child,
it's just changed it.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.870
Because all of a sudden,
I couldn't get the sleep.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:04.315
Everything was just
thrown up in upheaval.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:10.042
I feel like I end up enjoying
myself more on stage now

00:46:10.042 --> 00:46:13.610
that I have a child because I'm
like, well, I can't be perfect.

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:15.870
So what can I do?

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.870
He had a fever, and I'm
trying to be a good mom.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:18.770
So I get up there.

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:20.740
And then I end up doing
better because I'm

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.160
more relaxed, because I just
throw caution to the wind.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.710
As opposed to like I
warmed up for 25 minutes,

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:29.389
and I didn't drink any wine, and
I didn't smoke any cigarettes,

00:46:29.389 --> 00:46:31.180
and I'm perfect, perfect,
perfect, and then

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.210
I still miss the
note-- oh, my, god.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:39.392
So now I'm more of a human
being, and I enjoy myself more.

00:46:39.392 --> 00:46:40.350
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:40.850
Thank you.

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.000
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Another one, yes.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.949
AUDIENCE: First off,
congratulations on your album.

00:46:48.949 --> 00:46:50.990
As another parent, I really
enjoyed the sentiment

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:53.750
in "Perfect Story."

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:57.650
Now more of a story of
myself, because after I

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:01.490
heard you singing "Defying
Gravity" in "Wicked,"

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:03.520
it inspired me to
start singing lessons.

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.500
Because I have no theater
background or singing

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.000
background.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.120
I'm a total geek.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.320
But I started taking private
lessons a couple years.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.245
I even started a
chorus here at work.

00:47:11.245 --> 00:47:13.550
And some of the
members are here.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:15.880
And just I've always
wanted to sing,

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.800
but I've never felt as
inspired as I did when I heard

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.380
you sing "Defying Gravity."

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.780
And I just wanted to be able
to sing along with that.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.120
And my singing
instructor has also

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.700
started off trying
to teach me how

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.970
to sing kind of like
you, the whole belt

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:32.440
by shouting, which
is a lot like--

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.750
IDINA MENZEL: Healthy shouting.

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:36.149
AUDIENCE: Exactly, without
destroying my throat.

00:47:36.149 --> 00:47:38.690
IDINA MENZEL: Well, because like
children scream all the time

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.070
and they never walk
around with laryngitis.

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:43.610
So they do it in a
way that's very free.

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:46.300
So that's the thought
process, not like screaming.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.375
It's that idea that you
call across the playground

00:47:49.375 --> 00:47:50.000
to your friend.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.860
You're like, hey, Johnny.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.370
And then you're like, hey!

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:56.420
It's the same thing.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.520
That's how I think of it.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.620
And I would listen to Chaka
Kahn and Aretha Franklin

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.990
and actually mimic
them all the time

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:05.320
to figure out how
are they doing that.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:12.020
And so the best way to learn
I think is to emulate people.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.200
And then because we're who
we are, it'll never be them.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.420
It will still be
unique and true to us.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.759
So anyway, I cut you off.

00:48:20.759 --> 00:48:21.800
AUDIENCE: No, not at all.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.754
I just want to let you know how
your singing has touched me.

00:48:24.754 --> 00:48:25.920
IDINA MENZEL: Oh, thank you.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:26.770
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:27.630
IDINA MENZEL: Thank you so much.

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.330
So what are you
singing in the choir?

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:30.940
What kind of music?

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.120
AUDIENCE: We kind
of sing everything.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.830
We sing "Summertime."

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:37.740
We sing Disney music.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.080
IDINA MENZEL: Oh, fun.

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:43.700
That's great I actually
miss being in a choir.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:46.340
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
Well, maybe, if you

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:52.830
would like to sing in a choir,
I'm just connecting dots here,

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:53.870
as the moderator.

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:56.186
It feels like
opportunities abound.

00:48:56.186 --> 00:48:57.810
IDINA MENZEL: I'm
very out of practice,

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:01.380
though, with the four-part
harmony and everything.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.260
It's coed.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.959
It's obviously--

00:49:03.959 --> 00:49:05.417
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
It's very cool.

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:12.390
AUDIENCE: So I have something
I've been wondering ever

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:14.940
since I saw "Enchanted."

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:18.260
And at this point,
you had very well

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:21.420
established yourself, both
in terms of your acting

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.320
and singing prowess.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.380
So it surprises me seeing
you in a musical movie role

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.320
without a song in
the whole movie.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.490
So do you have any thoughts on--

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.230
IDINA MENZEL: Well, it wasn't
written as a singing part.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.950
And so I actually
was so flattered

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:37.090
because I was like I know.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:37.720
I'm an actress.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.250
I'm not just a singer.

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.840
So I was happy and
relieved to not

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.006
have to worry about singing.

00:49:42.006 --> 00:49:45.310
Because a lot of
times it's a relief

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:49.850
not to sing or to worry
about having it all there.

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:51.420
So I was happy about that.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.500
But once I was in it,
they wrote something.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.370
And then it end up just being
superfluous because they

00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:57.590
were trying too hard.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:59.630
They wrote a whole song
for me and the prince

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:02.830
at the end, James
Marsden, and it got cut.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:03.692
He knew it too.

00:50:03.692 --> 00:50:04.400
I was so excited.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.500
And he's like, this
is totally ending up

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.310
on the cutting room floor.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:09.439
I was like, no, it's not.

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:09.980
It's awesome.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.605
He's like, there's no reason for
this song to be in this movie.

00:50:12.605 --> 00:50:14.710
They're going to totally cut it.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:17.609
But thank you for
thinking of that.

00:50:17.609 --> 00:50:18.650
But I was actually happy.

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:21.130
And then I got to take--
my first day of rehearsal

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:23.480
in that movie, I had to
show up at a dance studio--

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.780
a ballroom dance studio-- and
dance with Patrick Dempsey

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:31.254
and James Marsden this close and
learned-- and I'm not a dancer.

00:50:31.254 --> 00:50:33.170
People think is I'm from
Broadway I can dance.

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:34.830
I cannot.

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:38.460
I have to have a special
session with the choreographer

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.510
to teach me eight counts.

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:42.480
That's like how bad
I am, but imagine

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.470
having a go at those two hot
guys and like stand this close

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:48.740
and try to be-- it
was heaven and it

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.186
was hell at the same time.

00:50:52.186 --> 00:50:54.705
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you
for satisfying my curiosity.

00:50:54.705 --> 00:50:55.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.610
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: I
think everybody just

00:50:57.610 --> 00:50:59.590
had this wonderful vision in
their heads of those two men

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:00.810
at it exactly the same time.

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:01.440
IDINA MENZEL: Oh, my god.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.780
And you have to have your butt--
it's like "Dirty Dancing."

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:04.800
This is my dance space.

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.990
This is your dance space.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:09.910
He's going to like
touch my arm, like that.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:13.605
You know how when Patrick
Swayze does that thing.

00:51:13.605 --> 00:51:14.980
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
It's so nice.

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:17.012
IDINA MENZEL: And she's
like tickled by it.

00:51:17.012 --> 00:51:17.880
That's how I felt.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:18.820
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Let's
all just take a moment

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:19.922
and take that in for a second.

00:51:19.922 --> 00:51:21.210
IDINA MENZEL: You know what
I'm talking about, right?

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:21.560
In the movie?

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.059
OK.

00:51:22.059 --> 00:51:22.702
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:22.702 --> 00:51:23.910
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Oh, yeah.

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:27.490
Oh yeah, we got an
enthusiastic oh, yeah.

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:28.930
Any other questions?

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:30.681
We have time for one
or two more, anybody?

00:51:34.824 --> 00:51:35.740
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Tom.

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:38.265
So I was wondering, do
you have a favorite song?

00:51:38.265 --> 00:51:42.020
And how often does your
favorite song change?

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.230
IDINA MENZEL: Yeah, I don't
because it does change,

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:47.209
depending on how I feel.

00:51:47.209 --> 00:51:49.000
I can tell you that
the things people would

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.030
think I get sick, like "Let
It Go" or "Defying Gravity,"

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:55.370
I don't get sick
of singing them.

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:58.070
Maybe it's the
creature of theater

00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:00.410
that I am, where you
are always looking

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.300
for something new, just
the tiniest thing from show

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.600
to show to keep it fresh.

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.980
So that's an exercise
that I enjoy.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.692
So either it's a little
girl in the front row

00:52:11.692 --> 00:52:14.150
and I like, oh, I'm going to
sing "Let It Go" to her today.

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:15.380
She never saw a concert.

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.847
Or I think it to my son,
or I think of a new melody

00:52:19.847 --> 00:52:21.430
because I'm sick and
I have to come up

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.240
with something different cause
I can't hit the high note.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.740
So then I'm like,
oh, that was cool.

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:27.540
Whatever it is, I give
myself those exercises.

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.860
So that can be fun.

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.790
But it changes, depending
on the day, really.

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:36.280
That's the cool
thing about music

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:39.410
is like what you bring to it.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:44.280
The song kind of
unfolds differently.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.100
I used to sing "Both
Sides Now," Joni Mitchell,

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:54.040
and that was a great song
that would sort of just reveal

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.880
itself to me differently every
time I sang it, depending

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.600
on what perspective I had.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.250
So that was nice.

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:05.750
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: We hosted
you in the Joni Mitchell Room,

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:06.670
without even knowing this.

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:07.025
IDINA MENZEL: Oh, yeah?

00:53:07.025 --> 00:53:07.760
Is she here?

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.620
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: That
is the conference room

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.240
that we were in.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:09.370
IDINA MENZEL: Oh.

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:10.660
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: It
was all Joni Mitchell.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:11.535
IDINA MENZEL: Really?

00:53:11.535 --> 00:53:14.694
JULIE ANN CROMMETT: Yeah,
look at that, everybody.

00:53:14.694 --> 00:53:16.360
I know we have to
wrap up because people

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.509
have to get to
their next meetings,

00:53:18.509 --> 00:53:20.300
unfortunately, in the
workday, although I'm

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.883
sure everybody would
like to stay here

00:53:21.883 --> 00:53:24.020
for another hour, yeah.

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:28.960
If you could think of
one piece of advice

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.910
that you received that you'd
want to share with all of us

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:33.920
today, what's the thing
that always sticks out

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.430
in your mind-- piece of advice?

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:41.000
IDINA MENZEL: Is it
helpful in this arena?

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.460
I guess it could
be in life's arena.

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:55.960
Yeah, it's just, I
feel like nobody's

00:53:55.960 --> 00:54:01.450
looking for a copy or a
clone of somebody else.

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:05.690
So as much as we want
to be like other people

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:07.720
and admire other
people, the more we

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.150
figure out what makes
us completely unique,

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:16.480
that will be the most desired
thing, whether it's in the arts

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:19.410
or it's in business.

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:21.690
So when you find that
thing that sets you apart,

00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:24.090
that's the thing that's
going to make you

00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:28.910
more desirable and successful.

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:32.140
So like when we're
younger, we think

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:36.270
we should be like other people.

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.910
And it's not till we
realize that if we're

00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:43.830
as authentic as we can
possibly be, that eventually

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:49.182
that you will reveal
yourself to the world.

00:54:49.182 --> 00:54:50.640
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
That's awesome.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:51.520
Thank you for that.

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.050
And thank you for being here.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:53.480
IDINA MENZEL: Thank you, guys.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.570
I think they gave you
CDs and everything.

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:58.780
And also, like I think I'm
on Google Play or something

00:54:58.780 --> 00:54:59.310
like that.

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:00.930
JULIE ANN CROMMETT:
I believe you are.

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:05.970
In fact, download
it on Google Play.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.920
Everybody, please join me in
thanking Idina for joining us.

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.920
IDINA MENZEL: Thank you.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.270
