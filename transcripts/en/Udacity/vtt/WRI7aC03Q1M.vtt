00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.300
I hope this hasn't gotten too mathy for

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.240
you wonderful biology students out there, but I want

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.110
to throw one more big, cool calculation on

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.170
you. One way of actually measuring or estimating heritability

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.700
is to compare the correlation of a trait

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.250
between monozygotic twins and dizygotic twins. Now there are

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.360
multiple equations out there that people use to

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.520
estimate or calculate heritability. One of the one's that's

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.950
relevant to what we've learned so far,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.360
is using the correlations between monozygotic and dizygotic

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.410
twins for trait. And this is the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.870
equation here. Heritability is equal to two times

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.310
the monozygotic correlation minus the dizygotic correlation.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.130
Now the chief assumptions here are that monozygotic

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.560
twins Are twice as genetically identical as dizygotic

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.050
twins, right? Dizygotic twins are 50% identical and

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.590
monozygotic twins are 100% genetically identical. And that's

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.890
where this two comes in outside the parenthesis.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.650
Because monozygotic twins are twice as identical, or

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.610
two times as identical as dizygotic twins. So if

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.990
our heritability is low, if it's under 0.5.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.920
It means that variation in the trait reflect

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.620
environmental influences because the dizygotic correlation roughly equal

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.310
the monozygotic correlation. So we're getting a much lower

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.890
number from our equation. But if variation chiefly reflects

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.500
genetic influences, then the correlation between monozygotic twins is

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.218
going to be much higher than dizygotic twins. So we're

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:29.240
going to get a much higher heritability value. So let's

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.370
look at the heritability of a trait like height.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.870
So here we have a monzygotic correlation of 0.95

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.770
and a dizygotic correlation of 0.525. So if we

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.440
plug these numbers into our equation we get a heritability

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.450
of 0.85. And this is actually the heritability of height

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.080
in developed countries. Does this mean that the environment or the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.160
genome plays a larger role in determining the variability of the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.960
trait of height. Use this heritability value to decide your response.
