00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.080
Some deeply worrying things are, as always, happening in the world.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.980
However bad it is, we have an additional complication:

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.220
what we call the news, is really a business that understands that you can't make money

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.240
by telling people that things are, on balance, going to be okay.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.260
The point of the news is to make money by scaring us

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
(and it does this brilliantly).

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.120
But we need an antidote,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.920
and we can find it in a resource thats on hand to remind us that difficulties aren't new,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.160
that troubles can be survived,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.700
and that is has in fact been a lot worse than this before.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.820
It's an antidote we call 'history'.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.680
When political events seem to reach a new low,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.280
we might – for example – turn to the writings of the ancient Roman historian Suetonius.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.820
Born towards the end of the first century AD.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.860
Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus was an imperial administrator

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.400
and chief secretary to the emperor Hadrian.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.180
He was the first historian to try to give an accurate portrait of what the rulers of the empire,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.140
from Julius Cesar down to Domitian,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.500
had actually been like.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.500
It's a shocking story.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.700
Suetonius’s book amounts to a catalogue of extraordinary follies

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.400
and crimes of the first twelve men to rule the western world.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.200
Amongst them: 
Julius Caesar: Who emerges as a thief, a liar, an egomaniac and a murderer.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.620
Caligula: A notorious psychopath who, to quote Suetonius,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.820
‘sent people down the mines or thrown to the wild beasts

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.460
or confined in narrow cages where they they had to crouch or were sawn in half,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.920
not for major offences but because they did not properly admire a show he had sponsored at the Circus

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.040
or did not refer with sufficient respect to his genius.’

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.760
Suetonius tells us that:

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.560
‘The method of execution he preferred was to inflict numerous small wounds but avoiding all major organs.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.520
He often gave the command: ‘Make them feel they are dying’.’

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.340
Then came Nero; of him we hear:

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.000
‘He dressed himself in the skins of wild animals and attacked the private parts of men and women bound to stakes.’

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.900
‘He wandered through the streets at night randomly murdering strangers and throwing their bodies into the sewers.’

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.680
Afterwards, it was the turn of Vitellus: His ruling vices were gluttony and cruelty.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.400
He banqueted three or four times a day and he survived by taking frequent emetics.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.700
He used to give himself a treat by having prisoners executed before his eyes.’

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.600
Then it was time for Domitian:

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.380
‘At the beginning of his reign Domitian would spend hours alone every day catching flies

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.840
and stabbing them with a needle-sharp pen.’

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.440
He wasn't any nicer to his own people.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.440
Though Suetonius writes about grotesque individuals

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.620
– who were also at the time the most powerful people on the planet –

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.280
reading him can leave one feeling remarkably serene.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.680
One might read him tucked up in bed, after news of the latest election win.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.740
The experience is strangely reassuring, because it’s at heart a narrative of resilience.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.060
Suetonius writes of earthquakes, plagues, wars, riots, rebellions,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.040
conspiracies, betrayals, coups, terrorism and mass slaughter.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.200
Considered on its own it might seem to be the record of a society whose collapse must surely be immanent.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.040
But in fact Suetonius was writing before – and not after – the most impressive period of Roman achievement

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.620
– which would come fifty years later under the rule of the stoic philosopher and Emperor, Marcus Aurelius.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.660
The disasters that Suetonius catalogues were compatible with a society heading overall towards peace and prosperity.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.960
Reading Suetonius suggests that it is not fatal for societies to be in trouble;

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.100
it is in fact usual for things to go rather badly.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.400
In this respect, reading ancient history generates the opposite emotions to scanning today’s news.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.920
Events have been much worse before and things were, in the end, OK.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.000
People behaving very badly is a normal state of affairs.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.380
There have always been existential threats to the human race and civilisation.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.140
It makes no sense, and is a form of twisted narcissism,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.340
to imagine that our era has any kind of monopoly on idiocy.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.700
By reading Suetonius we enter unconsciously into his less agitated and more Stoic responses.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.600
He and History more generally encourage access to what we need now more than ever:

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.600
the less panicky, more resilient sides of ourselves.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.600
