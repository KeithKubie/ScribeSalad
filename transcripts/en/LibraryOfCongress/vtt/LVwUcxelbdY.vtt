00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.740
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: I have the
pleasure of introducing someone

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.860
who did research in the African
and Middle Eastern Division.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.260
I also have the pleasure
to introduce someone who,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.140
if we were giving an award
for innovative titles,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.980
would no doubt have
won it today.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.970
To a Professor -- Assistant
Professor of History

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:46.440
at Skidmore is going to speak
to us about "Biceps and Balls,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.280
Physical Culture in
Late Ottoman Bolis."

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.010
And for those who -- of you
who don't know what Bolis is,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.220
Bolis -- Polis is the
Armenian word for Istanbul,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.050
Constantinople, and it
brings me great pleasure

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.210
to introduce Murat Yildiz.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.010
&gt;&gt; Yay.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.790
[ Applause ]

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.280
&gt;&gt; Murat Yildiz: Levon,
you're too -- too kind.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.280
So before I begin, I would like
to thank Levon and the Library

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.380
of Congress for organizing
this amazing conference

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.990
that really -- I think, we
can all attest to this --

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.800
that reveals the
breadth and richness

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.720
of Armenian history and culture.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.380
It's an honor to be here.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.030
My talk today, as Levon
mentioned, is entitled "Biceps

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.630
and Balls, Physical Culture
in Late Ottoman Bolis."

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.860
Okay, so in fall 2010, I
started to conduct research

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.940
for my dissertation
project in Istanbul.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.810
I initially envisioned the
dissertation as a study

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.240
of the intersection of sports,
nation building, the body,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.880
and gender during
the late empire

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.750
and early Turkish republic.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.990
And more specifically,
what I wanted to do was,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.200
I wanted to investigate the
ways in which the bodies

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.580
of young men served as a
central site of nation-building.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.760
Like many Ottoman historians, I
started in the [foreign word],

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.850
or the Ottoman archive for
the Prime Minister's office,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.850
which basically --
which serves as the --

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.710
as the primary repository
for state archival documents

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.540
in Turkey related to
the Ottoman Empire.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.120
So my searches resulted
in me sifting

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.900
through government reports
on physical education,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.820
and team sports in schools,
government programs,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.170
and voluntary associations.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.340
They offered a number
of insights

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.560
into the burgeoning interest

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.390
in sports throughout
Istanbul during the time.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.040
However, they left
me dissatisfied.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.760
They left me dissatisfied
for the following reason.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.480
The documents created
the impression

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.240
that the Ottoman government was
the central actor in spreading,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.680
institutionalizing, and
popularizing sports.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.810
And in order to complicate
this narrative,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.770
I sought to diversify
my sources,

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.130
and explore the representation
of sporting activities

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.310
and institutions in the
expanding public sphere.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.880
And in order to do this,
I turned to the press.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.540
Magazines and newspapers
written in Ottoman Turkish

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.070
from the period offered
a rich set of textual

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.930
and visual coverage,
and discursive framing

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.890
of team sports -- mainly
soccer, gymnastics,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.110
competitions, and sports clubs.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.650
The Ottoman government wasn't
absent in these conversations.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.020
However, it was de-centered
from the narrative.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.920
In other words, the Ottoman
government emerged as one

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.760
of many actors, albeit an
incredibly powerful one,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.600
contributing to the spread
and popularization of sports

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.450
in the center of the empire.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.330
And I found myself asking
what was the significance

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.610
of these different
representations of sports.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.470
In order to answer
this question,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.220
I decided to bring these sources
and archives into dialogue.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.650
And I did so by reading
magazines in the morning,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.580
and files from the Ottoman
state archives in the evening.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.050
Now, this methodological
exercise revealed a number

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.410
of insights, one of which was

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.570
that some non-government
institutions were represented

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.580
in certain places
and not in others.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.730
Specifically, I noticed
some clubs that emerged

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.570
in government reports
were absent --

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.470
were absent from
discussions in the press.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.630
Now, for example, this report --

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.290
this report from the
Interior Ministry is a list

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.570
of voluntary associations,
written in Ottoman Turkish,

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.520
which included, but was not
restricted to sports clubs.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.950
Now, I was familiar
with some of these clubs

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.160
from the sports press,
and others less so.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.910
I was familiar with
some -- others less so.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.670
So one of the clubs, which I
hadn't come across in the press,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.760
was the -- and this is
the Ottoman spelling,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.440
Artivasat Gymnastique
Gymnyeti [phonetic].

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.540
And I'll say something about
the spelling in a second.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.220
This was the spelling
in Ottoman Turkish.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.030
This is around -- a
couple from -- a couple --

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.710
maybe one, two, three,
four, five from the bottom.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.450
Like all experienced researchers
-- and this is a joke --

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.410
I turned to the all-knowing
web for answers.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.360
I appreciate that [laughter].

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.890
Did not figure into
my table of contents.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.970
So these searches led me to
the work of Hayk Demoyan,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.280
who was at that -- then,
and now, the director

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.170
of the Armenian Genocide
Museum in Yerevan.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.630
Now, at the time, Demoyan had
recently organized an exhibition

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.870
at the museum, and
published a book

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.680
on Armenian sports
in the empire.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.740
Now, these project reveal --

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.270
these projects reveal to me

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.280
that Artivast Gymanstique
Gymyeti [phonetic] had another

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.460
name, more than likely a more
commonly-used one during the

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.290
time, and that was Cruchesmeh
Marnamasagan Artivast

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.590
Ugumph [phonetic].

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.740
Now, why hadn't I encountered
this club in other places,

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.810
is the question that I ask?

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.140
Were there other clubs,
and more specifically,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.020
were there other Armenian
clubs and figures excluded

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.580
from the documents that
I had been reading?

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.390
And if so, what was
the significance

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.740
of this seemingly-separate
sporting world

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.950
in late Ottoman Istanbul?

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.860
Now, I asked myself whether
early 20th Century sports

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.140
enthusiasts writing in Ottoman
Turkish knowingly excluded

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.590
Armenians from their
discussions.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.930
In other words, were they
unaware of Artivasts [phonetic]

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.380
and other Armenian
sports clubs' activities,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.770
or were they knowingly
ignoring them?

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.230
Now, an image of
three sportsmen seemed

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.300
to indirectly provide
the answer.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:00.150
Now, this titillating image
featured three men posing

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.170
and flexing their
divine -- defined bodies.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.120
That was a slip, but
it was actually very

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.470
enlightening [laughter].

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.910
Until that point, what had
captivated my attention

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.970
about this and similar
images was the presentation

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.220
of a gendered athlete
that was modern, strong,

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.490
beautiful, and also exotic.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.180
The text, however, now offered
a whole new layer of meaning.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.200
Now, at the top of the page,
the top right part of the page,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.010
the text reads "our robust
bodies, [foreign word]."

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.320
Now, the three men
are [foreign word],

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.100
or the naval officer
[foreign word],

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:47.200
or the gymnastic instructor
of Galatasaray club,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.930
and who was a major, [foreign
word], and the [foreign word].

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:58.430
Now, together, the text and
the images conveyed a number

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.860
of points to readers.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.140
First, these were
robust, beautiful bodies.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.580
Second, these Turkish male
bodies were cultivated

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.880
in sports clubs.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.180
They're connected to --

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.790
these figures are
connected to institutions.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.170
And third, these bodies
belonged to a group

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.550
of people, not just themselves.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:29.160
Okay? So I asked, who were
claiming these bodies?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.100
Was it the magazine?

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:36.310
Was it its readers, a broader
collective, a fan club?

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.430
Was there a difference between
these different communities --

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.490
communities of readers,
the magazine,

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.790
or a broader collective?

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.540
Now, I concluded that the
Ottoman Turkish sports magazine,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.920
through this image and others,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.170
was projecting an exclusive
reading of sports in Istanbul,

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.530
one in which Ottoman
Turks were the main,

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.570
if not the sole actors, okay?

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.050
And in doing so, what
the magazine was doing --

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.490
it was erasing the presence
of some Armenians --

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.990
excuse me, some Ottomans, and
foregrounding the presence

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.510
of others in the world
of sports in the city.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:18.760
Now, this conclusion haunted
me, because of its implications.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.780
Like the magazine, at that
time, I was contributing

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.100
to the historical erasure
of many Ottoman citizens --

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.730
more broadly, and more
specifically, Armenians.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.710
Now, I asked, could I write
an alternative history

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.790
that accounted for, but did
not reproduce, this erasure?

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.300
And if so, what would
this history look like?

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.190
Was it different than the
project that I had set

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.440
out to study as a
graduate student?

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.500
So I concluded that
the answers were yes,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.400
I could write an
alternative history.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.950
However, in order to do so, I
needed to expand my analysis

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.920
of the historical actors,
spaces, and institutions

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.700
that made up physical
culture in late 19th

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.390
and early 20th Century
Constantinople.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.690
What did this require?

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.390
This required an expansion of
the project's archives, sources,

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.040
as well as the languages
that I used.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.010
And it was at this point that I
began to study western Armenian

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.400
with a tutor, a very kind,
generous, and lovely tutor,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.300
and consult Ottoman Turkish,
but also Armenian sources.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.890
Now, this proved to be
an immensely challenging,

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.230
but also rewarding exercise.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.710
Now, the new methodological
approach offered exciting

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.930
insights into the ways in
which Ottomans, from a plethora

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.140
of different ethno-religious
communities,

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.150
shaped the defining
contours of sports

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.460
as a shared civic
culture in Istanbul.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.180
As a result, this approach
fundamentally reconfigured the

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.790
scope of the dissertation.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.860
And now, the metamorphosis of
the project enabled me to build

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.840
on the insights of a
new body of scholarship

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.600
that graduate students and
junior scholars of Armenian

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.540
and Ottoman studies
were producing

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.090
over the past decade, okay?

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.270
Now, bringing together sources
written in a diverse array

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.500
of languages, investigating
spaces, and transformations

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.010
across ethno-religious
divisions, and refusing

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:24.050
to treat communal boundaries
separating Armenians as Turks

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.820
as historically static
and impenetrable.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.040
This new body of literature has
produced what historian Lerna

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.760
Ekmekcioglu refers to
as an entangled history

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.660
of the late Ottoman empire.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.960
And in doing so,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.620
this scholarship has made
significant contributions

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.460
to both fields, but also
helped challenge this --

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.850
basically, this divide
between --

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:53.560
a firm divide between
Ottoman and Armenian studies.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.860
So what I'm going
to do now is --

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.160
and this is what I'm going to do

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.460
for the remainder
of the project.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.870
I'm going to focus on the
ways in which sports can serve

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.820
as an under-studied lens through
which we can write an entangled

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.430
history of the period.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.920
And specifically, I'm going

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.510
to examine the ideal
masculine characteristics

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:09.810
that Ottoman Turkish

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.550
and Armenian sports enthusiasts
worked out in a variety

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:19.570
of spaces in late
Ottoman Constantinople.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.780
Now, Ottomans from a variety
of professional stripes

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.960
and interests contributed
to discussions

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.530
about the ideal man
and his antithesis.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.400
Novelists, journalists,
intellectuals,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.620
as well as modernists,
all offered views

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.230
on the defining characteristics
of this new type of man

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.580
in the capitol more
specifically,

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.010
but also other urban centers
of the Ottoman Empire,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.110
and the broader region.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.570
Now, a major contributor

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.830
to these discussions was the
physical culture enthusiast.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.850
So during the late 19th
and early 20th Century --

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:58.090
centuries, advocates of physical
exercise and team sports argued

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.440
that it wasn't sufficient for
a modern, middle-class man

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.380
to study secular
subjects in school.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.980
This in and of itself
was a debate.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.140
But it wasn't enough to
just study secular subjects

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:13.120
in school, learn western
languages, work in an office,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.370
frequent social functions,
and dress in dapper clothes.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.990
He had to develop athletic
acumen, regularly exercise,

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.940
and maintain a healthy
and robust body.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.680
Now, some of the earliest
contributors to discussions

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.810
about the importance of physical
exercise in the construction

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:37.250
of the ideal man were educators
in a variety of Ottoman schools.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.380
It was during this period
that educators introduce

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.390
and gradually institutionalize
physical education

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.420
into the curriculum of a number
of different type of schools --

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:52.020
civil and military, foreign
missionary, and a diverse array

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.460
of non-Muslim communal
schools --

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.440
Armenian, Greek,
as well as Jewish.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.020
Now, two leading institutions
were Mekhtibi Sultani

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.600
[phonetic], or the Imperial
School, and this is an image

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:13.170
of young men posing from
the Imperial School,

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.470
and Robert College.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.230
Now, Robert College was
founded as an American college,

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.750
while Mekhtibi Sultani was
based on the French lysee model,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.050
and was a government
institution.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.990
Now, Turkish and
Armenian students

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.200
at both institutions
were exposed to the idea

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.050
that they needed to perform
physical activities in order

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.130
to develop strength and athletic
prowess, build character,

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.600
cultivate mental and
physical disciplines,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.270
as well as acquire a
competitive toughness.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.340
Educators asserted
that by exercising

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.160
and cultivating these
characteristics on campus,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.240
students would develop
into physically, morally,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.750
and spiritually sound young men.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:52.130
According to supporters of
sports, the regular performance

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.380
of gymnastics in particular
offered multiple benefits.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.380
One of the primary
ones was a strong,

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.570
defined, and healthy body.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.490
There's no debate there.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.320
Lifting weights, stretching,

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.170
and exercising helped
students develop a firm body,

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.730
and to fight off
different types of diseases.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.600
And this is the type of
language that is used

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.890
in a variety of different
sources.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.900
This hygienic, beautiful body
was envisioned as a modern one.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.720
Okay, so what we're doing
here -- this stands --

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.460
may stand out as a
beautiful body now,

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.310
but what we're seeing is
the historical production

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.610
of that idea.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.150
And it was deemed
to be a modern body

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:37.490
because its development required
work, discipline, and effort.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:41.040
Now, while gymnastics were
deemed an important physical

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.830
activity at Mekhtibi Sultani and
many private minority schools,

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.670
school officials at
foreign institutions

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.750
such as Robert College
were more concerned

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.470
with encouraging team sports,
and forming school teams.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:58.560
This is the Istanbul Dodgers.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.860
That's a bad joke.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.370
It's a baseball team
from Robert College.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.280
Educators believed that team
sports, such as baseball,

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.270
soccer, and basketball,
even moreso than gymnastics,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.220
helped students build trust in
each other, cultivate a respect

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.120
for rules, and develop a
commitment to teamwork.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.100
Soccer and basketball's
popularity did not catch on --

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.750
excuse me, basketball

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.210
and baseball's popularity did
not catch on, while soccer,

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.510
on the other hand, did.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.750
Okay. Now, another space that
advocated a distinction vision

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.200
of the relationship
between physical exercise

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.350
and masculinity was
the sports club.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.440
So during this period
of the late 19th

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.470
and early 20th centuries,
clubs --

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.370
sports clubs mushroomed
in different neighborhoods

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.930
around Istanbul as spaces
where young men could exercise.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:54.040
Now, upwardly mobile
Armenians and Turks,

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.780
as well as Istanbulites from
various different backgrounds --

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.060
ethno-religious backgrounds,
created and joined these clubs.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.190
And this -- the emergence
of sports club is part

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.690
of a broader transformation,

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.830
and that transformation
was the creation

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:10.910
of voluntary associations.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.210
Now, sports clubs
were predominantly,

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.490
although not exclusively,
spaces of male sociability.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.400
And what they did was, they
represented crucial sites

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.640
where historically-novel male
subjectivities were formed,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.500
negotiated, and performed.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.020
Now, what these spaces did
was, they attracted young --

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.940
likeminded and like-bodied
young men

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.860
by offering them a private space

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.690
where they could spend their
leisure time training their

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.860
bodies, performing
sports, socializing,

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.180
and building homosocial bonds.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.220
So what you're also seeing is
the creation of leisure time

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.580
as a space that needs
to be filled with moral,

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:53.720
productive activities, and the
sports clubs provided this.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.770
So what sports clubs did was,
they served as a testing ground,

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.520
a testing ground of an emerging
middle-class masculinity

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.110
in Istanbul where new
conceptions of the self,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.550
defined in relation to the
body, physical agility,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.850
a distinct look, and one's
ethno-religious community came

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.150
into being.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.990
Now, to a large extent,

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.060
these clubs embraced
a shared civic vision

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.740
of the defining characteristics
of middle-class masculinity.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.570
Young men needed to regularly
exercise, compete on the pitch,

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:29.090
maintain a well-defined
physique, regularly bathe,

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.350
shave their cheeks, wear
neat and dapper attire,

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.040
attend social functions,
and also read.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.200
This is a litany of different
things that they needed

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.530
to embody and to perform,

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.880
and the sports clubs
provided the space

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.380
in which they accomplished this.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.150
So at this -- but the same time,

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.920
these clubs also projected
an exclusive ethno-religious

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.770
understanding of
masculinity and sports.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.410
So sports clubs were
established along ethnic

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.820
and confessional lines,
and attracted members

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.610
from a specific ethno-religious
community.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.840
And they served as spaces

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.820
where young men built
ethnic-based solidarity

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.410
around a popular
activity in the city.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.650
Now, clubs conveyed
their shared civic

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.330
and exclusive ethno-religious
reading

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.840
of masculinity in
a number of ways.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.250
So the main language and
symbols used, and the eponyms

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.970
that organizations adopted
projected a distinct

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.770
ethno-religious identity.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.680
So some clubs explicitly adopted
names -- religious names,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.170
excuse me, while others
were named after a heroic

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.060
or mythological figure of the
club's respective community.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.780
So for example, the Maccabee
Jewish Gymnastic Society

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.860
[assumed spelling], the Hercules
Gymnastics Association [assumed

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.480
spelling], and the Armenian
Dork Club [assumed spelling].

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.510
Now, in doing so, club founders
sought to construct an awareness

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:55.440
of the idea that the club
served as a modern fraternity

00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:00.660
of young men who were
inheritors of a deep history,

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.980
a history of their
community's corporeal strength,

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.040
robustness, and valor.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:14.540
Now, club uniforms, which often
featured different scripts,

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.460
ethno-religious symbols, and/or
posters conveyed the idea

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.040
that this was an ethnically

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.600
and religiously exclusive
fraternity of young men.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.570
So here we have the Besiktas
Ottoman Gymnastics Club.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.420
We have Ottoman Turkish
being used, and actually,

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.270
in the back -- this is
a fascinating image --

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:38.710
there's a verse from the Quran
with a bulging bicep as well.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:43.060
Obviously, you all have this
poster at your house [laughter].

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.690
And here's an image of
the Armenian Dork Club.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:54.930
The -- for -- the title
doesn't carry the same resonance

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:59.400
that it does in Armenian,
and in English, obviously.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.730
Those Armenian speakers,
you can appreciate that.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:10.070
Now, a young Turkish and
Armenian man became a member

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.570
of an athletic club
by agreeing to abide

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.630
by the club's internal
regulations.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:16.930
Here are internal regulations

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.140
of the Dork Armenian
Physical Training Union,

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.350
and the Galatasaray
Physical Training Club.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.630
And paying regular
membership fees.

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.870
Now, after becoming a
member, what happened?

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.990
He received an identity card,
which featured his name,

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.720
and the date in which
he was registered.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.090
So what you're seeing
is a cultivation of --

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:42.820
cultivation, production, and
the performance of a self here,

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.780
but also that's part of a
broader community, right?

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.690
Community of the Besiktas Club,

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.070
or the Armenian Dork
Club, right?

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.340
Now, what did membership
provide?

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.760
It enabled young men access
to the various amenities

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:03.220
that the clubs provided,
such as a gymnasium,

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.210
a full set of gymnastics
equipment,

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.930
and a shower, as well.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.500
And this is some of the ways

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.480
in which clubs distinguished
themselves from others, right?

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.150
Who had the best shower?

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.980
Who had the best gym?

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.860
I hear people laughing,
but, you know,

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.720
this is serious stuff
[laughter].

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.020
How do you choose your gym?

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.330
Now, these were things
that, you know,

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.630
Bulsahais [assumed spelling]

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.620
and other community members
were grappling with at the time.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.280
Now, membership also
enabled young men

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.600
to perform their
athletic dexterity

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.860
in newly constructed
spaces throughout Istanbul.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.280
So basically, new, cool spaces
where people would gather,

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.330
such as stadiums,
gardens, and theaters.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.500
Soccer matches -- more
properly, football matches,

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.800
but we're not talking
about the pigskin.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.180
We're talking about the global
sport -- athletic competitions,

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.160
and gymnastics exhibitions
attracted large crowds

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.460
of spectators.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.040
It facilitated both intra-

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.000
and inter-communal
social interactions,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.610
and what it did was, it
celebrated the appearance

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:12.730
of young men wearing club
uniforms and performing novel

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.050
and physically challenging
activities.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.730
Now, many of the
athletic events,

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.740
such as the Armenian
Olympics, or [foreign word],

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.230
Maccabee's annual
gymnastics tournament,

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:27.310
as well as other shows
and competitions,

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.440
were all organized
in the same space.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.750
And this was the main space.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.410
Oh, that's of the
Armenian Olympic games,

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.000
but that's in the
same venue as this.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.370
This is the Union Club.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.250
And a number of these activities
maintained striking similarities

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.800
as well.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.410
So sports clubs,
therefore, served as spaces

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.590
in which young men cultivated
distinct notions of the self.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.530
Now, central to this
identity was the commitment

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.400
to a distinct understanding
of the body.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.990
Now, Turkish and Armenian
members deployed photography

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.020
as a means by which they
recorded their commitment

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.940
to a shared corporeal look.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.560
Members had their photographs
taken while dressing

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.420
in dapper suits, starched shirts
and ties, but also as well

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.420
as posing bare-chested in
order to highlight their sense

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.960
of style and beautiful physique.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.290
Now, there are two images
that I want to show you.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.130
So these images --
and they're part

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.640
of a broader kind
of sportsmen genre.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.160
The one on the right,
but also the left --

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:33.910
and I think of them as two
sides of the same coin,

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.530
that young men -- upwardly
mobile young men had taken

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.460
of themselves, and
also shared as tokens

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:44.710
of friendship, and
potentially more.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.710
Now, these images provide
basically visual representations

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.430
of these two interconnected
tastes and looks

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.060
of the gentleman athlete,

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.390
which club members
celebrated and promoted.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.000
The one on the left is Ali
Sami [assumed spelling],

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.800
of the predominantly,
although not exclusively,

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.080
Turkish Galatasaray
Physical Training Club.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.810
And I should note, because
this is being recorded,

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.270
that I'm not a Galatasaray
fan, necessarily [laughter].

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:11.150
I appreciate that.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.130
As well as Yetvart [assumed
spelling], on the right,

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:15.430
Shahonazar [assumed spelling]

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.950
of the exclusively Armenian
Artivas Physical Training Club,

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.250
okay?

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.710
Now, sports clubs served
as one of the main spaces

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.910
in which Istanbulites
contributed

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:28.620
to a broader discussion about
middle-class masculinity.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.700
However, these were
not the only sites

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.020
in which young men experimented
with these novel ideas.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.710
The press, for example,
was the more public --

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.720
was a more public space
than the actual association.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.170
Now, the growth of
literacy and the mushrooming

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.370
of reading rooms throughout
Istanbul and other urban centers

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.830
of the empire ensured that a
wider array of the citizens --

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.070
excuse me, of the
empire's citizens.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.650
Not just members of athletic
associations, were visually

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.420
and textually exposed
to the view

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.610
that young men should regularly
exercise, perform gymnastics,

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:03.820
and participate in team sports.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.850
So to rephrase, I
mean, think about it.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:09.550
You didn't have to be a
member of a club in order

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.640
to see men performing in
the stadium, the theater,

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.580
and the garden, but
also, you could read

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.880
about that in the press.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.290
And these were becoming
increasingly common,

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.230
both in terms of the
publication of these ideas

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:26.290
in daily newspapers, but also
specialized magazines, okay?

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:30.510
And now, what these publications
did, or what they constituted,

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.250
at least in my estimation,
is a public forum

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:36.070
that provided Istanbul's
growing reading public

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:40.330
with articles focused on
particular sports, scouting,

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.500
and other sport-related
leisure activities,

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.000
but also on a wider array
of issues of health,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.860
hygiene, and lifestyle.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.160
And what these discussions
did was,

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.350
they offered this aspiring
middle class with instructions

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.900
and guides on how
to become young,

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.890
modern men by playing sports,
having fun, exercising,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.520
and training their bodies.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.180
Now, while the physical culture
press embraced shared masculine

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:13.110
ideals, like clubs, they
also conveyed exclusive

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.410
ethno-religious ties.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:17.280
And this is accomplished
both through the languages

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.240
that are used, as well

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.960
as addressing its
reader, all right.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.630
So the fact that
Turks are addressed

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.660
in an Ottoman Turkish
publication as the reader,

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.910
or Armenians, and specifically
Armenians from Constantinople,

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:37.510
suggests that the ideal reader
is from this community, right?

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.740
And so, what you're
having is the construction

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:45.400
of an ideal Armenian self,
or an ideal Turkish self

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.760
in these publications.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.070
So written by educators, leading
members and administrators

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.600
of sports clubs, doctors, as
well as government officials,

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.460
these publications insisted on
the idea that young men needed

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.590
to regularly exercise.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:05.690
And they needed to exercise
not just at the gym --

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:08.560
and this is what's fascinating
about it, that you can exercise

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.560
at the gym, in a
school, but also at home.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.630
So what you're having is
the broadening of the spaces

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.240
in which you can
cultivate a new self.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.440
Now, the sports press
regularly ran guides,

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.740
and here's an example
of a guide.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.010
An illustration in
text and image

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:33.390
on the defining characteristics
of the ideal male body --

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:36.050
proportionality, strength,

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.570
and health were all
treated as interconnected.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.610
A person who maintained
a proportionate

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.000
and defined body was
considered strong, healthy,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.940
attentive, and disciplined.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.430
Now, in addition to indicating
acumen and competency,

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.490
the proportionate, flexible,

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.340
and defined male body
was treated as beautiful.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.700
And this is a really
interesting point,

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:02.000
how the term beautiful
is not -- it's --

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.380
we're seeing it being gendered,

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.450
but it's also applying
to men here.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.260
And you see both
the Ottoman Turkish,

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.600
[foreign word] being used,

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.320
and [foreign word] being
used in Armenian, okay?

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.910
Journals soon created entire
sections for photographs

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:21.310
of semi-nude young men
run as regular features.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.620
Here are two examples.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.530
The portrait -- photographs
published

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.030
in these magazines
included captions,

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.950
and this is what's
interesting, right.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.490
Without the captions,
these are just --

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:38.810
these are bodies that you can't
necessarily identify whom they

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.370
belong -- to whom they belong.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:44.770
But because they're
collated with text,

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.530
what you're having
is the inscription

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:51.290
of confessional difference
on these bodies, okay?

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:56.070
So here is a body of Jervat Bey
[assumed spelling] on the left,

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.560
and Wailim Safhibay [assumed
spelling] on the right,

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.390
both identified as
Ottoman Turks.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:08.090
This is an image of
Krikor Hagopian, and again,

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:12.020
you have the inscription on
that body as an Armenian body

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.740
with the Armenian text.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.730
In addition to this, there's
a description of that body.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.860
Here's -- and the
description is the following.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.100
It refers to Levon
Hagopian [assumed spelling]

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.400
and his brother.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.010
His brother's image doesn't
make an appearance next to his,

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:29.210
and the description
is the following.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.990
"They are among the few
Armenian youth who take care

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:35.320
of their bodies and
glorify the Armenian name

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.210
through their bodies, will,
and muscle," end quote.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.760
That's an intense sentence.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.830
So together, what these
images are doing is,

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.180
they're establishing that
these bodies -- and again --

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.480
and I haven't really
talked about this yet,

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.390
but this is a global phenomenon
at the time, in the late 19th

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.910
and early 20th Century.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.210
Levon is raising his hand.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.510
He's agreeing with me.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.810
No, he's not.

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:01.620
But these -- this image of Levon
Hagopian [assumed spelling] --

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.540
and Levon is a beautiful
Bolsahai [assumed spelling] man,

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:10.300
but that -- Levon can be found
in Paris, in New York, right,

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.200
in upstate New York -- hat's
where I currently live.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.750
Saratoga Springs, Los Angeles --

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.640
but it can also be
found in Bolis.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:23.530
And now, because that body
is identified in Istanbul

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:27.870
as a beautiful body in the
imperial capitol, it's global,

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.170
but it's also imperial.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.760
With the text and the
publication of that body

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.340
in this publication,
it's also confessional.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:37.960
So simultaneously, that
body is rendered global,

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.100
imperial, and confessional.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.910
Now, while educators

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:45.460
in the sports press
treated physical exercise

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.770
as the primary means

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.740
to construct the
defining characteristics

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.540
of the ideal man, other
voices promised quicker

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.460
and less conventional ways.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.500
Istanbul's multi-lingual
daily press is replete

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.480
with advertisements for pills,
which promised to provide men

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.270
with vigor and muscle.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:10.300
So an early 20th Century
advertisement, for example,

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.920
addresses, quote, "those

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.890
who have lost the strength
of youth," end quote.

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:17.650
So these are pills that promise

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.790
to provide people
strength, okay?

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:26.530
Now, other products sought to
help men who were impotent.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.810
Strong, beautiful, and
healthy men were supposed

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:32.270
to have a strong sex drive.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:36.930
So -- I know it's a
shock to all of us here.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:40.090
Here's an a-historical
statement that I'm making.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.730
Impotence was a sign
of weakness, okay?

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:46.520
Now, Amrita [assumed spelling]
-- this is a publication --

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:52.230
excuse me, a type of -- an ad,
and a product, served as one

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.500
of the most well-known
products that promised

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.450
to restore the virility to
all impotent men of all ages

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:02.820
in the capitol who, quote,
"conduct a regular life,

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.140
but silently suffer from the
mistakes of their youth."

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.370
And we can hear dun, dun, dun.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.120
Amrita ran identical
advertisements

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.630
in Ottoman Turkish,
Armenian, Greek,

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:19.930
and French daily newspapers in
order to reach these poor souls

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:24.890
in the -- in the capitol, who
were all afflicted by these --

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:27.110
who were all afflicted
by impotency.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.940
And here's the --
here are the ads.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.200
Now, these two advertisements
publish an identical caricature

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.760
of an dapperly dressed gentleman
and the following headline.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.160
"Only for men, an important
announcement for those

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.080
who have lost the
strength of the body."

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.590
Now, the advertisement is --

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:49.520
you know it opens a really
interesting question about,

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.820
you know, marketing.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.010
I don't know how successful
they were, because there's a lot

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:57.480
of text here, but the
text is very rich,

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.150
in terms of what it
-- it goes on to talk

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:05.650
about how people actually
become impotent, what are some

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.390
of the immoral activities
that they engage in.

00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:10.740
Alcohol is one of them.

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.370
Gambling is one of them,
and, I should warn you,

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:19.330
dark and thick tea -- and tea
as well, according to Amrita.

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:23.500
So if you have had a lot of tea
and coffee today, you may want

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.330
to look into Amrita [laughter].

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.170
Okay? According to the product.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:30.670
Now, it goes on.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.860
It says, "I have prepared a
miraculous and effective pill

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.700
that will give hope
and joy to those

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.830
who are afflicted by impotency.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.020
This pill that I have
invented will heal the health

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.130
of those men who have
been completely weakened

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:45.430
because of bad practices, or
have been under the infrequence

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:47.830
of unfavorable circumstances."

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.660
Keeps that kind of broad.

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:53.050
"This cure that I have invented
is a blessing for everyone.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:56.590
It gives everyone
health and strength."

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.710
Now, what's going on here?

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:03.510
At first glance, gymnastics
guides and advertisements

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.110
for pills and tonics published

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:07.460
in Istanbul's multi-lingual
press seem

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.930
to be fundamentally different.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:14.220
However, I would argue they
maintain striking similarities.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.850
They all -- they're
all concerned

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.720
with helping men
rejuvenate their bodies.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.660
And as a result, they
provide an insightful window

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:28.350
into the diverging approaches
that educators, writers,

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:32.970
manufacturers, and
advertisers proposed

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.240
that the ideal man adopt
in order to be a strong,

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.610
beautiful, and virile body.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.450
Now, moreover, these conflicting
approaches constituted an

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.850
emerging market, which treated
the body as a central site

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:47.360
of male subject formation.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.220
Now, in conclusion, the writings
of educators about sports,

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:55.620
physical culture, the
activities of club members --

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.830
they all demonstrate that
young men articulated

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:59.650
and performed their
gendered identity

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:03.390
by cultivating a defined body
and regularly exercising,

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:07.080
and were reading about exercise
in late Ottoman Istanbul.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.720
Together, sports, sports clubs,
and the press served as spaces

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.820
where Istanbulites from
a variety of backgrounds,

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.860
including Armenian and
Turkish, experimented

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.330
with new conceptions
of the self.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.080
Now, while I have demonstrated

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:25.050
that Ottomans espouse similar
views about the importance

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.710
of physical exercise,
techniques of the body,

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:32.070
and athletic acumen, I have also
attempted to highlight the fact

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:35.250
that Ottomans worked out
these ideas within spaces

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:37.790
that projected exclusive
ethno-religious ties,

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.870
and that were firmly divided
along confessional lines.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:45.720
Thus, these clubs and the press
might've embraced the share

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.760
masculine ideal, but they
also cultivated an exclusive

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.710
ethno-religious identity among
their readers and members.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:57.450
Now, this, I want to stress,
should not be interpreted

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:00.300
as contradictory, at
least in my estimation.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.260
On the contrary, I think
it invites us to examine --

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.180
and I'm speaking
to all historians

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.020
of the time period, really.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.290
It invites us to examine
the ways in which Turks

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:14.720
and Armenians experimented with
and shaped the defining contours

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.830
of other novel practices,
beliefs,

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.170
and norms within the boundaries

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:21.840
of ethno-religious
communal spaces

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.470
in a late imperial session.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:26.510
Thank you for your attention.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:32.900
[ Applause ]

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.650
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan:
Thank you, Dr. Yildiz.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:44.650
Our next speaker is a dear
friend of mine, and a colleague

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:50.240
of many, many years, Theo van
Lint, who is the professor

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.820
of Armenian studies
at Oxford University.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:59.380
He has chosen one of my favorite
poets of the 20th Century --

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:03.760
as a matter of fact, one of my
favorite Armenian poets ever.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.480
His talk is on "Poetry,
Patria, and Pedigree,

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:13.250
Eghishe Charents' Monuments
and the Muse's Discontent."

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:14.610
&gt;&gt; Theo marten van
Lint: Thank you, Levon,

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:19.170
for organizing this
wonderful gathering.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:24.470
I am sorely tempted to
do 10 pushups before I --

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:27.870
[laughter] before
I start [laughter].

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.850
From the poetry of
the body to the poetry

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:35.460
of the Muse's Discontent,
so -- [laughter].

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.180
Thank you very much.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:43.700
Yes, so you see, friendship
blossoms in many ways,

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.040
and leads to all
kinds of things.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:52.070
"Poetry, Patria, and Pedigree,
Eghishe Charents' Monument,

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:54.330
and the Muse's Discontent."

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.610
A poem rarely exists
entirely on its own,

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:02.010
revealed by divine inspiration
without any cultural context.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:04.980
Almost every aspect of it
exists thanks to a network

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.200
of conventions, applied
and tweaked anew

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.110
in a never-ending flow
of creative activity.

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.830
These carefully-chosen
conventions carry particular

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.500
meaning, and their application
by poets through space

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.260
and time is potentially
very powerful,

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.830
as they place their
work both in a tradition

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:25.020
and in their own
contemporary context.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.680
My contribution today
addresses this double phenomenon

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.060
of conventionality and
contextualization through a poem

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.710
by the Armenian modernist
poet, Eghishe Charents.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.410
It was the poem that
triggered these considerations,

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.110
not the phenomena addressed.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.560
For me, the source of the study
of literature is the text,

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:48.250
from which all else follows.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.710
In January 1934, Charents
finished a poem called

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.920
"Monument" in Armenian,
which is a first indication

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.720
that something particular
is going on.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.300
So "Monument" -- the poet could
have called it [foreign word],

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.900
the usual and indigenous
Armenian word.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:08.590
Why use a word that had clear
western and ancient overtones?

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.650
In fact, it hails
back to a famous poem

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:14.310
by the Latin poet Horace
that is [foreign word],

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:17.380
written just over
2000 years ago.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.910
Its opening line
is [foreign word],

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:25.790
"I erected a monument
more durable than bronze."

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:29.200
The connotation with classical
imperial commemoration is

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.970
visually present as
well, as you can see.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:36.680
The date is in Roman letters, in
literally monumental capitals.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.680
They are not Armenian
ones, which are used

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.900
to indicate numbers as well,
as you know, or Arabic numbers,

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.770
as is common in the western
world, and as it was also

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:47.570
in the Soviet Union, where
Charents wrote his poem.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:50.810
Yet, the reference
is not direct.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:54.350
It does not bridge 2000
years without intermediary,

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:57.510
because the opening words of
Horace's poem, [foreign word],

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:01.800
are the motto of a famous
Russian poem Eghishe Charents

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.100
knew very well.

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:06.980
It was written in -- a
Century earlier, in 1836,

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:11.080
by Russia's national poet,
Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.510
This is its opening line.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:18.710
[foreign word], "I erected
a monument for myself,

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.400
not made by human hands."

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.140
What's going on here?

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.640
I'd like to spend the time
allotted to this talk trying

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.180
to suggest some answers
to this question.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.810
First, let us look at the poems.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.110
That's always the most fun.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:34.760
Latin, Russian, and Armenian --
I began with the Armenian one.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.510
So here it is, "Monument."

00:41:37.510 --> 00:42:24.060
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.600
Twelfth of January, 1934.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.500
In English -- whoops, this
is the young Charents,

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:38.500
more or less, returned from the
fighting around Van in 1915.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.870
This is Charents as he may have
looked when he wrote the poem.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:46.780
And this is the English
translation.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:50.730
"I erected a monument for
myself in a difficult age --

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.580
" in a fraught age, perhaps --

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.730
"when everything was
going to ruin around me,

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.240
that for many years, for
centuries, had stood,

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.200
and had seemed immortal
in the world.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.500
I wove my monument out of
songs profound and complex,

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.270
from thoughts that are red
hot anew, that carry life

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.790
in themselves, that can
flow in gushing forth

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:11.610
from the fiery heart of my age.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:12.940
I was born in Kars.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:16.800
However, in my soul, the song
of Iran was always a flame,

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.650
like an old native yearning
unquenched, but the native land

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:24.790
of my soul became
the entire world."

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:28.570
This is an image of the Church
of the 12 Apostles in Kars,

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:33.070
with the elevated
castle in the background.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:34.980
You can just about see it.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.730
Now we go back 2000 years.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:46.330
This is a newspaper photograph
of Horace declaiming his poem

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:48.780
in front of his audience.

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.450
I will read this in Latin

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:57.150
in a very approximate
meter, I must say.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:00.530
It's not simple to follow this.

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.140
So I will make mistakes.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.510
Let it be recorded.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:53.500
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.750
And this is another 19th Century
impression of Horace, you see,

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:03.200
wearing the laurels
of the poet king.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.200
The English translation here,

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.980
which will give us some more
insight, is by Ted Loker,

internet.

"I have created a monument
more lasting than bronze,

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.530
and higher than the royal
site of the pyramids,

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.320
which neither harsh rains nor
the wild north wind can erode,

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.220

succession of years,

in the eyes of posterity so long

of Apollo for my crown."

Personal fame and prowess

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.550
as poets are central
to Horace's poem.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.040
Horace is one of the
most-quoted classical authors

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.540
in western civilization.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:21.090
The Dutch big dictionary has
250 quotations from his work

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:24.530
that phonated into
21st-Century Dutch.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.730
The reason for his fame,
however, does not lie

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.240
in the fact that
he was the first

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.400
to put Greek verse
into Latin meter.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.830
That is of less importance
to us than it was to him.

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:36.070
To trace the itinerary
of Horace's work

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:39.240
of almost two millennia
is not my intention here,

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.690
nor can I trace the particular
root the Horace reception took

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.990
in Russia.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:47.120
But through 18th Century ground
tours and enlightenment context,

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.540
including the strong
presence of French literature,

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.660
as well as their
school curriculum,

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:54.800
well-educated youngsters
like Alexander Pushkin --

or Sasha Pushkin, as he
would've been then --

would have gained
knowledge of the classics.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.250
And here is Pushkin.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:15.510

slander with indifference,

This is Pushkin, what
he may have looked

like in 1836, by Pyotr Sokolov.

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:46.830
The translation of this
poem is by Catriona Kelly,

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:49.870
professor of Russian at Oxford,
who makes it a central pillar

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:52.020
of her admirable, very
short introduction

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.890
to Russian literature.

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:57.950
One may wonder, what binds these
particular three poems together,

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:01.470
so wide apart in time and space?

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:05.140
The interrelationship between
poems mentioned at the opening

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.050
of this presentation
and the trivial fact

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.610
of temporal sequence
give partial answers.

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.990
Charents built from Pushkin,
who built from Horace,

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:13.290
while Charents was, himself,

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:16.130
part of the Russian-language
reception of Horace.

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:21.080
Charents, the communist Armenian
poet, was raised on the Russian

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:25.380
and western European culture,
apart from the Armenian one.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.130
The Latin poetic tradition does
not have a strong reception

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:32.250
in Armenian literature, quite
in distinction to the Greek one,

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:34.530
which is overwhelmingly
present from the beginning

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:38.140
of the Armenian written
tradition in the fifth Century.

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:41.350
It was only from the early
modern period onwards,

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:42.720
through the highly successful

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.320
and culturally savvy Armenian
merchants, as we have seen,

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.480
and the Catholic
Armenian Methodist fathers

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.470
that [inaudible] and post
[inaudible] European classical

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:54.680
reception entered
Armenian literature.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.580
In the poems, a set of
binary oppositions seem

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:02.520
to present themselves -- poet
and patron, poetry and politics,

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.200
native region and the wider
world, and the direction

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.440
from local to
world-encompassing.

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.730
And two more construed
ones, perhaps,

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:13.810
fame versus civilization,
and the combination of poetry

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:17.880
with freedom over against
empire and oppression.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.520
The latter opposition makes
itself more clearly heard

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.310
in Pushkin and Charents
than in Horace.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:26.990
The life and work of all
three poets was defined,

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:30.520
to some extent, by a
patron, with all the shades

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.940
that word can muster, Maecenas.

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.850
This literally was the name
of the protector-become-friend

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:38.710
of the down and out Horace,
who was superbly gifted

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:42.330
but financially broke after he
had sided with the Republicans

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:44.100
in the Civil War
following the murder

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.400
of Caesar -- Julius Caesar.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.260
Horace had received the best
possible education in Rome,

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:53.070
and then in Athens among
the elite of the empire.

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:56.010
Horace was then introduced by
Virgil, the other great poet,

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.470
to Maecenas, who
gave him a villa,

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:00.890
and thus the leisure
to write quietly.

00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:02.190
I would like that [laughter].

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:06.400
Ere long, Augustus, the
emperor, offered him a position

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.590
as his personal secretary,
which he refused.

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:14.030
He also kept intrusions into his
independence by Maecenas at bay.

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.750
This is a paradigmatic example

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:18.450
of the way artistic independence
is maintained in the need

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:21.230
of patronage, and how
recognition can be an even

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:23.020
greater threat to it.

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.830
Being Augustus' personal
secretary would've left him

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:28.740
neither the leisure to
write, nor, one must assume,

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.430
the freedom to choose
his own themes.

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:31.930
I mean, this is 2000 years ago.

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:36.130
It's still very actual.

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:39.710
Directly comparable are the
cases of Pushkin and Charents.

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:42.060
The latter was embraced
by the socialist system

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:44.810
with state and art patronage.

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:48.300
Pushkin was a small
aristocrat of mixed heritage.

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.610
He also received the
best possible education,

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:55.550
the elite lysee of [inaudible],
followed by a life dedicated

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.820
to poetry and court
cavorting, or carousal.

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:03.540
However, Pushkin's outspokenness
soon earned him exile.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:07.310
Then, his poetic career took
a turn, evoking Horace's fate.

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:10.320
Following the Decembrist
uprising of 1825,

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.780
Pushkin was interrogated
by the Tsar in person.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:16.330
The poet came out
with honor intact,

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:17.970
but had to accept the favor

00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:20.840
of the emperor's
personal censorship.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:22.790
In practice, this
meant subjection

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:27.560
to Count Alexander Benckendorff,
founder of the secret police,

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:30.430
precursor of the KGB,
to the an institution

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:34.210
that might lend him another
term of exile, or worse.

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:37.870
We find echoes of this in
one line in Pushkin's poem.

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:40.660
You may wonder which one.

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:46.080
[foreign word], "in my cruel
age, I have celebrated freedom."

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.690
This line recurs, in fact,

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:50.410
in the opening line
of Charents' poem.

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:52.940
Nothing here about the
quality of the monument,

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.520
as in Horace's more durable than
bronze, and Pushkin's not made

00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:00.150
by human hands, which by the
way is a reference to ikons,

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:02.670
that are not made
by human hands.

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:07.910
But "I erected a monument for
myself in a difficult age,"

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:11.480
followed by the devastating,
dystopian lines allowing

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.120
for an interpretation
denouncing the revolution he had

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.510
so enthusiastically
embraced two decades earlier,

00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:21.080
as well as mourning
the genocide of 1915.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.460
"When everything was
going to ruin around me

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.720
that for many years, for
centuries, had stood,

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:30.060
and that seemed immortal in the
world" -- the end of tradition,

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.160
the end of immortality.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.760
Does Charents predict his
own immortality instead?

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:39.900
The last minutes allotted
to me, I would like to spend

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.400
on Charents' trajectory --

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.700
in particular, a brief
consideration of the state

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:50.850
of the art of poetry, and by
extension, but flowing from it,

00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:54.880
the value of the word
in today's society.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:58.100
Where we stand, there seems
ample reason for caution,

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:01.210
seeing the value of the
word in politics here

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:04.460
in the United States,
in the United Kingdom,

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:05.760
and in my native Europe.

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.830
Where it is difficult
to find people capable

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:11.230
to unite the remnants of
humanistic culture based

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:14.510
on the Greek Judeo-Christian
tradition into a vision

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:18.150
for the continent in danger
of caving in once again

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.880
to ignorant populism
and rampant nationalism.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:25.200
Here, the muse's discontent
comes to the fore in full force,

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:28.530
as it had in Pushkin's
and Charents' poems.

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:32.870
For we must be aware of the fact
that both our disenchantments

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:35.640
of Horace's triumphant
proclamation of a victory

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.360
of poetry over politics,
and more generally,

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.840
of culture over politics --

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.210
after all, he had erected
a monument more durable

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:47.140
than bronze, the stuff
emperor's statues are made of.

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:49.380
He might just as well have
mentioned the word marmer --

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.680
marble.

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:55.690
Moreover, if Pushkin's laconic
final advice to the muse,

00:55:55.690 --> 00:56:01.190
and to himself, [foreign word],
"and don't' dispute with fools,"

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:04.380
betrays a trust in rational
persuasion, in Charents,

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.950
we find a completely
different emphasis,

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:08.870
one that in my view
is now more actual

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:14.120
than it has been for some time.

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.080
[foreign word], "the native land

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.460
of my soul became
the entire world."

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:23.300
This is both a return
to Goethe's ideal

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.340
of [foreign word],
world literature,

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:28.030
and one to socialist -- to
the socialist international,

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:31.960
if you want -- an overcoming of
nationalism and limiting origins

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:35.710
in a forward-looking movement
towards a better world.

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:37.220
Much could be said about this,

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.910
as it represents a typical
Charentsian paradox,

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:41.990
in particular in
his later years.

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:44.710
The communists denouncing
totalitarianism,

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:47.930
and the cosmopolitan atheists
returning to the religious great

00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:51.070
of his native Armenian
tradition, [foreign word],

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:54.390
even more appreciated by him.

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:56.170
Possibly an understandable
preference,

00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:58.450
given the free poet's
temperament,

00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:01.540
but this is not the time
and place to go into that.

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:04.360
What does need to be noted
is the seemingly veering away

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.540
from poetics to psychology.

00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:09.290
Charents gives pride
of place to the soul.

00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:12.630
In fact, what happens here is,
on the one hand, a consequence

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:16.140
of the socialist realist forging
of new souls, interpreted,

00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:21.270
one is tempted to say, without
the encumbrance of ideology.

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:24.290
Of that, Charents had, by now,
become more than a little wary,

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:26.110
of which the opening stanza

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:28.570
of the poem eloquently
bears witness.

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.580
On the other, it is a
consequence of the power

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.360
of the alternative to the
ideology of nationalism,

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.390
the dire consequences of
which he had witnessed

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:38.300
in a genocidal attempt by the
Ottoman Turkish government

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.490
at the annihilation
of his people

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:43.180
under cover of World War I.

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.640
Precisely how the whole
world became the native land

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.130
of his soul is intriguing,
because that is

00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:51.380
through the poetry, through
the power of the word.

00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:54.860
Therefore, no veering away, in
fact, from poetry after all,

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.680
but the strengthening
of the bond

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.610
between poetry and personality.

00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:01.870
The last years of Charents
life, in particular,

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:03.860
bear eloquent witness to this.

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:05.730
He set out on a journey
of absorption

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:09.420
and creative expression while
his life was in constant peril.

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:12.260
His work was taken away
from him, as were his wife

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:15.120
and children, and soon, his
health and freedom as well,

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.840
followed by death in prison.

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.500
The pressure must
have been unbearable.

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:25.840
On 28th March, 1937, he writes,
in quiet recognition of the fact

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:30.470
that he turned 40, and had
been a poet for 25 years,

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:34.560
"I am celebrating my double
jubilee, alone, and persecuted,

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:38.140
a poet exiled in
his own fatherland."

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.300
The late Charents awaits
deeper exploration,

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.930
and offers both pearls
and cups of bitterness.

00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:46.950
The philological situation
of his later work is very,

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:49.380
very difficult, due to the
fact that it had to be buried

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:51.500
in the ground, and
we don't have anyone

00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:54.480
to tell us how he
would have liked

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.310
to have eventually edited it.

00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:59.670
And so we have various
editions of his work

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:06.610
that bear no relationship to one
another, nor a real account --

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:12.140
accountability of how
these are represented.

00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:16.020
There is a parallel
with the work

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.900
of Osit Mumbo Schtum
[assumed spelling].

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:22.080
However, Osit Mumbo Schtum's
widow knew everything by heart,

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:24.430
and knew what he had
wanted to do with it.

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:27.870
So there was a big
difference there as well.

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:30.400
In 1937, Charents was somber

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.200
about what he proclaimed
in his monument.

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.470
It had been -- despite the
clearly disillusioned tone,

00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:39.770
at least been partially
triumphant.

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:45.370
So he says, and there are
five separate lines published

00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:48.510
together, in one case with
the fifth one lacking --

00:59:48.510 --> 01:00:16.770
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:19.890
-- "you were born null
and void, like a number

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:22.190
with a zero overlooked.

01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:23.730
In Kars, you may have been born,

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:26.030
but the world was
your fatherland.

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.760
Kars, and Maku [assumed
spelling], and the world --

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.990
which was your land, poet?

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:35.160
Kars, and Maku, and the world --
all of it was your land, poet.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.180
Woe to you, Charents,
either way.

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:41.690
Neither your song nailed
it, nor your life."

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:43.270
Charents' restlessness

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.370
in his final years
does not seem directed

01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:47.550
at the realization
of a political ideal.

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:51.210
It has become clear that the
communist experiment is both a

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:53.740
farce and drenched in blood.

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:56.930
The poet's remaining energy is
directed at two areas of life,

01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:59.370
it seems, and this
needs checking --

01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:02.640
poetry, and the exploration
of religions, always engaged

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.510
for the good of humanity.

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:07.500
What the conclusion has to
be about the relationship

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.680
between poetry and politics
is unclear so far, for me.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.900
A political system
that murdered poets

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.590
by the dozens clearly took the
poet word extremely seriously,

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:20.850
feared it, and tried to kill
poet and destroy poetry itself.

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:24.570
Poetry is a means to find truth,
to insist on honesty in life

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:27.910
and society, forms part of the
wider endeavor to speak truth

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:32.420
to power, beginning with
oneself -- truth to oneself.

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.290
Dire experience stripped
Charents of all pretense,

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:37.680
and in the end, what
remained was the word,

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.210
the word that had also been
there in the beginning.

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:46.970
A contemporary of Charents,
W.H. Auden, in January 1939,

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:49.670
commemorating the death
of William Butler Yeats,

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:51.290
wrote three poems, in the second

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:54.050
of which the following
movement occurs.

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.250
"Poetry makes nothing happen.

01:01:56.250 --> 01:02:00.350
It survives in the valley of
its making, flows on south

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:03.530
from ranches of isolation
and the busy griefs,

01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:06.290
raw towns that we
believe and die in.

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:10.370
It survives, a way of
happening, a mouth."

01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:14.100
Auden finishes the third and
final poem as a blind song,

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.670
in assured way keeping intact a
belief of the power of the word

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:21.340
as life-creating, and
as a life-giving gift.

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:24.620
You probably know it.

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.370
It's a fantastic poem.

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:27.670
"Follow, poet.

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:29.390
Follow right to the
bottom of the night.

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:31.630
With your own constraining
voice,

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:34.110
still persuade us to rejoice.

01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:37.650
With the farming of a verse,
make a vineyard of the curse.

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:41.380
Sing of human unsuccess
in a rapture of distress.

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:45.000
In the deserts of the heart,
let the healing fountain start.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.610
In the prison of his days, teach
the free man how to praise."

01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:52.390
Such was the monument erected.

01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:56.610
Did Charents seek to fathom
similar deep wellsprings?

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:58.510
Thank you.

Please do not break your leg.

Yes. We should've had
stairs on this side, too.

wonderful talk on Charents,

Thank you very much.

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.730
As a government employee,
I have to start

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:55.040
with my standard disclaimer

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.600
that my views do not
reflect those views

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.210
of the U.S. government,
and that will probably come

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:02.630
as no surprise [laughter].

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:07.090
Let me first really give
a most sincere thank-you

01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:10.940
to my dear friend,
Levon Avdoyan.

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:16.630
Levon has been a friend and
a mentor for 32 years now,

01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:21.700
having met in 1986 when I first
made it down to Washington,

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:25.380
D.C. So I have learned
a tremendous amount,

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:28.640
both from him personally and
from all the wonderful programs

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.820
that he has put on
through the Library

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.120
of Congress, so thank you.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.490
Thank you, Mary Jane.

01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:40.360

some of you have lived through.

01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:47.040
And some of you have
helped me with my research,

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.430
like my dear friend,
Nerses Hayrapetyan.

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:55.800
So what I am going to do is to
look at the role of history,

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.860
how history is remembered,
and the role that played

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.520
in undermining communist
legitimacy in Soviet Armenia

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.430
from the years 1988 to 1991.

01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:08.670
This is part of a much larger
project that I undertook,

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:10.310
but what I would
like to do for today

01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:13.740
for a few minutes is
extract the parts that relate

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.150
to how the first Republic

01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:18.730
of Armenia was remembered
in Soviet Armenia.

01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:21.560
Because this is being
the 100th anniversary

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.690
of the Independent
Republic of Armenia,

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:26.960
I thought it might
be a good pairing.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.440
In terms of context,
let me just say

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.950
that I had the extraordinary
good fortune of living

01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:37.610
in Soviet Armenia
from 1988 to 1991,

01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:41.450
during the last three
years of soviet rule.

01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:44.110
I got to Soviet Armenia
through a program

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:46.590
that the soviet government
had organized

01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:49.260
for all ethnic Armenians abroad

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:52.610
to get an education
in Soviet Armenia.

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:55.030
Now, I did not need
a soviet education.

01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:58.690
I had an American education that
I was perfectly satisfied with,

01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:01.060
but I did not speak Armenian.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:05.670
So I went to learn Armenian,
and it so happened to coincide

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:08.020
with the -- really
the renaissance

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.880
of the Armenian nation.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.550
And so, for three
years, I got to witness.

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:14.100
I got to participate.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.650
I got to observe, and I
got to gather lots and lots

01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:19.250
of material along the way

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:22.740
that I was never quite sure
what I was going to do with.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:25.570
But I knew that what I was
witnessing was important,

01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:28.230
and so when I went back to
graduate school later in life

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:31.100
to write a doctoral
dissertation, I used a lot

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:34.690
of that material to try to
make sense of what had happened

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:38.350
in Armenia in those
three very short,

01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:40.830
but very, very intense years.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.850
Right? We have a sweep
of Armenian history

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:47.060
that goes back millennia, but in
that very short period of time

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:52.580
from 1988 to 1991, the
whole world changed.

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:55.350
Not just Armenia, but
the whole world changed.

01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:58.640
No one predicted the
collapse of the Soviet Union,

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.900
except for someone
named Andrei Amalrik,

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.940
who wrote a book <i>Will
the Soviet Union Last</i>

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:05.830
<i>Until 1980 -- Survive
Until 1984 </i>.

01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:07.840
Unfortunately, he
died before that,

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.240
before the Soviet
Union fell in 1991,

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.990
so he didn't even get
a chance to see that.

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:19.320
What I would like to do is
talk a little bit about --

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.210
again, to contextualize
about historical narratives,

01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:24.030
and the role that they play.

01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:26.410
They're really the --
kind of the cornerstones

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:29.100
of anyone's identity, right?

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.710
We have narratives in
the United States, right?

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:33.680
The words we use matter.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.770
They connote either
where we stand socially,

01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:40.120
economically, or politically.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.830
Interestingly, in the Soviet
Union, history was one

01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:47.630
of the first things that the
soviet state appropriated.

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:54.060
Imagine 1917 to the -- you know,
when the revolution broke out,

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:59.780
and then the following years of
civil war, foreign intervention.

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:03.690
The soviet state -- the
Bolshevik party was fighting

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:06.060
for its very survival.

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.120
Yet, it devoted very limit --
its very limited resources --

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.520
it devoted a considerable amount
of resources to making sure

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.380
that it controlled
the historical record.

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.400
It created something
called [foreign word],

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.920
a party committee
devoted to history,

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.370
and devoted to making sure

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:31.040
that the narrative supported the
ideological goals of the state.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.920
So what that means is
that, in the Armenian case,

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:41.760
Armenia inherited the soviet
system, the soviet ethos,

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:46.680
if you will, but they never
accepted it wholeheartedly.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.730
And there was always a
little pushback, right?

01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:52.230
There was always
a little tension

01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:55.710
between what the soviet
central authorities wanted,

01:08:55.710 --> 01:09:00.510
and what the Armenian Soviet
Socialist Republic actually did.

01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:02.590
So I think there
are two quotes --

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:05.330
and we don't have the
makeup artist here to try

01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:09.390
to dampen the moisture, but
hopefully that won't come

01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:11.000
out too badly on film.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.630
There's two quotes that
I would like to use.

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:17.930
In the Soviet Union,

01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:22.200
every profession had a
professional journal.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.730
If you were a tractor driver in
Ufa, you had your own journal.

01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:29.240
If you were a tube
player in Krasnoyarsk,

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.720
you had your own journal.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.380
Well, the historians had their
own journals, too, right,

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.910
and one of them was called
[foreign word], "Problems

01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:38.230
or Questions of History."

01:09:38.230 --> 01:09:42.140
And every issue started with an
editorial, right, and that kind

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:46.510
of laid out what the party
line would be for that issue,

01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:49.130
and kind of where
soviet history stood.

01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:53.280
So there's a wonderful quote
from 1960, and it says,

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.700
"The study of history has
never been a mere curiosity,

01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:01.480
a withdrawal into the past
for the sake of the past.

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.940
Historical science --

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.080
" and everything for
them was a science, so --

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.890
"historical science
has been, and remains,

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:11.720
an arena of sharp
ideological conflict."

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.610
Now, perhaps more indicative
of this approach would be

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:19.160
from Nikita Khrushchev, who
had a reputation, let's say,

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.000
for being somewhat more
earthy in his pronouncements,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.270
and he declared that "Historians
are dangerous people.

01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:28.560
They are capable of
upsetting everything.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.860
They must be directed."

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:36.880
So that is the backdrop for
what I will now present,

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.900
and I have my clock here.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.970
Tell me, what time would
you like me to stop?

01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:47.070
It is 2:26.

01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:51.060
Okay. So, the reassessment
of history at the end

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:54.970
of soviet rule in Armenia -- it
didn't take place in isolation.

01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:58.540
It occurred simultaneously
with and as an integral part

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:02.540
of unprecedented
political, economic, social,

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.770
and intellectual changes
that were taking place,

01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:09.150
a result of Gorbachev's
policies of Glasnost.

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:12.100
Developments in any one of these
spheres -- political, economic,

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:15.540
social, intellectual --
influenced the nature and pace

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:19.320
of change in the others in
an interconnected process

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.290
that culminated in the collapse
of soviet power in Armenia,

01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:26.300
and the reestablishment
of an independent state.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:30.130
These processes, in turn, were
deeply influenced by events

01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:34.310
in other parts of the Soviet
Union and eastern European.

01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:36.360
Mikhail Gorbachev's policy

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.260
of Glasnost gave
the initial impetus

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.360
to a more open discussion

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.090
of the problems facing
soviet Armenian society.

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:48.810
These early discussions,
which focused on topics

01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:52.650
of contemporary relevance,
such as the environment,

01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:54.960
the state of education
in the republic,

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:58.350
the status of the Armenian
language, Armenian culture,

01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:02.240
also included an important
historical component,

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:05.070
as Armenians strove to
understand the origins

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:08.710
of the problems affecting
their society.

01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:12.470
The search for the roots of
environmental, educational,

01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:13.770
and cultural questions

01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:17.490
in Armenia inevitably
involved the study of history.

01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:22.080
For example, environmental
degradation was traced back

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:25.020
to the industrialization
policies of Stalin,

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.020
which led to a closer look
at Stalin's other policies

01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:31.980
in Armenia, including the
drawing of borders and the loss

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:35.950
of Karabakh and Nakhchevan
to Azerbaijan.

01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:39.200
The exploration of these
issues soon gave way

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.900
to a more broadly-based
reevaluation of the soviet

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:46.660
and pre-soviet Armenian
historical experience.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.900
The emphasis on historical
issues was of more

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:51.830
than just academic interest.

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:54.600
It had political
implications as well.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.880
Historical interpretation in
Armenia was given relevance

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.420
in February of 1988 with
the spontaneous formation

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:04.480
of a mass social movement
throughout Armenia agitating

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.780
for the secession

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:08.320
of the Nagorno-Karabakh
autonomous district

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.440
from Azerbaijan, and its
unification with Armenia.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.890
The borders of Nagorno-Karabakh
were established

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:19.150
in the early 1920s with the
direct participation of Stalin,

01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:21.310
who arranged for the
region to be placed

01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:24.850
under the administration
of soviet Azerbaijan.

01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:29.010
It was this perceived
historical injustice

01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:32.970
that mobilized the Armenians
into action, with the hope

01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:35.230
that under Glasnost,
a rectification

01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:37.680
of borders might be possible.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.220
Using history as a means
to demonstrate the justice

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:44.780
of their cause, Armenians began
to draw wider historical lessons

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:47.130
from their experiences
in the pre-soviet

01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:51.320
and early soviet periods, which
steadily led to the undermining

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.880
of soviet legitimacy in Armenia.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.700
In order to increase
their chances

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.370
of resolving the Karabakh
issue to their satisfaction,

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:04.440
Armenians turned to
history to demonstrate

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.830
that the region was historically
Armenian, and should be placed

01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:09.890
under the control of Yerevan.

01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:12.430
They pointed to the involvement
of Stalin and the injustice

01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:15.020
that had occurred under soviet
Azerbaijani administration

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:16.630
throughout the years.

01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:19.080
This instrumental use of
history by the Armenians

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.890
in 1988 was just the beginning

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:25.600
of a full-fledged historical
reassessment of Armenia's past,

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.590
the outcome of which would
have profound implications

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:31.020
for the entire nation.

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:34.070
The process of historical
reassessment was fundamentally

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:38.570
altered by the February-March
pogrom against Armenians

01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:42.100
in the Azerbaijani
industrial city of Sumqayit.

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:45.580
That event, more than any
other, changed the course

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:48.370
of events in soviet Armenia.

01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:54.120
It broke a tacit social contract
between the soviet state

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.180
and the Armenian people,
which had been in place

01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:00.300
since the early days
of soviet rule.

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.570
This social contract
assured Armenian acquiescence

01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:08.010
to soviet rule in exchange
for the physical security

01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:10.730
and protection from the Turks,

01:15:10.730 --> 01:15:14.790
Armenia's most serious
security threat.

01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:18.420
Although this might not
seem like much of a bargain,

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:21.700
it must be viewed in the context
of the atrocities perpetrated

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:25.860
against Armenians in the
Ottoman Empire in 1915.

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.320
Despite the atrocities committed
under Lenin and Stalin,

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.030
they never reached the
same level of intensity.

01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:34.730
This geopolitical reality
allowed Armenians to come

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:37.520
to terms with soviet
rule in their country.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.780
The memory of 1915 was kept
alive throughout the years

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:45.450
of soviet rule by
survivors, by scholars,

01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:49.360
and by the intense feelings
of the general public.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.660
The persistent denial

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:52.690
by successive Turkish
governments only served

01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:55.140
to deepen the importance
Armenians attached

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:56.440
to their national tragedy.

01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:01.030
The events at Sumqayit had a
profound impact on Armenians,

01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:05.510
and resurrected painful
historical memories and images.

01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:08.800
The close ethnic and linguistic
ties between Azerbaijanis

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.980
and Turks only served to
reinforce the connection

01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:15.900
between the two events in
the minds of most Armenians.

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:19.100
Sumqayit occurred so
close to the beginning

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:22.450
of the democratic movement in
Armenia that it is impossible

01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:25.850
for this event not to
indelibly mark the course

01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:28.200
of the movement from the outset.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.750
Thus, from the very beginning,
the struggle over Karabakh,

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:34.310
and the creation of a national
democratic movement in Armenia,

01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:36.700
perception of current
events was colored

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.870
by an understanding of the past.

01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:41.120
And conversely, a
particular reading

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.510
of the past influenced the ways

01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:46.990
in which the present
was seen and understood.

01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:51.850
History and politics,
inextricably linked in Armenia

01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:55.950
in the years leading up to the
dissolution of the Soviet Union,

01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:59.860
and the interconnection between
the two played a leading role

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:03.180
in the determination
to secede from the USSR

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.360
and reestablish an
independent state.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:10.040
The interpreters of the Armenian
past were not just historians,

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.760
but intellectuals
more generally.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.040
And their deconstruction
of the soviet narrative,

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.610
so laboriously fabricated over
70 years of communist control,

01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:22.040
would prove decisive
in the process

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.670
of redefining Armenian
national identity,

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:28.100
and laying the groundwork for a
post-soviet Armenian identity.

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:32.150
Through the use of the mass
media and publishing houses,

01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:35.940
Armenian historians and other
intellectuals reshaped popular

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:40.380
perception of the past, which
in turn influenced the present.

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:41.680
The reassessment of history

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.770
in Armenia was neither
completely elite-driven,

01:17:44.770 --> 01:17:48.280
nor did it emanate
exclusively from below.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.930
Instead, it was a symbiotic
process, in which historians

01:17:51.930 --> 01:17:54.290
and other intellectuals
commenced

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:57.820
with a wide-ranging debate
about the past at the same time

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:00.730
that the general reading
public was getting excited

01:18:00.730 --> 01:18:04.850
about the fresh interpretations
made possible by Glasnost.

01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:09.040
Popular interest in the past
meshed with a renewed interest

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.690
and renewed spirit
of scholarly inquiry,

01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:13.940
as historians began
the dismantling

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.180
of soviet revisionism.

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:18.490
This resulted in nothing
less than a revolution

01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:21.650
in thinking among soviet
Armenians about themselves,

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:23.790
and their place in the world.

01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:27.030
Having become accustomed over
the years to be skeptical

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:29.860
of the heavy-handed
soviet approach to history,

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:33.030
the Armenian reading public
greeted Glasnost warmly,

01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:34.330
and showed great interest

01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:36.680
in the new interpretation
of their past.

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.700
Armenian skepticism,
in part, was a result

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:42.060
of the clumsy nature
of soviet revisionism.

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:46.640
It was also the result of the
extensive use of oral history

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.230
in Armenia as the elder
generations passed

01:18:49.230 --> 01:18:51.700
down to the younger
generation memories

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:56.420
of a pre-soviet and
non-soviet past.

01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:00.930
Discussion of the independent
1918 to 1920 pre-soviet Republic

01:19:00.930 --> 01:19:05.090
of Armenia was closely connected
to and occurred simultaneously

01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:09.310
with reinterpretation of events
such as the liberation movement,

01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:12.580
the Armenian Genocide,
et cetera.

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.070
This was understandable, as
many of the leading figures

01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:16.830
of the liberation movement went

01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:20.400
on to play leading roles during
the independent republic.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.530
And of course, the foundation
of the republic occurred

01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:26.970
in the midst of war
and revolution.

01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:30.410
Armenia became a soviet
republic in December 1920,

01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:34.910
as a result of a joint
soviet-Turkish assault.

01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:38.040
The new Bolshevik rulers
inherited a devastated

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.810
and exhausted country,

01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:42.490
and needed to quickly
establish their legitimacy

01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:45.130
and consolidate their rule.

01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:47.760
One method of legitimizing
their rule was

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.130
to employ a tactic perfected
throughout all the lands

01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:53.280
of the former Russian Empire.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:57.210
This was to discredit
and delegitimize the rule

01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:59.130
of the predecessor regime --

01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:02.430
in this case, the Armenian
Revolutionary Federation.

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:05.950
As Marxists, the new soviet
leaders found the ideology

01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:09.760
of the Armenian nationalists
anathema, and they lost no time

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:14.020
in leading the -- in labeling
the dashnaks as, quote unquote,

01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:17.570
"bourgeois nationalists,
imperialist lackeys,

01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:22.420
narrow-minded chauvinists, and
irresponsible adventurers."

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:25.520
They blamed the dashnaks for
the loss of independence,

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.580
and credited the Bolsheviks
with, quote unquote,

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:30.140
"saving Armenians
from the destruction

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:32.270
at the hands of the Turks."

01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:34.900
By thus discrediting
the previous regime,

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:37.920
the soviets were able to gloss
over the uncomfortable fact

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.680
that they had allied with the
Turks who were responsible

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.790
for massacring Armenians,
and then jointly invaded

01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:47.150
and occupied an independent
state.

01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:50.410
The Bolshevik alliance
with the nationalist forces

01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:53.130
of Mustafa Kemal was
completely ignored

01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:56.970
in soviet historiography, while
the alleged voluntary reunion

01:20:56.970 --> 01:21:00.430
of Armenia and Russia
was stressed instead.

01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:01.960
The soviets portrayed
the leaders

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.710
of the independent republic

01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:05.970
as inexperience bourgeois
nationalists

01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:09.630
who understood nothing about
governance, and who were blinded

01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:13.920
to the reality of Armenia's
dire situation by the promises

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.500
of the western capitalist
powers.

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:20.080
They accused Armenia of being
an outpost of imperialism

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.380
that was used to weaken

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.970
and undermine the socialist
revolution in Russia,

01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:28.760
and drive an artificial wedge
between the working classes

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.060
of Armenia and Russia.

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:31.510
It's probably important to note

01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:34.390
that Armenia really didn't have
a working class at this point,

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:39.260
but we don't have to digress too
far to see the contradictions.

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:41.630
The lack of information
and supression of knowledge

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:44.940
in Armenia regarding the
independent republic served

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:46.920
soviet interests
in several ways.

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:50.810
First, it allowed the soviets
to present the republic

01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:55.020
as an experiment that failed
because of the inexperience

01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:58.190
and immaturity of its
leaders, and their inability

01:21:58.190 --> 01:22:01.650
to prevent the hostile
takeover by Turkey.

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:03.540
According to the soviet
version of events,

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.910
the adventurous dashnaks
had initiated a war

01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:07.760
against the Turks, which ended

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.440
with the defeat of
Armenian forces.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.690
Only the timely humanitarian
intervention

01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:15.590
of the Bolsheviks prevented
the complete destruction

01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:17.680
of the Armenian people.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.380
This version also served the
interests of the communist party

01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:23.390
in Armenia by portraying the
Armenian Soviet Socialist

01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:28.590
Republic as the culmination of
Armenian national aspirations,

01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:31.310
thus increasing their
own legitimacy.

01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:34.010
This recounting of
the events of 1918

01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:37.310
and 1920 was an important part
of the soviet grand narrative

01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:40.310
for Armenia, which was
reinforced over the years

01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:43.890
through constant and sustained
propaganda, both in the schools

01:22:43.890 --> 01:22:45.190
and in the public sphere.

01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:48.000
The information that
was publicly available

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.300
about the Independent Republic

01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:52.900
of Armenia was almost
uniformly negative,

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:56.000
stressing the nationalist
and thus evil character

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.410
of the fledgling state.

01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:02.850
Dashnak became synonymous
with bourgeoisie nationalist,

01:23:02.850 --> 01:23:05.830
and the ultimate
political pejorative,

01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:08.540
as were the terms
Musafatist [assumed spelling]

01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:12.480
in Azerbaijan, Bazmachi [assumed
spelling] in central Asia,

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.870
Menshevik [assumed spelling]
in Georgia, and Banderite

01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:17.170
or Pepurst [assumed
spelling] in Ukraine.

01:23:17.170 --> 01:23:21.900
During Glasnost, however,
this soviet narrative came

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:25.160
under sustained criticism in
Armenia by both intellectuals

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:29.010
and the public, as a vigorous
and open debate developed

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:32.920
on the nature and significance
of the independent republic.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.590
This was the first
independent Armenian state

01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:37.830
that had been created
since the fall

01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:42.920
of the Mediterranean
Kingdom of Cilicia in 1375.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:46.680
The previous lessons transmitted
to the population by Moscow

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:49.200
through soviet Armenian
historiography were challenged

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.500
by new interpretations.

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:54.840
These interpretations stress
the important symbolic value

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.680
of the republic as an
independent Armenian state.

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.840
This debate on the independent
republic opened slowly at first,

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:05.470
as historians and the
public were hesitant

01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:08.600
to openly discuss the
subject of independence.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.650
There seems to have been
fear among certain circles

01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:13.460
of intellectuals and the
public that discussion

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:16.050
of the independent republic
would be seen by Moscow

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:20.030
as a sign of disloyalty
and possible separatism.

01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:22.460
Armenians were already being
accused of these things

01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:25.240
because of their support for
Karabakh, and did not want

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.140
to exacerbate tensions further.

01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:31.090
The only consistent calls
for independence came

01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:33.700
from the Armenian
Self-Determination Union,

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.610
and the supporters of the
dissident Paruyr Hayrikyan.

01:24:36.610 --> 01:24:40.530
At a public rally
on May 28th, 1988,

01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:43.290
which was the 70th
anniversary of the declaration

01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:46.660
of Armenian independence, a
telegram was supposedly sent

01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:49.710
to the Supreme Soviet,
asking for that date

01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:51.610
to be declared Armenian
Independence Day.

01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:54.070
This group had not
yet been able to win

01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:56.950
over the mass public support
for the idea of independence,

01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:58.990
though, and throughout
most of '88,

01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:01.720
the subject of the
independent republic was not

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.500
on the public agenda.

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.930
But as the conflict over
Karabakh intensified,

01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:10.740
and an acceptable political
resolution seemed far-off,

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:13.270
attitudes began to change.

01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:16.130
This change of opinion about
independence was escalated

01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:19.230
in the aftermath of the
December '88 earthquake,

01:25:19.230 --> 01:25:21.860
and the soviet Armenians --

01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:24.900
excuse me, the soviet
authorities proved incapable

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.650
of alleviating the
suffering of the people.

01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:30.610
Disillusionment with the
authorities was heightened

01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:35.500
by the active participation and
organizational skill of members

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:38.010
of the Armenian Democratic
Movement.

01:25:38.010 --> 01:25:40.780
Thus, from '89 on, more emphasis

01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:43.240
on the independent
republic became discernible

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.050
in the public sphere.

01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:47.570
This was most noticeable at
the regular mass meetings

01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:49.210
that were held in Yerevan,

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:52.490
as symbols of the old
republic began to appear.

01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:54.480
The red, blue, and
orange tricolor

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.320
of the independent
republic was in evidence.

01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:01.230
It was considered a great honor
to be the chosen flag-bearer

01:26:01.230 --> 01:26:03.500
by the organizers of
the mass meetings.

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:07.090
Some of my young friends at the
time made sure they got there

01:26:07.090 --> 01:26:09.880
as early as they could, and
got to know the organizers

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.620
so that they would have an
opportunity to hold the flags.

01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:16.370
And they would be willing to
hold them for hours and hours

01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:18.510
in the blazing sun, and
they thought that that,

01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:21.980
for them, was a great honor.

01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:25.870
Buttons, pins, and other
paraphernalia related

01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:29.010
to the Independent Republic
of Armenia were also produced

01:26:29.010 --> 01:26:32.820
in large numbers by activists,
and distributed at the rallies,

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.780
or sold along the route.

01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:37.890
Public curiosity about this
previously forbidden aspect

01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:41.300
of the Armenian past was
mirrored by an increase

01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:43.520
in scholarly interest.

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.810
One of the more prominent
historians of this new approach,

01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:50.290
who's representative, but
by no means exclusive,

01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:53.220
was Goodrik Sardariyan [assumed
spelling], who wrote extensively

01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:55.030
in the mass media
on the formation

01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:57.230
and development of the republic.

01:26:57.230 --> 01:26:58.530
He developed the idea

01:26:58.530 --> 01:27:00.730
that Armenia's most pressing
problems were the result

01:27:00.730 --> 01:27:04.280
of its lack of statehood, also
noting that Armenians needed

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.900
to be more realistic in their
approach to political life,

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:10.290
and understand that having
a just cause was not enough

01:27:10.290 --> 01:27:12.230
to ensure victory.

01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:15.100
Sardariyan turned to the history
of the Republic of Armenia

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:18.800
in an effort to understand
the problems and experiences

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.770
of an independent state.

01:27:20.770 --> 01:27:25.040
He criticized those embraced the
idea of an independent Armenia

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.150
without understanding
the full implications

01:27:27.150 --> 01:27:28.980
of such independence.

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:31.330
Although he supported
the idea of independence,

01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:35.840
he feared the consequences
of precipitous action.

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.130
He concluded that without a
sober assessment of history

01:27:39.130 --> 01:27:41.010
and Armenia's current situation,

01:27:41.010 --> 01:27:42.960
Armenians would end
the 20th Century

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.660
in the same way that
they started it.

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:48.940
This stark warning for caution
was echoed in other quarters

01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:52.880
as well, but in the atmosphere
of escalating violence

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:57.020
against Armenia and Karabakh,
most people concluded

01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.440
that independence would
be a better option

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.090
than continued membership
in the Soviet Union.

01:28:03.090 --> 01:28:05.620
In recognition of the
symbolic importance ascribed

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:09.360
to the Republic of Armenia by
soviet Armenian intellectuals,

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.480
the Academy of Sciences
elected Richard Hovannisian,

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:15.270
the foremost scholar of
the independent republic,

01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:18.840
to be a member of the
Armenian Academy in 1990.

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.480
This was one of the
very few times

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.210
that a foreign member was
inducted into the academy,

01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:25.550
and was the first time
that a foreign historian

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:28.200
of the modern period
was allowed in.

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:30.930
This was a clear signal
that Hovannisian's work

01:28:30.930 --> 01:28:32.230
on the Independent Republic

01:28:32.230 --> 01:28:35.270
of Armenia was considered
indispensible for a fuller

01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:37.910
and more accurate understanding
of modern Armenian history.

01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:42.350
There was much talk among
historians for the need

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:46.200
to have Hovannisian's work
translated into Armenian as soon

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.910
as possible in order
to prepare the country

01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:52.090
for renewed independence,
renewed statehood.

01:28:52.090 --> 01:28:54.420
The new positive image of
the Independent Republic

01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:57.070
of Armenia presented
Armenian historians --

01:28:57.070 --> 01:29:01.290
presented by Armenian historians
was enthusiastically adopted

01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:05.200
by local nationalists and used
as a symbol of local autonomy

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.690
and sovereignty in their
struggle against Moscow.

01:29:08.690 --> 01:29:09.990
Thus, discussion

01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:12.680
of the independent republic
carried an anti-soviet

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.060
connotation from the outset.

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:18.370
This was mirrored by many local
Armenian political activists,

01:29:18.370 --> 01:29:22.820
who identified themselves as
dashnaks, although very few

01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:25.850
of them actually knew what the
ARF's political position was,

01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:30.210
or the party's platform, or
the party's goals beyond a free

01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:31.510
and independent Armenia.

01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:34.260
They were nevertheless
calling themselves dashnaks,

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:37.940
because to them, that
was the symbol for a free

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.100
and independent Armenia.

01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:42.500
In the highly charged
political atmosphere of Armenia,

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:45.260
for most people, that
meant anti-soviet,

01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:48.060
and being anti-soviet,
in some quarters,

01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:52.520
became increasingly equated
with being pro-Armenian.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:55.810
In this new spirit of defiance,
there was a reassessment

01:29:55.810 --> 01:30:00.020
of the foundational
battles of May 1918,

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:03.830
the battles of Sardarabad,
Bash Abaran and Karakilisa,

01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:08.010
in which Armenians were
able to stop Turkish forces

01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:10.320
from invading the
eastern part of Armenia,

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.290
and finishing the job that
they had started in 1915.

01:30:14.290 --> 01:30:17.650
Soviet historiography had
tended to portray these battles

01:30:17.650 --> 01:30:20.730
as important instances
of self-defense

01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:24.180
which saved the Eastern
Armenians from the same fate.

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:26.660
They were not viewed, however,
in the context of the founding

01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:28.690
of an independent state.

01:30:28.690 --> 01:30:31.320
Given that Armenian independence
was declared immediately

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.820
after these battles, it
seemed an odd omission,

01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:35.130
but one completely in keeping

01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:37.130
with the ideological
needs of Communist Party.

01:30:37.130 --> 01:30:41.390
As Soviet legitimacy was
called into question,

01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:44.300
these battles took on
an added significance.

01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:47.380
In addition to their importance
as self-defense battles,

01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:50.120
they were also presented
by historians and accepted

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:53.350
by the public as foundational
events in the process

01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:57.150
of restoring Armenian
independence.

01:30:57.150 --> 01:31:01.520
They ascribed new significance
to all this as the conflict

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:03.910
of [foreign word]
continued to worsen.

01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:08.420
In Moscow, increasingly -- was
increasingly seen in Armenia

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:12.120
as unwilling or unable to be an
honest broker between Armenians

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.450
and Azerbaijanis,
the reestablishment

01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:16.810
of an Armenian state was
discussed more frequently.

01:31:16.810 --> 01:31:20.130
It was in the context of
current events that the legacy

01:31:20.130 --> 01:31:22.740
of the republic came
to be viewed.

01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:24.980
Part of this reassessment
consisted of trying

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.840
to draw lessons as to the
root causes of failure.

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:34.940
In conclusion, the historians
identified three main causes

01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:37.850
for the failure of the
Republic to survive.

01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:41.390
The first cause was
directly related to 1915

01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:44.940
with the destruction of Ottoman
Armenians still occurring

01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:48.140
at the time of the foundation of
the Republic and the territory

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:52.080
of the fledgling state flooded
with refugees, the establishment

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.470
of independent state was viewed

01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:56.890
as an astonishing
feat in and of itself.

01:31:56.890 --> 01:31:58.570
The second major
factor in the defeat

01:31:58.570 --> 01:32:01.770
of the independent republic
was the attitude and behavior

01:32:01.770 --> 01:32:06.140
of Lenin and the Bolshevik
Party, including Stalin.

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:08.090
Bolshevik collusion
with Kamala's Turkey

01:32:08.090 --> 01:32:10.490
and the dismemberment
of Armenia only served

01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:14.250
to delegitimize Soviet
rule even further.

01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:17.750
And the third factor, identified
by Armenian historians,

01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:19.120
was the indifference

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.920
and contradictions
among the great powers.

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:25.220
The promises to end
Ottoman oppression extended

01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:28.430
to the Armenians during the war
led many Armenians to believe

01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:31.500
that their hour of
liberation was at hand.

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:34.810
These promises went unfulfilled,
however, as the interests

01:32:34.810 --> 01:32:36.960
of the great powers
took precedence

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.800
over any moral obligation
they have --

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:42.050
may have felt for the
plight of the Armenians.

01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:47.760
So at the end of the Soviet
period Armenians were faced

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.200
with a choice.

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:53.020
And for most, independence was
not the first choice, right?

01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:54.320
The choice was to try

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.930
to renovate the Soviet
Union to make it work.

01:32:56.930 --> 01:33:00.990
But the way events evolved,
the Armenians had to rethink.

01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:03.380
And so by -- in rethinking
their position,

01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:06.800
they looked to history,
not just to the Republic.

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:09.360
They also looked to the
ancient and medieval period

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:12.860
where they were able to show the
continuity of Armenian statehood

01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:16.870
from pre-Christian
era to the present.

01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:19.060
They looked at the
Liberation Movement.

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:22.490
They looked at our
cultural inheritance,

01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:24.050
our connections with the West.

01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:29.110
And all of those things together
helped delegitimize Soviet rule

01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:32.500
in Armenia and laid the
foundations for independence.

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:35.410
And, hopefully, that will
be a nice segue to my friend

01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:38.520
and colleague, Nerses.

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.320
Thank you.

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:46.680
[ Applause ]

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:53.600
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: In 1994 I
met a young librarian here

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.410
in the United States.

01:33:55.410 --> 01:33:57.580
And that was my first exposure

01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:01.090
to the new library
world in Armenia.

01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:06.200
I want to say a few words about
librarians in Armenia if I may.

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.070
As far as I'm concerned they
have been in the forefront

01:34:09.070 --> 01:34:14.300
since independence of building
a new Armenia, and actually

01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:17.970
in the forefront of
diplomatic efforts with all --

01:34:17.970 --> 01:34:23.230
between the three states of the
caucuses, and I have nothing

01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:26.310
but high praise for
the libraries

01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:29.680
and librarians that I have seen.

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:33.360
Now, when I first visited
in 1996 after independence,

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.240
the conditions were
not very good.

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:39.810
There was no heat, there's
obviously no air conditioning,

01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:44.220
the - so please don't
complain anymore [laughter].

01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:51.830
The salaries were
nonexistent or very low.

01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:54.810
These people went to work
under conditions that most

01:34:54.810 --> 01:34:59.000
of my colleagues would probably
have resigned years ago.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.880
And so all this to say that
I have nothing but respect

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.870
for all librarians
and especially

01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:07.420
for the two librarians
with us today.

01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:09.510
I call both of them friends.

01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:12.670
And Nerses is not only a
friend; he's a [foreign word],

01:35:12.670 --> 01:35:14.820
he's a brother of mine.

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:17.720
And I would like to introduce
to you one of the founders

Association,

01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:25.050
former Assistant Director of
the National Library of Armenia,

01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:29.190
the Director of the Informa --
an Information Resource Center

01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:33.370
at the United States
Embassy in [foreign word],

01:35:33.370 --> 01:35:38.580
who has been actually, as a side
duty, regulating the exchanges

01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:42.710
of Armenian libraries with
the Library of Congress,

01:35:42.710 --> 01:35:49.490
and a specialist on book
arts and history in Armenia.

01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:53.190
And Nerses Hayrapetyan will be
speaking about [foreign word]

01:35:53.190 --> 01:35:57.630
and the emergence of the
contemporary Armenian press.

01:35:57.630 --> 01:35:59.510
Nerses.

01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:03.040
[ Applause ]

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:04.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Levon.

01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.640
It's an honor to be at
the Library of Congress.

01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:08.350
Exactly 24 years ago I first --

01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:10.510
my step was, first
step to the Library

01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:15.690
of Congress was in
April 30, '94.

01:36:15.690 --> 01:36:18.010
And I shall start --

01:36:18.010 --> 01:36:21.410
before starting my
official presentation,

01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:26.420
I should like repeat
the same sentence

01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:31.320
like my friend Robert
told that my disclaimer

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:35.140
that my opinion not
necessarily, you know,

01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:38.210
is the same like
the U.S. government.

01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:42.700
So -- but I'm talking -- my
topic is rather interesting.

01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:47.170
I was dealing with the Armenian
new periodical press or --

01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:52.980
during those [inaudible]
movement years,

01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:56.720
and little by little
collecting information.

01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.110
Mostly bibliographic
information at that time.

01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:05.060
If I knew that it is so
important to collect pieces also

01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:09.040
because at firstly there is
not any library in Armenia

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:14.350
that has this all, you
know, rich collection of --

01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:17.740
some [inaudible] data
now traditional press.

01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:23.440
What is the -- ah, we have it.

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:27.330
Okay. Some is that originated

01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:31.790
from the dissident
movement in Russia.

01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:36.330
The Russian [foreign words]
coined the version of the term

01:37:36.330 --> 01:37:41.100
in 1952 when he typed
copies of his poems

01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:43.630
and included the not
some [inaudible] is that.

01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:48.700
"Myself, by Myself"
publishes on the front page.

01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:51.760
The individuals reproduced
censored

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.810
and underground publications
by hand or printed

01:37:55.810 --> 01:38:00.610
on semi-professional printing
presses and passed the documents

01:38:00.610 --> 01:38:03.070
from reader to reader.

01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:05.510
Russian dissident
and prominent figure,

01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:11.920
Vladimir Bukovsky
summarized it as follows.

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.220
"Some is that.

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:18.370
I write it myself, editi it
myself, censori it myself,

01:38:18.370 --> 01:38:23.730
publishi it myself,
distribute it myself [laughter],

01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:31.970
and may get imprisoned
for it" [laughter].

01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:34.260
The history of Armenian
[inaudible] is

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:38.750
that started I should
say in '60s.

01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:41.680
And in the Russians,
some is that rose

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:44.350
as an underground
movement to create

01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:46.910
and distribute literary texts.

01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:50.360
The Armenian sum is that,
was the political protest

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:54.130
for a national unity
and independence.

01:38:54.130 --> 01:38:55.640
The roots of Armenian
[inaudible] is

01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:59.880
that are closely tied
with the 1965 year

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.200
[inaudible] demonstrations.

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:10.420
On April 24, 1965, 100,000
protestors held a 24-hour

01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:14.400
demonstration in [foreign
word] on the 50th anniversary

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:18.140
of the commencement of
the Armenian Genocide.

01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:22.550
Around that movement, the first
legal political partisan groups

01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:24.590
were established.

01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:31.760
The National United Party was
founded in 1966 on April 24

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:37.450
by Haykaz Khachatryan, Stepan
Zatikyan and Shahen Harutyunyan.

01:39:37.450 --> 01:39:41.640
The Party issued and
distributed the first issue

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:50.210
of its periodical <i>Paros,
Lighthouse </i>in October, 1967.

01:39:50.210 --> 01:39:55.490
In 1968, they published

01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:58.670
and distributed another
journal titled [foreign words],

01:39:58.670 --> 01:40:01.040
in the name of the homeland.

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:09.670
And, lastly, in 1969, National
United Party published its third

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:12.090
journal, [foreign word].

01:40:12.090 --> 01:40:16.880
When the founders were
imprisoned in 1968,

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:20.930
Paruyr Hayrikyan became
head of the party.

01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:23.610
After the arrest
of active members,

01:40:23.610 --> 01:40:27.610
the National United
Party, until the late '80s,

01:40:27.610 --> 01:40:32.490
until the perestroika and
glasnost period, only one issue

01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:35.380
of the Armenian [inaudible] is
their publication was published.

01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:42.820
In 1981, [foreign words]
published the last, fourth issue

01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:44.880
of <i>Paros Newspaper </i>.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:50.340
The Armenian [inaudible]
that was reborn in 1987

01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:55.280
when the Union for National
Self-Determination Party was

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:57.900
established by Paruyr Hayrikyan.

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:03.610
UNSD published the <i>Independence
Weekly Newspaper </i>,

01:41:03.610 --> 01:41:09.950
starting from October
24 of 1987.

01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:15.320
The <i>Independence Weekly </i>was
the first alternative political

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:19.240
periodical not only in
Armenia but one of the firsts

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.350
in the entire Soviet Union.

01:41:22.350 --> 01:41:25.750
The <i>Independence </i>had
chosen [foreign words]

01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:28.830
or Armenian people,
your only salvation is

01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:33.310
in your collective power
lying as your epigram.

01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:38.770
And you can see it on the
first -- on the left side.

01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:44.510
The self-published
was of small scale.

01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:45.810
Only 85 [inaudible].

01:41:45.810 --> 01:41:50.620
In the beginning, <i>Independence</i>
looked very simple.

01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:54.050
Only text without
any illustrations.

01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:56.790
In the state of being
a self-publishing,

01:41:56.790 --> 01:42:00.230
the front page would often
feature the national emblem

01:42:00.230 --> 01:42:02.120
of the Republic of Armenia.

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:05.600
Later, also the NSDU emblem.

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:10.160
The final pages presented the
sponsors of the newspaper --

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:12.430
of course, with their
permission.

01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:14.790
Not only <i>Independence </i>did so,

01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:20.360
but also other self-published
newspapers

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.860
as that [inaudible] et cetera.

01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:25.690
It is worth nothing that
the newspapers were printed

01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:28.010
by the personal means
of the publishers

01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:30.800
and with the support
of individuals.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.350
The materials were in a row

01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:35.380
without any illustrations,
typewritten.

01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:37.270
The plot was rich though.

01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:41.240
The newspaper's priority
was the self-determination

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.590
of the Armenian Nation.

01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:46.000
The idea of independence
of Armenia

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.810
and those were constantly
vacant consciousness

01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:52.150
in the civil society.

01:42:52.150 --> 01:42:57.050
The materials related to
this topic were very many

01:42:57.050 --> 01:43:00.300
in the self-published.

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.800
[Inaudible] we and our
fight article appeared

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:06.940
in the very first number of
the newspaper where he spoke

01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:10.700
of the necessity of
national self-determination,

01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:13.680
mentioning that some people
are suffering from [inaudible].

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:19.350
He wrote that there are
no ever-lasting enemies

01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:20.650
in [inaudible] lives.

01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:24.500
Yesterday's enemy may
become tomorrow's ally.

01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:28.090
He highlighted the idea of
national self-determination,

01:43:28.090 --> 01:43:32.080
the nation's imperative to
control its own destiny,

01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:35.180
and considered any intervention

01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:38.780
on [inaudible] illegal
and non-human.

01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:42.850
Offering to create
[inaudible] National Armenia

01:43:42.850 --> 01:43:46.570
through a referendum,
the author thinks

01:43:46.570 --> 01:43:50.600
that this very idea can
bring the nation together.

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.710
The <i>Independence </i>was one
of those few periodicals

01:43:54.710 --> 01:43:58.730
that was keeping a chronological
record of the events connected

01:43:58.730 --> 01:44:02.210
with our [inaudible]
moment in 1988.

01:44:02.210 --> 01:44:07.130
The Soviet Union official press
was either silent on the event

01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:09.660
or was presenting them distorted

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:13.860
in the light favorable
for the authorities.

01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:17.410
The official press was
presenting the leaders

01:44:17.410 --> 01:44:21.470
of the [inaudible] growing
movement as national extremists,

01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:24.050
while the criminal
persecution against them

01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:27.550
as fight against crime.

01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:33.310
It is obvious that there
was a political presentation

01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:36.590
against the leaders and
activists of the movement.

01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:40.460
In the history of the newest
Armenian periodical press,

01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:42.300
the self-published
independencies,

01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:45.740
the first to preach
firmly the idea

01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:48.300
of rebuilding Armenia's
independent statehood

01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:52.130
and deny any other solutions
like becoming a member

01:44:52.130 --> 01:44:56.790
of the renewed Soviet
Union or Confederation.

01:44:56.790 --> 01:45:00.380
The first sum is
that publication

01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:03.670
in 1988 was [inaudible].

01:45:03.670 --> 01:45:07.490
Bi-monthly which was
published by the Union

01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:10.000
of Difference of Armenian Cause.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.050
Several months later UDAC
started the [inaudible]

01:45:14.050 --> 01:45:19.350
publication, [foreign words],
Armenian Cause in Russian.

01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:21.710
And the same year in May,

01:45:21.710 --> 01:45:25.560
the National Self-Determination
Union started its new

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:29.520
publication, [foreign
words], Motherland.

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:34.550
[Foreign words] was a national
political publicist journal

01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:35.850
which was repeat
by [foreign words],

01:45:35.850 --> 01:45:41.750
one of the founding members
of NSDU and national hero.

01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:47.200
In total in sum is that
period in 1988/1991,

01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:51.460
11 issues of <i>[Inaudible]
Journal </i>was published.

01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:54.760
It covered wide range
of subject areas.

01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:58.430
For example, national
materials of the fifth issue

01:45:58.430 --> 01:46:03.200
of 1988 are divided in
the following chapters --

01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:06.690

Armenian National Movement,

01:46:06.690 --> 01:46:10.710

Although first independent

was published on
October 24, 1987.

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:38.920
The evolution of some is that
really began in February,

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:43.580
1988 with the movement
for the reunification

01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:48.110
of Nagorno-Karabakh and
Armenia, generally referred

01:46:48.110 --> 01:46:49.830
to as the Karabakh Movement.

01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:54.420
The most influential
periodical [inaudible]

01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:56.930

<i>Mashtots </i>.

01:47:25.330 --> 01:47:30.610

01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:39.200
In fact, [foreign words]
was the literary nickname

of the famous journalist and
publicist, [foreign words].

01:47:44.970 --> 01:47:50.250
By the way, [inaudible]
recently --

01:47:50.250 --> 01:47:56.140
he's working on different
documentaries and the link

01:47:56.140 --> 01:48:00.000
in the bottom you
can find on Twitter.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.120
It's about the Armenian
and Russian [inaudible]

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:08.010
and you can find several
interesting interviews

01:48:08.010 --> 01:48:11.430
with those people who published

01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:14.970
in Armenian [inaudible]
is that newspapers.

01:48:14.970 --> 01:48:20.930
<i>Mashtots </i>have published
20 issues.

01:48:20.930 --> 01:48:25.940
It was also of scale
more like brochure,

01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:28.610
but the scale was inconsistent.

01:48:28.610 --> 01:48:34.090
If the second issue published
in 1989 had 61 pages,

01:48:34.090 --> 01:48:36.680
the third could have 38 pages.

01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:39.760
The third published
was also typewritten

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.080
on a plain A5 format paper.

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:46.630
The pages were bound
and enumerated.

01:48:46.630 --> 01:48:51.080
It highlighted those pictures
of Karabakh Committee members,

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:55.470
the historic loopholes of the
First Republic of Armenia,

01:48:55.470 --> 01:49:00.490
especially those that during the
Soviets were kept in secrecy.

01:49:00.490 --> 01:49:05.070
For instance, in the May,
1989 issue the memoirs

01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:08.650
of the Prime Minister of the
First Republic of Armenia,

01:49:08.650 --> 01:49:11.100
Hovhannes Kajaznuni,
were published.

01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:14.170
These topics were not
only a closed door

01:49:14.170 --> 01:49:18.010
for the Soviet press, but also
many of the political figures

01:49:18.010 --> 01:49:22.600
of the first republic were
considered anti-Soviet,

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:27.070
and topics about them were
not permitted by the censors.

01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:29.050
And that time, I was
a Deputy Director

01:49:29.050 --> 01:49:32.530
of the National Library,
and our closed talks

01:49:32.530 --> 01:49:41.480
for political reasons, it had
like a 57,000 different items.

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:44.360
Could you imagine how
much was the, you know,

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:48.120
censorship taking
over the library.

01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:51.990
In the fifth number of
<i>Mashtots </i>, self-published,

01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:56.440
brought it out in
September, 1989.

01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:59.740
A well-known historian
and linguist,

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:01.160
Raphael [foreign word], the law

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:06.130
of excluding the third
force article was published.

01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:11.200
Later on, it was republished in
[inaudible] Daily and got a lot

01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:15.170
of public attention in
Armenia and Diaspora.

01:50:15.170 --> 01:50:20.310
Moreover, according to
historian [foreign words],

01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:22.930
this was the article
that made <i>Mashtots</i>

01:50:22.930 --> 01:50:25.810
Mself-publication prominent.

01:50:25.810 --> 01:50:30.050
It wouldn't be an exaggeration
to claim that the article served

01:50:30.050 --> 01:50:34.770
as a guideline for the Karabakh
Movement as the author called

01:50:34.770 --> 01:50:38.590
on to rely only on own forces.

01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:40.720
Why in solving the problems

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:43.560
with neighbors highlighted
the importance

01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:46.100
of eliminating the third party,

01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:50.520
as the third parties
have their own interests.

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:55.720
It is worth to note that for
the first time in 70 years,

01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:59.640
the people living in Soviet
Union were not only listening

01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:04.720
about becoming independent
from Russia, but also a call

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:09.120
to solve the problems
on their own.

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:13.870
This was not accepted
without [inaudible] though.

01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:19.140
In autumn, 1989, most of
the official newspapers were

01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:23.140
under strong influence
of Armenian revolution.

01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:26.890
In October/November [foreign
words] and <i>Avant-Garde </i>,

01:51:26.890 --> 01:51:31.250
those are newspapers
published in Armenia,

01:51:31.250 --> 01:51:33.820
started publishing
news and articles

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:35.380
to highlight the activities

01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:39.260
of the All Armenian
National Movement.

01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:43.880
During the [inaudible] a new --
a few newspapers and few issues

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:48.380
of periodicals were still being
printed in the established press

01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:50.060
in the traditional number.

01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:54.540
The sum is that period of an
official period because ended

01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:57.790
with the first issue of the
[inaudible] newspaper published

01:51:57.790 --> 01:52:02.130
on November 2, 1989,
on the occasion

01:52:02.130 --> 01:52:06.960
of the All Armenian National
Movement First Congress.

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:12.070
Since January, 1990, [Inaudible]
continued its regular

01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:15.260
uninterrupted publication
in a last run.

01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:19.350
In 1989, there were three
unofficial publications

01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:22.590
which were published at
state printing houses.

01:52:22.590 --> 01:52:26.560
However, the sum is that period
because did not disappear,

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:31.060
and the competition between all
the new periodicals entered a

01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:33.250
new stage.

01:52:33.250 --> 01:52:40.270
The years 1990/'91 began a new
phase which we have defined

01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:43.080
as the Period of Transition.

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:46.900
We have used the term transition
because the official press

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:53.450
at long last did not withstand
the competition and collapsed,

01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:56.720
clearing the road for the
new one's while the --

01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:00.820
at the same time, new
global changes had started,

01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:03.000
from the past to the present,

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.300
from forced

01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:07.470
to self-determination,
toward independence.

01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:13.440
In 1991, the traditional
political parties,

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:18.510
namely [foreign words] Armenian
Revolutionary Federation --

01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:23.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:28.500
-- Democratic Liberal Party
of Armenia, Social Democrat

01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:30.810
and [foreign words], Social
Democrat [inaudible] Party,

01:53:30.810 --> 01:53:32.270
were reestablished

01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:35.750
and subsequently began
publishing activities

01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:37.050
on [inaudible].

01:53:37.050 --> 01:53:42.510
On February 16, 1991,
the first issue of --

01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:46.080
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.470
-- was published, although the
[foreign word], the founders,

01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:50.510
were five council members -

01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:56.500
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:57.800
-- and others.

01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:59.770
But their fact rate
was the organ

01:53:59.770 --> 01:54:02.550
of Democratic Liberal
Party of Armenia.

01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:07.450
Within the course of years,
[inaudible] among the pioneers

01:54:07.450 --> 01:54:10.490
that brought the cultural
Western journalist practices

01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:11.790
in Armenia.

01:54:11.790 --> 01:54:14.790
The other influential
publication was [foreign words],

01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:16.330
<i>Homeland </i>.

01:54:16.330 --> 01:54:21.340
An official of Armenian
Revolutionary Federation

01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:22.640
[foreign words].

01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:23.940
Central Committee
of [foreign words].

01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:30.510
In mid-1993, the [foreign
words] daily reached to 55,000

01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:32.740
which was the largest
opposition [foreign words].

01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:40.370
The Armenian Revolutionary
Federation established its own

01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:41.670
printing house [foreign words],

01:54:41.670 --> 01:54:44.800
that was the only
alternative print house

01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:47.910
to the [foreign words] owned
[inaudible] publishing house.

01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:50.340
Their periodical press
was printed either

01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:53.510
by [foreign words] or [foreign
words] printing houses.

01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:59.100
And at the end of
1996 the Republic

01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:00.400
of [inaudible] the Minister

01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:05.000
of Justice have reduced it
already 54 political parties

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.250
and sociopolitical organizations
of which almost half have

01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:15.970
or had their own
organ print newspaper.

01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:23.760
Among the core topics
of discussion,

01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:26.540
in sum, is that periodicals.

01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:29.150
Those are the Armenian
[inaudible] issue

01:55:29.150 --> 01:55:32.820
which direction to follow.

01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:36.810
Either keep them ordering if
they're not Armenian or return

01:55:36.810 --> 01:55:38.110
to the language roots

01:55:38.110 --> 01:55:40.720
and implement the
classical Armenian.

01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:42.020
Many [inaudible] is that --

01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:46.660
many [inaudible] is that
periodical [foreign words]

01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:53.510
as a modern supplements --

01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:56.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:59.170
-- were published solemnly
in classical Armenian.

01:55:59.170 --> 01:56:01.920
It was kind of back-to-the-roots
movement

01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:06.510
and the language reform was
among the mainstream of changes.

01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:10.520
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:14.060
-- indicated their titles and
subtitles in classical Armenian.

01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:16.140
The issues of unification

01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:20.850
of the Armenian language
has been considered as one

01:56:20.850 --> 01:56:23.710
of the directions of
greater consolidation

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:26.310
of Eastern and Western Armenia.

01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:29.560
In the bottom part,
in the middle,

01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:36.080
you can see there is a
announcement in the first issue

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:38.400
of [foreign word]
Periodical that they --

01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:41.140
in the future they going
to print their newspaper

01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:47.290
in classical Armenian which
never happened, by the way.

01:56:47.290 --> 01:56:52.340
In order to stress
their independence,

01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:58.150
many periodicals used various
terms to stress their status,

01:56:58.150 --> 01:57:02.290
such as independent,
non-governmental, free,

01:57:02.290 --> 01:57:04.820
alternative, democratic,
et cetera.

01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:08.620
It is difficult to precisely
define some [inaudible]

01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:12.450
when it became possible
to reduce all periodicals

01:57:12.450 --> 01:57:13.920
without any difficulties.

01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:17.560
Some publishers, in order
to show the independence,

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:20.290
refused to reduce
the publications.

01:57:20.290 --> 01:57:25.160
In this manner, stressing and
expressing their autonomy.

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:29.070
The majority of these
periodicals were typewritten

01:57:29.070 --> 01:57:33.530
and produced by photocopying,
almost always the word

01:57:33.530 --> 01:57:36.390
of polygraphical design
and illustrations.

01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:41.080
Yet they had a great advantage
over the official periodicals.

01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:44.970
They were preaching in the
language of truth and freedom.

01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:54.640
As the first tip, many official
periodicals were renamed a good

01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:58.310
read of their Communist
stamped names.

01:57:58.310 --> 01:58:00.210
Like every Armenian newspaper,

01:58:00.210 --> 01:58:04.640
they had that "Workers
of the World Unite."

01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:08.410
As a first fine of
change, these, you know,

01:58:08.410 --> 01:58:12.460
epigram disappeared
from all the newspapers.

01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:17.550
And even -- 1990s a
very interesting year

01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:22.820
because in mid-'90,
I believe in May,

01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:25.380
the first parliamentary
elections were in Armenia

01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:27.800
where the Communist monopoly --

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.820
they lose their power
in Armenia,

01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:36.230
so many newspapers
starting like the, you know,

01:58:36.230 --> 01:58:38.970
changed their appearance
like there was --

01:58:38.970 --> 01:58:43.500
every newspaper had a Lenin
medal or something like that.

01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:49.770
And they -- first they lose
their medals, the [speaking

01:58:49.770 --> 01:58:52.820
in foreign language], but still
-- see, this is a newspaper.

01:58:52.820 --> 01:58:56.980
Only one issue was
published in 1990

01:58:56.980 --> 01:58:59.750
by <i>[Inaudible] Literary
Journal,</i>

01:58:59.750 --> 01:59:02.640
<i>Literary Journal
and Newspaper </i>.

01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:06.230
And the first issue
-- still it had --

01:59:06.230 --> 01:59:08.440
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:19.890
-- like the publishing house
of Central Committee of Party.

01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:27.760
I have another journal.

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:29.820
You see it in -- on the top.

01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:31.520
Not journal, sorry.

01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:32.820
A newspaper.

01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:34.120
It is interesting.

01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:40.170
It -- this was also published
in '90, but never gone to --

01:59:40.170 --> 01:59:49.450
for dissemination because it was
censored by the new, you know,

01:59:49.450 --> 01:59:52.440
new government of Armenia.

01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:55.870
Still for the political reasons.

01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:57.610
Obviously you see [inaudible]

01:59:57.610 --> 02:00:01.040
and you see the Turkish-Armenian
side [foreign words].

02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:06.670
So all, you know, print
run was kept somewhere.

02:00:06.670 --> 02:00:07.970
I don't know.

02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:09.550
But I have 10 copies,
so these copies are

02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:10.850
for the Library of Congress.

02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:12.650
You can keep it.

[ Applause ]

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:25.420
Not only in Armenia, but in,
let's say, in the Diaspora

02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:33.410
in Soviet Republics, several
Armenian newspapers in Russian,

02:00:33.410 --> 02:00:38.780
in Armenian, appeared
in many countries --

02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:45.250
in republics including
Russia, Estonia, in Georgia,

02:00:45.250 --> 02:00:47.510
in Ukraine, in Kiev --

02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:51.210
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:54.840
So these changes were
happening everywhere.

02:00:54.840 --> 02:01:01.520
And to summarize
my presentation,

02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:05.280
and to [inaudible] is the
differences to emergence

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:10.160
of the contemporary
Armenian press,

02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:16.030
I can sum up that
1987/1990, we saw a rise

02:01:16.030 --> 02:01:18.000
of those periodicals
approximately

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.880
about 15 known traditional
journals

02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:23.890
and newspapers appeared.

02:01:23.890 --> 02:01:28.260
Their role as [inaudible]
of the establishment

02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:33.220
of new Armenian media
can't be over-estimated.

02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:38.400
And this is the first issue
of [foreign words] official.

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:42.810
Many independent journalists
and they criticized

02:01:42.810 --> 02:01:46.140
at that time our new government
because what does it mean

02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:48.790
to have official newspaper?

02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:52.820
So you are continuing the same
traditions like in Soviet times.

02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:54.990
It was a [inaudible] has done.

02:01:54.990 --> 02:01:58.390
Now you have under your
control [inaudible].

02:01:58.390 --> 02:02:00.890
What's the difference?

02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:05.360
On October 8, 1991, the
Supreme Soviet of Republic

02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:07.410
of Armenia passed a law

02:02:07.410 --> 02:02:10.060
on periodicals and
other mass media.

02:02:10.060 --> 02:02:14.150
Therein emerged the legal
framework of regulations

02:02:14.150 --> 02:02:17.740
of the periodical press
and its activities.

02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:19.680
Some [inaudible] because
either transfer it

02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:24.410
into official publications
or [inaudible] you

02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:28.170
to mass media environment
changes.

02:02:28.170 --> 02:02:32.480
Time to time, when due to
political tensions and turmoil,

02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:35.080
media was on under
government attack.

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:40.930
We witnessed a new kind of
[inaudible] papers and flyers.

02:02:40.930 --> 02:02:43.830
For example, during the '94 ban

02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:48.010
of Armenian Revolutionary
[inaudible],

02:02:48.010 --> 02:02:52.970
party government forced to close
not only [foreign words] weekly,

02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:56.810
but also several
literally women's cultural

and youth publications,
and this newspaper

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:07.060
or [inaudible] was
published 99, just 99.

02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:11.910
They were indicating 99 copies
and they could publish it,

02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:15.850
you know, without
any registration.

02:03:15.850 --> 02:03:19.030
This is end of my presentation.

02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:20.830

that Nerses knows very well

02:03:33.530 --> 02:03:36.530
that I love getting donations to
the collection, so [laughter],

02:03:36.530 --> 02:03:40.730
if any of you would like to
leave donations on your way out,

02:03:40.730 --> 02:03:43.790
we would be glad to accept them.

02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:45.090

02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:48.590
My colleague, Dr. Paul Kergol,
will be glad to take them

02:03:48.590 --> 02:03:51.570
from my hands and make sure
that they are catalogued

02:03:51.570 --> 02:03:54.060
and made available
to you if I like you.

02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:55.360
No [laughter].

02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:57.910
Whether I like you or not.

02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:59.440
I have the great honor

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:04.700
to actually introduce another
friend and great librarian.

02:04:04.700 --> 02:04:06.840
He's presently the President

02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:10.040
of the Armenian Library
Association.

02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:13.810
He is the Director of the
National Library of Armenia.

02:04:13.810 --> 02:04:16.130
And I have to tell,
Tigran, before you go up,

02:04:16.130 --> 02:04:18.050
I have to tell a story.

02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:23.240
The first time I did this, the
only place I could find a book

02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:26.800
that a researcher needed
was in the National Library.

02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:31.140
So I wrote to Tigran and
I said, is it possible?

02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:32.440
How can you get a copy?

02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.470
And he says, well,
I'll look into it.

02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:38.500
And I think it was two days
later, maybe three days later,

02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:39.970
I had in my hands to hand

02:04:39.970 --> 02:04:45.380
onto this researcher a complete
digital page-turner copy

02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:46.680
of that book.

02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:48.510
This is what kind of
a librarian he is.

02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:55.810

02:05:04.730 --> 02:05:07.050
And, Levon, I want to
thank you for organizing

02:05:07.050 --> 02:05:08.800
such a wonderful event.

02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:10.150
Very useful.

02:05:10.150 --> 02:05:11.450
One correction.

02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:14.950
I have never been the president
of a library association,

02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:17.900
never -- so, just
a small correction.

02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:22.460
And such is my presentation
will be about the technologies

02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:25.080
and how -- this a bookmark.

02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:27.540
I will put after my
presentation there.

02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:31.370
Some weeks thereafter
you can think, keep them,

02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:34.970
and you can use and share
with your colleagues.

02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:43.330
So political culture
and economic life

02:05:43.330 --> 02:05:47.160
of each nation is connected
with a geographic place

02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:49.280
which carries the
name of that nation,

02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:52.550
a place that has been
populated by the majority

02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:56.740
of the given ethnic group for
centuries, where they lived

02:05:56.740 --> 02:06:00.290
and flourished, and transferred
their unicultural [inaudible]

02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:02.070

02:06:02.070 --> 02:06:03.390
As for the Armenians,

02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:06.020
the situation's a
little bit different.

02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:09.490
During its centuries of
destroying despite the fact

02:06:09.490 --> 02:06:11.200
that [inaudible] they took,

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:14.920

communities, built churches,

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:18.570
opened schools and [inaudible]
colleges all over the world.

02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:20.170
They created and passed

02:06:20.170 --> 02:06:23.710
on to the next generations
a huge number of treasures

02:06:23.710 --> 02:06:26.740
and masterpieces
including manuscripts,

02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:29.660
Armenian relevant early
prints which are preserved

and family collections
worldwide.

02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:39.350
This resulted in the creation
of a [inaudible] network

Armenia,

02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:44.360

from Italy to [inaudible]
and Transylvania.

02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:57.500
All the centers for spiritual
Armenia were connected

02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:02.040
with each other and
had one common goal --

02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:07.090
to protect Armenian language
to reestablish statehood.

02:07:07.090 --> 02:07:10.970
The Armenian National Council
declares their independence

02:07:10.970 --> 02:07:15.310
with Armenia on 28th
of May, 1918.

02:07:15.310 --> 02:07:18.710
One of the first decrees
of the government was

02:07:18.710 --> 02:07:20.910
about the National
Library of Armenia

02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:24.670
which was established
in June 5, 1919.

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:28.180
Since that time,
the National Library

02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:30.410

02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:33.970
and preserving Armenia
prints published worldwide.

02:07:33.970 --> 02:07:38.120
The Armenian collection has
about one and one million items.

02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:41.370
Amongst their titles are the
first Armenian printed book,

02:07:41.370 --> 02:07:42.670
the <i>Friday Book </i>.

and many other unique
publications.

years, the Library,

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:08.060
of the Armenian language
publications in the world,

02:08:08.060 --> 02:08:10.460

the central nodes

of the Spiritual
Armenian Network.

And as their major cultural
hub is actively bridging values

02:08:17.580 --> 02:08:18.880

scattered all over the work

in different cities whereas some

02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:09.490
of these places have thriving
Armenian communities in the past

In these communities there
still are Armenian unique book

collections forgotten and
abandoned, that are awaiting

02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:28.300
to be cleaned from the death,
catalogued, and preserved

02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:30.760
in normal library conditions.

02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:33.350
It is important for
scholars to have access

02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:36.990
through their primary sources
which include historical

02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:41.750
and legal documents, eyewitness
accounts, statistical data,

02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:53.240
With all of librarians is
to open such primary sources

02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:58.520
to the researchers by preparing
bibliographic bibliographies,

02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:00.460
as complete as possible.

02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:04.590
Understanding the advantages
of the printed bibliographies,

02:10:04.590 --> 02:10:08.540
being aware that
information technologies

02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:11.300
and Internet are
acting as key supporters

02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:14.520
in the knowledge
bridging process,

So, the first one.

02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:11.010
Armenian book database.

Total number of bibliography
records is 127,579.

02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:21.610
Why I am just [inaudible]?

02:11:21.610 --> 02:11:24.380
Because this is very close

02:11:24.380 --> 02:11:29.600
to what Armenians had produced
unique titles from 1512,

02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:33.110
I think until 2016/'17.

02:11:33.110 --> 02:11:38.580
This number could go up to
1000-30,000, but no match.

02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:42.430
So we can state that
Armenians have produced

02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:45.670
so much titles during
their printing history.

02:11:45.670 --> 02:11:49.200
More than 12,000
digitized books are attached

02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:53.240
to the relevant bibliographic
records.

02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:55.330
And this number is growing.

02:11:55.330 --> 02:11:58.660
Main sources for having
bibliographic records are

02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:01.220
[inaudible] and libraries'
collections --

02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:07.130
UK, USA, Europe-based libraries
on [inaudible], digitized books

02:12:07.130 --> 02:12:10.210
from our products from
[inaudible] to Jerusalem,

02:12:10.210 --> 02:12:12.740
New [inaudible] and Istanbul.

02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:17.760
Although [inaudible]
digitization activities

02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:21.570
for the books are carried out in
the National Library of Armenia

02:12:21.570 --> 02:12:23.850
and even from the [inaudible]
scientific libraries,

02:12:23.850 --> 02:12:28.730
several international projects
are of [inaudible] for us,

02:12:28.730 --> 02:12:32.770
so those are the
Europeana Project

02:12:32.770 --> 02:12:37.850
which is covering all Europe and
the special national libraries.

02:12:37.850 --> 02:12:39.150
UNESCO is [inaudible] program.

02:12:39.150 --> 02:12:42.040
Google Books Project,

02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:45.590
the [inaudible] Digital
Library [inaudible] verification

02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:48.320
for the research
and the archiving

02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.840
of Armenian memory [inaudible].

02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:53.170
This is from Marseilles, France.

02:12:53.170 --> 02:12:58.540
Also some research institutions
and universities in Armenia

02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:01.830
which have joined the
Open Access Initiative

02:13:01.830 --> 02:13:03.910
and they're mounting
their publications

02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:06.250
in the open access domain.

02:13:06.250 --> 02:13:10.930
The European and [inaudible]
Digital Library platforms are

02:13:10.930 --> 02:13:12.230
very useful.

02:13:12.230 --> 02:13:15.370
In both we find early
Armenian printed books

02:13:15.370 --> 02:13:19.220
which are not included in
any of the bibliographies.

02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:22.550
So thanks to the digital
technologies, we were able

02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:26.030
to find in different European
libraries a digital [inaudible]

02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:31.420
of 12 foreign language rare
books containing Armenian text

02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:34.640
which were not included
in their publication,

02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:40.010
<i>The Armenian Book</i>
, in 1512, 1800.

02:13:40.010 --> 02:13:44.390
The number of -- and this
covered early prints is

02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:45.690
much higher.

02:13:45.690 --> 02:13:47.700
Let's say last year our
videographers visited the

02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:49.690
Istanbul Municipal Library

02:13:49.690 --> 02:13:53.160
and we found there
19 new book titles.

02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:56.630
In the Armenian Patriarchate
in Constantinople

02:13:56.630 --> 02:14:00.170
in their library we
found 84 new book titles.

02:14:00.170 --> 02:14:03.940
So these are titles which
had never been included

02:14:03.940 --> 02:14:07.140
in any bibliographies.

02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:12.560
So the Union Catalog of
"Armenian Continuing Resources."

02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:18.140
Total number of the
bibliographic records is 5808.

02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:21.950
This includes newspapers,
journals, yearbooks, bulletins.

02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:25.500
More than 3 million
digitized pages are already

02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:27.340
fully accessible.

02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:30.650
Again, our partners from
[inaudible], Istanbul, Antilles,

02:14:30.650 --> 02:14:35.640
are not only participating
in digitization activities,

02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:38.810
but are also providing
us with new titles

02:14:38.810 --> 02:14:40.520
for [inaudible] you can see.

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:42.300
They are on the screen.

02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:47.550
And you just -- Professor
[inaudible].

02:14:47.550 --> 02:14:56.390
He mentioned -- he
[inaudible] I think newspaper

02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:59.170
around [inaudible].

02:14:59.170 --> 02:15:04.320
I check now database and
not any record for this.

02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:05.830
So maybe this is --

02:15:05.830 --> 02:15:08.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:09.340
-- material.

02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:10.640
In any case, will be interesting
just to discuss with you

02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:16.390
because still we find lots of --
a lot interesting titles for us.

02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:21.130
So we don't know any
information about that.

02:15:21.130 --> 02:15:25.910
The database is a good
of Armenian periodical,

02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:27.850
is a good resource
for researchers

02:15:27.850 --> 02:15:30.700
and also for statistical data.

02:15:30.700 --> 02:15:34.240
It is having very
high hits from U.S.,

02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:39.460
a lot of requests are coming.

02:15:39.460 --> 02:15:41.640
Such as it is further
down [inaudible] so --

02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:47.940
especially [inaudible]
center start using the data

02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:49.480
from this database.

02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:55.700
So we can see that
5808 titles are divided

02:15:55.700 --> 02:16:00.000
by publication type in this way.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.070
So, as you can see the numbers.

02:16:02.070 --> 02:16:04.490
Another interesting source --

02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:13.470
the last bibliography for
the periodicals was published

02:16:13.470 --> 02:16:16.480
in Armenia in 1986
by [inaudible].

02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:22.200
It covers the time period 1795,

02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:27.960
the first Armenian periodical
was published, until 1980.

02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:33.770
So you can see some
of cities, not all.

02:16:33.770 --> 02:16:39.270
And in red we indicate total
number of periodicals published

02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:42.940
in those cities according
to our database.

02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:46.060
So we can see that in
Boston, according to Babloyan,

02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:49.340
46 titles; according
to our database, 58.

02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:54.040
In New York, according
to Babloyan, 87;

02:16:54.040 --> 02:17:01.840
according to our database, 142,
from which four are periodicals

02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:05.310
in Turkish with Armenian
letters.

02:17:05.310 --> 02:17:11.680
So in USA, seven periodicals
were published in Turkish

02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:13.620
with Armenian letters.

02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:18.000
Total number according
to Babloyan is 298;

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.670
according to our
database, is 464.

02:17:21.670 --> 02:17:23.900
So very big difference.

02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:25.950
And these numbers
still will be changing

02:17:25.950 --> 02:17:29.100
because of the [inaudible]
first in a search

02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:36.170
and they are still finding
new titles, new titles.

02:17:36.170 --> 02:17:40.560
So cities, you know, US
cities which were not included

02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:44.440
in the Babloyan's bibliographies
-- so we can see Paramus,

02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:49.970
Morton Grove, Belmont, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

02:17:57.070 --> 02:17:59.360
Now Armenian Libraries
Union Catalog.

02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:01.160
All solutions are based

02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:03.680
on Free/Open Source
Software products.

02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:05.710
Actually, Armenian Libraries --

02:18:05.710 --> 02:18:09.840
we do not use any commercial
products, from service solutions

02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:13.410
to the library systems.

02:18:13.410 --> 02:18:15.920
Everything is based
on free/open source.

02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:19.920
So products in the systems are
maintained by the librarians,

02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:21.320
which is very interesting.

02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:25.380
So they are doing the
maintenance of the systems,

02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:29.690
of those systems, with more than
one and two million bibliography

02:18:29.690 --> 02:18:32.930
and [inaudible] and more
than 5 million items.

02:18:32.930 --> 02:18:36.200
This is a unit resource
for researchers, students,

02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:38.360
library patrons worldwide.

02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:41.590
Public, academic, community,
and university libraries

02:18:41.590 --> 02:18:45.430
from Armenia are active
participants of the project.

02:18:45.430 --> 02:18:47.790
It's worth mentioning
that the repository

02:18:47.790 --> 02:18:49.120
of ancient manuscripts

02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:53.500
and Mechitarist Congregation
have also joined this project,

02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:56.360
which means that
two important nodes

02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:59.550
of spiritual Armenia
will be [inaudible].

02:18:59.550 --> 02:19:02.530
We have finished our training
courses with [inaudible],

02:19:02.530 --> 02:19:08.180
and now a lady from [inaudible]

02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:13.460
by the Mechitarist Congregation
is passing training courses

02:19:13.460 --> 02:19:16.990
and after that she
will start to compare

02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:22.290
and correct Mechitarist
Congregation card catalog,

02:19:22.290 --> 02:19:26.970
now metaphonic form, which will
be a huge help for all of us.

02:19:30.490 --> 02:19:33.950
So the weight of the
U.S.-based universities

02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:39.470
and Armenian Studies Centers
has a spiritual Armenian note,

02:19:39.470 --> 02:19:41.660
and for supplying
the Armenian book

02:19:41.660 --> 02:19:44.260
and the Armenian Continuing
Resources Data Business

02:19:44.260 --> 02:19:48.450
with information is becoming
more and more important.

02:19:48.450 --> 02:19:51.780
The Healthy Choice Digital
Library Initiative wishes

02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:54.950
Armenian Collection is a
real help for all of us.

02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:59.490
The Library of Congress with its
rich Armenian Collection could

02:19:59.490 --> 02:20:02.290
have to ask another
note in the USA.

02:20:02.290 --> 02:20:05.210
There are many unexplored
private collections,

02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:11.020
a university library collection
which should be examined.

02:20:11.020 --> 02:20:15.790
And currently we're considering
establishing professional

02:20:15.790 --> 02:20:20.010
relationships with
these organizations.

02:20:20.010 --> 02:20:24.770
By the way, we can supply our
viewers' library electronic

02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:28.180
[inaudible] with
Armenian script records

02:20:28.180 --> 02:20:32.680
with high-quality Armenian
script records in [inaudible],

02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:37.960
so if anybody first time that
they hear is interested on that,

02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:42.320
we can provide you
freely with those records.

02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:45.970
We are confident that much
more unknown titles of books

02:20:45.970 --> 02:20:49.710
and [inaudible] because
will be discovered.

02:20:49.710 --> 02:20:52.270
Here we see, [inaudible]
possibilities.

02:20:52.270 --> 02:20:55.080
We saw a U.S. Diaspora.

02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:56.790
So what's next?

02:20:56.790 --> 02:21:03.210
Just as I mentioned, we now
are organizing training courses

02:21:03.210 --> 02:21:06.270
for the Library [inaudible]
and in Armenia

02:21:06.270 --> 02:21:12.890
and from our Diasporas, teaching
them on modern technologies,

02:21:12.890 --> 02:21:19.790
on machine [inaudible]
rules, and more.

02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:21.370
And programming languages

02:21:21.370 --> 02:21:24.310
because now our [inaudible]
are doing --

02:21:24.310 --> 02:21:27.380
are developing some small
software pieces for us.

02:21:27.380 --> 02:21:32.160
As a result of military
conflicts, immigration,

02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:35.050
economic crisis in
our communities,

02:21:35.050 --> 02:21:39.240
we already have abandoned
all forgotten libraries.

02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:43.940
So if audience of here, you
know also about such libraries,

02:21:43.940 --> 02:21:47.430
please keep us informed about
existence of such libraries,

02:21:47.430 --> 02:21:51.660
or here in U.S. or in
Europe or in Middle East.

02:21:51.660 --> 02:21:56.730
And with the help of Minister of
Diaspora, Minister of Culture,

02:21:56.730 --> 02:22:00.260
Minister of Foreign Affairs, we
will try to organize transfer,

02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:03.760
transportation of
those collections

02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:06.560
to the National Library
of Armenia.

02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:10.510
Now we are [inaudible] one
very interesting project

02:22:10.510 --> 02:22:15.740
in preparation with the Poznan
Supercomputing Center Institute

02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:19.170
for Informatics and Automation
Problems of the Academy

02:22:19.170 --> 02:22:24.550
of Sciences of Armenia and the
Fundamental Scientific Library

02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:29.460
-- Development of the
Pan-Armenian Digital Library.

02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:34.090
The system will enable to
create professional repositories

02:22:34.090 --> 02:22:38.480
of digital documents and share
them with interested people

02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:41.410
and systems on the Internet.

02:22:41.410 --> 02:22:43.010
Data exchange is based

02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:47.170
on generally accepted
standards and protocols.

02:22:47.170 --> 02:22:50.830
And Pan-Armenian Digital Library
will offer the users many

02:22:50.830 --> 02:22:54.430
powerful possibilities such
as searching for content

02:22:54.430 --> 02:22:56.310
of the collected resources,

02:22:56.310 --> 02:22:59.750
searching bibliography
descriptions using [inaudible]

02:22:59.750 --> 02:23:02.630
dictionary, grouping
digital publications

02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:05.310
and navigating their structure.

02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:08.680
The system will operate on
virtual servers environment.

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:11.370
We have parallel
computing features using the

02:23:11.370 --> 02:23:12.940
cloud solutions.

02:23:12.940 --> 02:23:18.360
And I hope that you
will come in two years.

02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:22.460
We'll be able to develop an
optical recognition engine

02:23:22.460 --> 02:23:23.780
for Armenian handwritten

02:23:23.780 --> 02:23:27.350
and printed characters using
deep learning approach.

02:23:27.350 --> 02:23:33.380
Here we are cooperating with
some of our European partners.

02:23:33.380 --> 02:23:36.830
So we are working, because this
is really very, very important,

02:23:36.830 --> 02:23:41.410
very, very important
topic for us now.

02:23:41.410 --> 02:23:46.190
And I came with my presentation
an African proverb saying that

02:23:46.190 --> 02:23:49.330
"if you want to walk
fast, walk alone.

far, walk together."

02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:59.640
So I think that now we have
started to do a step together.

02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:03.890
We do have very interesting
findings with the help

02:24:03.890 --> 02:24:05.390
of our Diaspora partners,

02:24:05.390 --> 02:24:08.040
and I hope that we will
continue our preparation

02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:09.950
on behalf of Armenian nation.

02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:11.750
So, thank you.

here are the bookmarks.

So, Levon, can you
join me please?

02:24:32.050 --> 02:24:35.160
This is a small surprise.

02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:41.820
So, Levon Avdoyan is a great
scholar, researcher, librarian,

02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:45.060

02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:47.920

02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:54.800
Thank you very much.

02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:56.610
What Tigran doesn't know
-- I'm greatly honored.

02:25:56.610 --> 02:25:58.660
But what Tigran doesn't
know is that as soon

02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:01.850
as I retire I am going to spend
several months in Armenia.

02:26:01.850 --> 02:26:03.670
And I might -- I'll
probably spend many

But thank you.

02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:22.260
Wonderful.

02:26:22.260 --> 02:26:25.260
Oh, the Hakob Meghapart, in case
you don't know, was the printer

02:26:25.260 --> 02:26:27.950
of that first Armenian
book in --

02:26:27.950 --> 02:26:33.880
I prefer 1512, but I know
Sylvia [inaudible] 1511.

02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:38.490
No truer words have been spoken
than by Tigran, and Nerses,

02:26:38.490 --> 02:26:43.910
but the library community is
so interconnected, you know.

02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:46.510
Many people -- eyes
glaze over when we talk

02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:49.690
about library science,
but it is interconnected,

02:26:49.690 --> 02:26:52.390
and we do work together
very well.

02:26:52.390 --> 02:26:57.370
We are now on to our last talk,

02:26:57.370 --> 02:27:00.870
and we're going back
to the 19th century.

02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:04.510
And I did this purposely because
there's a surprise at the end

02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:08.060
of this talk that I won't
particularly tell you about.

02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:13.230
About 10 years ago we procured a
manuscript by Pietro Bianchini.

02:27:13.230 --> 02:27:14.960
I won't say anything
more about him

02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:20.240
because our speaker will
certainly fill us in about him.

02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:24.180
And there is something special

02:27:24.180 --> 02:27:29.140
about seeing something you
have acquired come to life.

02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:34.680
And this is what we want to have
happen to all our acquisitions.

02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:38.390
So, brilliant musicologist,
composer.

02:27:38.390 --> 02:27:41.190
I mean, I would -- whatever
I have done in scholarship

02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:45.510
and librarianship I would trade
to be able to be a musician.

02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:48.200
People know that about me.

02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:54.570
From the Czech Republic, a
great storyteller I have come

02:27:54.570 --> 02:27:58.590
to learn, Mr. -- Dr. Haig
Utidjian, who will be speaking

02:27:58.590 --> 02:28:02.560
about sublime and
celestial Pietro Bianchini

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:04.510
and an <i>Ode for the Patriarch </i>.

02:28:04.510 --> 02:29:47.340
[ Music ]

02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:49.330
&gt;&gt; Haig Utidjian: Thank you
very much, indeed, Levon,

02:29:49.330 --> 02:29:53.160
for the I would say
excessively kind introduction

02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:55.810
which nonetheless I
appreciated very much indeed.

02:29:55.810 --> 02:29:58.950
This is not the manuscript
I intend

02:29:58.950 --> 02:30:02.120
to talk about, ladies
and gentlemen.

02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:06.270
I shall be talking about a
particularly beautiful Armenian

02:30:06.270 --> 02:30:09.770
manuscript of an
ode that has been

02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:14.920
in use during the Armenian
Devine Liturgy for probably

02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:21.280
at least three centuries
"[Inaudible], oh, ye chosen one

02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:26.620
of God," which Bianchini
transcribed and harmonized.

02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:31.360
Nonetheless, I thought that if
I started with that manuscript

02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:34.860
which I will give it the bulk
of the present talk, you would,

02:30:34.860 --> 02:30:39.690
of course, with justification,
ask who on Earth Bianchini was,

02:30:39.690 --> 02:30:43.030
because he's not as well as
known as he deserves to be,

02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:47.150
either in Armenian circles
or in even internationally.

02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:49.740
I was extremely fortunate
in being able

02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:54.400
to locate a manuscript
of this <i>Sinfonia </i>from

02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:59.040
which we just heard a
soundbite recorded specifically

02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:03.050
by the [foreign words] Orchestra
in Prague under my direction

02:31:03.050 --> 02:31:07.230
with the very kind
permission of the procurators

02:31:07.230 --> 02:31:11.120
of the St. Marks
Basilica in Venice

02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:14.130
for whose orchestra
the piece was composed

02:31:14.130 --> 02:31:17.200
and performed in 1863.

02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:21.460
Uniquely, we have permission to
play this excerpt this afternoon

02:31:21.460 --> 02:31:25.380
and [inaudible] the time so I do
feel privileged that I was able

02:31:25.380 --> 02:31:27.620
to present you this
little fragment.

02:31:27.620 --> 02:31:31.930
To give you a little idea
of who Bianchini was.

02:31:31.930 --> 02:31:36.790
He was an Italian
Venetian-born musician described

02:31:36.790 --> 02:31:38.590
by various Armenians as --

02:31:38.590 --> 02:31:45.300
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:50.410
He was a child prodigy as
first composer and violinist.

02:31:50.410 --> 02:31:54.560
He was prolific as a composer.

02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:59.470
He has two masses, two
requiems, a large number

02:31:59.470 --> 02:32:02.150
of orchestral pieces,
chamber music,

02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:05.040
music for the [inaudible]
instruments,

02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:07.280
some [inaudible]
music, but very little

02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:10.230
of his artwork has
been published at all.

02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:14.210
And, indeed, what he's most
remembered for is the fact

02:32:14.210 --> 02:32:17.040
that he published his
own transcriptions

02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:18.340
of all the [inaudible]

02:32:18.340 --> 02:32:21.810
of the <i>Armenian Divine
Liturgy </i>which he harmonized

02:32:21.810 --> 02:32:26.500
on the basis of the chance
he had heard performed

02:32:26.500 --> 02:32:31.730
by the Venetian [foreign
word] fathers in San Lazarof.

02:32:31.730 --> 02:32:35.640
And that is what he may be
remembered for at the moment,

02:32:35.640 --> 02:32:38.150
although he deserves to be
known very much better both

02:32:38.150 --> 02:32:43.540
in Armenian circles
and in others.

02:32:43.540 --> 02:32:45.740
Now, there is, in fact,

02:32:45.740 --> 02:32:49.170
one piece that very
many Armenians know,

02:32:49.170 --> 02:32:53.210
but without in fact knowing that
Pietro Bianchini composed it.

02:32:53.210 --> 02:32:59.800
And it is actually a piece
that is very, very opposite

02:32:59.800 --> 02:33:03.370
to this occasion, given
that I have the privilege

02:33:03.370 --> 02:33:08.230
of participating in the
[inaudible] Lecture Series.

02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:13.270

a rousing song, a march,

in which [foreign words]

so that they will take their
vengeance for the [inaudible].

Now, this was a poem
composed by --

who was an almost exact
contemporary of Bianchini's.

02:33:39.700 --> 02:33:43.570
And I managed to find a very
interesting historical recording

02:33:43.570 --> 02:33:49.190

than the Nightingale of Darron,

now, very briefly,

02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:02.340
to play you a little
bit of [foreign words].

02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:05.160
Many of you will have heard
the melody without knowing

02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:09.510
that Bianchini composed it.

[ Music and Singing ]

02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:49.720

you to hear a sufficient beat

02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:52.920
of the excerpt so that we could
include the magnificent high

02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:54.550
notes with which he ended.

in <i>La Scale </i>in Milan and in --

at the Paris Opera as well.

02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:06.420
And he was singing [foreign

by Father Ghevont Alishan,
and music by none other

02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:11.240
than Pietro Bianchini,

02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:15.120
the author of the manuscript
I'm going to talk about.

02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:19.070
But one last thing
before I start doing so --

02:36:19.070 --> 02:36:23.990
just to give you a sort
of feel about the circles

02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:26.820
in which Pietro Bianchini
circulated.

02:36:26.820 --> 02:36:29.630
I should like to invite
you to consider three

02:36:29.630 --> 02:36:33.960
of the delicatees [assumed
spelling] of his various works,

02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:36.130
manuscripts, publications.

02:36:36.130 --> 02:36:40.250
They are none other than
King Victor Emmanuel II,

02:36:40.250 --> 02:36:45.680
the King of Italy, for whom
Bianchini composed an orchestral

02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:47.010
piece, [foreign words],

02:36:47.010 --> 02:36:51.050
to celebrate the
annexation of Venice in 1866.

02:36:51.050 --> 02:36:55.060
But the other two were no
less formidable characters

02:36:55.060 --> 02:36:57.980
within the Armenian milieu.

02:36:57.980 --> 02:37:01.880
The middle gentleman
was Abbott General

A formidable personality
himself,

and a towering intellectual

02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:15.540
who would deserve a

02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:18.070
in his own right if
it were possible.

02:37:18.070 --> 02:37:19.730
And the third is nonother

02:37:19.730 --> 02:37:23.280
than the Catholicos
Patriarch Steven Peters,

02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:27.610

who was very distinguished,

02:37:27.610 --> 02:37:29.620

should now like to turn.

This is what the
dedication page looks like.

It is hand-written
by Bianchini himself,

02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:54.210
dedicated to the
patriarch on the occasion

of the latter's nameday
which was St. Stephen's Day,

02:37:58.910 --> 02:38:03.190
the 26th of December, 1887.

02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:05.930
Bianchini ends the letter

02:38:05.930 --> 02:38:10.980
by seeking the patriarch's
blessing, approaching,

02:38:10.980 --> 02:38:13.750
figuratively, to kiss his hand,

02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:17.640
and declaring himself

02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:23.610
And very importantly
Maestro of the Congregation

02:38:23.610 --> 02:38:27.850
of the Mechitarist Fathers
of San Lazzaro in Venice.

02:38:27.850 --> 02:38:30.930
Bianchini spent many
years working

02:38:30.930 --> 02:38:35.610
in San Lazzaro apparently
directing the choir during the

02:38:35.610 --> 02:38:36.960
Divine Liturgy.

02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:40.240
So, in addition to serving as
Director of Music in a number

02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:43.250
of Italian cities,
particularly Northern Italy,

02:38:43.250 --> 02:38:48.440
he performed this very valuable
service to the Armenian Monks.

02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:52.800
Now the ode in question, and
[foreign words], chosen of God,

02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:55.220
is a composition
not of Bianchini's.

02:38:55.220 --> 02:38:58.500
Bianchini merely transcribed
the traditional melody.

02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:02.210
But it is a work that
preoccupied Bianchini

02:39:02.210 --> 02:39:05.190
for several decades in
the course of his career.

02:39:05.190 --> 02:39:10.570
And we have various versions
of it which he worked on.

02:39:10.570 --> 02:39:14.240
The earliest that I know
was published as part

02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:17.900
of a very slim booklet
that is exceedingly rare.

02:39:17.900 --> 02:39:20.950
Not only the Mechitarist
fathers,

02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:24.600
not even the Mechitarist
fathers in Venice in San Lazaro

02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:26.820
or even the Armenian
National Library are

02:39:26.820 --> 02:39:30.550
in possession of a copy.

02:39:30.550 --> 02:39:33.960
And you can see -- that is the
extreme left-hand side corner.

02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:40.190
It consists of two lines,
the melody sung by a soloist,

02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:43.900
and a figured baseline as if it
were a piece of baroque music,

02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:46.600
indicating one line and
with little numbers,

02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:48.900
the chords that should be played

02:39:48.900 --> 02:39:52.120
by the organist or
harmonium player.

02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:57.330
The second version of it
that we encounter is part

02:39:57.330 --> 02:40:00.570
of the entire complete
Divine Liturgy chance.

02:40:00.570 --> 02:40:04.330
These were published
in 1877 in San Lazaro.

02:40:04.330 --> 02:40:09.080
And there, we find the entire
ode complete with an organ

02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:11.460
or harmonium accompaniment.

02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:13.980
But there are also
various manuscripts

02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:16.150
that I have succeeded
in locating

02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:18.020
in the San Lazaro archives

02:40:18.020 --> 02:40:20.360
in which Bianchini
made various copies

02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:24.930
or arrangements particularly
of the choral component

02:40:24.930 --> 02:40:29.470
of the ode typically with
the verbal underlay written

02:40:29.470 --> 02:40:31.920
in Latin script suggesting

02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:36.520
that probably Italian
professional singers would sing

02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:39.950
during the Divine
Liturgies in San Lazaro,

02:40:39.950 --> 02:40:43.410
a fact that I found rather
surprising initially.

02:40:43.410 --> 02:40:46.110
And in one case and that's
the undated manuscript

02:40:46.110 --> 02:40:49.160
that I'm showing you on the
extreme right-hand side,

02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:52.790
he has a string orchestra
accompaniment

02:40:52.790 --> 02:40:56.120
to almost the entire
Divine Liturgy and it seems

02:40:56.120 --> 02:40:57.850
that he had second thoughts.

02:40:57.850 --> 02:41:00.330
You see that he crossed
out the orchestra

02:41:00.330 --> 02:41:05.430
from the first four measures,
deciding that it should be sung

02:41:05.430 --> 02:41:10.580
by solo female voices alone,
one soprano and one alto,

02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:11.880
before the chorus comes

02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:15.570
in on the fifth measure
together with the strings.

02:41:15.570 --> 02:41:19.170
But this is what the version
in our manuscript looks like.

02:41:19.170 --> 02:41:22.930
Again, it is the complete ode
with the first two stanzas

02:41:22.930 --> 02:41:27.700
of the ode to be sung by a
soloist accompanied by harmonium

02:41:27.700 --> 02:41:31.120
or some other suitable
keyboard instrument.

02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:35.830
And the remaining stanzas
are included complete

02:41:35.830 --> 02:41:43.010
to be sung by a choir.

02:41:43.010 --> 02:41:46.470
And after the music, the words

02:41:46.470 --> 02:41:50.140
on their own have also been
beautifully copied out.

02:41:50.140 --> 02:41:54.850
The first two stanzas in a
kind of Armenian Gothic script

02:41:54.850 --> 02:41:57.900
with the word [inaudible]
patriarch highlighted

02:41:57.900 --> 02:42:05.560
by being made larger because
usually the words are [Speaking

02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:09.090
in foreign language], chosen
of God, oh happy, holy priest.

02:42:09.090 --> 02:42:13.780
But the word priest
has been replaced

02:42:13.780 --> 02:42:18.580
by the word patriarch
customizing the ode as it were

02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:22.400
for the person, to the
person of the patriarch.

02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:26.930
And the choral stanzas are
written in a beautiful hand

02:42:26.930 --> 02:42:30.980
in another script which is
characteristic of the period.

02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:34.450
But the crucial thing is that
the entire ode has been included

02:42:34.450 --> 02:42:36.560
and the music for it as well.

02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:40.560
And the verbal text, we can
find in another possession

02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:41.860
of the Library of Congress

02:42:41.860 --> 02:42:45.980
in the beautiful
Constantinopolitan Breviary

02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:49.720
of 1768 where you see
it starts at the bottom

02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:51.580
of the left-hand side page,

02:42:51.580 --> 02:42:57.680
continuing all the way
along the page opposite.

02:42:57.680 --> 02:43:03.810
The verbal text, the poetry
is actually rather beautiful.

02:43:03.810 --> 02:43:08.380
It makes allusions to the
Book of Exodus from the Bible,

02:43:08.380 --> 02:43:12.290
the 28th chapter where
there is a description

02:43:12.290 --> 02:43:17.730
of Moses preparing meticulously
and beautifully woven garments,

02:43:17.730 --> 02:43:20.620
priestly garments for Aaron.

02:43:20.620 --> 02:43:24.640
And the poet, whoever it was who
composed the words of this ode,

02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:29.590
likens the celebrant about
to serve the Divine Liturgy

02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:33.610
to the person of Aaron.

02:43:33.610 --> 02:43:37.320
And in the words of
the poem, it is Christ

02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:41.640
who today makes our celebrant
appear under the same form

02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:47.440
as Aaron and seeks the
intercession of the priest.

02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:51.530
Now, this is full of
polyvalent symbolism

02:43:51.530 --> 02:43:55.850
because if we consider the
liturgical use of the ode,

02:43:55.850 --> 02:43:57.250
we find that in fact, the ode is

02:43:57.250 --> 02:44:00.370
to be sung during the
particularly poignant moment

02:44:00.370 --> 02:44:02.600
in the beginning of
the Divine Liturgy.

02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:07.450
During those moments when the
celebrant, being the bishop

02:44:07.450 --> 02:44:11.340
or of higher rank, is
to fall on his knees

02:44:11.340 --> 02:44:15.640
and with overflowing tears --
these are not my words but those

02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:20.470
of the rubric, the instructions
in the missal and I'm quoting

02:44:20.470 --> 02:44:24.010
from another beautiful
Library of Congress manuscript,

02:44:24.010 --> 02:44:28.210
a missal from the year
1722 where you can see

02:44:28.210 --> 02:44:30.010
on the left-hand
side the situation.

02:44:30.010 --> 02:44:31.800
The celebrant is kneeling.

02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:36.700
The proto deacon, the chief
deacon has taken his miter away

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:41.320
and the celebrant is to recite
the very beautiful prayer

02:44:41.320 --> 02:44:44.670
by Saint Gregory of
Narek in two parts,

02:44:44.670 --> 02:44:48.050
addressed to the Holy
Spirit which he has

02:44:48.050 --> 02:44:50.910
to do quietly and
inexpressively.

02:44:50.910 --> 02:44:52.990
The Armenian word is [Speaking

02:44:52.990 --> 02:44:54.290
in foreign language]
corresponding

02:44:54.290 --> 02:44:57.370
to the Greek [Speaking in
foreign language] which in turn,

02:44:57.370 --> 02:45:00.890
harks back to the Book
of Romans, chapter eight

02:45:00.890 --> 02:45:05.460
where Saint Paul refers to our
own inability to pray properly

02:45:05.460 --> 02:45:10.310
but that fortunately, the
Holy Spirit utters these

02:45:10.310 --> 02:45:12.410
inexpressible groans by way

02:45:12.410 --> 02:45:15.320
of interceding on
our behalf to God.

02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:18.260
So you can see there are all
sorts of layers of associations.

02:45:18.260 --> 02:45:20.550
The celebrant kneels.

02:45:20.550 --> 02:45:24.900
He recites quietly this
prayer during which time,

02:45:24.900 --> 02:45:27.640
someone has to sing this ode.

02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:30.080
And if you were in the
position of singing the ode,

02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:34.610
as I have been, you can never
predict how long this is going

02:45:34.610 --> 02:45:35.910
to take.

02:45:35.910 --> 02:45:39.050
How many stanzas of the ode you
will require because the rubric

02:45:39.050 --> 02:45:42.200
in the middle of the prayer
to the Holy Spirit says

02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:45.680
that the celebrant has to repeat
the first part of the prayer

02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:52.450
as many times as it takes
until such time as confidence

02:45:52.450 --> 02:45:54.230
in the upward contemplation

02:45:54.230 --> 02:45:58.170
of light be wonderfully
revealed to the celebrant.

02:45:58.170 --> 02:46:00.180
As you might imagine,
one cannot predict

02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:05.240
in advance how long it will
take for such confidence

02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:08.390
in the upward contemplation
of light and the revelation

02:46:08.390 --> 02:46:11.590
of this light will take.

02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:16.380
And so, Bianchini was very wise
in providing the entire text

02:46:16.380 --> 02:46:19.710
with music just in case.

02:46:19.710 --> 02:46:21.490
It is a very beautiful
moment, the celebrant

02:46:21.490 --> 02:46:25.350
and the singer both kneel
and usually these days,

02:46:25.350 --> 02:46:29.670
unlike this image where the
celebrant is holding the missal

02:46:29.670 --> 02:46:32.330
himself from which
to read the prayer.

02:46:32.330 --> 02:46:38.840
Two deacons also kneel holding
the missal on either side.

02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:42.450
This is another illustration
from Matenadaran missal

02:46:42.450 --> 02:46:45.880
of about the same period.

02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:50.770
You can see the deacons behind.

02:46:50.770 --> 02:46:54.760
One is holding the miter and
the celebrant is kneeling

02:46:54.760 --> 02:46:56.820
and saying the prayer.

02:46:56.820 --> 02:47:00.650
Rather more recently than the
18th Century, last October,

02:47:00.650 --> 02:47:03.400
I had the enormous pleasure
of bringing this melody back

02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:09.240
to life by singing this
Bianchini version of the ode

02:47:09.240 --> 02:47:11.610
in the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

02:47:11.610 --> 02:47:15.800
I was not, of course, singing
from the beautiful Library

02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:18.990
of Congress manuscript
itself but rather

02:47:18.990 --> 02:47:20.290
from an electronic scan

02:47:20.290 --> 02:47:25.100
of it very kindly made
available to me by Levon.

02:47:26.250 --> 02:47:30.560
Now, you might like to
ask how old this ode is.

02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:33.490
Since when did it
come into existence?

02:47:33.490 --> 02:47:35.760
It is a question that I
have not been able to answer

02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:41.530
with certainty but I
have tried my best.

02:47:41.530 --> 02:47:45.180
We have the very great benefit
that there is a fine catalog

02:47:45.180 --> 02:47:50.030
by the later Father [Inaudible],
the former abbot of San Lazaro,

02:47:50.030 --> 02:47:53.550
where you can look up
all the odes that are

02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:56.850
in all the manuscripts
in San Lazaro,

02:47:56.850 --> 02:47:59.670
looking up their first lines.

02:47:59.670 --> 02:48:02.020
And there are over
60 manuscripts

02:48:02.020 --> 02:48:05.720
that could include this ode
which include odes and litanies.

02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:11.370
And only a single one out of
those 66 manuscripts, I think,

02:48:11.370 --> 02:48:13.620
if I'm right, includes the ode.

02:48:13.620 --> 02:48:16.590
And it is a rather
recent manuscript

02:48:16.590 --> 02:48:18.550
as Armenian manuscripts go,

02:48:18.550 --> 02:48:22.260
being copied out
in the year 1663.

02:48:22.260 --> 02:48:26.160
As it happens, in the Armenian
Church of the Holy Cross

02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:28.470
in Venice, a stone's throw

02:48:28.470 --> 02:48:31.800
from Saint Mark's
Basilica, as it happens.

02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:35.110
Moreover, we read that the
manuscript was discovered

02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:37.360
in the 19th Century
by none other

02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:41.550
than the poet monk Father Lewond
Alisan whose [Inaudible] we

02:48:41.550 --> 02:48:44.360
heard a moment ago
to Bianchini's music.

02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:46.620
This is what the
manuscript looks like.

02:48:46.620 --> 02:48:48.640
But alas, although other items

02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:51.490
in the manuscript have
musical signs on them,

02:48:51.490 --> 02:48:54.120
this particular ode, the
ode that interests us,

02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:56.570
does not bear musical signs.

02:48:56.570 --> 02:49:00.290
But if we look at the
[Inaudible] Monastery in Vienna,

02:49:00.290 --> 02:49:03.320
there is a manuscript
from about the same period

02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:05.890
but it cannot be clearly dated

02:49:05.890 --> 02:49:07.980
as it does not have
a [inaudible]

02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:11.810
which does bear musical
signs known as neumes.

02:49:11.810 --> 02:49:15.110
Now, that does not necessarily
help us quite as much

02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:17.910
as one might hope because
we are sadly unable

02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:20.680
to decipher the medieval neumes.

02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:23.840
But we can tell various
things by looking

02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:27.010
at the notation over the words.

02:49:27.010 --> 02:49:29.120
We can see that the
melody, whatever it was,

02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:32.170
must have been fairly
simple because the density

02:49:32.170 --> 02:49:34.580
of the neumes is not
particularly high.

02:49:34.580 --> 02:49:37.870
And we mostly see
rather simple signs.

02:49:37.870 --> 02:49:40.480
But we can do a bit
better than that.

02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:43.910
We are extremely fortunate
in that a very great genius

02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:46.790
and probably the greatest
Armenian musicologist

02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:48.500
of modern times,

02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:52.510
the Constantinopolitan
Church musician Elia Tntesean

02:49:52.510 --> 02:49:58.240
who belonged more or less to the
same generation as Bianchini,

02:49:58.240 --> 02:50:00.220
carried out a lot of astute

02:50:00.220 --> 02:50:06.260
and meticulous detective
work enabling him not perhaps

02:50:06.260 --> 02:50:09.080
to decipher the meaning
of the neumes

02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:11.220
but to develop a conjecture,

02:50:11.220 --> 02:50:15.840
quite a convincing conjecture
although it is not quite 100%

02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:20.420
water tight, according
to which we can tell

02:50:20.420 --> 02:50:23.930
with reasonable certainty
the metrical durations

02:50:23.930 --> 02:50:28.910
of particular syllables
bearing some neumes

02:50:28.910 --> 02:50:31.610
or bearing no neumes at all.

02:50:31.610 --> 02:50:36.820
And if we apply his conjecture
to this manuscript of this ode,

02:50:36.820 --> 02:50:44.510
we find that there is, indeed, a
very exciting rhythm as follows.

02:50:44.510 --> 02:51:05.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:08.170
It continues like this but
then in the middle of the ode,

02:51:08.170 --> 02:51:11.510
things get more exciting and the
rhythm changes and it becomes --

02:51:11.510 --> 02:51:19.070
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

02:51:19.070 --> 02:51:20.370
And then it returns

02:51:20.370 --> 02:51:23.430
to the regular five-four
sort of rhythm.

02:51:23.430 --> 02:51:27.080
There is a sort of dance-like
lilt to it, isn't there?

02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:31.790
And I think that this is,
indeed, the sort of meter

02:51:31.790 --> 02:51:35.100
that would have -- that the
ode would have been sung to.

02:51:35.100 --> 02:51:38.880
Now, none of the melodies that
are available to us at present

02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:43.750
from various traditions
correspond to the neumes

02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:48.220
because they are far more slower
and ornate melodies with a lot

02:51:48.220 --> 02:51:51.000
of notes being sung
to a single syllable.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:54.990
But it is interesting to go back

02:51:54.990 --> 02:51:59.570
and see what perhaps
this ode may have sounded

02:51:59.570 --> 02:52:03.570
like although alas, we are not
able to reconstruct the melody,

02:52:03.570 --> 02:52:07.560
only the meter and the rhythm
which we are able to do,

02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:11.950
thanks to the pioneering
work of Elia Tntesean.

02:52:13.460 --> 02:52:19.300
Now, let us turn to the melody

02:52:19.300 --> 02:52:22.930
that Bianchini was
able to transcribe.

02:52:22.930 --> 02:52:27.160
Before I do so, however, I
should like briefly to refer

02:52:27.160 --> 02:52:31.690
to a little pink slip of paper
that I found bound in the one

02:52:31.690 --> 02:52:33.940
of the Bianchini
manuscripts found

02:52:33.940 --> 02:52:36.490
in the archives of San Lazaro.

02:52:36.490 --> 02:52:39.390
On this occasion, as
on other occasions,

02:52:39.390 --> 02:52:43.290
Bianchini was painstakingly
leaving instructions

02:52:43.290 --> 02:52:46.290
to his singers, probably
Italian singers,

02:52:46.290 --> 02:52:51.170
as to how Armenian sacred
music ought to be performed.

02:52:51.170 --> 02:52:53.640
And his instructions
and by saying

02:52:53.640 --> 02:52:59.000
that if these chants are
performed as they should,

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:03.870
then the result renders
them sublime and celestial

02:53:03.870 --> 02:53:06.950
and that one and the
same time, most pleasing

02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:10.550
to our hearts and to our ears.

02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:13.960
It is daunting having
sighted these words

02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:16.640
to make a feeble attempt to
sing a bit of the melody to you.

02:53:16.640 --> 02:53:21.620
It is not my singing that
will be sublime and celestial

02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:26.200
but I do hope that my singing
notwithstanding the melody may

02:53:26.200 --> 02:53:29.480
perhaps correspond to
such a description.

02:53:29.480 --> 02:53:31.620
There would be only
a little sound bite

02:53:31.620 --> 02:53:35.510
so that we do not miss the
reception this evening.

02:53:35.510 --> 02:56:14.120
[ Music ]

02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:16.620
And it continues in this vein.

02:56:16.620 --> 02:56:18.510
Time is --

02:56:18.510 --> 02:56:26.500
[ Applause ]

02:56:26.500 --> 02:56:28.420
I thank you for the
applause which naturally,

02:56:28.420 --> 02:56:31.630
I take as being directed
to three people,

02:56:31.630 --> 02:56:35.710
Bianchini who transcribed it,
whoever composed the melody,

02:56:35.710 --> 02:56:39.780
and of course, the poet
who composed the words.

02:56:39.780 --> 02:56:41.660
But it is a privilege to serve

02:56:41.660 --> 02:56:47.420
as their advocate in
my very small way.

02:56:47.420 --> 02:56:53.350
Now, a question rose in my mind
as I was preparing this lecture.

02:56:53.350 --> 02:56:56.750
It was very clear to me from
all the materials that I saw

02:56:56.750 --> 02:57:00.190
and from the meticulous
and painstaking nature

02:57:00.190 --> 02:57:03.130
of the transcription of
this beautiful manuscript

02:57:03.130 --> 02:57:07.070
and the general care that had
been taken in its production

02:57:07.070 --> 02:57:10.480
on the part of Bianchini
and it is abundantly obvious

02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:14.440
that this man was enamored
of Armenian sacred music

02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:19.110
into which he had immersed
himself in a very, very big way.

02:57:19.110 --> 02:57:20.590
And although he had
a very active

02:57:20.590 --> 02:57:24.670
and distinguished career writing
a lot of pieces in the tradition

02:57:24.670 --> 02:57:28.240
of his day -- non-Armenian
pieces, of course --

02:57:28.240 --> 02:57:31.520
I wondered if there
could be some means

02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:34.570
of finding any possible
connections might he have been

02:57:34.570 --> 02:57:39.900
somehow influenced by his
immersion into the sound world

02:57:39.900 --> 02:57:43.510
of these ancient Armenian
chants and their modality

02:57:43.510 --> 02:57:47.720
in his compositions
in a western style.

02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:51.500
Alas, most of his pieces are
unpublished and one needs

02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:53.610
to travel to all sorts
of places in Italy

02:57:53.610 --> 02:57:56.610
and gradually uncover them,
something that God willing,

02:57:56.610 --> 02:57:59.550
I should very much like
to do in future years.

02:57:59.550 --> 02:58:04.180
But upon conducting the
Bianchini Symphonia of 1863

02:58:04.180 --> 02:58:06.580
and remember, it
was composed a year

02:58:06.580 --> 02:58:12.350
after Bianchini published this
ode in a little booklet in 1862,

02:58:12.350 --> 02:58:14.150
only a year previously.

02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:18.620
After having conducted the
piece, I looked at the score

02:58:18.620 --> 02:58:23.770
and then I was struck
by what one might refer

02:58:23.770 --> 02:58:26.650
to as a little oddity.

02:58:26.650 --> 02:58:29.260
The melody that I
sang of the ode,

02:58:29.260 --> 02:58:31.510
it has a very characteristic
motif.

02:58:31.510 --> 02:58:41.640
[ Music ]

02:58:41.640 --> 02:58:46.310
And this occurs twice
in the first stanza

02:58:46.310 --> 02:58:50.090
and another two occasions
in the second stanza.

02:58:50.090 --> 02:58:52.440
And it tends to linger in
the mind, at least it stayed

02:58:52.440 --> 02:58:54.510
in my mind when I first
looked at the ode.

02:58:54.510 --> 02:59:01.040
[ Music ]

02:59:01.040 --> 02:59:04.350
And yet, you will recall that
the symphony that we heard,

02:59:04.350 --> 02:59:07.510
the Symphonia with which
we started has the theme --

02:59:07.510 --> 02:59:13.060
[ Music ]

02:59:13.060 --> 02:59:15.920
Now, if we forget about
the rhythm and just look

02:59:15.920 --> 02:59:17.720
at the notes and the skeleton --

02:59:17.720 --> 02:59:24.490
[ Music ]

02:59:24.490 --> 02:59:29.470
-- it is almost identical to
that of the motif in the ode.

02:59:29.470 --> 02:59:33.420
This is pure speculation on
my part, ladies and gentlemen.

02:59:33.420 --> 02:59:37.460
It might be just the
fancy but I like to think

02:59:37.460 --> 02:59:40.100
that subconsciously possibly,

02:59:40.100 --> 02:59:44.120
this motif from [Inaudible]
may have lingered

02:59:44.120 --> 02:59:47.330
in Bianchini's mind
and somehow re-emerged

02:59:47.330 --> 02:59:50.050
as the theme of this Symphonia.

02:59:50.050 --> 02:59:53.490
I don't know if this
is indeed the case.

02:59:53.490 --> 02:59:56.390
We're not in a position
to ask the master

02:59:56.390 --> 03:00:00.050
but it's an intriguing
thought nonetheless.

03:00:00.050 --> 03:00:03.960
I should like to end by
saying that this was an age

03:00:03.960 --> 03:00:10.680
of cultural titans, people like
Lewond Alisan, [Inaudible],

03:00:14.070 --> 03:00:17.330
many others, Elia Tntesean
-- Bianchini himself,

03:00:17.330 --> 03:00:19.990
I would also put
in that category.

03:00:19.990 --> 03:00:24.800
And it was an exciting era not
only because of an awakening

03:00:24.800 --> 03:00:27.830
on the part of the Armenians
but because of the very,

03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:31.380
very beautiful fruits
that emerged as the result

03:00:31.380 --> 03:00:34.970
of the interaction between
Armenian and European cultures.

03:00:34.970 --> 03:00:38.590
And this happened
not only in music.

03:00:38.590 --> 03:00:42.450
It happened in terms of
spirituality and theology.

03:00:42.450 --> 03:00:45.080
It happened in literature
particularly

03:00:45.080 --> 03:00:47.570
in poetry as we all know.

03:00:47.570 --> 03:00:51.720
And this manuscript
documents precisely that.

03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:54.870
It exemplifies and embodies
one of those fruits,

03:00:54.870 --> 03:00:57.770
a Venetian Italian
music transcribing

03:00:57.770 --> 03:00:59.520
into western notation

03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:04.000
and harmonizing an
ancient Armenian ode.

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:07.920
Had he not transcribed it, we
would probably have lost it

03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:10.460
because this melody is not known

03:01:10.460 --> 03:01:15.250
to the San Lazaro
monks at present.

03:01:15.250 --> 03:01:19.650
And this manuscript is like
a diamond that sheds light

03:01:19.650 --> 03:01:22.370
in all sorts of direction
suggesting avenues

03:01:22.370 --> 03:01:24.110
for future research.

03:01:24.110 --> 03:01:27.750
And I feel so very
fortunate and blessed

03:01:27.750 --> 03:01:31.940
that this manuscript has
been preserved and these kept

03:01:31.940 --> 03:01:35.810
at the Library of Congress
for our own generation

03:01:35.810 --> 03:01:40.530
and future generations
to study and to enjoy.

03:01:40.530 --> 03:01:42.830
And moreover, it is here

03:01:42.830 --> 03:01:46.340
where it is really disseminated
electronically to anyone

03:01:46.340 --> 03:01:49.960
who may care to have a look at
it which is something that is

03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:52.980
of very great value and which
the Library of Congress shares

03:01:52.980 --> 03:01:55.400
with the National
Library of Armenia.

03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:59.710
And I feel above all, a
tremendous and profound debt

03:01:59.710 --> 03:02:02.430
of gratitude to Dr.
Levon Avdoyan,

03:02:02.430 --> 03:02:06.510
thanks to whose excellent
nose for such things

03:02:06.510 --> 03:02:10.380
and unerring instinct
and his untiring efforts,

03:02:10.380 --> 03:02:12.770
this manuscript has
been acquired

03:02:12.770 --> 03:02:15.260
by the Library of Congress.

03:02:15.260 --> 03:02:19.200
So please accept my
gratitude for this as well

03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:25.160
as many other things of which
today's unique conference is

03:02:25.160 --> 03:02:26.460
but one.

03:02:26.460 --> 03:02:30.450
In thanking Levon, I should
also like to thank a number

03:02:30.450 --> 03:02:34.220
of other individuals
and these institutions

03:02:34.220 --> 03:02:38.000
without whose generosity
and kindness,

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:41.350
this research would
not have been possible.

03:02:41.350 --> 03:02:42.650
Thank you very much indeed

03:02:42.650 --> 03:02:44.510

has actually flown by for me.

03:02:58.860 --> 03:03:02.150
It's been a combination of
several months of planning.

03:03:02.150 --> 03:03:06.940
I would truly want to thank all
of my speakers, our speakers,

03:03:06.940 --> 03:03:11.260
some of whom have come
from long distances abroad

03:03:11.260 --> 03:03:13.740
and are going to leave sadly.

03:03:13.740 --> 03:03:18.800
It is -- people who know me,

03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:21.840
I usually just say thank
you if I'm not pleased.

03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:25.740
What I am going to say is
true in every single case

03:03:25.740 --> 03:03:27.260
which is each and every one

03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:30.470
of these papers has
exceeded my expectations

03:03:30.470 --> 03:03:33.660
of what I hoped would happen.

03:03:33.660 --> 03:03:37.040
And I hope those of you who have
lasted all day, will go away

03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:39.650
with what I wanted you to feel

03:03:39.650 --> 03:03:44.130
which is Armenian
history is extremely more

03:03:44.130 --> 03:03:47.470
than just a few isolated facts.

03:03:47.470 --> 03:03:48.850
So thank you for attending.

03:03:48.850 --> 03:03:51.280
Thank you for my
wonderful speakers.

03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:54.910
And I hope you will all attend
the Smithsonian Folk Life

03:03:54.910 --> 03:03:56.750
Festival in the next two weeks

03:03:56.750 --> 03:03:59.640
and enjoy Armenian culture
on a different plane.
