00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.470
&gt;&gt; It is my pleasure and
honor to yield the floor

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.510
to the great Tom Friedman.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.890
[ Applause ]

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.790
&gt;&gt; Thomas L. Friedman: Thank
you, I really appreciate that.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.790
Thank you.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.090
Thank you very much.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.190
Wow, it's great to do
a neighborhood concert.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.470
This is fantastic.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.770
Marty, thank you.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.730 position:56%
We are in a golden age of journalism
at least as regards to 2 newspapers,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.500
the New York Times and
the Washington Post.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:50.260 position:56%
We are going at it every day and one
of the people centrally responsible

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.640
for that golden age is
Marty Baron and it's,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.340
it's an honor for me to
be introduced by him.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.860
And if you would silence your
cellphones or put them on stun,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.400
I'll be forever grateful.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.220
So, thank you for being late.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.330
An optimist guy de-thriving
in the age of acceleration.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.640
First question I always get from
people when they hear the title

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.150
of the book is where from comes the
title, Thank You for Being Late.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.210
And it actually comes
from meeting people

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.320
in Washington D.C,
I live in Bethesda.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.050
For breakfast, I like too
not waste not waste breakfast

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.490
when I'm downtown eating alone,
I like to learn from someone

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.830
so I often organize business
breakfast and every one

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.760
in a while someone comes in 15
minutes late and they say; Tom,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.160
I'm really sorry, it was
the weather, the traffic,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.370 position:56%
the subway, the dog ate my homework.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.400
And one day, over 3 years ago,
now, my friend Peter Corsell,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.690
energy entrepreneur came, we
were meeting at the Hey Adams,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.890
he came a few minutes
late, said the usual; Tom,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.820
I'm really sorry the weather,
the traffic, the subway,

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.610
the dog out my homework, and I
just spontaneously said to him;

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.670
actually Peter, thank
you for being late.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.530 position:56%
Because, you're late, I've been
eavesdropping on their conversation.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.780
Fascinating.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.390
I've been people watching the
lobby, fantastic, and best of all,

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.320
best of all, I just connected
2 ideas I've been struggling

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.010
with for a month, so
thank you for being late.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.580
People started to get into it,
they'd say, well you're welcome,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.050
because they understood I was
actually giving them permission

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.660
to pause, to slow down, to reflect.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.140
My favorite quote from the front
of the book is from my teacher

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.040
and friend Dov Seidman
who says, you know,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.560
when you press the pause
button on a computer it stops,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.400
but when you press the pause
button on a human being, it starts.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.740
That's when it starts to reflect,
rethink and reimagine, and boy,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.850
don't we need to do
a lot of that now.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.840
Now this book, thank you.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.950
This book actually was triggered
when I paused and engaged

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.040
with someone I wouldn't
normally engage with.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.350
So, as I said, I live in
Bethesda, Maryland with my wife Ann

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.620
and about once a week I take the
subway to work, and so for me,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.440
that means driving
from the Bethesda,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.580
from our home on Bradley
Boulevard to the Bethesda Hyatt.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.940
I park in the basement
of the Bethesda Hyatt,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.070
in the public parking garage there
and I take the Red Line into D.C.,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.280 position:56%
down to the New York Times office,
not far from the white house and low

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.000
of 3 years ago, now I did that.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.720
I parked my car, took the Red Line
in, spent the day at the office,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.360
took the Red Line back, got
in my car, time stamp ticket,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.210
drove to the cashier's booth,
handed it to the cashier.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.950
I looked at him looked at me
and said I know who you are.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.660
I said great.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.960
He said I read your column.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.930
I said, great, parking
guy reads my column.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.100
He said, I don't always agree,
I thought, get me out of here.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.570
But, I actually said well that's
good, it means you always have

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.400
to check then and I drove off
thinking it's great the parking guy

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.990
reads my column.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.760
Anyways, a week later, I took my
weekly trip into D.C. by subway,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.750
parking garage, Red Line, office,
Red Line back, parking garage, car,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.950
time stamp ticket, cashier's
booth, same guy's there.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.000
This time he says, Mister Friedman,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.510
I have my own blog,
would you read my blog.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:50.080
I thought, oh my god, the
parking guy is now my competitor.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.680
What just happened?

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.450
So, I said look, right it
down and I'll look it up.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.400
So, he tore off a piece
of receipt paper

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.000
and he wrote on it odenoby.com.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.460
I got home, I call, told Ann,
I called it up on my computer.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.740
Turns out he's Ethiopian,
wrote about,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.960
was writing about Ethiopian
politics from the perspective

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.760
of the Aroma people, a
real democracy advocate

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.860
and it was pretty good,
it was a pretty good blog.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.960
I thought about him for a few days

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.570 position:56%
and I eventually concluded this was
a sign from god, that I should pause

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.820
and engage this guy, but
I didn't have his email,

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.620
so the only way I could
do it was park

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.220
in the parking garage every day.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.920
So, that took 3 or 4 days.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.200
I don't remember how long
anymore, but we overlap one morning

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.750
at 7 A.M. I parked under the
gate so it couldn't come down,

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.660 position:56%
I got out of my car and I said Elia,
now I know his name, Elia Bojerre.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.840
Elia, I would like your email,
I'd like to send you a message,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.550
which he gladly gave me and that
night we began an email exchange.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.090
I've saved them all and most
of them are in the front

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.600
of book, they're kind of funny.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.190
But, I basically said
to him, in essence,

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.250
I have a proposition for you.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.350
I will teach you how to write a
column for the New York Times,

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.770 position:56%
if you will tell me your life story.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.700
And he basically said, I see your
proposing a deal, I like this deal.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.750
So, he asked that we meet near
his office out in Bethesda

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.300
at Pete's Coffeehouse
across from the Hyatt.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.990
Pete's has since sent me a gift
certificate for putting them

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.250
in the book, which
we did 2 weeks later.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.570
And I came with a 6-page
memo on how to write a column

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.330
and he came with his life story.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.240
His life story as an economics
grad from [inaudible] university

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.680
in Addis Ababa, was a political
activist, a democracy advocate.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.480
His democracy activism eventually
earned him a one-way ticket

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.220
out of Ethiopia.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.870
We welcomed here, him
here in our country

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.210
as a political exile,
yes, we did that.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:22.220
And, and he told me he was
blogging on Ethiopian websites,

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.950
different ones, but they wouldn't
turn his stuff fast around,

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.690
turn stuff around fast enough,
so eventually he decided

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:33.810
to start his own blog and now
Mr. Friedman, I feel empowered.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.060
His good metrics say he's read
in 30 different countries,

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.340
he's my parking guy and
it's a wonderful story

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.750
and he's a wonderful man of how
anyone today can participate

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:51.530
in the global conversation and
he taught me so much about that

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.710 position:56%
and about his own country, Ethiopia.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.020
Well I then presented
him with a 6-page memo

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.770
on how to write a column.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.880
So, if the world is a big data
problem, this is my algorithm,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.880
this how I go about
cutting through it.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.200
And I thought about some of this
before, but I never put it together

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.690 position:56%
until I did it in the memo for Elia.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.620
I basically explained to him that
a news story is meant to inform

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.850
and it can do so, better or worse.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:22.150
The post tomorrow will write
a story about this festival

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:27.200
and Marty will tell whether they
did better or worse, but a column,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.110
an opinion article,
is meant to provoke,

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.420
it's meant to produce a reaction.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.430
So, I'm either in the
heating business

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.930
or the lighting business,
that's what I do.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.370
I'm either doing a heating or
a lighting, I'm either stoking

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.510
up an emotion in you or I'm
illuminating something for you

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.500
and if I really do it well,
I do both and create heat

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.720
and light and a reaction.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.910
And I can tell if I
created heat or light

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.490
by the reaction I get from readers.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.360
Some might read your column
and say, I didn't know that,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.410
that's a good reaction,
you created some light.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.820
Some might say, never looked at it
that way, that's a good reaction,

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.500
I never connected those things,
more light, your favorite,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.850
you live for this as a column.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.420
This happens 4 times
a year, Mr. Friedman,

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.880
you said exactly what I
felt but didn't know how

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.550
to say, God, God bless you.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:23.500
I want to kill you dead, you and
all your offspring, I get that.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.000
That's usually heat
and light also, okay.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.500
So, but I explained to Elia
to produce heat and light,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.510
actually required a
chemical reaction

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.430
and you had to combine 3 chemicals.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.610
The first is what is your value
set, what are the set of ides,

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.410
values and principles you're
promoting in the world.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.110
Are you a communist, a capitalist,
a neo-comm, a neo-liberalist,

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.060
libertarian, a [inaudible],
a Marxist, what are the set

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.130
of values you're pushing?

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.810
Second, how do you
think the machine works.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.430
So, the machine is my shorthand

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.100
for what are the biggest forces
shaping more things in more places

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.030
in more ways in more days.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:10.490
As a columnist, I'm always carrying
around in my head a working theory

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.470
of how the big gears and
pullies of the world work.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.910
Why? Because I'm trying to take
my values and push the machine

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.840
in their direction and if I
don't know how the machine works,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.120
I either won't push or I'll
push it in the wrong direction.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.190
And in many ways, all my
books have been an exploration

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.150
about how the machine works.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.250
Lastly, what have you learned
about people and culture?

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.670
How the machine effects
different people and culture

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.220
and how they come back
and affect the machine,

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.500
because there's no
column without people

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.600
and there's no people
without culture.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:51.070
Stir those 3 together, mix it up,
let it rise, bake for 45 minutes

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.920
and if you do it right,
you will produce a column

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.270
that produces heat or light.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:02.020
Well, the more I engage with
Elia on this, we had 3 sessions

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:07.180
at Pete's Coffeehouse and
several emails in between.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.800
The more I step back
and would say to him,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.980
well that's what a column is
about, what's my value set.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.700 position:56%
Those of you who read me know that I
have a rather quirky set of values.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.370
I'm not quite liberal, I'm
certainly not a conservative,

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.710
that's because my values
actually emerge

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:29.770
from the small community I grew up
with in Minnesota in the 1950's,

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:35.230
60's and 70's, at a time and
place where politics works.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.730
And that had a huge
impact on me, to this day.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.590
How do I think the machine works
today and what have I learned

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.350
about people and culture
and I decided

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.960 position:56%
that was the book I wanted to write.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.830
And that's what Thank You
for Being Late is all about.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.490 position:56%
The first half is about how the
machine works and the second half is

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:01.040
about how this machine, today,
is not just changing your world,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.370
it's reshaping your world.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.980
And it's reshaping 5 realms
in particular, the work place,

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:13.660
politics, geopolitics,
ethics, and community.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.140
So, let me try to give
you a quick run through.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.810
How does the machine work today?

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.840
Well I think what is shaping more
things in more places in more ways

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.060
and more days is the fact
that we're in the middle

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.670
of 3 non-linear accelerations,
all at the same time,

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:37.060
with the 3 largest forces on the
planet, which I call the market,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.490
mother nature, and Moore's law.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:46.650
And I should tell you that I mixed
these 3 together for a reason.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:51.150
One of my teachers in
this book, Linwells,

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.680
something he's really taught
me, which is, I think essential

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.110
to doing proper journalism
today, is never think in the box

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.250
and never think out of the box,

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.900
today you must think
without a box, okay.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.870
You need to be melding all of
these disparate things together

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.890
and in my case, they're the market,
mother nature, and Moore's law.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.970
So, the market for me is
digital globalization,

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.030
not your grandfather's
globalization, that was containers

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.520
on ships, planes and trains.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.530
If you chart that today, it's
actually flat to going down,

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.740
but digital globalization, the
way everything is being digitized

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.810 position:56%
and globalized, whether it's through
Facebook or Amazon, or Google

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.530
or Twitter or Paypal or Mooks,

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.560
if you put that on a
graph it looks like,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.980
looks like a giant hockey stick.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.860
Mother nature for me is climate
change, biodiversity loss,

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.530
and population growth in
the developing worlds.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.800
If you put that on a graph,
it looks like a hockey stick.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.470
And Moore's law, get that first
slide up here for a second,

00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:00.790
coined by Gordon Moore, the
co-founder of Intel in 1965.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:04.150
Gordon Moore, positive,
that the speed and power

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.600
of microchips would double
roughly every 24 months

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.710
and the price would
stay roughly the same.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:18.280 position:56%
Moore's law has held up for 52 years

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:24.240
and it is the engine driving
all technological change today,

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.720
because Moore Moore's law
drives more globalization,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.420
more globalization drives
more climate change.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.810
Now, about once a year
for the last 52 years,

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.980
someone has written an article
saying, Moore's law is over,

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.970
it's going to run out and for
52 years, what they all have

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.970
in common, is they were all wrong.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.480
Moore's law is alive and well,
it's now about 30 months,

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.060
but your computer at home
now, is probably operating

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:54.840
on an intel workhorse
chip that's a 14-nm chip.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:01.220
It has 37.5 million transistors
per square millimeter,

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.340
you cannot see them, at the end
of 2017, Intel will introduce its,

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.720
under Moore's law,
10 nanometer chip.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.500
It will have 100 million
transistors per square millimeter.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.590
Now I know that's very abstract,
hard to conceive what that means.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.830
Basically, what it
means is, the difference

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.670
between those 2 chips
is the difference

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.780
between a self-driving car
that needs to whole trunk

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.290
to contain the brains of that
car, so it can drive itself,

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.110
and a self-driving car that
will just need a little box

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.970
under the front seat.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:40.910
So, if you think your world is fast
now, wait till the end of the year.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.930
In fact, Intel's engineers
wants to try

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.000 position:56%
to explain the power of Moore's law.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.610
One step back and said what if a
1971 Volkswagen Beatle had improved

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.960
at the same rate microchips have,
what would it be like today.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:03.260
And they calculated that that 1971
VW Beatle today would go 300,000

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.390
miles an hour, it would get
2 million miles per gallon

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.100
and it would cost 4 cents.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:16.070
You'd be able to drive it your
entire life on one tank of gas.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.370
That is the power

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:23.790
of the technological
exponential now driving our lives.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.150
So, my chapter though, on Moore's
law, and I'm really just going

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.710
to talk about that today, not
the climate and the market.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:36.760
My chapters actually called,
What the hell happened in 2007?

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.130
What the hell happened in 2007?

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.430
What's this guy talking about?

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.510
2007, such an innocuous year.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.740
Well here's what happened in 2007.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.880
The year was kicked
off in January of 2007,

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.540
when one Steve Jobs introduced
this, the first Iphone

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.710
at the Moscone Center in San
Francisco, beginning a process

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.270
by which we're about half way
through putting one of these

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:07.400
into the hands of virtually,
well we're about half way now,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.200
to everyone on the planet.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.930
That is a handheld computer
with more compute power in it

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:17.940
than the Apollo Space Mission that
doubles as a phone and a camera.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.310
That's how the year began.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:25.850
But in 2007, a company
called Facebook,

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.390
which had been previously confined
to high schools and universities,

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.660
in late 2006, opened
its platform to anyone

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.070
with a registered email address.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.160
And in 2007, Facebook went global.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.620
In 2007 a company called
Twitter split off

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.500
on its own independent
platform and went global.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.790
In 2007, the most important
software you may have never heard

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:54.830
of called Hadoop, named after
the founder's son's toy elephant,

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.770
launched its algorithm
into the wild.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.600
Hadoop is what enables a million
computers to work together

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.630
as if they're one, seamlessly,

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.360
that's actually I think
we call it big data now.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.700
Hadoop actually didn't
invent the algorithms,

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.130
it's based on 2 algorithms invented
by google called [inaudible]

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.810 position:56%
and MapReduce, but as the founder of
Hadoop, Doug Cutting, explains to me

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.310
in the book, Google
lives in the future

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:22.040
and sends us letters back home, and
what google did was leave a trail

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.950
of breadcrumbs to the open
source software community

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.410
of its algorithms, they
reverse engineered it,

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.600
Hadoop is the public version of
it, there isn't a major company

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.070
in Washington D.C that
isn't somewhere

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.950
in the background running Hadoop.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.870
In 2007, the second most important
software you may have never heard

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.540
of called VMware went public.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.240 position:56%
VMware is what enables any operating
system to work on any computer.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.600
Well you're used to that now,

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.970
but that actually was
very unique back then

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.460
and that's what enables
Cloud computing.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.230
So, we can have all
these commodity servers

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.540
and anyone can run any
operating system on them.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:01.010
In 2007, a company called
GitHub, the world's, now largest,

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:05.600
repository for open-source
software, opened its doors.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.800
In 2007, this company called Google
bought a little know T.V. company

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.930
called YouTube.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.840
And in 2007, Google
launched its own algorithm

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.660
into the wild called Android.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:23.310
In 2007, Marty's boss Jeff Bezos
introduced the world's first e-book

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.640
reader, called the Kindle.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.490
And in 2007, IBM started the
world's first cognitive computer

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.350
called Watson.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.040
In 2007, 3 design students
in San Francisco,

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.400
were attending a design
conference that year

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.090
and they noticed all the
hotel rooms were sold out,

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.900
but one of them had 3 spare
air mattresses and they decided

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.220
to rent them out to people
who couldn't get hotel rooms

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.600
and it worked out so well, in 2007,

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.760
they started a company
called Airbnb.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:00.890
That's why it's called Airbnb,
because of the 3 air mattresses.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.850
In 2007, the internet crossed a
billion users for the first time,

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.760
it was actually late 2006,
really scaled in 2007.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.830
Here's what else happened in
2007, this is a graph for the cost

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.420
of sequencing a human genome.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.990
So, for those of you in the
back who can't see, in 2001,

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.920
it cost us 100 million dollars to
sequence a human genome, in 2006,

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.620
it fell to 10 million and then
you'll notice in 1 year it goes

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.820
over a cliff, like an EKG
heading for a heart attack,

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.230
that year is 2007, the price

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:38.630
of sequencing a human
genome collapses to $10,000.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:43.120
In 2007, solar energy took off.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.710
As did a process for
extracting a natural gas

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.030
from tight shale called fracking.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:54.450 position:56%
Between 2006 and 2008, America's
total natural gas reserves increased

00:20:54.450 --> 00:21:02.890
35%, that is a spectacular
number in 2007.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.750
This is a graph of what
social networks look like.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:10.440
So, that white line over on the
left that's actually the cost

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.380
of generating a megabit of data.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.950 position:56%
You'll notice the line goes straight
down in, what year is that, 2007.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.760
And then the blue line is the
speed of transmitting that data,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.260
you'll notice the 2
lines cross in 2008,

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:29.590
close enough for government work.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.800
Oh yeah, I forgot the Cloud.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.490
This thing we call the Cloud,
it was born in 2007, first year,

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.500
the statistics show up as 2008.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.320
In 2007, Intel for the
first time, went off silicon

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.100
to extend Moore's law and
introduce non-silicon materials

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.400
into its microchips.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:53.250
In 2005, Michael Dell, the
founder of Dell Computers retired

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:59.270
and in 2007, he decided he
better come back to work.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:05.080
Turns out friends, 2007 may be
understood in time as surely,

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.510
one of the greatest technological
inflection points since Gutenberg.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.750
And always remember,
someone was alive

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:19.280 position:56%
when Gutenberg invented the printing
press and surely some monk turned

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.520
to some priest and said, now
that is really cool, okay.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.690
You mean I don't have to write all
these bibles out long hand anymore,

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.450
we can just stamp them out.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:35.900
Well I think you were alive at a
similar inflection point in 2007,

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:40.270
unfortunately we all
completely missed it.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.270
Why? Because of 2008.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:48.020
So, right when our physical
technologies just took off,

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.040
like we're on a moving sidewalk
in an airport that went from 5

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.200
to 50 miles per hour,
right when that happened,

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.820
all of our social technologies,
the regulatory reform,

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:01.150
the political reform, the manager
reform, the learning reform,

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.640
you'd want to go with
it, all completely froze

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.220
because we entered the
deepest recession since 1929.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:15.830
And in that dislocation, many
Brexit and Trump voters were born.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.390
You cannot understand what's going

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.970
on if you don't understand
that disjunction.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.570
So, what happened in 2007?

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:27.800
Well, I argue what happened is your
computer basically is 5 key parts,

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.830
it's got that processor chip,
it's got a storage chip,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.940
it's got networking, it's got
software and it's got a sensor.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.360
And what I trace in the book is
how 5 are actually in a Moore's law

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.320
and what happened in 2007,
is they all melded together

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.200
into this thing we call the Cloud.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.600
The Cloud.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:54.330
But I never use the term the Cloud
in my book, because it sounds

00:23:54.330 --> 00:24:00.740
so soft, so fluffy,
so cuddly, so nice,

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.200
sounds like a Joanie Mitchell song.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.880
I've looked at clouds
from both sides.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.950
This ain't no cloud
folks, what I call it

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:15.330
in the book is the supernova.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.980
Those of you who are science fans
know the supernova is actually the

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:24.710
largest energy force in nature,
it's the explosion of a star.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:30.150 position:56%
And I think what happened in 2007,
was a release of energy in the hands

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.290
of men, women and machines,
the likes of which,

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:39.540 position:56%
we have never seen before, and it
overnight, changed 4 kinds of power.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.120
First it changed the power of
1, what 1 person can do today

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.840 position:56%
as a maker or a breaker is amplified

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.400
to a degree we have
never seen before.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.800
We have a president who can sit
in his pajamas in the West Wing

00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.550
and tweet to a billion people,
directly, without an editor,

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.340
a liable lawyer or a filter.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:12.810
Okay, so. But, but here's,
here's what's really scary,

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:19.080
the caliph of Isis can do the
exact same thing from his bunker

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.010
in Raqqa Province in Syria.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:26.600 position:56%
The power of 1 today to be a maker
or breaker is fundamentally changed.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.130
The power of machines have changed.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:32.770 position:56%
Machines are acquiring all 5 senses.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.820
We have never lived in a world
where machines had all 5 sense

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:46.780
and as a result, machines can now
analyze, optimize, prophesize,

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:51.100
customize and automatize anything.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.400
They can analyze, they can find the
needle in the haystack of that data

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.940
as the norm now, not the exception.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.890
They can optimize, they can tell
United Airlines exactly what

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.660
altitude to fly that GE engine
for every mile of its flight

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.570
to get the premium
energy efficiency.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.230
They can prophesize.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.600 position:56%
Oh, you've seen the IBM Watson add,
the repairman comes to the building,

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.800 position:56%
says I'm here to repair the elevator

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.160
and the guy says the
elevator's not broken

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.440
and the repairman says I know,
but it will be in 6 weeks.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.240 position:56%
Because with big data, we know that.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.640
We can customize just for
you and we can now digitize

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.800
and automatize everything
and anything.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.900
That is a new world, one
we've never inhabited before.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.900
We kind of cross that line, I
would argue, in February 2011

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.240
on all places, a game show.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.740
There were 3 contestants, 2 we're
the all-time Jeopardy champions

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:51.830
and the 3rd contestant simply
went by his last name Mr. Watson.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.790
Mr. Watson passed on
the first question,

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.890
but he buzzed in before
the two humans

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:58.880
on the second question,
see if you can get it.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.240 position:56%
The question was, it's worn on the
foot of a horse and used by a dealer

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.300
in a casino, and in under
2.5 seconds, Mr. Watson said,

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:11.410
in perfect Jeopardy
style, what is a shoe.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.090
And for the first time,
we watched live on T.V,

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:20.040
a cognitive computer figure out
a pun faster than 2 human beings

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.100
and the world kind of
hasn't been the same since.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.180
It's changed the power of flows,
ideas now flow, circulate, meld,

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.570
fracture, and change faster
than we've ever seen before.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:37.190 position:56%
Confederate statues were up for, you
know, a century and a half and bam,

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.190
one day, we decided to take
them down and they're all gone.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:46.600 position:56%
Barack Obama ran 6 years ago, saying
marriage between a man and a woman,

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.910
today blessedly so, he says
marriage is between any 2 humans

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:54.060
who love each other and he
followed Ireland in that opinion.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.950
Ideas now flow and
change and congeal

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.410
at a pace we've never seen before.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:02.160
And lastly, it's changed
the power of many.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.170
These amplified powers of men,
women, and machines have become

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:10.860
so great that we have become the
biggest foresting function on

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.550
and in nature and that's why the
new climate era has been named

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.050
for us, the Anthropocene.

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.540
Well the argument I make in this
book, is that these 4 changes

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.670
in power, they're not
just changing your world,

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:31.400 position:56%
they are reshaping your world and
that requires fundamental rethinking

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:37.020
of everything and they're reshaping
5 realms; politics, geopolitics,

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.840
ethics, the community
and the workplace.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.210
So, let me spend the next,
I can have with this talk,

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:47.320
talking about what I mean.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:53.630
So, basically the workplace
is being changed

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.520 position:56%
in large part because of this graph.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.570
I was out working on the book,
I was interviewing Astro Teller,

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.190
the CEO of Google EX,
Google's research arm.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.740 position:56%
And I went to see him and I told him
the thesis of the book and he got

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.850
up from his desk and went
over to his whiteboard

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.840
and he drew this very
crude, simple graph.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.740 position:56%
So, the blue line across the middle,

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.750
you'll notice it has a positive
slope, but it's very gradual.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.650
I said, what's that Astro?

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.160
He said, that's the average
rate at which human beings

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.050
and societies adapt
to change over time.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.840
It has a positive slope,
but it's gradual.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.890 position:56%
The white line that starts below and
then loops up, that's technology.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.400
So, if you lived at the left
end of the line in the 11th

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.820
or 12th century, we forget, if
you lived in the 11th century

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.190
or 12th century, your bow
and arrow did not get better

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.740
between the 11th century
and the 12th century.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:49.300
There was no bow and arrow
2.0 in the 12th century, okay.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.660
The line of innovation
was very flat,

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:55.370
but then we got the scientific
revolution, Copernicus and Galileo,

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:58.280
and then Steve Jobs
and Intel, Bill Gates

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.040
and the line starts
to go straight north.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.130
And then Astro drew that
little diamond there,

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.430
and I said what's that Astro.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.630
He said that's where we are.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:10.180
We're at a point now where
technology is evolving faster

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.560
than the average human
being in society can adapt.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.680
Then he went out and got a 3rd
magic marker, it's hard for you

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.080
in the back to see maybe, but,

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.990
and he drew a little dotted
line off the blue line.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.020
And I said what's that Astro?

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.120
He said, that's learning
faster and governing smarter

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:32.070
and that is the challenge
of the workplace today.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.720
How do we enable more people
to learn faster and how

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.540
as a society do we govern smarter
so we can lift the adaptation line

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.290
to meet technology
where it's taking us?

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:47.360
So, let me give you some samples
of what I'm talking about.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.980
So, my chapter in how the workplace
is being reshaped is called How do

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.300
we turn AI into IA.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.000
How do we take artificial
intelligence and turn it

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.210
into intelligent assistance, a, n,
c, e, intelligent assistants, a, n,

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.980
t, s, and intelligent algorithms

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.320
so more people can learn
faster and govern smarter?

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.430
I believe that's the
central managerial governing

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.520
and education challenge
of our time today.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.650
So, I'll give you a
couple of examples.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.050
My examples of intelligent
assistance, ance,

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:24.430
is actually the human
resources department at AT&amp;T.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.890
I spent a lot of time with AT&amp;T,

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:30.450
giant global telecom company
living right next to the supernova,

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.540
competes everyday with
Verizon, Deutsche Telekom,

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.430
and all these great
telecom companies.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:42.840
Pretty good chance that AT&amp;T
with its 360,000 employees,

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.860
whatever is going on in their
human resource department,

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.580
coming to a neighborhood near you.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.250
So, what's going on here?

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.270
Well, this is, in shorthand,
basically what's going on is this;

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.060
their CEO Randall Stephenson
begins the year

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.480
with a radically transparent speech
about where the company is going,

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.860
what markets their going to
be in and what skills you need

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.620
to be an AT&amp;T employee that year.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:11.310
Then they put all 110,000
managers of a non-unionized staff

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:14.000
in their own in-house
LinkedIn system.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.780 position:56%
And so, they've got me in there, you
know, Tom Friedman, Tom Friedman,

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:24.550
and then they determine that there
are, I'm estimating this roughly,

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:28.060
10 different skill sets you
need to be a thriving employee

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.760
and rising employee to AT&amp;T
given where they're going

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.220
as a company in the world today.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.920
And on my LinkedIn
profile, turns out I have 7

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.270 position:56%
of the 10 skills, but I'm missing 3.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.700
Then they partnered with Sebastian
Thrun, the founder of Udacity,

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.080
the online learning university.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.020
He created nanodegrees and
courses for all 10 skill sets.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.540
Then they came back to me and
said Tom, here's the deal,

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:56.800 position:56%
we will give you up to $8,000 a year
to take all the nanodegree courses

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.430
for the skills you're missing, in
fact we heard you're interested

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.990
in the middle east, you we're in,

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:04.170
if you want to take an archaeology
class, in fact if you want

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:07.330
to take our 1 year
master's degree for $6,000

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.720
that we built with Georgia Tech.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.640
we'll pay for that as well.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.260
Just one condition
Tom, one condition.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:18.270
You have to take all these courses
on your own time at night, at home

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:22.080
and on weekends, not
on company time.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.650
Now, if I say, you know, Mr. AT&amp;T,

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:26.900
I've climbed up one too
many telephone poles,

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.450
I'm not into this anymore.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:33.160
They now have a wonderful
severance package for me.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.340
But I won't be working
there much longer.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:41.370 position:56%
If I do take the courses, they're
social contract for their employees,

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:45.970 position:56%
is they will offer them the new jobs
first, they will not go outside.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:50.720
What is AT&amp;T's social contract
with their employees today?

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.040
It's very simple, you can be a
lifelong employee today at AT&amp;T,

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.610
but only if you are
a lifelong learner.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:00.020
If you are not ready to
be a lifelong learner,

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:04.120
you can no longer be a
lifelong employee at AT&amp;T.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:09.090
And that is the social contract
coming to a neighborhood near you.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:12.600
The days when you could go
to college for 2 or 4 years

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.510 position:56%
and then dine out on that knowledge
over the next 30 are completely gone

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.080
in the age of acceleration.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:23.820 position:56%
What you learn now in your 1st year,
may be out of date by your 4th year

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.870
and therefore being a lifelong
learner becomes the single most

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:32.500 position:56%
important competitive advantage you
can have in the age of acceleration.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:37.200
Which is why my friend
Heather McGowan likes to say,

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.860
today never ask your kid what do
you want to be when you grow up,

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.500
because whatever it is,
unless it's a policeman

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.360
or fireman, not going to be there.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.960
Only ask your kid how you
want to be when you grow up.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.610
Will you have an agile
learning mindset,

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.100
will you be predisposed
to lifelong learning.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:59.200
And that's why another
friend of mine Marina Gorbis,

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.580
CEO of the Institute of the
Future in Palo Alto likes to say,

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.150
the biggest divide in the
world we're going into now,

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.010
is no longer the digital divide.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:11.240
We remember the digital divide,
Washington D.C. had internet,

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.090
upstate Maryland didn't, you know,

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:15.730
American had internet,
central Africa didn't.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.970 position:56%
The digital divide is going to be
gone in 5 years if it isn't already,

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.630
and when it's gone, the biggest
divide in the world is going

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:26.900
to be the self-motivation divide.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.690
Who has the self-motivation
to be a lifelong learner

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:35.970 position:56%
after you've left home or graduated
school and mom and dad are not there

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:39.400
to say Tommy, have you
done your homework?

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.060
And I believe one of the things
roiling our society today,

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.860
is this issue of the rising
importance of self-motivation,

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:52.550
because a lot of people were
built to show up to work

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.290
and do what they were told.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:58.610
And by the way, these are good
people, and they built our country.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:02.200
We ask them to show up, we asked
them to do what they were told,

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.140
and they did it, and
they did it damn well,

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.530
but the world has changed now,

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:11.900
and one of the things roiling
the society is the necessity

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.880
of lifelong learning and how
more important self-motivation

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.460
is becoming.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.820
That's my example of
intelligent assistance,

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:24.770 position:56%
my example of intelligent assistant
is the janitorial staff at Qualcomm.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:26.610
So, I spent a lot of
time at Qualcomm

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.820
because I profiled their
founder Irwin Jacobs in the book

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.720 position:56%
for networking and when I was there,

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.640
I discovered that Qualcomm
had taken 6 of their building

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:39.220 position:56%
and they affixed sensors everywhere,
on every door, window, faucet, sink,

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.770
air conditioning, heating
system, computer, light,

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.740
they put sensors everywhere.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.030
And then they beamed all
that data up to the Cloud,

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.590
up to the supernova, and now
they beam it down onto an Ipad

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:54.530
with an incredibly user-friendly
interface for their janitors.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:57.720
So, if I leave my computer on
or a pipe bursts above my head,

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.860
they know it just when I do, if
not faster and they just swipe

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.360
down to see who can fix it or
how to repair it themselves.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:10.310
Qualcomm has turned their janitors
into maintenance technologists.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.930
Their janitors now give
tours to foreign visitors.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:17.740
What do you think that does for the
dignity of a janitor, because he

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:22.020
or she is now and intelligent
assistant, enabling them to live

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.750
and learn at a higher pace?

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:28.040
My example of intelligent
algorithms is the partnership

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.390
between the college
board and Khan Academy,

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.320
the online learning platform.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.690
For free PSAT and SAT prep.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:40.810
Now we all know the
story in 11th grade,

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:45.850
you have to take your PSAT
exam your preparatory SAT exam

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:49.050
to see how well you do and to get
you ready for your SAT exam to get

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.870
into the college of your choice.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:55.700
We all know that many parents will
go out and hire a tutor for $200

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.780
and hour to boost their
kid's PSAT and SAT scores.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:02.520
Don't worry, many of us did it.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.600
A completely rigged game.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.430
A completely rigged game, because
if you come from a neighborhood

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:13.030
or a family that can't
possibly afford such a tutor,

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:14.800
you are at a real disadvantage.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:19.000
So, 3 years ago, David Coleman
of the college board and Sal Khan

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.990
of Khan Academy created
an intelligent algorithm

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:25.760
for free PSAT and SAT prep.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.440
The way it works is I
take my PSAT in 11th grade

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:34.360
and I get the results back and the
results say Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.300
You did really well in
verbal, you could have a career

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.790
in writing maybe, but you
have a problem in math,

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:42.750
in fact you specifically
have a problem

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.580
with fractions and right angles.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:50.040 position:56%
It then takes me to a practice site
just for fractions and right angles,

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.280
just for the things
that I'm weak at,

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.890
doesn't waste any time
on my strength.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.690
If I do well there, it takes
me to another site that says,

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:58.570
you know, you could be in AP math.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:01.090
Me, in AP math?

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:03.640
I don't know anyone who is in AP
math, no one in my neighborhood was

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.460
in AP math, you know,
you could be in AP math.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.560
Another site for college
scholarships and another site

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.290
where young boys and girls
at the boy's and girl's clubs

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:14.350
of America are volunteering
to shepherd other young people

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:16.690
through this intelligent algorithm.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:24.740
Last year, 3,000,000 American
kids got free PSAT and SAT prep

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.690
through this intelligent algorithm.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:33.330
Last example is, is
opportunity at work.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.930
So, we have a real problem in
this country, we have less count,

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:39.690
roughly 32,000,000 people who
started college but never finished.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.950
Some went 1 year, 2, 2 and a
half, 3, 3and a half years.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:46.860
They drop out before they did get a
degree, they go to apply for a job,

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.460
where's your BA, no BA, no job.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.500
So, there are groups
like Opportunity at Work,

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.930
that have come along that will
now, you can come to them,

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:56.920
they will badge what you learned
in 1 year, 2 years, 2 and a half,

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.480
3 year, and they will then partner
with employees to slot you in based

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.730
on what they have determined
you know.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:07.130
So I profile in the book,
Young African American Women,

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:08.760
Lashawn Lewis who is going

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.960
to Michigan Tech studying
computer science.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.110
She had to drop out for
family reasons after three

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.580
and a half years, ended up
having to drive a bus to

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.100
and from computer school,
couldn't make that up,

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.400
and working on the help desk

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.750
at a law firm helping lawyers
rediscover their lost passwords.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:30.310
She was discovered by a group
like Opportunity at work.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.180
They partnered with Mastercard,

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.280
slotted her in as a systems
engineer at Mastercard.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:39.750
Today she is a senior
systems engineer at Mastercard

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:43.540
and in the last line in her
interview in my book she says

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:47.920
and Mr. Freedman, I
still don't have my BA.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.940
That is an intelligent algorithm.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.440
Now, I'm going to make a
bet with every one of you.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:59.970
I'm going to bet none of you
have heard of any of this.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:03.820
And, that's because you
weren't paying attention

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.470
to our last election.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:11.760
You see, the fact is there
is massive innovation going

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:16.410
on in our country on the
pathway of education to work.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:18.430 position:56%
In fact, there's so much innovation,

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:20.600
I thought at one point I could
just write a book on that.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.330
Whatever you can think
of I promise somebody

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.930
in some community is
already doing it,

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.390
it just needs to be
shared and scaled.

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:32.870
Unfortunately, what was
our last election about?

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:36.430
Berny Sander's big idea was
to tear down the big banks.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.540
Donald Trump's big idea was
to tear down Hillary Clinton.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.520
And Hillary Clinton's big
idea was to direct you

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:46.970
to her website
www.hillaryclinton.com.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:52.280
But, the fact is there is
massive innovation going

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:57.090
on around this centrally important
subject of education to work.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:02.110
It touches every home and no
one's telling anyone about it.

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:05.090
So that brings me to my
second world that needs

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.510 position:56%
to be reshaped and that is politics.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.140
So, I use a lot of parallels
from nature in my book

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.070
and my thinking in general.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.390
And, I believe, to think
about politics today you have

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:16.910
to understand that we're
actually in the middle

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:20.100
of three climate changes at once.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.040
We're in the middle of a change
of the climate of the climate.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.010
We're going from what
I all later to now.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:30.300 position:56%
Later, was when I was growing up and
I could fix that lake in Minnesota,

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.440
repair that forest,
save that orangutan,

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.130
I could do it now or later.

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:37.200
Not anymore.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.410
Later is officially over.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:41.600
Later will be too late.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.520
So, whatever you're going to save,
you better think of saving it now.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.160
That's a climate change.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.690
We're in the middle of a change
of the climate of globalization.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.810
We're going from a world
that's interconnected

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.610
to a world that is interdependent.

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:59.550
That's a difference of degree
that's a difference of kind.

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:01.080
The interdepended world,

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.120
your friends can kill you
faster than your enemies.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.980
Oh my God, if Greece and
Italy's banks go bankrupt,

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.320
we'll all feel it here.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.220
Greece and Italy, well
they're in the EU,

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:13.470
they're allies, they
can kill us today.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.560
And, your rivals falling

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.210
in an interdependent world
become more dangerous

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:20.290
than your rivals rising.

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:22.060 position:56%
Frankly, if China takes more islands

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.510
in the South China Sea,
I couldn't care less.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:28.320
If China's growth goes from 0%,

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:34.470
from 6% to 0% this festival
will not be held next year.

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:37.450
That's what happens in
an interdependent world,

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:41.620
your rivals falling becomes more
dangerous than your rivals rising.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.220
That's a climate change.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.570
And lastly, we're going through
this climate change in technology.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:50.220
Machines can now, as I said,
analyze, optimize, prophesy,

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.820
customize, anathematized, anything.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.900
There's a thought about that
and thought about politics.

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.750
I said to myself, well,
if we're going

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:03.790
through all these climate
changes, who can I interview?

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.870
Because, what do you want
when the climate changes?

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:07.200
You want two things.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.510
You want resilience.

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:10.410
You need to be able to take a blow.

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:12.230
But, you also want propulsion.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.530
You want to be able to move ahead.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.630
You don't want to be curled up
in a ball under your bed just

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.700
because three climates
are changing at once.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.700 position:56%
So, as I said, I thought who can I
talk to about how you get resilience

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.400
and propulsion when
the climate changes?

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:31.690
Then, I realized I knew a woman,
she was 3.81 billion years old.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.100
Her name was Mother
Nature and she dealt

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.240
with more climate changes
than anybody.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.330
So, why don't I interview her?

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:44.300 position:56%
So, I called her 800 number, made an
appointment and went out to see her.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.750
I sat her down and
said Mother Nature,

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:51.520 position:56%
how do you produce resilience and
propulsion when the climate changes?

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.050
She said, well Tom,
first of all I have

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:55.390
to tell you everything I
do, I do unconsciously.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:57.120
But, these are my strategies.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.850
She said, first of all
I'm incredibly adaptive.

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:03.130
In my world, only the
adaptive survive.

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:08.560
And I do it through a very brutal
mechanism I call natural selection.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.180
A second, she said, I am
incredibly entrepreneurial.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.670
Wherever I see a blank place in
nature, I fill it with a plant

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:18.820
or animal perfect adapted
to that niche.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:23.140
Lastly she said, thirdly she
said I am incredibly diverse

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.440
and pluralistic.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.770
I love pluralism I try 20
different species and see who wins.

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:29.570
I love diversity.

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:33.030
Fourth, she said, I am incredibly
sustainable, everything is food,

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:37.170
eat food, poop seed, eat food, poop
seed, nothing wasted in my world.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:40.770
Fifth, she said I'm
incredibly hybrid and heterodox.

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:44.920
I try all kinds of ideas
and mix them together,

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.760
mix any birds with any
trees, any flowers any bees,

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.810
any plants with any soils.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:54.490
Lastly, she said, I do believe
in the laws of bankruptcy.

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:56.400
I kill all my failures.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:59.800
I return them to the great
manufacturer in the sky

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.160
and I use their energy
to nourish my successes.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.480
I got it thank you.

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.270
You can, you can put
the sign down, I got it.

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:06.570
Yeah thanks.

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:08.490
Now, thank you.

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:14.630
So, as I thought about
that, it occurred to me

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:16.850
that the political party that's
going to thrive in the age

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:21.450
of acceleration is the one that
most closely mirrors Mother

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:24.050
Nature's strategies.

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:29.070
And, as I thought about that,
I thought, because it was 2016,

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:31.450
why don't I start my
own political party.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:32.980
And so, I created, in the book,

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:37.870
Mother Nature's political
party based on those ideas.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.640
I won't go into the
details with you on that.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.720
But, basically the core
idea is, on some issues,

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:47.380
of course this is all just a
proxy for my own politics, but,

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:51.210
mother nature's actually to
the left of Berny Sanders.

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.390
Mother Nature would be
for universal healthcare.

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:57.560
She would understand that,
in an age of acceleration,

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.010
we need to improve are
safety nets and trampolines

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.940
because more people are going
to find this world too fast.

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.690
But, at the same time, because
she's hybrid and heterodox,

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.990
Mother Nature would be to the right

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:10.130
of the Wall Street
Journal editorial page.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:14.600
She would be for abolishing all
corporate taxes and replacing them

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.300
with a carbon tax, a tax
on sugar, a tax on bullets,

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.120
and a small financial
transaction tax.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.750
Mother Nature would want

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:26.810
to radically stronger
safety nets over here.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.120
And, to pay for them, she'd want

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:32.090
to get radically entrepreneurial
over here.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:34.100
Unfortunately, in our politics,

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.170
if you're for stronger
safety nets you're never

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:39.430 position:56%
for radical entrepreneurship, if
you're for radical entrepreneurship,

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.380
you're never for stronger
safety nets.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.460
What would Mother Nature call that?

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.230
Stupid, that's what
she would call it.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:49.380
She would tell you, you
could never build resilience

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.010
and propulsion that way.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:53.660
I won't spend any more on politics.

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.270
Quickly the last two areas
and I finish with this

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:57.760
that need to be reshaped.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.750
The first is ethics.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:01.430
You're thinking ethics,
ethics what does

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:03.230
that have to do with Moore's law?

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:05.960
Well, thank you.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.740
My chapter on this
subject is called Is God

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:13.710 position:56%
in Cyberspace, Is God in Cyberspace.

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.250 position:56%
And, it actually comes from the best
question I ever got on book tour

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:18.740
in 1999 on the Portland Oregon.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.010
And the man stands
up in the balcony,

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:22.870
I'm selling a book called
Lexus and the Olive Tree

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:25.050
and he says Mr. Friedman
I have a question.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:27.880
Is God in cyberspace?

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.980
And, I said ah, ah, ah.

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.430
I have no idea.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:36.900
So, I got home, I called
my spiritual teacher,

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.330
he's a rabbi Saint Mark,
he's a great Talmudist I met

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:41.540
at the Hartman Institute
in Jerusalem and now lives

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.360
in Amsterdam married to a Dutch
priest, interesting character,

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:49.370
I said [inaudible] I got a
question I've never had before.

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:51.830
Is God in cyberspace?

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:54.080
What should I have answered.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.880
And, he said Tom, well
basically in our faith tradition,

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.050
we have two concepts
of the Almighty.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:03.270
One is that He's Almighty, He
smites evil and rewards good.

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.790
If that's your view of God He sure
isn't in cyberspace which is full

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:09.120
of pornography, gambling,
cheating, lying, prevarication

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:13.040
and now we know fake news, okay.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.340
But, he said fortunately, we
have a postbiblical view of God

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.670
which says God manifests
Himself by how we behave.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:21.670
So, if we want God
to be in cyberspace,

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:25.340
we have to bring Him there
by how we behave there.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:29.010
Only we can bring God
into cyberspace.

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:32.310
Well, as I thought about that,
put it in the paperback edition

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:34.960
of my book Lexus and the Olive
Tree, it sat there for 20 years

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.310
where none of you saw it.

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:38.250
And, and there it was.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:39.650 position:56%
Anyways, I started writing this book

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:44.810
and suddenly I start asking
myself that question again.

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:46.990
I said why are you
asking that question?

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:50.840
And, the answer immediately became
clear to me, it's for two reasons,

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.490
the first happened just last year.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:57.760
I think 2016 was the year
when we started living 51%

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.850
of our lives in cyberspace.

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.430
That's where we went to get
our news, write a, find a book,

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:06.530
buy a book, buy a house, buy
a car, meet with our friends,

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:08.070
find a date, find a spouse.

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:10.820
We are now living in the
developed world, at least,

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:14.180
51% of our lives in cyberspace.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:18.190
And, my definition of
cyberspace is that it's a realm

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:21.050
where we're all connected
and no one's in charge.

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:24.230
It's the ultimate God free realm.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:27.550
There are no stop lights there,
no police, no ethics code,

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:31.890
no 1-800 please stop Putin
from hacking my election.

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:36.670
We are living our lives in a
realm that is ethics and God free.

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:40.580
And, at the same time, because
of these accelerated powers

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:44.140
that I've written about, we're now
standing at a moral intersection,

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:47.500
we have never stood up
before as a human species.

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.550
In 1945, we entered a world

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:52.600
where one country could kill
all of us post Hiroshima.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.220
If it had to be one country,
I'm glad it was mine.

00:50:55.220 --> 00:51:00.410
I believe we're entering a world
where one person can kill all of us

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:04.360
and where, at the same time, all of
us could actually fix everything.

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.520
These same amplified powers
are creating a world where one

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.070
of us could kill all of us and all
of us could actually feed, house,

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:13.810
clothe, and educate every
person on the planet

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:15.110
if we put our minds to it.

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:16.760
We have the power to do that now.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:22.290
We have never stood at
this intersection before.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:23.970
And what does that mean?

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:26.320
It means we have never
been more Godlike

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.640
as a species than we are today.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.540
And, what does that mean?

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:35.230
That we're living most of our
lives in a realm that is God free

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:40.500
and we are increasingly Godlike,
that means what everyone thinks,

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.760
feels, and believes
matters now more than ever.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:48.060
And, that means that everyone
today has to be in the embrace

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:53.620
of sustainable values particularly
the one everyone shares,

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:57.230
the Golden Rule, do unto others
as you wish them to do unto you

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:59.290
because we now live in a planet

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:02.950
where more people can do unto
you farther away, faster, deeper,

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:07.060 position:56%
and cheaper than ever before and
you can do unto others farther away,

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.500
deeper, cheaper than ever before.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:13.730
Everyone today has to be in
the embrace of the Golden Rule.

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:17.500
I know what you're
thinking, how naive.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:23.040
No, what is naive is thinking we're
going to be okay if everyone isn't

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.610
in the embrace of the Golden Rule.

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:30.500
Naivety today, in the age of
acceleration is the new realism.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:31.970
Where does the Golden
Rule come from?

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:33.620 position:56%
It comes from two places in my view,

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:36.900
strong families and
healthy communities.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.430
I'm not an expert on
strong families.

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:39.730
I hope I've built one.

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:41.540
I never lecture anyone
on that subject.

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:46.330
But, I am an expert on strong
healthy communities because I grew

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:50.050
up in one in Minnesota
in the 50s, 60s,

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:52.490
and 70s called Saint Louis Park.

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:56.030
And, that's why my book
and talk ends here.

00:52:56.030 --> 00:53:00.320
Basically, the short story
is in Minnesota in the 40s.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.660
Minnesota was the, Minneapolis
was the capital of antisemitism

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.890
until Hubert Humphrey became mayor.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:09.480
My grandparents came from Europe,
my parents were born in Minneapolis

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.390
and I was born in the
north side of the city

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:16.120
which was a ghetto basically with
just Jews and African Americans,

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:19.830 position:56%
not because we were integrated there
but because we were isolated there.

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:23.280
My parents couldn't
join AAA in the 50s.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.840
antisemitism was a real problem

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.680
until Huber Humphrey
became mayor of the city.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:32.840
After the war, the entire
Jewish community, virtually,

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:37.900
of North Minneapolis moves out
in a three year period unmasked

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:41.280
to one little town
called Saint Louis Park,

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.870
about 20 minutes half hour away
outside of Central Minneapolis.

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:50.630 position:56%
And, overnight, a town that had been
100% white, protestant, catholic,

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:54.730
Scandinavian, became
20% Jewish 80% white,

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:56.820
protestant, catholic, Scandinavian.

00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:02.610
If Sweden and Israel had a baby,
it would be Saint Lois Park, okay.

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:06.230
And, I tell the story of how
we built a community together,

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:08.810
how we built an acute
inclusive community together.

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.420
And there were warts
and there were problems

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:12.790
and there were broken
hearts and broken days.

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:17.930
But in the end, we built a
really interesting community.

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:21.530
I went to high school or
religious school or grew

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:23.970
up in the same neighborhood
roughly the same time

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:27.660
with the Coen Brothers,
Al Franken, Norm Ornstein,

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:30.650
the philosopher Michael Shandel,
Sharon Isbin the Guitarist,

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:32.570
Marc Trestman the coach
of the Chicago Bears,

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:36.320
Dan Wilson was someone
like you with Adel.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.660
It was a freaky place.

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:42.470
The Coen Brother's movie A Serious
Man was about our Hebrew school.

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:44.760
And, if you saw No Country For
Old Men, you remember the scene

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.930
where Chigurh blows up a
car outside of a grocery,

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:51.160
outside of a pharmacy excuse me
in Mexico to go in and steal drugs

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.400
and at the end of the scene
the camera pans to the pharmacy

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.230
and it's called Mike Zoss Drugs

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.880
which was the little Saint
Louis Park Drugstore.

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:04.850
I tell the story of that community
and how I learned something there

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:07.800
and it effected all of us, Frank
and Sandel, a myself we all took it

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.300
into politics in different ways.

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:13.860
Some become Minnesota nice,
hard to explain Minnesota nice

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.160
if you're not from Minnesota.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.700
But, you know, in the book I tell
the story of home bread in the book

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.780
and I went to my friend
Jay Goldberg's wedding,

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:22.240
[inaudible] daughter's wedding and
my friend Jay Goldberg was there.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:26.110
We sat at the table and Jay told
me Tom my wife Ilene was driving

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:28.320
on the ring road around
Minneapolis today

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.490
and a driver almost
drove her off the road.

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:36.520
And she came home and said Jay
I was so mad I almost honked.

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:42.020
Okay. That's Minnesota
for road rage okay.

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:43.320
I tell another story.

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.640
There was actually a Jewish mafia
in Minnesota in the 30s and 40s.

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.940
My dad grew up with these guys.

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.630
He wasn't in the mafia, I swear.

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:52.000
But, when I was a young
boy five or six years old,

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.120
my dad came home one
day and told me a friend

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.290
of his had been sent to jail.

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:57.960
And, when you're a six year
old or five year old kid,

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:02.340
the idea your dad knows someone
who went to jail, that is freaky.

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.130
And, I said to him
dad what did he do?

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:06.430
And, rejoinder I never forgot.

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:11.250
He said son he was shopping
in a store before it was open.

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:15.800
That's Minnesota for
breaking and entering.

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:21.360
Okay. Anyways, I tell all the
story of Minnesota, I left in 1971

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.430
to discover the world, and
I came back 40 years later

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:26.110
to write this book, and found

00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:28.520
that the world had
discovered Saint Louis Park.

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:32.090
Now, my high school's 50% white,
protestant, catholic, Scandinavian,

00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:36.480
10% Jewish, 10% Hispanic,
and 30% Somali,

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.050
small African American,
same community.

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:43.120
And now the diversity
challenge both religiously

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:47.730
and racially is much bigger,
the chasm that has to be built.

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:49.640
And, I tell the story
of how they're doing it.

00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:50.940
And, they're doing pretty well.

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:53.610
Washington Post says they're
still the fifth rated high school

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:54.910
in the state of Minnesota.

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:57.880
But it's a struggle, it's
a struggle every day.

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.020
But, if you want to know why
the book, and I conclude here,

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:07.910
is an optimist guide, is
because the problems are huge.

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:09.840
But, when you go to
these communities,

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:15.360
it is amazing the number of people
who want to get caught trying.

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.320
My teacher and friend
Emory Lovens likes to say,

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.330
whenever anyone asks her about
Emory what are you an optimist

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:21.130
or a pessimist, Emory
says I'm not neither

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:23.840
because they're just two
different forms of fatalism,

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.280
everything will great,
everything will be awful.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.150
Emory says I believe
in applied hope.

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:32.490
And, I believe in applied hope.

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:35.820
You want to be an optimist about
America today, stand on your head.

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:39.150
The country looks so much
better from the bottom

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:40.970
up than the top down, okay.

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:48.170
It's not that we don't have
communities that are struggling

00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:52.210
and failing, but we
also have a huge number

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:54.060
where people are applying hope.

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:59.930
And, that's why my book and this
talk ends with a theme song.

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:01.230
My book had a theme song.

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:02.530
I actually thought
can I buy this song

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:04.630
so when you open the book
it would play this song

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:07.700
like a Hallmark card
plays happy birthday?

00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.030
And it's really, I think,
the anthem of our time.

00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:13.470
It's by one of my favorite
singers, Brandy Carlyle.

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:18.050
And, the song is called
The Eye, E Y E. And,

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:23.170
the main refrain is I wrap your
love around me like a chain

00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:25.660
but I never was afraid
that it would die.

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:32.310
You can dance in a hurricane but
only if you're standing in the eye.

00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:40.010
You see, I think these
accelerations I've written about,

00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:41.650
they're a hurricane.

00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:43.530
They are a hurricane.

00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:47.810 position:56%
We have a president who is trying to
build a wall against the hurricane.

00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:51.430
I'm advocating an eye, an eye
that moves with the storm,

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:55.970
draws energy from it that creates
a platform of dynamic stability,

00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:59.490
a healthy community, where
people can feel connected,

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:02.220
protected, and respected.

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:06.020
I think the great struggle in our
politics going forward is going

00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:10.110
to be between the wall
people and the eye people.

00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:25.270
And, my book is a manifesto
for the eye people.

00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:26.570
Thank you very much.

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:27.870
Thank you.

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:29.170
Thank you very much.

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:32.770

of the Library of Congress.
