the liar revealed story is painful but
the rest of the set up I thought was

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690
the rest of the set up I thought was
 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.629
the rest of the set up I thought was
actually kind of clever if given a

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639
actually kind of clever if given a
 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.070
actually kind of clever if given a
little bit more focus and a few

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080
little bit more focus and a few
 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.690
little bit more focus and a few
different choices made I think this

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700
different choices made I think this
 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.519
different choices made I think this
could have been actually a really good

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:33.529
could have been actually a really good
 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:34.610
could have been actually a really good
story and

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620
story and
 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.159
story and
right really great film but as is kind

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169
right really great film but as is kind
 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.930
right really great film but as is kind
of like the spider-man movies they're

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940
of like the spider-man movies they're
 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.420
of like the spider-man movies they're
well intended and creative and visually

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430
well intended and creative and visually
 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.460
well intended and creative and visually
interesting but they're just kind of

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470
interesting but they're just kind of
 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.290
interesting but they're just kind of
awkward the moments that work are really

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300
awkward the moments that work are really
 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.420
awkward the moments that work are really
great moments the ones that don't are

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430
great moments the ones that don't are
 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.760
great moments the ones that don't are
just kind of uncomfortable I guess I

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770
just kind of uncomfortable I guess I
 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.379

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080
so maybe there wasn't as big a
 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.080
so maybe there wasn't as big a

playing the china doll back together I
 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.230
playing the china doll back together I
like some of this imagery but clearly

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240
like some of this imagery but clearly
 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.700

some of these casting choices should

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710
some of these casting choices should
 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.990
some of these casting choices should
have been moved around some of the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000
have been moved around some of the
 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.950
have been moved around some of the
dialogue could have been a lot more

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960
dialogue could have been a lot more
 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.900
dialogue could have been a lot more
clever the pacing in some moments could

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910
clever the pacing in some moments could
 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.400
clever the pacing in some moments could
have been a little tighter which leads

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410
have been a little tighter which leads
 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.990
have been a little tighter which leads
to an obviously good intentioned but

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000
to an obviously good intentioned but
 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.240
to an obviously good intentioned but
still clumsy movie if you're in the mood

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250
still clumsy movie if you're in the mood
 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.010
still clumsy movie if you're in the mood
for some good visuals and a couple of

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020
for some good visuals and a couple of
 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.170
for some good visuals and a couple of
nice scenes I say this isn't that bad

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180
nice scenes I say this isn't that bad
 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.850
nice scenes I say this isn't that bad
one to check out if you're in the mood

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860
one to check out if you're in the mood
 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.200
one to check out if you're in the mood
for something that's much more complete

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210
for something that's much more complete
 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.480
for something that's much more complete
and put together I say you're probably

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490
and put together I say you're probably
 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.840
and put together I say you're probably
gonna need a lot more glue
