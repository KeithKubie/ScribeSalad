00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
probably raised the bar a great deal as
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.940 align:start position:0%
probably raised the bar a great deal as

in<00:00:44.010><c> any</c><00:00:44.160><c> other</c><00:00:44.399><c> kids</c><00:00:44.760><c> show</c><00:00:45.030><c> I</c><00:00:45.210><c> probably</c><00:00:45.600><c> won't</c>

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
in any other kids show I probably won't
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.709 align:start position:0%
in any other kids show I probably won't
give<00:00:46.110><c> a</c><00:00:46.140><c> shit</c><00:00:46.440><c> but</c><00:00:47.100><c> the</c><00:00:47.399><c> fact</c><00:00:47.670><c> that</c><00:00:47.820><c> it's</c><00:00:48.360><c> done</c>

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
give a shit but the fact that it's done
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.130 align:start position:0%
give a shit but the fact that it's done
in<00:00:49.260><c> a</c><00:00:49.530><c> show</c><00:00:50.219><c> that</c><00:00:50.610><c> they've</c><00:00:50.789><c> established</c><00:00:51.140><c> so</c>

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
in a show that they've established so
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.369 align:start position:0%
in a show that they've established so
well<00:00:52.469><c> uh</c><00:00:52.910><c> I</c><00:00:53.910><c> think</c><00:00:54.300><c> it's</c><00:00:54.690><c> worth</c><00:00:54.840><c> bringing</c><00:00:55.020><c> up</c>

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 align:start position:0%
well uh I think it's worth bringing up
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
well uh I think it's worth bringing up
so<00:00:55.770><c> I</c><00:00:56.300><c> guess</c><00:00:57.300><c> one</c><00:00:57.449><c> thing</c><00:00:57.480><c> is</c><00:00:57.719><c> that</c><00:00:57.809><c> the</c>

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 align:start position:0%
so I guess one thing is that the
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.990 align:start position:0%
so I guess one thing is that the
criticisms<00:00:58.440><c> here</c><00:00:58.620><c> are</c><00:00:58.800><c> actually</c><00:00:59.309><c> take</c><00:00:59.760><c> it</c><00:00:59.879><c> as</c>

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 align:start position:0%

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
a compliment these criticisms it makes
it<00:01:04.439><c> because</c><00:01:05.100><c> that</c><00:01:05.339><c> it's</c><00:01:05.700><c> usually</c><00:01:06.170><c> because</c><00:01:07.170><c> it</c>

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 align:start position:0%
