1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:01,810
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,170
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,010
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,010
[inaudible].

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,830
I'm just checking in on you.
You're not going to believe what the,

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,030
what I just did a,

7
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:18,690
you probably will have in you listened
to this thing enough to know that I'm a

8
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:22,640
fucking moron. You're not going
to believe what I just did.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,130
Why don't you do bill? Well, I just
recorded the Thursday afternoon podcast.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,950
Right. And I forgot my cord that I
usually end up, I have a routine.

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,910
The second I do it, I upload it and
I'm done, but I forgot the cord,

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,390
the UCB Chord, whatever the fuck it is.
USBC fucking public bank cord. Yeah.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,650
So it took me out of my routine and I
just wanted to like robot mode and I

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,350
fucking erase the podcast.
I just did.

15
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,480
Why would I do that? I was
so psyched. I was done.

16
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,480
I just came back from Boston, dude.
I came, you know, I woke up early,

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,310
I'm still on east coast time. My
beautiful daughter, lovely wife.

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,470
I was sleeping, I paid all the fucking
bills. I got everything ready to go.

19
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,890
All the way to do is knock out my podcast.
It's a quarter, eight in the morning.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,880
I'm done. My kids just getting up,
I'm ready to make everybody breakfast.

21
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,860
I'm crushing it.
And what do I do?

22
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,600
I just had a race and I hit a race
and you know, once she had her race,

23
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:32,320
she can't stop it from a racing.
And I was like going, oh my God,

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,160
what did I just do? And it's just, it gone

25
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,303
over.

26
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,090
So now the big thing is,

27
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,650
is I can't compete with myself
from a half an hour ago.

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,073
All right?

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,930
I can't be looking into the past and
thinking about what I talked about.

30
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:53,250
I need to go into the fucking,
yeah.

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,760
All right.

32
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,510
I hope you guys all have
a merry Christmas. Okay.

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,450
Have you noticed Mary
only goes with Christmas?

34
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,500
Do you notice that it's happy Hanukkah.
It's happy Kwanzaa.

35
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,900
It's go fuck yourself and it's
merry Christmas. Isn't that weird?

36
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,930
Mary Hanukkah.
Merry Kwanzaa.

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,873
Okay.

38
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,790
Marry Muhammad.
What is their Christmas?

39
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,213
MMM.

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,730
Have a merry, merry Mohamed Edge.

41
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:37,420
The best time of the year.
Buddha do to do.

42
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,510
I know there won't be snow
cause we're in the Middle East.

43
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:44,680
They have any moms out there.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,410
Do people go skate and I rack?

45
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,880
Have I ever sewed a dumber
in my life? Well, you know,

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,240
considering I just recorded a podcast
and then promptly fucking erased it

47
00:02:57,641 --> 00:02:58,474
promptly.

48
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,060
Like within fucking two minutes. That's
all I'm gonna do. I'm gonna Bitch,

49
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:08,140
Moan and complain and whine about what
I just did rather than move on with my

50
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:12,940
life. All right, setting the
tone for 2018 once again,

51
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:16,660
we're going to look back rather
than being in the moment.

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,170
That's one of my goals for 2018

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,980
is to tell somebody who tells me to
be in the moment to shut the fuck up.

54
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,920
And when they say, well, I
like, Hey, I'm in the moment.

55
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,270
You're annoying me in this moment.
Now that moment's gone.

56
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm still talking about it. Did I
not take your advice? You can't.

57
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,250
Can you stop acting?
Is there anything,

58
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:45,210
you know some of the most spiritual
people have the most fucked up lives?

59
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,190
Are you enjoying it? Did you take it in?
Did you take a moment to fucking chill

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,660
the fuck out of my face?

61
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,093
MMM.

62
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,500
Anyway, sorry. Sorry. Whatever.
Whatever. Well, this four minutes.

63
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,730
All right. Four minutes. I just, I
just got it back. Oh, guess what?

64
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,810
I got some big news for you.
Um,

65
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,160
after a 131 days of being sober,

66
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,170
oh, GH. Oh,

67
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:27,160
Billy red face fell off the fucking wagon.
Um,

68
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,170
I put up a good fight right through
the holidays. I made it to December 26.

69
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,800
What kind of a fucking
asshole falls off on the 26?

70
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,530
I can see New Year's Eve. I could, I mean,
Christmas Eve I could see Christmas Day.

71
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,280
I can see New Year Z,

72
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:48,250
but the 26th and the history of
people falling up the fucking wagon,

73
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,210
who falls off on the 26? What do
you, what are you crying about?

74
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:56,680
The fact he didn't get a fire
engine the day before for Christmas?

75
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,250
Um, yeah, fell off.

76
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,450
I'm going 131 days and very
proud of myself. I, yeah,

77
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,460
I can definitely, I was definitely in
the moment. Uh, this is what happened.

78
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,430
Um, first of all, I had,

79
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,680
I had the best Christmas I've had since
I was a little kid and I still believed

80
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,490
that some fat stranger came
down the chimney. All right.

81
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,050
Uh, it was awesome. And
I was actually like,

82
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:30,820
I had a lot of stress about it because
I was flying back with my lady and my

83
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:32,800
lovely daughter and I was thinking like,
oh my,

84
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,420
all I've ever heard is people talking
about flying back with an infant.

85
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,710
It's a nightmare. Everyone,
you know? Yeah. You know,

86
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,170
by the end you're ready to get a
divorce and all this type of shit.

87
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,070
I gotta tell you something.

88
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,690
It was the fucking best Christmas I've
had since I was like eight years old.

89
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,550
When did I find out there was
Jake and the fat man was bullshit.

90
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,780
When did they find that
out? Uh, first grade

91
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,300
I found out in first grade because my
older brother found out in third grade and

92
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:05,290
he quickly told me,

93
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,800
and I remember I wasn't mad either. I
actually felt like an adult, like, oh wow,

94
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:19,360
man, I'm in a, I'm in on the
secret. Right. So anyways,

95
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,030
uh, coming back with a kid ended
up being the greatest thing ever.

96
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,890
It just, it takes all the pressure
off of you in your relationship.

97
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,570
You just come back like
we got married,

98
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,830
we reproduced no more questions of when,
when,

99
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:40,850
when that's over.

100
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,710
And then the best thing too is you come
on with the toddler and all everybody

101
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:49,400
wants to do is interact with the kids.
So nobody's asking you about your life,

102
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,720
nobody's giving you the third, what do
you got going on? What are you doing next?

103
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:54,680
What do you think about this?

104
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,440
Are you sure you're going to do
that or is that the right move?

105
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,274
And next thing you know,

106
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,270
you're fucking boozing it up and
you're all fucking depressed. Um,

107
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,260
or getting into arguments or talking
politics of or guy, I dunno what,

108
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,360
um,
all of that was gone and I,

109
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:12,960
yeah,

110
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,160
it was just great.

111
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah.

112
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,020
I came in and he was like, how are you
doing? Oh my God, look at your daughter.

113
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,860
And then that was it. There was no, you
know, I got a lot of social anxiety.

114
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,260
Like when I go to like
parties and that type of shit,

115
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,770
I was always the guy up on the wall,
you know?

116
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,180
Yeah.

117
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,060
It's a bunch of guys sitting around
watching a game. Then I'm in my element.

118
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:36,240
But when once it becomes like this
social thing, there's no game on.

119
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,090
And uh,
I,

120
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:43,070
I don't know know there's all
this fucking weirdness going on.

121
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,250
You've got adults are so fucking
weird. You know, there's all this like,

122
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,220
it's just like the playground
when you were a kid,

123
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:54,930
but it becomes like an adult
shit, like a, you know,

124
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,640
I don't know.
Competing.

125
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,863
Yeah.

126
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,010
You know,
I don't know how much you make in dreams.

127
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,490
She getting married, whatever the fuck
you going through just becomes this,

128
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:10,170
all this, there's all these
storylines that are going on.

129
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,120
Okay.

130
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,750
Maybe that's why my wife
has always watching those,
those reality shows I guess.

131
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,440
Cause all of that shit that's just
going on. You know what I mean?

132
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,190
Of just watching people so caught
up in bullshit that, you know,

133
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:27,930
your neighbor gets a better spatular
than you and it like affects your fucking

134
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:31,100
mood.
MMM.

135
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,660
So anyways, so we went back
there and just watching people,

136
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,180
meeting my daughter and her like,
you know, her big thing now,

137
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,970
she knows she just waves
at everybody and uh,

138
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,970
she could say hi now, although
she, she's yet to say it,

139
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,350
she looks in the mirror and says me.
And then she also says hi,

140
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,370
and I've yet to see her
do either either or.

141
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,600
Although there's video of her saying hi.
Um,

142
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,540
anyways, everybody was,
you know, flip his, she,

143
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:10,800
she, she killed it. She killed
it. She was a little starlet.

144
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Everybody absolutely loved her and
her personality is really coming out.

145
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,610
And, uh, I got to tell you what's
really fucking crazy is like,

146
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,750
the more her personality develops,
like the more I love her.

147
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,420
It's crazy. Like every time
you think he hit the ceiling,

148
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:30,900
like I could not love this kid anymore.
There's like another level.

149
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,760
And um,

150
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,900
I always hated when I didn't have a
kid and people will go in like it,

151
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:41,580
you don't get it. You don't get it. It's
like, dude, I hit the kid, you know,

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,110
hate to say this, but, uh,
they were right. They were.
Right. But I haven't said that.

153
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:50,130
I will never tell somebody they
don't get it. Who doesn't have a kid?

154
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,150
That's a douchey thing to see. Now.
You don't get it. You don't care. Yeah,

155
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,940
neither did Jill. All right.
Stop acting like you're smart.

156
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,200
All right. There's 10
minutes. 21 minutes to go. Um,

157
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,200
so, uh, I don't know. It's
just so many great things.

158
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,230
Uh, I got together and jammed
with a couple of my brothers.

159
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:17,730
We used to play used to butcher hair
metal tunes back in the 80s into the early

160
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:17,731
nineties.

161
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:22,650
We had not gotten together
and try attempted to play
music in almost 24 years.

162
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,850
And one of my brothers, uh, rented this
place. Uh, I got to give him a shout out.

163
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,950
It's in Somerville,
Somerville,

164
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,160
which was known as
Slummerville when I was a kid.

165
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:36,030
Now it's all hipstery with like cupcakes
and fucking burger joints and shit.

166
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,270
Um, it's like a upscale
thing, right? And uh,

167
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:46,740
this place is called the jam spot
out in Somerville, Somerville Lumber,

168
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,710
that's all I remember from out
there. It was, uh, uh, the jams.

169
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:53,820
Paul was just a beautiful clean place.
Rooms were awesome.

170
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,550
All the equipment was the shit.
And the guy who worked there was just a,

171
00:10:56,551 --> 00:11:00,810
just a great guy. Family man actually
got a kick out of the fact that a,

172
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:05,070
we were all brothers going to go down
there and play and we hadn't been playing

173
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:06,170
together.
Then that fucking long.

174
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,230
We went in there and we
butchered some songs.

175
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,330
Sounded all right though.

176
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,290
And then at the end a couple more of
my relatives came down and like doing

177
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:20,310
karaoke at the end and they sang and we
actually had the place from 12 to four

178
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:21,780
in the afternoon.
I remember thinking like two,

179
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,730
two hours is going to be more than enough.

180
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,990
We know like six songs from almost,
you know,

181
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,770
a decade and a half ago.
We're going to play for about 20 minutes,

182
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:35,390
then we're just going to be
staring at each other. And um,

183
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,000
that's actually not what happened.
It flew by and uh,

184
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,540
what we were trying to work
on a couple of songs, uh,

185
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,140
ACDC walk all over.
You touched too much highway to hell.

186
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,230
We always had that one down.
And uh,

187
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,190
then one of my brothers always
played Stevie ray Vaughan,

188
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,090
so we played a bunch
of that stuff. And, uh,

189
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,280
then a few more relative
showed up. Maxine, you know,

190
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:05,170
we played Zeplin the ocean
and uh, it was, it was just,

191
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,330
it was fucking awesome.
And then after that,

192
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:10,810
that's when we went out
and got a steak and a,

193
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:13,420
one of my other relatives
hadn't been drinking since June.

194
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,960
I had been drinking since August, so like,
we're going to do this. He's like, yeah,

195
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,890
let's do it. Fuck it. So
he orders a Johnnie Walker
black. I'm like, come on man,

196
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,000
we're going off the wagon after
six and four months. Say we got it,

197
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,550
let's get the blue. So we ordered
the blue, but it was a steak house,

198
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,260
so it was around the holidays
and they were out of it.

199
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:32,950
So I forget if we've got the gold or
the platinum, but it was really good.

200
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,350
And my buddy stopped at one,

201
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:38,980
I had one more and uh,

202
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,533
and then that was it.

203
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,750
We called it a night and then like two
hours later I was back in the hotel room.

204
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:48,040
I gotta be honest with you, I felt
like shit. And I was just like, wow,

205
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:52,870
I do not miss feeling like this. Um,
I don't think I like drinking anymore.

206
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,770
And then yesterday I went to the airport
and of course they are the American

207
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,520
Airlines terminal at Logan.

208
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:04,720
They have to Cisco Brewery and I love
Nantucket and I love Cisco Brewery.

209
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:09,640
So I'm like, well, I gotta go in there
and get a fucking beer. So I had the,

210
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:13,920
a whale's tail Pale Ale had that nurse,

211
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,250
that thing that was delicious. And
then I get on the plane, I'm like, Eh,

212
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,210
we don't have a fucking drink.
I know. Nah, don't do it.
Don't do it. Don't do it.

213
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:26,950
Right. Fortunately, uh,
I avoided that a, and um,

214
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,950
I think what I'm going to do is basically,
um,

215
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,643
I think,

216
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:34,620
yeah,

217
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,890
I'm just going to take a few days off
as far as not drinking and then just go

218
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:40,380
back on the wagon on January 2nd
I'm going to the road school.

219
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,510
I've got to have a couple
of cocktails when I'm there,

220
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,720
but I don't have to drink today. I don't
have to drink up until the rose bowl.

221
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,080
And I think that's just how I'm going
to boost rather than trying to go like a

222
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:52,920
whole fucking year and you know,
so many days or whatever.

223
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:56,340
I just think I'm just going to pick
my spots. So being at the Rose Bowl,

224
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,700
it's a playoff game. That's a good
time to have a couple of drinks.

225
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,750
And then I really don't see excuse to
have one for the rest of January. So

226
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,050
February or March, I don't really
don't see any event coming up.

227
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:11,760
Maybe a super bowl party,
I don't know.

228
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,190
But I think that's the way I'm going to
booze and I'll keep the weight off. Um,

229
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,480
I won't be a drunk dad or whatever.
And uh,

230
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,990
I think that's basically the
way I'm going to do it. But, uh,

231
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,430
my daughter actually caught a cold,
you know,

232
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,240
so many people picking up holding or,
you know, just that time of year was it?

233
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,670
I guess it was inevitable. So we were
flying back and I was like, Oh God,

234
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:36,730
six hours on the plane
with an infant with a call,

235
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,810
this is going to be a nightmare.
And actually, uh, she was a trooper.

236
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,370
She fell asleep for like the first,

237
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:46,980
like 40 minutes and then was just up
for the rest of the flight. And, uh,

238
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,140
she was a little bit whiny or whatever,
but anytime she would whine,

239
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,050
I just take it for a walk up
and down the aisle, you know,

240
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,700
cause I don't want to bug other people
in the plane with my crying kid. And, uh,

241
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,070
I never resented people
if their baby was crying.

242
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:04,850
The only time it bugged me is if they
just weren't making any sort of effort to

243
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:08,450
try to entertain the kid. So, uh,

244
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,210
I was just walking up and
down the aisle and, uh,

245
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,330
of course she went over the stewardesses
and then they will hold in her for a

246
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,840
minute. So it all worked
out. And I'm funny,

247
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:23,510
fucking dad moment changing a,
uh,

248
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,530
a diaper,
you know,

249
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,190
on the plane, you know, in the bathroom
there. I never even noticed it.

250
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:32,900
Got a little thing that
fucking comes down.

251
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,050
I sterilize the whole thing with one
of the wipes the best I could. And uh,

252
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,781
that's a big thing.

253
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,570
Making sure your kid doesn't
touch anything and then
you got a wipe down their

254
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:43,910
hands and their feet and
everything when they come back out.

255
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,540
But a change in a fucking shit
diaper during turbulence on a plane.

256
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,690
I was like, all right, this is it.

257
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,620
I'm officially a dad. I knocked
it out, I knocked it out.

258
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,350
And um, yeah, I got to
tell you something too,

259
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:09,970
like all the things that I loved about
my lovely wife, you know, seen one of,

260
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,170
see what an incredible
mother she is is uh, I dunno,

261
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,420
that's a whole other level too.
So whole other level.

262
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:22,320
So I don't know what to tell you. This
is weird. I'm actually really happy. So,

263
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:25,140
I don't know how know how funny
this fucking podcast is going to be,

264
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:28,290
but I had an awesome Christmas and,
um,

265
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,600
I was really at all this stress
thinking like, oh, I'm like,

266
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,770
all I've ever heard is, oh my
God, going back to holidays,

267
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,020
bringing your kids and everything.

268
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:37,800
It's like as a parent you don't get
to rest and blah, blah, blah, blah,

269
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:42,030
Blah and all that. Uh, I had
a great fucking time and um,

270
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,800
I was thinking that we were just gonna
fly back this time and then start

271
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:51,000
establishing Christmases out here by at
such a good time with like two days left.

272
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,000
I even sent an d, I was like, if you want
to do this again next year, I'll do it.

273
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,870
Cause you know, it snowed, it was
out. It was just, it was the shit.

274
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,440
And um,

275
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,500
yeah,

276
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,860
yeah. And my kid is awesome.
Even though she wears me out,

277
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,460
she'll literally wear me out and then
she'll finally go to sleep and then I

278
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,460
closed the door and I get this to,
you know, to lay down for a second,

279
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:13,170
like [inaudible] and like five minutes.

280
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:16,560
I'll just sit there and laugh and five
minutes later I just start thinking like

281
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,290
I miss her.
I was at possible,

282
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,760
how was that possible? But I
dunno. That's, that's how it works.

283
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:31,230
So I'm not complaining. Um, so anyways,

284
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,490
uh, oh, you know, when I could drink
again after the new year's, maybe, uh,

285
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,650
the night of the Patrice o Neal benefit
to get that plug in there. There you go.

286
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,180
The Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit,
uh, entering, it's, let's see,

287
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,170
is this the sixth or the seventh one?
I think the seventh,

288
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,080
right. Let's see here. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

289
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:58,890
18 is 61. And I want to thank
everybody that's been buying tickets.

290
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,910
We're almost sold out again
this year, which is really, uh,

291
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,620
it's truly amazing.
And um,

292
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,870
I have to thank Maureen Taren
and everybody else who, uh,

293
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:15,060
gives their time every year.
Jim Norton Calling Quinn, uh,

294
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,950
David Tell Bobby Kelly Dane Cook all of
his friends that have taken time out of

295
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:24,690
their lives and uh, it's just fun. You
know, it's like a high school reunion.

296
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,860
And then also to see like a,
you know,

297
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,150
we always have a couple of the
young, you know, I call them kids.

298
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,540
I went old fucked out, but, uh, and just
see, you know, they were teenagers when,

299
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,530
when Patrice is stuff staying up,

300
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:42,520
first started coming on TV and he
actually influenced them to be comedians.

301
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,460
So getting to hear those stories and
getting to see the young, the young guys,

302
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,280
the uh,
Michael Che's,

303
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,340
the Hannibal Burress is and see them
coming out and how funny they are and all

304
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:54,730
that. It's just, it's just
a great thing. So, uh,

305
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:59,560
I will once again tweak the link.
I'll keep tweaking it until we, uh,

306
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,690
sell the whole thing out.
But once again,

307
00:19:01,691 --> 00:19:05,350
thank you to everybody who's been over
the years been a helping to support that,

308
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,240
a wonderful cause. And as always,
after we pay for the, uh, theater,

309
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:14,530
all the money goes to Patrice has loved
ones that he was supporting while he was

310
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:17,890
still alive, taking care of them. So, um,

311
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,300
with that,
what are we going to do now?

312
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:24,420
How are we going to talk a little sports
here? A little fucking sport. Oh Shit.

313
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,920
Do you know what I watched
what documentary I watched
that was only like an hour

314
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:32,480
and 20 minutes long, but it took
me six hours to watch because, uh,

315
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,670
my lovely daughter would not go to sleep.
I watched

316
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,680
this documentary called, uh, Newman.

317
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,913
Right.

318
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,700
So I was initially attracted to the
title cause I thought it was going to be

319
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:50,250
about Paul Newman, who's like one of
the coolest guys ever saw. I'm like,

320
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,660
I gotta watch this. See what
they're talking about. Right.

321
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,440
And uh, you know, what's
it going to be about?

322
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:02,450
It's going to be about racing
career is acting career or his,

323
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,830
uh, his charity. I always wondered
how involved he was with that.

324
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,190
I just can't see the great Paul Newman's
sitting there listening to people

325
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:16,090
talking about their balsamic vinegarette
or spaghetti sauce. Yeah, I bet.

326
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,280
I bet. At the beginning he just wanted
to have a business. He's just like,

327
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:20,560
I don't want to deal with this shit.
Just that, just fucking running,

328
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,160
give them money. The poor, um, by the way,

329
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:26,770
did you see some fucking jerk off?
Bought his watch,

330
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,950
his actual watch for 17 point $8 million.

331
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,170
What, what kind of a fucking
asshole then what do you do with it?

332
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:40,070
And you put it on like, oh, like I feel
as life force, maybe I can act now.

333
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,210
Maybe I'm cool.
Um,

334
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,100
I just don't,
I don't understand that type of shit.

335
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,090
I Dunno. I guess I do a little bit
maybe with like musical instruments.

336
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:57,260
I think it'd be cool to see a
couple of really famous instruments,

337
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:58,430
but I wouldn't want to own them.

338
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,140
Yeah.

339
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,580
You know, like if you had somebody
like some famous person's guitar,

340
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:08,960
they pass away and you have that guitar
and then you're playing their music on

341
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:13,490
that with your skill level. You
know, I know the guitar is an alive,

342
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:15,530
but if it was when it started crying,

343
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,660
um, anyways, uh, so I,

344
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:30,661
I rented this documentary called Newman
and it was about this guy who came up

345
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:37,570
with a electromagnetic
device that produced energy.

346
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:42,571
And the big thing about it was not
only was it clean energy was the device

347
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:43,600
itself,

348
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,600
somehow it created more energy
than it was using to run.

349
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,790
And I didn't know that that was a
problem because I have a horrible science

350
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,710
background. So, uh, just, just watch
it to see what you think. All right.

351
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,850
Basically I wasn't aware of any engine
and he sought of turbine anything,

352
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:10,540
whatever. I guess what, even
if it's used to create energy,

353
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,940
maybe they all are, I guess, you
know, some sort of turning force.

354
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:18,550
I don't know what I'm in.
I'm in way over my head.

355
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,440
They had always day, always like you're
always in a deficit because it, it,

356
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,470
I guess it uses more energy than it
actually fucking produce as well.

357
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,660
This thing that this
guy created allegedly,

358
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,050
like it used 10% of the energy
that it actually created,

359
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,890
which was fucking unheard of.
So when he went down to get a patent,

360
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,290
they will like, what you're
doing is impossible, sir.
That sounds like witchcraft.

361
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:47,680
This,

362
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,680
it basically defied the laws of
physics as we know them right now.

363
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,330
So they were all saying what,

364
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,630
you've probably got some transforming
hidden somewhere on your property.

365
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:01,270
They tried to find it.
They couldn't find it.

366
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,580
They just refuse to believe that this guy,
what he was doing was true,

367
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,830
which then goes, you know, they
wouldn't give him a patent.

368
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,540
And then it goes into all this
conspiracy theory. You know,

369
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,340
that a big oil company,
politics and all of this shit,

370
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,850
we're standing in the way of this guy
because he was basically going to put them

371
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:26,710
out of business. And, um,
I gotta be honest with you.

372
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:30,280
I believed everything that I saw in it.
Uh,

373
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,640
and spoiler alert, cause I'm going
to continue talking about this.

374
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:38,230
You should definitely watch it.
I believe that his device worked.

375
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:44,010
I believe that the patent company probably
with pressure from the oil companies,

376
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,600
um, wouldn't give him a patent.
I believe he got death threats.

377
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,690
And then I also believed that
he was out of his fucking mind.

378
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:58,430
I believe that he had
a god complex and um,

379
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,810
they certainly had a temper.
Just check this.

380
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:03,650
This guy's one of the most
fascinating people ever.

381
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,760
And there's no way to
watch this for me anyways,

382
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,380
for me to watch this.

383
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,350
And I'm not talking about
the genius side of this guy.

384
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:17,970
I'm talking about his flaws.
The Newman dude,

385
00:24:17,971 --> 00:24:21,480
his,
the is flawed personality.

386
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,630
I couldn't help but watch that guy.
You know,

387
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,690
when investors would come around and
he'd be like, I know what you want to do.

388
00:24:27,691 --> 00:24:31,650
You want to steal from me, I'll put
you right in your fucking face. Right.

389
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,950
I couldn't,
and I'm not even exaggerate.

390
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,930
I couldn't help.

391
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,060
Yeah.

392
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,680
When I was watching that
to not see myself going,

393
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:47,030
that looks like me when I try
and rent a car or when I try to,

394
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:48,710
yeah.

395
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,400
Good customer service. That's what I
ended up doing. And even though I'm right,

396
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:55,430
I become wrong because
of the way I behave.

397
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,620
And um,

398
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,640
it's really fascinating and it's
one of those things where you just,

399
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:06,020
you just want it to be true and it'll
be so great if it was just a way to

400
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:09,650
seamlessly have that thing developed.

401
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,540
Give the Guy Newman is credit.

402
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah.

403
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,620
He makes a ton of fucking money.

404
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,160
You let the fucking oil companies run
the goddamn thing and they keep making,

405
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:22,380
I don't give a fuck.
I'll keep paying what I pay for oil.

406
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,763
All right,

407
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,020
let's quit.

408
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,020
If we can pollute less and
have to liberate less people
around the world because

409
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:36,440
of our fucking dependency on this shit.

410
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,103
You know,

411
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,660
I really believe, you know, I, I
actually, I know you guys. Yeah.

412
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,580
They always say you get
your tin foil hat on.

413
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:47,230
I don't even know where
that reference comes from.

414
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,420
But yeah,

415
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,130
does seem to be this
incredible progression

416
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,960
as far is like,
uh,

417
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,150
in energy and in curing diseases and
then all of a sudden it just came to a

418
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,950
screeching fucking halt.

419
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,970
And it's my belief that it's because the
amount of money that is being made and

420
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:16,901
how entrenched those entities are and
how many's people's livelihoods are

421
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:21,620
attached to them that
they don't want that it's

422
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:22,870
okay.

423
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,160
There's just too much conflict
of interest to have it progress.

424
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,360
Like, uh, I dunno,

425
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,050
I'm one of those people that believes
that they can cure way more diseases than

426
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,880
they let on. And eye doctor told me one
time a long time ago, he said, look,

427
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:42,150
there's no money in the cure.
The money is in the treatment.

428
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:46,140
And I know that's thought that human
beings would actually fucking do that.

429
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:51,240
But the way a corporation works is
kind of like the way back in the day,

430
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:52,021
the war games,

431
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:55,260
the way they would shoot off the warheads
where it's like it took two people.

432
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:58,110
Everybody's fucking got to
turn a key and every, oh,

433
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:02,550
and they would gas somebody
or shoot somebody, you know,

434
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,570
and the firing squad,

435
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:08,340
somebody had like a fucking rubber bullet
or in an empty gun so everybody would

436
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:13,080
fucking do it. Uh, I
dunno, I didn't, you know,

437
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,530
something half by the end of that, that
didn't even make sense to me. But I just,

438
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:16,860
I don't,

439
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,130
I don't believe in people when it comes
to that doing the right fucking thing.

440
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:21,020
Well,
that's to probably whatever.

441
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,080
I watched the fucking thing
and decide for yourself.

442
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,940
I explained it so much better.
Oh,

443
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,490
now living in the past and
the podcast I already did. Um,

444
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,690
anyways, being back in Boston, you know,

445
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:40,040
something I really fucking missed was uh,

446
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:44,830
the Herald sports page and the globe
sports page. I was in fucking heaven

447
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,800
reading that sports page.

448
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:52,570
One day I sat down and they had all
the Bruins stats for this season.

449
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,240
All the Celtic stats,
all the patriots stats,

450
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,480
and then they had these giant
articles about all three teams.

451
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,990
There was still breaking
down the Patriots.

452
00:28:01,991 --> 00:28:06,370
Buffalo bills game and rating the
quarterback, the running back,

453
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:10,570
the receivers, the offensive
line to defensive line, the
linebackers to secondary,

454
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,600
the special teams, the
coaching, grading them.

455
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,450
It's fucking phenomenal.

456
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,830
I'll tell you what wasn't phenomenal was
watching those fucking assholes trying

457
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:23,080
to stir up some bullshit right into,

458
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,890
we're going into the playoffs about Tom
Brady and his fucking personal trainer

459
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,600
who gives a fuck whatever his personal
trainers doing, it's obviously working.

460
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,710
The guys ran out of digits on
one hand was Superbowl rings.

461
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,880
Now he's moved onto the other one.
I swear to got the local media.

462
00:28:39,881 --> 00:28:41,140
What would they be?
I tweeted that.

463
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:44,200
What the fuck would they be doing if
they weren't trying to sabotage the local

464
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:48,850
team and all you fucking cops out there
who then pile on and start commenting

465
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:50,380
and calling into these sports shows.

466
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,150
Anytime there's shitting on the
fucking home team like that, like look,

467
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:58,570
if it's deserved, it's deserved, but
if they're just trying to stir up shit.

468
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,133
Okay.

469
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,330
Just stopped. I wouldn't
just stop listening. Turn
the channel. That's, I mean,

470
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:04,164
that's what I do.

471
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,393
MMM.

472
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,140
By the way, you know what was funny
is, uh, I saw yet another, uh,

473
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,780
eat guy in ESPN talking
about bill Belichick's press
conferences going to like

474
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,450
God, there's there so intimidating.
It's like what is intimidating by it?

475
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,500
Stop acting like you don't know
exactly what the fuck the guys doing.

476
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:23,700
He knows what you're doing.

477
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:28,850
You're trying to get him to give you a
quote so you can build your story around

478
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:33,210
that and then you can exaggerate and
take all his shit out of context and give

479
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:36,930
the other team bulletin board material.
That's why he doesn't talk to you guys.

480
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,070
Jesus fucking Christ.

481
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:43,870
Did you see that coach Auburn after
they beat Georgia at the first time they

482
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:47,000
play, we beat the dog shit out of
them. Whatever the fuck he said.

483
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,850
I bet that was all over their locker room.

484
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,930
Fuck it on the ceilings above their
bed until they played them again.

485
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:58,620
And what happened? The
Georgia bulldogs. Hey,

486
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,410
they came back and paid them
right in the fucking ass man.

487
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,340
They came back and beat him. That's why
bill Belicheck doesn't do that shit.

488
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:10,260
All right. That was another thing I
liked about Newman was that this guy was,

489
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,020
this was a good old boy
from fucking Mississippi.

490
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,890
And just being out here in La and
watching all these fucking actors and

491
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:20,610
actresses just openly shitting on anybody
lives in the middle of this country

492
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,750
because they have the audacity to vote
for somebody different than they do,

493
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,230
you know,
independently.

494
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,280
Evidently because they don't live next
to an ocean that makes them a fucking

495
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:33,720
moron. Just watching what this
guy did, allegedly, you know,

496
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,050
Johnny Carson was from like Nebraska.
I just don't understand. I just,

497
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,750
I don't get people out here and I'm
not saying I shouldn't act like it's

498
00:30:42,751 --> 00:30:45,570
everybody, but it's just really
fucking ignorant. Anyways,

499
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:51,210
that is the podcast. All right, and
that is the last podcast for this year.

500
00:30:51,211 --> 00:30:55,680
2017 was the greatest year of
my life becoming a dad. And,

501
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,850
um, I know just so many
great things, you know,

502
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,970
happened to me this year.
So I'm going to thank all you guys.

503
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:05,890
Everybody came out to shows
and all that type of stuff.

504
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:09,130
I really want to take the time. I never
do this. I always call you guys cons.

505
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,420
I like to think it's a daring, but thank
you guys for the best year of my life.

506
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,560
And um, I hope 2018 I don't even
think it needs to be better.

507
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,770
Just match this one. Just be
in the cruising altitude. Joe,

508
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,390
live the path. You have to be
the presage shut up. You can't.

509
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,110
Um, but anyways, uh, that's
it. I'm not doing shit.

510
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:36,490
I have basically all the
fucking January off and uh,

511
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,580
I'm going to put together another 20
minutes to add to all the bullshit that I

512
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:41,900
have.
That's sort of my goal and

513
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,553
I'm going to court.

514
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,360
I went to a lot this year to put it
that way and I'm looking forward to an

515
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:50,220
amazing year. Alright. Enjoy this music.

516
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,370
And then a throwback episode
at Thursday afternoon,

517
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,470
just before Friday. Monday morning
podcast. Have a great weekend.

518
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,790
[inaudible] happy new year
and I'll talk to you in 2018.

519
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,733
[inaudible]

520
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,230
Hey,
what's going on?

521
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:30,460
It's built bar and it is the Monday
morning podcasts from Monday,

522
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,530
uh,
December 28,

523
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:38,440
the final Monday morning podcast for 2009.
Can you believe it?

524
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,270
Another decade has flown by.
Dude, this was like the most,

525
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:49,270
um, stealth decade of all time.
And I'm going to tell you why,

526
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,040
just in case you were worried,

527
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,340
I would make such a bold fucking statement
about the Goddamn calendar and then

528
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,250
never give you an explanation.
I'm going to tell you why.

529
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:02,110
Because every decade that I've lived in,

530
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:07,270
at least that I can remember that I lived
in the 70s everybody would discuss the

531
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,010
70s what are the 70 [inaudible] like? And
then the 80s, the big eighties, right?

532
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,410
And then, you know, people
talking about the, you know,

533
00:34:14,411 --> 00:34:18,190
the 90s people would make
references on sitcoms, you know,

534
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:22,840
about the coming nineties,
right? It had a fucking name.

535
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:28,150
Every decade that I've been
in has had a name, seventies,

536
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:32,770
the 60s, the eighties and the nineties
but this decade had no fucking name.

537
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,810
Oh, the arts, the two thousands we,

538
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:41,800
we never decided on a fucking
name. Therefore, you know,

539
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,650
I wasn't really paying attention.

540
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,850
I wasn't really paying attention as this
decade whipped by because it's kind of

541
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:52,090
like the odometer went back to zero.
Right.

542
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,390
Uh,
this is this getting shaky here.

543
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,730
I just realized I'm really
getting into some shaky territory.

544
00:34:57,731 --> 00:35:02,380
It's kind of like it went back to to
the two zero. Right? Except it didn't,

545
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,570
it was,
it was at 2000,

546
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:09,370
which actually comes back after 1999.
I'm just saying. You know what I mean?

547
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,940
It's like, what the fuck? What happened
to this decade? You know? I don't know.

548
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,130
That was pathetic. I really sounded
like I had something to say there.

549
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:20,860
And it went absolutely fucking nowhere.
Um,

550
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:25,240
which is the theme of this podcast
every damn week. Every fucking week,

551
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,450
you know, for the last few weeks
ago with a gratuitous fucks.

552
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:31,120
Why am I saying fuck so
much this fucking week?

553
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,840
You know why I have not been on
stage since I take my latest special.

554
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,640
I have been on

555
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,240
vacation and uh,
I haven't been doing shit.

556
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:47,241
I've been stuffing my fat
face with holiday cheer and a,

557
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:52,980
I don't know what, you guys have a good
Christmas. Did you have a merry Christmas?

558
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,220
Isn't that just put a song in your
heart and say that to somebody?

559
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,790
Merry Christmas. Uh, what the
fuck? Who's calling me now?

560
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,700
Ah, Shit. Hey, I'm doing my podcast.

561
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:08,370
Let me call you back in about 40 minutes.
Okay.

562
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,960
There we go.
Anyways,

563
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,810
merry Christmas to one and all. Um,
yeah, I gotta get on stage here because,

564
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,360
uh, now that I've basked
in the glory of, uh,

565
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:28,380
not fucking up my special, everything
went great. Now I can take a vacation.

566
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:31,680
Now, you know, there's this little voice
in the back of my head going, dude,

567
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:35,460
you know, um, you don't
have an act right now.

568
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:40,140
Technically you really don't. So,
uh, why don't you go do some shit?

569
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,970
It hopefully some funny
shit will happen. Um, um,

570
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,370
speaking of which,
um,

571
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:52,230
some of my girlfriend's family came out
and we took them out to Venice beach out

572
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:55,560
here in California and a, if you
never been out there, you know,

573
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:56,970
there's a bunch of freaks out there,

574
00:36:56,971 --> 00:37:00,510
but there's enough regular people sort
of tourists that it waters it down.

575
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,710
But a big to being the fact
that it was the Christmas week,

576
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,050
there wasn't a lot of tourists out there,

577
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:08,940
there wasn't even a lot
of regulars out there.

578
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:13,941
So when we showed up it was pretty
much wall to wall freaks and uh,

579
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,000
just had a fucking great time out there.

580
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:21,900
This guy was standing in front of some
sort of fun house shit that I'd never

581
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:25,950
seen before and he was that
classic, you know, you know,

582
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:30,030
step Brad half step right up and
he's going to see the rubber man,

583
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,210
see the electric boy.
And then he goes and look,

584
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,130
look what just came in from the space
station and he reached into a bucket of

585
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:41,010
water and he pulled out
a two headed turtle.

586
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,360
It was one of the greatest fucking
intros to something. He Yell,

587
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:52,650
look what they just look what just
came in from the space station. Right.

588
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,491
First of all,

589
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:58,200
I like the fact that this fucking shitty
on Venice beach standing next to a

590
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:02,880
crack head has some sort of direct
link to the space station. All right.

591
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,290
I also liked the term the space station.
Is there a space station?

592
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:12,470
I haven't seen a report on space for a
long fucking time considering NASA really

593
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:16,530
fell off. They really fucking
fell off of, you know,

594
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:20,130
when I was a kid,
you know they were going to the Goddamn,

595
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,570
they'd been to the moon. All right.
That was like the godfather moment,

596
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,420
or at least they pretended to go to
the moon. I don't know what they did,

597
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:32,421
but I bought it and they would literally
feeding us Tang at school and for all

598
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:34,760
you youngsters out there,
this was, it was this,

599
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,610
this powdered orange drink that they,
that's what the astronauts drink.

600
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,830
You know when they're up there and I, you
know, outer space and they don't have a,

601
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,780
they don't have the, I don't know
what I'm trying to say. They, they,

602
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:52,330
they can't get into any decent
fucking food or liquids.

603
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,530
Would you like to see what it's like to
drink a poor excuse for a orange juice

604
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:59,740
and be like an astronaut? And of
course you did. Of course she did.

605
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:05,200
There was actually a dream of many kids
growing up. What would you like to be?

606
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:07,210
I'd like to be a hockey player.
What would you like to be?

607
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,640
I think it'd be a heel keeper.
What would you like to be?

608
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,240
I'd like to be a fucking
astronaut. Well, that's nice, Tim.

609
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:16,540
He could you say it again without
the curse words? You little cunt.

610
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,150
Why do you have a fucking bowl cut?

611
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Because it's the 70 sweetheart and my
dad grow up with malaria and curly.

612
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,070
Um, remember that? Remember the seventies,

613
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,050
remember that shit when it was still okay.

614
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:32,860
It was still acceptable for your
parents to cut your fucking hair,

615
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,790
even though they had no
beautician skills whatsoever.

616
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,720
My Dad cut my fucking hair
right up until a sixth grade,

617
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,900
sixth grade,
just laying a template for no pussy,

618
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:46,990
right through fucking a
right through high school.

619
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,860
What am I trying to say? So
there was, this guy goes,

620
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,850
look what just came in
from the space station.

621
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,510
Now obviously there's no rubber man.
There's no electric boy.

622
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,770
I know it's all bullshit. But you figure
if you're going to make, uh, a, uh, uh,

623
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,510
a reference to space,

624
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,110
you're gonna pull out something that
looks like it came for fucking space,

625
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,760
some sort of rock that you found on the
beach claim. It's part of an asteroid,

626
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,940
maybe part of a bigger asteroid
that's headed right towards us.

627
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:19,180
Whatever you got to do. This fucking
guy pulled out a two headed turtle.

628
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,300
Look what just came in
from the space station.

629
00:40:22,301 --> 00:40:25,930
They were up in the fucking space
station and look what came floating by

630
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,100
a deformed,
uh,

631
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:35,310
fuck an amphibian that needs to be
within this atmosphere and a fucking know

632
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:38,830
what I'm trying to say here. I just
thought it was fucking hilarious. And me,

633
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:42,250
my girlfriend and her family
laughed for like fucking 10 minutes.

634
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,060
You know that when someone just does
something stupid out in public and then

635
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:49,150
that just becomes like the catch phrase,
you know what I mean?

636
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:52,540
The coupon truck and moment of your
afternoon, anytime the, you know,

637
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:55,570
the conversation would die down.
Someone would just say, hey,

638
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:59,650
look what just came in from the space
station. Oh, and we would laugh.

639
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,100
We had a great fucking time,
bunch of freaks out there.

640
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:07,780
I saw a black guy in the yellow
phone walking on broken glass. No,

641
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:09,010
we didn't have a thong.
The other guy,

642
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,570
it was an American flag Thong and the
other guy was dressed as skin tight,

643
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:17,680
fucking yellow. I don't
know what it was. Um,

644
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:21,130
he was basically walking barefoot on
trash, but I got admit he pulled a crowd.

645
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,680
I was impressed, very impressed. Uh,

646
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:27,850
the best one I saw was I saw this
dude who was wearing a derby,

647
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,320
which is a type of hat. I don't if
it's a bowler hat or a derby. I don't,

648
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:33,290
one of those, one of those, uh,

649
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:38,470
let Charlie Chaplin hats and his big
Shtick to get money was he would walk

650
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:43,990
backwards in front of tourist with
his hat on and he had an empty, uh,

651
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,010
like Paper Cup that you'd have cocaine.

652
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,200
And he was just sort of hitting it up
in the air and before it would land,

653
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,240
he'd hit it up with the
other hand and it would,

654
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,880
would go no higher than
just the top of his hat.

655
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,390
And he had this look on his face
like, Eh, am I doing something?

656
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,340
And then there was another dude out there,

657
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:06,580
this drug addict who had his side
kick me in the ass for a buck and a,

658
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,150
he started yelling at me to do it.

659
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,890
And I just was laughing cause I'm sorry I
can't, I can't do that. I'm not, I don't,

660
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,020
first of all, I'm not going to kick in the
ass for a buck. I don't want, you know,

661
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:16,880
it's humiliating.
I don't want to do that to you.

662
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,230
And then not to mention the second you
bend over, I'm going to fucking do that.

663
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:24,380
You know, you know you have a kick your
friend in the ass and you kick him.

664
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:29,300
So you want to kick him so hard that
you misjudge it and you actually hit his

665
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:34,280
ball bag from the, from the
other side. That's what I,

666
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:38,000
I envisioned myself doing it at that
point. I, I would think that, you know,

667
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:42,940
then I've got to fight a fucking drug
addict and I get hit hepatitis, whatever.

668
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,440
Look at me acting like a, you know,
that's what I was going to do now.

669
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,900
You weren't bill, you weren't going to
do that. That's what you wanted to do,

670
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,090
but you didn't have
the balls to do what's,

671
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,460
he laughed like a little girl and
he continued on down the boardwalk.

672
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,540
That's what the fuck you
did. You know? You know?

673
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,190
Speaking of a new era of comedy,

674
00:42:58,191 --> 00:43:01,040
that's something I always wanted to talk
about on stage and I always thought it

675
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:01,874
would be funny,

676
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,160
but I never really kind of was able to
make it funny was those fucking people

677
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,980
always you tell, tell him something
that happened, something bad to you,

678
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,010
and then the second had done
listening to it. They always go, dude,

679
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,240
you know what I would've done? You know
what I would've done? Let me guess.

680
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,100
You would've done something that worked.

681
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,480
Now that you're basically in the
future and saw what the fuck happened,

682
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:28,640
asshole and I believe I parked
my car and I go to get out of it.

683
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,890
All of a sudden it started
rolling down the fucking street.

684
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:33,400
I don't know what happened. I
had the thing in gear, dude.

685
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:36,260
You know what I would've done?
I would've had it an emergency.

686
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,620
I would have put the emergency brake
on and I were to turn the fucking tires

687
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:40,311
towards the curb.

688
00:43:40,311 --> 00:43:44,780
That's what I would've done
in anticipation that the
one fucking time he didn't

689
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:46,010
put the emergency brake on,

690
00:43:46,011 --> 00:43:50,030
that your car that never slipped out of
gear before was then going to slip out

691
00:43:50,031 --> 00:43:52,790
of fucking gear. Shut up,
you asshole. You know,

692
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,500
if you had that sort of intelligence,

693
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:58,310
he wouldn't be friends with me hanging
out in this shit hole. Fucking bar. Right.

694
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,810
All right then. All right. Now that
I got myself worked up into a lather,

695
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:07,100
look at me wearing my Christmas
patriots. Jersey. What a fucking nerd.

696
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:11,060
How old are you look like
if she's standing with a
book bag waiting for a bus,

697
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,170
you know, it's just not
cute anymore. Um, all right,

698
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:19,970
let's get on with the podcast. If you're
new to the podcast, welcome, welcome.

699
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:23,120
Um, I got some news this
week. Everybody. Uh,

700
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:26,570
I know I keep threatening to join
Facebook and I'm going to have to do it.

701
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,640
I'm going to have to do it because there's
just nobody left Tehran my space. Uh,

702
00:44:30,641 --> 00:44:35,010
I'm a, I'm given up. Um, I'm pulling the
flag down and putting up the white flag.

703
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,210
I surrender you when Facebook,
you when God dammit,

704
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,610
if it wasn't for those
meddling kids. Um, all right,

705
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,040
so let's get on with the podcast.
If you knew the podcast,

706
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:50,850
I try to hype my shit and this is
what I got going on. I'm on vacation.

707
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,320
Okay.

708
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,000
I just taped a new special called let
it go and it'll be out in 2010 at some

709
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:58,470
point.
If you can't wait that long,

710
00:44:58,471 --> 00:45:00,840
why don't you go on iTunes
or going to my website,

711
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:06,120
[inaudible] dot com and go buy my
fucking DVD. Why do I do this? All right.

712
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,010
So I can get a little check and get my
little fucking $3 or whatever the fuck I

713
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:13,760
make on those things. Um, anyways,

714
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,010
my next Gig is an, uh,
Seattle January 15th,

715
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,780
and I'm doing the Marty reamer. Funny
Fest. Marty Room was a great guy,

716
00:45:23,781 --> 00:45:26,810
great radio guy up there in
Seattle and he's got this, uh,

717
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:29,300
this big comedy show that I have
been trying to do for years.

718
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:33,500
And I'm going to be up there with a bunch
of other big shots like a Jeff garland

719
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,290
and a,
and a bunch of other people.

720
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:39,500
I can't even fucking remember who else
may up there with Christian Finnegan.

721
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:39,801
Remember,

722
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:44,030
I hate that the other white dude on the
Chappelle show who had some people you

723
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,560
want to Chappelle show. Will you on the,
uh, the mad real world? No, I wasn't.

724
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,410
That was the other guy. And then people
try to argue with me. Not that was you,

725
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,273
that was you.

726
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,940
Why would I lie? Why would I, why would I,

727
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,300
why would I try to knock down my
pathetic entertainment resume?

728
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:03,400
I'm all about patting it. All right,
let's get on with the podcast here. Um,

729
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,340
what do we got here? Let's start off with
Douche bag of the week. All right. And,

730
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:10,270
um,

731
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:15,270
my nominee for Douche bag of the week
is the NFL network for showing a fucking

732
00:46:15,701 --> 00:46:19,270
game on Christmas. That was only on their
goddamn network. You know what dude?

733
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:23,710
Fuck the fucking NFL network.
All right.

734
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,240
Have any of you guys out there actually
looked into what it takes to get a

735
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,200
Goddamn dish? First of all, if
you're renting somewhere, right?

736
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,060
You landlord's going to be a cunt.

737
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,020
If you start drilling into the side
of the building, right? You know,

738
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,920
a repair that's probably going to cost
him $80 but somehow we'll take the entire

739
00:46:41,921 --> 00:46:46,720
12 to $1,500 a year fucking
deposit, you know? And then also,

740
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,840
you know, I don't know about you guys,
but when I actually first moved out here,

741
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:53,560
I was getting a flat screen. I was like,
fuck it. She's going to light up the card.

742
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,130
And they're like, would you
like to get direct TV? And
I'm thinking, yeah, fuck it.

743
00:46:57,131 --> 00:47:00,310
I'll get the NFL network. I can
watch the pats games. Why not?

744
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,980
And they wanted me to sign up
for like two or three years.

745
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,740
Like it say ya like a cell phone company.

746
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,420
I don't have to do that with cable

747
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,740
cable right now. I could call them and
say, you know what? I'm sick of your shit.

748
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,850
Go Fuck Yourself. And they make ramps.
I'm tearing. And Carol Amery Karen,

749
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:20,670
appreciate it. You didn't
use that language. Fuck you.

750
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,510
You fucking Sunday
working cable cont right.

751
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:27,960
And they would just shut it
off and then that would be it.

752
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,750
And then I could back on Monday and
be like, yeah, listen. You know,

753
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:34,990
I don't know. I was, I was drinking,

754
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,920
I was lost some money on the
games and I took it out on,

755
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:40,180
I believe her name was Samantha.

756
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,110
I don't know where she was
stationed in your states, but uh,

757
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,870
is there any way you can turn it
back on? Absolutely. Absolutely.

758
00:47:46,871 --> 00:47:49,660
There'll be a Yay.
$80 a raw go fuck yourself.

759
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:54,400
We start up fee to match
the $90 cancellation fee.

760
00:47:54,401 --> 00:47:58,840
You know, that's the way they
get ya. Okay. But I got mobility.

761
00:47:58,930 --> 00:47:59,763
I got freedom.

762
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:06,090
Mean I have a feeling of control going
to sign a fucking three year contract.

763
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,640
You know,
the level of,

764
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:14,790
of of Douche baggery by the NFL network
to show a game on Jesus's birthday

765
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,770
guide's son. He sitting there trying
to think, Jesus has fucking direct TV.

766
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:25,660
I don't think he does,
you know, fucking hippie.

767
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,890
You think he's going to be involved in
some sort of corporate contract? Man,

768
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:32,770
I dunno. You know what I mean? Look,

769
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,570
I don't mind if you're gonna show
the random Thursday game. I get it.

770
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:38,680
You're trying to get me,
you know,

771
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,400
you're trying to get me all right and
you have your best matchups. Okay.

772
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:45,670
And you got to ll cool j on the
fucking TV licking his lips,

773
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:47,650
telling me about all the
fucking games that I'm missing.

774
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:52,030
A how many fucking tubes of chapstick
does that guy go through a year?

775
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,090
Does that make your lips chapped?
If you're on saliva,

776
00:48:55,430 --> 00:49:00,100
if you keep them glistening with
your own saliva, that's one of those,

777
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,260
uh, those evidently urban sexy
moves that makes, I don't know,

778
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:09,070
white people in the suburbs just cringe.
Like really they do that.

779
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:13,810
They lick their lips and that's
like a good thing. Um, anyways,

780
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,350
I like how I just meet all white people
in the suburbs feel the way I feel about

781
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:21,160
ll cool j licking his lips anyways, Douche
bag of the week. NFL network. All right.

782
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:22,090
You fucking assholes.

783
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:26,060
If you want to show a random Thursday game
and you know into to try to get me to,

784
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:28,900
to, to buy it. I get it. You're a
business but don't do it on Christmas.

785
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:32,920
You asshole. You know what you did. You
just made me more of an NBA fan. Okay.

786
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,550
Cause they had the Celtics magic and
they, their, their best guys out there.

787
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,250
They had Lebron, Kobe, Shaq. All right.

788
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,130
The big three up in
Boston and Dwight Howard,

789
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:47,540
who's got a bicep the size of my entire
body and has absolutely zero fucking

790
00:49:47,741 --> 00:49:52,570
baseline moves. Jesus,
what's his one movie? Dunks.

791
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:53,741
You know,

792
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:58,741
if that guy would just steal one move
from a fucking Kevin Mchale via a chemo

793
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,620
Olijahwaun he would be unstoppable.
But he doesn't, he's got nothing.

794
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:04,120
He's got no turn around jumper.
He's got nothing.

795
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:08,620
He's just got a bicep the size of a
fucking credenza. He's got two of them.

796
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,330
Um, anyways, seriously do.

797
00:50:12,331 --> 00:50:14,230
That's like the biggest fucking
human being I've ever seen.

798
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:17,690
So douche bag of the week is
the fucking NFL network and I'm

799
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:23,230
fucking cough. Um, I dunno, I
really want to write them a letter.

800
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,160
I just have to take all the
fucks and cuts out of it.

801
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,520
And I don't think that they're
really gonna give a shit,

802
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:30,950
but I'm going to go biblical on him.
You know what I mean?

803
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:34,640
Because everybody pays attention with
some stuff saying that you offended me

804
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:36,560
religiously.
And speaking of which,

805
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:41,210
I am introducing a new
segment here on the podcast,

806
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:42,980
and this is the,
uh,

807
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:46,190
the religious segment where you can
ask questions about other religions.

808
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,090
You can bitch about your own religion or
you can say why it's great and why you

809
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:54,160
like it. All right? Uh, the name
of this segment is, oh Geez,

810
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,790
because you know, last week,

811
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:00,380
I don't even know what
the fuck I said about, oh,

812
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:03,940
I remember that guy was saying how you
were, um, how he thinks you're a, you,

813
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,850
you make a choice to be gay.
And then he starts, you know,

814
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:09,860
making some quotes with the
Bible. And I was just like, ah,

815
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:13,010
you fucking people you
know with the Bible, right?

816
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:17,270
So this guy writes in and he goes,
trash in the Bible at Christmas.

817
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,560
What have you gone?
Stark raving mad or something.

818
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:25,880
This guy sounds like a a
born again Christian cause
he's obviously not going to

819
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:28,370
curse here.
Have you gone stark raving mad?

820
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:34,550
I mean Jimminy cricket spell. Anyways.
Did you hit your head or something lately?

821
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,610
Okay. Let's see. You do
believe in God, right?

822
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:41,750
But you went to a Catholic church where
they filled your skull with guilt,

823
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,790
horror and hypocrisy. Then he puts in
parentheses the little boy thing. Oh,

824
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:49,400
is that what you call children?
Getting molested

825
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:55,760
grown men fucking children. You call
that the little boy thing. All right. Uh,

826
00:51:55,761 --> 00:52:00,590
or whatever they did to turn you off.
Okay. Understandable. Understandable.

827
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,880
But for crying out loud,
this, this right here,

828
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:09,910
this email is why I don't work clean
as a comedian because you have to use

829
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:13,160
expressions like for crying out loud.

830
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:17,030
Have you gone stark raving mad?
Um,

831
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,690
many ways for crying out loud.
What makes you think God is like that?

832
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:26,030
He's not exclamation point. I
never said he was, he's fucking,

833
00:52:26,031 --> 00:52:30,290
people don't even listen to me. I'm
saying the Bible was written by people.

834
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:34,760
That's what I feel. Okay. He was with
my people a long fucking time ago.

835
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:39,620
They thought the earth was flat. Okay. A
lot of its metaphors, a lot of the shit.

836
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,750
I know a lot of stuff, you
know, makes sense or whatever,

837
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:43,760
but it's written by people.
All right?

838
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:48,590
And I don't believe that Jesus
was the son of God, okay?

839
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:52,010
I don't believe you rub Buddhist stomach
and don't believe any of that stuff.

840
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:52,760
Okay?

841
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,760
All those stories are the bridge between
right now and back when we used to draw

842
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:00,950
a deer on the inside of caves,
all right?

843
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,200
I'm not saying there's not
a fucking higher power.

844
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,420
I'm not saying I don't
believe in an afterlife.

845
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:10,450
All I know is that you don't know what
the fuck is going on until you die,

846
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:14,930
all right?
So you can make your guesses.

847
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:20,360
Your guesses are, are, are, are,
you know, qualified. You know,

848
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:23,060
I'm not saying you can't make your guests
if that's what the fuck you want to go

849
00:53:23,061 --> 00:53:23,894
for,
but you know,

850
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,410
I'm not saying you can't believe
what you want to believe.

851
00:53:28,411 --> 00:53:31,830
I just don't believe in that stuff. I
just don't. Do you really believe that?

852
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:34,650
Do you really believe Jesus was
the son of God and he, and he just,

853
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:39,770
he had a wicker basket and he just
was pulling fish out of it and fed 800

854
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:44,991
fucking people out of this little basket
that you usually throw a fucking hot

855
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,840
steam and washcloth into,
you know,

856
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,350
and he walked on water and
then he rose from the dead.

857
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:56,460
You really believe all of that. I don't
know. Why is my voice going up so high?

858
00:53:56,461 --> 00:54:01,110
You really
believe in Jesus Christ.

859
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,110
Um, I, I'm envious of that.
I'm envious of that. I, um,

860
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:12,960
I dunno. I just, I don't, I don't believe
that, uh, you know, I don't believe Noah,

861
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:14,070
I don't believe any of those stories.

862
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:16,170
None of those stories are believable
than me. They're just not.

863
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,680
I can see the earth flooding
and everybody drowning.

864
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,290
I can see that.
I can see,

865
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,280
I can even see a guy making a fucking
boat or maybe people who are already on a

866
00:54:26,281 --> 00:54:29,910
boat. You know? Why didn't
those people survive with Noah?

867
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,850
See, I can't even fucking
answer. I don't know why.

868
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,520
Then you're going to fill it up with
all those animals shitting all over the

869
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:42,210
place. You've got to capture all
the animals. It's just, it's not,

870
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:47,130
it's not fucking believable on any level,
on any level. It lacks credibility.

871
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,950
I liked the Ted Commandments. I
love the seven deadly sins. Uh,

872
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:55,710
I like the end of the world shit,
but I don't take it that seriously.

873
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,830
And this is not me slapping anybody
in the face. I just, you know,

874
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,190
and I would take going to say,

875
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,240
just because you have an open yourself
up to Jay's is when you open your shelf

876
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,030
full up the new ship, him as
your one and only savior. Yeah.

877
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:10,680
Why can't I do that?
Why can I just do that?

878
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:14,460
Why do I then have to go to church and
fucking pay for somebody else's lifestyle?

879
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:18,630
Who wants to dress like James Brown's
in the fucking blues brothers? Huh?

880
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,020
And you guys out there
going a mega church,

881
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:25,860
you guys seen those things down the
south, south down the south, down south.

882
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,590
You've, you seen those? I don't know
what the fuck I'm talking about. Look

883
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,090
the same way, that guy standing
out there going, you know,

884
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,940
look what they just brought
in from the space station.

885
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,960
That's what preachers are doing.
And let's say they took,

886
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:42,210
they're giving you like life advice, but
when they just start talking about that,

887
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,150
uh, you know, and then on the third day,

888
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:50,180
God created the shrinks yet add GI
or where's written dead children need

889
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:55,340
something to play on. That word swung
them back and forth. [inaudible]

890
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,460
brutal.
Fucking brutal.

891
00:55:59,461 --> 00:56:02,460
This is really just going to cause a
shit storm and I hope it does. All right.

892
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:07,440
And, and all of this, I'm
not disrespecting your
religion or what you believe.

893
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:11,760
I just don't fucking believe it.
And I don't believe that you believe it.

894
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,870
That's how unbelievable it is to me.
All right. But I believe in a, in,

895
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:20,160
in something, you know, you know
that shit where you like, yeah,

896
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,010
you'll walk to the phone
and before you say, you just

897
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,030
know who it is. That kind of
weird shit or a Deja Vu that's,

898
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:32,200
there's a lot of weird shit
out there. You know, uh,

899
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:35,290
you forget to look and you change
seven lanes and you don't die.

900
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,560
And then you think, wait a minute,
that I, that I just look back there.

901
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:41,860
I can't really remember. You were
in this fucking zone. I don't know.

902
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,960
I don't believe in ghosts.
You know,

903
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,320
I don't get what can it
go studio other than,

904
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,660
than wake you up in the middle of the
night. I guess I can do that. Going on

905
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:56,560
beyond that, what can they do? You know,

906
00:56:56,590 --> 00:57:00,010
that's how I got over my fear
of the dark when I was a kid.

907
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:03,700
When I would imagine that
there was a monster in there.
I got so mad at the fear.

908
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,670
One night I started giving the monster
the finger and it didn't kill me.

909
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:07,751
And I was like,
all right,

910
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:09,980
any respectable monster's not
gonna put up with that shit.

911
00:57:09,981 --> 00:57:12,970
And it would come over here and fucking,
there's no monster. There's no monster.

912
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,863
The stupid,

913
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,250
this is actually just nature's way of
telling me it's time to go to sleep.

914
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:23,050
And they're making it easy by not having
the sun there that I ever tell you that

915
00:57:23,051 --> 00:57:26,590
time. Uh, one of my
friends was, was on this,

916
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:30,190
I can't say it was on a date. You know
that shit when you were like high school,

917
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,920
when you're basically drinking outside
and you just start talking to some bra

918
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,420
and you try to hook up with her.
All right, so let's get into dusk.

919
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,750
And there was this moment,
okay, right around dusk

920
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:47,470
where the sun's going down and the
moon was a, sounds like a fucking song,

921
00:57:47,471 --> 00:57:51,190
doesn't it? Um, the sun
was going down in the moon,

922
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:54,610
like I going down in the west of
the moon was kind of like, I dunno,

923
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:59,440
I guess at like two o'clock or whatever.
And this girl was go and someone's like,

924
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:01,810
Oh wow, the sun and the moon were
out at the same time. Wow. You know?

925
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,130
And this girl was like,
wait a day.

926
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:10,380
How can the faculty sat in the movie?
Yeah,

927
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:11,770
let's say fag attack it.

928
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:16,860
And at first they thought that she didn't
believe that you could see the moon

929
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:20,160
until the sun completely went down,
which I guess would be understandable.

930
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,300
But they quickly realized that
she thought that the sun and

931
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:32,270
the moon where the same thing
and that evidently at night,

932
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,920
I guess God or Jesus or Buddha would,

933
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I don't know,
not necessarily blow this,

934
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:44,300
I guess she thought the sun was on
a dimmer and they would just sort of

935
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:48,440
gradually bring it down and uh, I
don't know. I don't fucking know.

936
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,690
And that's just one of those
moments where they always a kid,

937
00:58:50,691 --> 00:58:53,870
you just have that first moment of,

938
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,790
is this thing too dumb to try and fuck.
You know,

939
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:02,960
I always had that I could
never fuck somebody. Whoa.
I really thought was stupid.

940
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,980
It just, it just felt like,
uh, it was a form of rape,

941
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:14,630
you know what I mean? If you
just sold like, I don't even
say it, I'm a smart guy,

942
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:18,620
but you know, when someone's
just like borderline, like wow,

943
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:23,990
high school really? And
College. College. Wow. Okay.

944
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:29,650
All right. Anyways, let me read the
rest of this though. Jesus here. Um, um,

945
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:34,460
above blah, blah, blah, blah. So the kid
thing, um, he's not a, he, he doesn't, oh,

946
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:37,310
this is a great line too. He's
saying that God is not mad. I,

947
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:41,870
this is one of my favorite sentences
of all time. He's addressing, um,

948
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,970
the view of homosexuality.
He says,

949
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:46,910
God doesn't hate fags either.

950
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,220
Oh, that's good. It's good. He doesn't
hate the, he doesn't hate cock suckers.

951
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,340
God loves the faggots.
Um,

952
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:02,390
he loves everybody and that
is written in big letters. Um,

953
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,040
even people that hold up traffic,
a gay guy or not,

954
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,630
he died for everyone.

955
01:00:08,631 --> 01:00:13,130
Everybody's sins so they can accept
that free gift at the, see that's,

956
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:14,150
that's right there.

957
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:18,320
That's what I find annoying
about Jesus is the whole guilt.

958
01:00:18,321 --> 01:00:21,830
He died for you. Dude, I
didn't ask you to do that.

959
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,560
Idiot. Can fucking walk on water,
you know, float off the cross.

960
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,580
Wow. I'm really, yeah, this is really
getting bad. But I'm just saying,

961
01:00:31,581 --> 01:00:33,170
isn't that common fucking sense?

962
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:36,600
Like when you watch your karate movie
and Bruce Lee's doing all this shit and

963
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,570
you're like, just get a
gun. Why did you shoot him?

964
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,490
All I know is if I was the son of God,
I would not sit there getting crucified,

965
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,490
or at least I cheated a little bit.
You know,

966
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:51,680
I'd sort of semi levitate so it looks
like the nails are really fucking ripping

967
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,780
at me and they have for you,
wouldn't you?

968
01:00:53,781 --> 01:00:58,130
Wouldn't everybody caves
under, under, under torture?

969
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:00,690
They all do. I don't, I don't
buy any of this shit. You know,

970
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:04,430
it'd be funny is if all of this stuff
that I'm saying isn't true is true.

971
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:08,770
And then like I die and then they play.
Mike.

972
01:01:08,771 --> 01:01:12,560
My damnation is this podcast and you know,

973
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:15,680
they just playing this podcast and God
is just sitting across from me, you know,

974
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:20,410
with his hands up. Uh, you know
that shit where you, uh, okay. You,

975
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,740
you don't have your hands together.

976
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:24,620
You just have the tips of your fingers
together and they're kind of spread apart

977
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:29,000
and you just sort of bouncing
them, you know, the classic, um,

978
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,500
what am I going to do with you?
I am in a position of authority over you.

979
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:38,280
What is your sentence going to be?
Um, anyway, so fuck it. Let's see how,

980
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,610
how far into hell I can dig myself?
Um,

981
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,990
what else does this guy say
that I don't agree with? Uh, no.

982
01:01:44,991 --> 01:01:49,340
We know Jesus didn't sit
down with stationary and
write the Bible at some desk,

983
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:52,670
but it is his words. You know
why? I would love to know why.

984
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:56,600
I would love to know your proof.
Okay. I'll tell you why Jesus.

985
01:01:56,601 --> 01:02:01,601
He anticipated my answer
because on the fuck is it?

986
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:04,580
Because I know you don't know.

987
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:07,220
It was inspired by God.

988
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:13,030
Jesus through the certain chosen
people that physically wrote it.

989
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,680
Yeah,
I hear you saying bullcrap.

990
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:19,980
Why can't you curse if you
believe in Jesus? I don't

991
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,120
understand that.
You know,

992
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:25,500
you don't think when they were nailing
his fucking limbs to that piece of wood,

993
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:30,550
he wasn't going, fuck yeah, Mama.

994
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,720
Fuck Dude, I am. Do you
know my dad is your mother

995
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:40,450
fuckers? Come on. All right. All right.

996
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:46,560
Jesus Christ. I'm really fucking,
you know, this is stupid to do this,

997
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:50,520
but here we go. Let's keep going. Um,

998
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,780
you know something,
they never really fucked with his balls.

999
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,430
I always thought that was amazing.
You know,

1000
01:02:56,570 --> 01:03:00,960
the smashing like a reads over his back,

1001
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,960
you know, and putting thorns into his
head when just kick him in the nuts,

1002
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,570
his holier than now nuts his ball bag.
That fucking died.

1003
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:14,850
I did it for you. Oh God. Is that
annoying? It's really annoying.

1004
01:03:14,851 --> 01:03:19,200
I swear to God, if Jesus at the mall
signing autographs, I walk right by it.

1005
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:23,460
I'd rather meet Charles Bronson.
He was still alive, you know,

1006
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:28,380
talk to them about being in
Poland in that mine. Um, anyways,

1007
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,900
I hear you saying bullcrap,
but you are wrong.

1008
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,950
If you're saying that I didn't say
bull crap. I said Bull Shit. Uh,

1009
01:03:34,951 --> 01:03:38,700
that just means you don't understand
spiritual and supernatural things.

1010
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:41,850
T that's another thing about these really
religious people is if you don't agree

1011
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:45,240
with them and they can't be like, oh, you
know, this is what the fuck you think.

1012
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:48,090
You know, I'm not saying what
this guy is saying is wrong.

1013
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:51,710
I hope it's not coming off like that.
I'm just asking questions. You know,

1014
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,060
how come they never
kicked him in the balls?

1015
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:58,370
You think he didn't curse when
they were fucking with him?

1016
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,130
They were playing the upright bass with
his juggler or whatever fucking horrific

1017
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:04,140
thing they did to him.
Um,

1018
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:09,060
I actually understand spiritual things.
I don't understand supernatural things.

1019
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,730
No, I don't. I don't believe in
ghosts and neither do you. Okay.

1020
01:04:11,731 --> 01:04:14,960
And just because you read a fucking book
doesn't mean you understand it, right?

1021
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:19,110
You don't. All right. Uh, so
like so many other people,

1022
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:23,250
you feel the need to stop on something
just because you don't understand it

1023
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:27,750
fully, and that makes you mad. Okay. Well,

1024
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:29,520
how about instead of getting mad you,

1025
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:34,560
you asked Jesus himself to explain it
to you. Okay. I will hang on a second.

1026
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,350
[inaudible]
Jesus,

1027
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:42,630
could you explain the Bible
to me cause I don't get it.

1028
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,340
Okay. All right. So now what do I
do? This is really getting creepy.

1029
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,940
This is, I feel like I'm at the
fucking weegee board right now. Um,

1030
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:00,600
I can't even read the rest of this. All
right. That's probably a fucking stew.

1031
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:04,390
I really should not do this podcast.
I should just fucking hit a race,

1032
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,410
you know? All right. Let's talk about
movies. Shall We? Let's get out of this.

1033
01:05:08,411 --> 01:05:13,150
I saw the movie Sherlock Holmes,
uh, this week, me and half of,

1034
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:18,310
uh, the, the, the American
population all went out.

1035
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:22,570
That's Jesus get me back. Um, yeah,

1036
01:05:22,571 --> 01:05:26,950
I saw Sherlock Holmes and uh,
this is my movie review.

1037
01:05:26,951 --> 01:05:28,780
This is the best way that I can put it.

1038
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:33,050
It was watching Sherlock Holmes.
It was like a,

1039
01:05:33,051 --> 01:05:36,970
this is how he said it to my friend or
friend of mine who actually have, who, uh,

1040
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:42,060
also does not believe in Jesus. I said
it was like Sherlock Holmes was like,

1041
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:44,510
it was like the first time
you ate a fat free cookie.

1042
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,480
Do you remember that confusion? You're
just looking at the cookie being like,

1043
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:53,620
you know, how can this not be good?
It's, it's a fucking cookie. You know,

1044
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:55,860
how can a cookie be bad?

1045
01:05:55,861 --> 01:05:59,070
And that's literally what I
felt like when I was watching,

1046
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:03,000
when I was watching Sherlock
Holmes. You know, I'm like,

1047
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:06,240
how is it Robert Downey Jr
has given a great performance?

1048
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:10,490
Fucking what's his face? Jude
Law was great. Nick Guy Ritchie.

1049
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,330
I've loved all his movies.
How is this not fucking good?

1050
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:18,590
And I don't even know. I can't explain
it. I don't know why it wasn't good.

1051
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:24,770
It just wasn't bad. It
just, it was it, I dunno,

1052
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,380
it just, it wasn't good. Um,

1053
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:32,320
I like how they dumbed down Sherlock
Holmes though rather than having them be

1054
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,680
just an egg head. They,
they made him like this guy,

1055
01:06:35,681 --> 01:06:37,660
like they turned it into like fight club.

1056
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:42,640
First of all was great about the movie
was that they had elements of Jujitsu in

1057
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:44,080
England in the 18 hundreds,

1058
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:47,440
which I thought was hilarious cause as
far as I knew it came from the fucking

1059
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:49,660
Gracie family. Right.
Then they get credit,

1060
01:06:49,661 --> 01:06:54,310
a very least Brazilian Jujitsu and he
came up with it and like the twenties or

1061
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:58,120
east right. Isn't that what happened?
I don't know if they did that.

1062
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:02,810
They had a little bit of Zeitgeisty in
there, a little bit of fight club and uh,

1063
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,780
and then after he beat
the shit out of people,

1064
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:06,610
then he would do all that
Sherlock Holmes Shit.

1065
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:09,820
And he would say all the Sherlock
Holmes is fast as like an auctioneer.

1066
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:13,610
You're probably wondering how I knew that
because that thread indicates that you

1067
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:14,920
are in the Middle East
and blah, blah, blah,

1068
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,750
name would fucking fly through the
whole thing. And uh, I don't know.

1069
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:21,370
It wasn't good. I'm thinking about
seeing Avatar though, you know,

1070
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,520
but that even that movie annoys me. I
don't like that the whole, you know,

1071
01:07:24,521 --> 01:07:29,020
I wrote this and I had to wait till
technology caught up with it. Oh my God,

1072
01:07:29,021 --> 01:07:33,400
you're such a fucking
visionary. Jesus Christ. Heaven.

1073
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:36,850
You want enough wards? You don't have to
fucking rub your own balls and public.

1074
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:40,480
I don't think I'm ever going to book a
movie again if anybody ever listens to

1075
01:07:40,481 --> 01:07:43,810
this fucking podcast. All right, let's
plow ahead. Speaking of which date night,

1076
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,550
I actually saw a preview
for it and I was like,

1077
01:07:45,551 --> 01:07:49,090
I'm in this mother fucker and I was so
afraid I was gonna see my big fucking

1078
01:07:49,091 --> 01:07:52,150
head that I actually stared down at my,
uh,

1079
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,570
the fuck was eight and junior mints,
Junior Mints,

1080
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:59,110
the Classic Candy that you would never
buy if you actually had a choice,

1081
01:07:59,111 --> 01:08:02,950
but you just do at the movie theater.
They're awful in this.

1082
01:08:02,951 --> 01:08:06,100
So much peppermint or whatever
[inaudible] or whatever, the mint,

1083
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,860
I'm a fucking idiot.
It actually had the answer in the name.

1084
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:12,220
There's so much mint in it
that after like three of them,

1085
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:15,060
your fucking throat starts to hurt.
It's like you're eating Vick's vapor rub

1086
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:20,600
covered in chocolate. Um,
anyways. All right. Uh,

1087
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:23,660
I'm probably going to pay for
that. Oh, is fucking segment.

1088
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:26,640
But maybe that'll just be a onetime
only and I hope the fucking people that

1089
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:29,870
wrote that shit and don't be a
cunt about it. What would Jesus do?

1090
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:35,030
He just looked down, shake his
Gregg Allman hair and be like, ohh,

1091
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:40,070
golly, Gee, what are we going to
deal with this guy? Um, all right,

1092
01:08:40,071 --> 01:08:44,870
last week I talked about men who
abandoned their families and,

1093
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,960
um, I, I mentioned obviously that I,

1094
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:51,380
I don't agree with that and I'm sure
Jesus doesn't either forget about Buddha,

1095
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:55,040
although Buddha was too fat to leave his
family. What's he gonna do? You know,

1096
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:58,160
he'd have to hit the lottery.
When you get that fat as a man,

1097
01:08:58,161 --> 01:09:02,240
you need some sort of, uh, it
needs some power, you know,

1098
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:07,340
to pull the hot broads, you
know, little bit of vague,

1099
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,460
you know,
they are liquid Viagara they,

1100
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,880
you guys see that commercial
yet is fucking unreal.

1101
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,070
His show with late at night liquid
Viagara you pour it in your hand and you

1102
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:18,260
literally start rubbing one
out and your dick comes up.

1103
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:22,160
I was watching it and it was a
fucking unbelievable commercial.

1104
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:26,330
And if you believe that you
believe in Jesus, I'm all right.

1105
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:32,180
I'm really being an asshole right now.
And I don't mean to be all right.

1106
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:36,830
I respect all religions and I'm actually
jealous that you go to bed every night

1107
01:09:36,831 --> 01:09:41,630
thinking that there's a real life Santa
Claus waiting to Koresh you and rub your

1108
01:09:41,631 --> 01:09:45,410
forehead and your brow.
Um, all right. So anyways,

1109
01:09:45,411 --> 01:09:49,790
I talked about guys who were abandoned
their families and I was saying how, uh,

1110
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:53,990
obviously I don't condone it,
but I am jealous of,

1111
01:09:55,790 --> 01:10:00,790
I want to feel that level of euphoria
because in order for you as a man to do

1112
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:02,750
something like that,

1113
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:07,751
to leave somebody who you actually agreed
legally to dedicate your life to and

1114
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:12,860
then you then had children with.
Right now I don't have any kids,

1115
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:17,210
but I see the look on people's faces when
they talk about their kids. You know,

1116
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,850
even if it's a pain in the ass and
that they really could go back,

1117
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:20,900
they wouldn't have kids.

1118
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:25,190
There's a look they have on their face
to that unconditional love to fucking

1119
01:10:25,191 --> 01:10:28,100
walk away from that.
All right.

1120
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:33,860
Like the level of misery that you
have to be in. I just, you know,

1121
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:35,450
and it must've been like,

1122
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:38,900
like how men della felt when he
finally got out of fucking all right.

1123
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,100
It was a little big,
but you know what I mean?

1124
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:45,290
So I was talking about it and I was
thinking like, you know, last week,

1125
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:47,330
like what music would you listen to?

1126
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:52,070
What is the soundtrack to fucking
leave in that? And you guys all like,

1127
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:57,200
wait in, somebody said highway
to hell and another person said,

1128
01:10:57,201 --> 01:10:58,760
you listened to wish you were here.

1129
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:06,920
I don't know what I
would listen to. Um, I,

1130
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:11,960
I would just, it would be
just, I would just some,

1131
01:11:11,961 --> 01:11:16,740
any song that just made go, yeah, I
would just, I don't know. It's unreal.

1132
01:11:16,741 --> 01:11:20,250
But anyways, beyond
these fucking songs, uh,

1133
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:24,390
Saudi actually had a story about it and
this isn't great contribution by the way,

1134
01:11:24,391 --> 01:11:27,390
to the podcast,
as was this stuff about religion,

1135
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:29,550
even though I was a jerk about it.
But you gotta understand,

1136
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:33,600
I've got to keep this shit funny.
That's my out. Um, anyways, uh,

1137
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:35,730
built during your last podcast,

1138
01:11:35,731 --> 01:11:39,930
you mentioned about fathers decided to
suddenly abandoned their family. Well,

1139
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:44,130
about 11 years ago when I was
stationed in South Dakota,

1140
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:49,740
the guy that I work with did exactly
that. He left his wife, he left his kids,

1141
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,540
uh, in hopes to start a new life. All
right. The story goes something like this,

1142
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,260
settle in everybody. You're still wearing
your course, your Christmas sweaters.

1143
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:02,580
All right. It was back in
1997 a what a great year, Huh?

1144
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:07,620
Clinton was getting blown. Nobody knew
about it. Boy Bands were popular. Right.

1145
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:11,860
How innocent. What a great fucking
time before it all got ugly, you know,

1146
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,730
and people started lighting then nuts
on fire trying to fucking take a plane

1147
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:18,070
down. Um, anyways, uh, Mike, uh,

1148
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:23,120
this Guy Mike was assigned remote duty
for six months in Panama at this point in

1149
01:12:24,361 --> 01:12:28,830
Mike's life. He had about 14
years in the air force, um,

1150
01:12:28,831 --> 01:12:33,831
that is being tasked with re remote
duty playing bullshit war exercises and

1151
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:36,630
being restricted to a military lifestyle.

1152
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:40,440
So one day when I showed up to
work my squadron's first shirt,

1153
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,440
I don't know what that means,
I guess the guy in charge. Um,

1154
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:47,820
and a few officers had had
maps laid out on the table.

1155
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,700
I asked what was going on and
one of the sergeants replied,

1156
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,050
we have a briefing and
15 minutes in formation.

1157
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,160
During that briefing,

1158
01:12:56,161 --> 01:13:01,110
I believe it was the base officer who
mentioned that Mike has been missing since

1159
01:13:01,111 --> 01:13:05,420
the day before the FBI had
some other military branch, uh,

1160
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,420
and some other military branch was
involved to find Mike by Searching South

1161
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,900
Dakota by feet,
automobile and air with helicopters.

1162
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:15,430
So my coworkers and I,
uh,

1163
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:20,450
were tasked to drive about 50 miles to
some remote location in South Dakota to

1164
01:13:21,031 --> 01:13:23,970
post missing posters
of Mike See Attachment.

1165
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:27,090
And he actually has the attachment
here. So anyways, he says, uh,

1166
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,270
we thought he was in danger.
Uh, we were concerned for him.

1167
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:35,370
He was a good guy helping people
out, um, when p when help is needed.

1168
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:39,120
So I'll be totally, there was no sign
that this guy was going to do this shit.

1169
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:43,290
He said he plays bones, which
I guess is dominoes during, uh,

1170
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,170
during lunch with us while
listening to classic rock,

1171
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:49,140
he never came across as being disturbed.
But then again,

1172
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:54,090
I was much younger so I might have, um, I
might've missed some science. All right.

1173
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:57,060
Back to the story of searching for him.
A few days after the search,

1174
01:13:57,061 --> 01:14:02,061
someone reported they found supposedly
his lunchbox with his military id in it.

1175
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:06,720
It was several miles north of where we
were stationed close to North Dakota,

1176
01:14:06,721 --> 01:14:08,940
South Dakota border.
Um,

1177
01:14:08,941 --> 01:14:13,090
then they found his car in a
parking lot of a Canadian airport.

1178
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,070
Shortly after finding his car,

1179
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,760
they detained him in
Panama where he was found.

1180
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,440
Mike left his family in exchange with
some Panamanian woman he met during his

1181
01:14:23,441 --> 01:14:27,670
duty there. Uh, we always wondered what
the hell he was thinking when he did this.

1182
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:32,050
Supposedly he left his lunchbox
near a road with his ID,

1183
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,920
this id in it as a decoy.
And when we drove to the car,

1184
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:39,820
when he drove to the Canadian airport
to flight, he then flew to Panama.

1185
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:41,081
And a,

1186
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:45,610
the big joke was that he was listening
to the song by Van Halen called Panama

1187
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:46,444
when he left.

1188
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:51,000
So they arrested him and discharged him.
Uh,

1189
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:54,310
his wife forgave him,
so evidently I guess he went back.

1190
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:59,200
Dude, you know what I love about that
story? That is the perfect fucking song.

1191
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,690
Oh my God. Just driving away
from your family, his dad.

1192
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:09,500
It would it would it reach down?
He's the seed pack.

1193
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,070
Ah, fuck. You know what? I think you
know what? I think the, the, the,

1194
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:19,090
the feeling of euphoria as you guys ever
watched Ferris Bueller's day off. Sure.

1195
01:15:19,091 --> 01:15:23,260
We all have. Do you know when those two
guys, the parking attendants, you know,

1196
01:15:23,261 --> 01:15:27,460
take the car out for the day and they
show that slow motion thing of when they

1197
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:31,690
go up and over the hill and they get
that look of absolute joy with the wind

1198
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:32,650
blowing through their hair.

1199
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:35,950
I think that's what it feels like to
abandon a family if you're that fucking

1200
01:15:35,951 --> 01:15:40,720
miserable. So, uh, God bless
that woman for taking them back.

1201
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:45,780
That's either a deep kind of love
or just no options whatsoever.

1202
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:51,760
Um, so there you go. And I think that's
going to be the podcast for this week.

1203
01:15:51,761 --> 01:15:56,440
Let's do some classic stuff here. Some
overrated, underrated, real quick. Bill.

1204
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:58,000
Overrated skinny girls.

1205
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:01,780
I've never understood the
appeal of super skinny girls.

1206
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:04,900
They look more like little boys
than women. Plus they're a,

1207
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:08,020
they usually snobby and expect
you to do all the work in bed.

1208
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:13,240
They like Kobe Bryant. They are jaded and
sex is more like a job for them. Dude.

1209
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:15,130
What you hook up with coke?
Uh,

1210
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:18,460
they don't understand the magic
of the game anymore. Okay,

1211
01:16:18,461 --> 01:16:20,470
I see what you're saying.
Do we talk about Colby?

1212
01:16:20,471 --> 01:16:24,970
Did you see Colby a yes on Christmas it
down by like 20 points and he's still

1213
01:16:24,971 --> 01:16:26,740
draws an offensive foul.
That guy,

1214
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:29,890
I'm a Celtics fan and I admit that's
a fucking best player in the league.

1215
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:34,850
All right. But my big complaint
about Colby Bryan is um, AH,

1216
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:39,850
Jesus Christ my fucking
alarm. Um, anyways, my uh,

1217
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:42,310
my big complaint about Kobe Bryant,

1218
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:44,770
I just want Laker fans cause
you guys watch them every night.

1219
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,670
I'm not being a jerk, but when was
the last time you saw him take a shot?

1220
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:53,080
Missed the shot and not look
over at the ref for a foul?

1221
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:56,890
It's almost like he's saying ref. It
didn't go in. They must have found me.

1222
01:16:57,130 --> 01:17:01,000
That's how fucking good I am. It's
annoying. But I totally respect that guy.

1223
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:05,080
I love his game. He needs Nisa that whole
teams riding on his fucking coattails.

1224
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:10,220
Um, alright. Underrated fat chicks.
Fat Chicks are the real deal.

1225
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:13,160
They do everything they
can to please you in bed.

1226
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:16,160
They're the only ones who
can give you a decent hump.

1227
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,580
They are like the guy t uh,

1228
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:22,490
taking the half court shot for 10
grand no matter what the outcome.

1229
01:17:22,491 --> 01:17:26,900
They still have a smile on the face and
they're just happy to be there. Do that.

1230
01:17:26,901 --> 01:17:30,140
I'm telling you, some of you fucking
listeners really ought to do stand up.

1231
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,620
Let's just, you know, do you want me,
comedians could write something that good.

1232
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:35,990
All right. Probably a few of them,
but that's really impressive.

1233
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:38,720
I forgot to do the life advice.
Doctor Bill.

1234
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:43,610
I get a blow through this and speaking,
speaking of, uh, becoming a comedian,

1235
01:17:43,611 --> 01:17:46,040
somebody who wants some life advice
and this is a rough one. He says,

1236
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:49,610
I got some shit going on in my life and
it's really starting to make me reflect

1237
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:54,080
on where I'm going and, uh, what I want to
be. Okay. So I need some answers. First,

1238
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:56,030
my grandfather raised
me from the age of two,

1239
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:59,000
almost died and recently had a
quadruple bypass on his heart.

1240
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:01,640
No idea how long he's
going to make it, but, uh,

1241
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:06,380
it's definitely given me a new perspective
on life. All I think about now is, um,

1242
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:10,550
what were the things that he
didn't do and always wanted to, uh,

1243
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:14,240
fuck regretting things you did. I wonder
about the things he regrets not doing.

1244
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,020
Um,
I'm 29 years old.

1245
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:22,100
I work as a senior manager for a
major company that builds airplanes.

1246
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:25,850
I make over a hundred grand a year
and I fucking hate it. I mean, uh,

1247
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,640
this part of the world and
I'm not going to mention, uh,

1248
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:31,470
I do stand up comedy almost
every other weekend, eh,

1249
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,280
at one of the comedy clubs there.
My question is this,

1250
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:39,460
can I ever make a trans transition from
work to stand up performing outside of

1251
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:44,000
La or New York or do you think I will
have to quit everything and move to one of

1252
01:18:44,001 --> 01:18:48,470
those locations also? Do you think
it's worth it? I know I'm funny.

1253
01:18:48,471 --> 01:18:52,400
I know I'm a good comedian.
I feel I make like, uh, uh,

1254
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,570
I feel like making a living as a comic
would be similar to winning the lottery.

1255
01:18:56,990 --> 01:18:58,040
Even though I'm funny.

1256
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:02,330
It's still one in a million shot that I
would ever be able to make it a career.

1257
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:06,400
Thank you. Uh, thanks for any
advice you have. Alright. Do that.

1258
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:10,670
Those are tough questions because I've
never seen your act and those are really

1259
01:19:10,671 --> 01:19:14,660
questions that only you can answer.
I'm not trying to cop out here.

1260
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,700
All right? But, uh, I do know this.
If you do a job and you're miserable,

1261
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:23,390
you know, I mean, we want to, if
you're making $1 million a year,

1262
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:26,390
I mean a hundred grads fucking sneezer.
Uh,

1263
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:32,390
I dunno dude. Um, all I can do
is tell you how I looked at it.

1264
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:36,290
And when I went into being a comedian,
I was not making a hundred grand a year.

1265
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:39,110
So it was very simple for me to
make that choice to go there.

1266
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:44,000
And I never really thought about not
making it other than a couple of times,

1267
01:19:44,001 --> 01:19:47,570
if I was doing a college gig in the middle
of fucking nowhere and I was sitting

1268
01:19:47,571 --> 01:19:50,900
in a super eight and I bombed that night,
then I'd be going like,

1269
01:19:50,901 --> 01:19:54,650
what the fuck am I doing?
This is crazy, you know? Um,

1270
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:59,990
but being able to make a living as a
comedian is not a one in a million chance.

1271
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,780
And, uh, believe it or not,

1272
01:20:02,781 --> 01:20:05,930
making it as a comedian is not a
one in a million chance because a,

1273
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:07,110
I'm going to go out on a limb and say,

1274
01:20:07,111 --> 01:20:09,120
there's not a million
standup comedians out there.

1275
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:13,260
Your rods are better than that.
It might be 750,000.

1276
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:18,000
No, dude, you gotta, you gotta
look, do you go out of the
club and in like, you just,

1277
01:20:18,001 --> 01:20:21,870
you go in there and you just feel
like this is home. You know, like,

1278
01:20:21,871 --> 01:20:25,500
this is where I'm supposed to be. If
that's what you feel, then I would do it.

1279
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:29,550
And you don't have to live
in New York or La to, uh,

1280
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,470
to get a career going.
Um,

1281
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:37,330
oh Jesus. I'm trying to give you an
example. I mean there's, there's every,

1282
01:20:37,331 --> 01:20:40,880
every stand up town has the,

1283
01:20:40,881 --> 01:20:45,520
the local guys who never left, who
make a living at it, you know, um,

1284
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:48,970
it's just one of those things where
you want to expand your horizons after

1285
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:52,810
awhile where, uh, you know,

1286
01:20:52,811 --> 01:20:57,020
you want to start making better money
or whatever, but, um, I dunno dude,

1287
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,190
like if it's your dream in life,
that's what you want to do,

1288
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,630
then I would definitely do it.

1289
01:21:02,631 --> 01:21:05,930
Especially cause if you're at work and
you're fucking miserable than I would do

1290
01:21:05,931 --> 01:21:10,520
it. And making a living at it is not
as difficult as it seems. You know,

1291
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:13,010
you get a college age and you
stopped booking college gigs.

1292
01:21:13,011 --> 01:21:16,730
Granted you've got to fly all
over the fucking country. Um,

1293
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:17,841
but you know,

1294
01:21:17,841 --> 01:21:21,020
if you want to go fucking see Sherlock
Holmes in the middle of a Tuesday,

1295
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:21,913
you know,

1296
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:25,400
dress like a shithead and not take a
shower till seven o'clock at night,

1297
01:21:25,401 --> 01:21:27,680
that's one of the great things
about being a comedian. But do,

1298
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:31,940
that's a huge decision. You gotta
make that on your own. But a,

1299
01:21:31,941 --> 01:21:33,140
I would make the happy choice.

1300
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:35,690
Don't choose money because you're going
to end up like one of those Stepford

1301
01:21:35,691 --> 01:21:39,470
wives. You know what I mean? We got
all this shit. Any of your fucking,

1302
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:43,190
you've got all this stuff,
but you're miserable. So, um,

1303
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,160
I don't know man. That's, that's too big.

1304
01:21:46,161 --> 01:21:49,970
That's too big a question for me to ask
you to answer for you a without knowing

1305
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:54,410
you. So I hope I helped you
out. Uh, I probably didn't
help you out at all, but uh,

1306
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,110
it believe me do it. It's not as
hard as you think it is. All right.

1307
01:21:58,170 --> 01:21:59,040
It's not fucking easy,

1308
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:03,450
but it's really not as hard as you think
it is a to make a living as a comedian.

1309
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:04,950
All right, let's get
to a question bill. Hi.

1310
01:22:04,951 --> 01:22:09,760
My question is when you are a cup
in a couple situation, situation,

1311
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:10,913
spelt with a c,

1312
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:14,940
what is the protocol for who or how
you decorate your Christmas tree?

1313
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:18,930
Do you do it together or
separately or in stages? You know,

1314
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:21,990
one puts it in the stand when
puts the lights, et Cetera,

1315
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:26,310
or do you put a not put one up or not?
Um,

1316
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:31,880
all right. Uh, Christmas tree question
questions are real late this week.

1317
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:38,300
Um, now my thing is if I buy it, you
decorated and if you decorate it, no,

1318
01:22:38,301 --> 01:22:43,010
if you buy it, you better decorate it
because I'm not doing it. In other words,

1319
01:22:43,011 --> 01:22:46,250
I, I don't, I don't decorate Christmas
trees. That's how I do it around here.

1320
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:50,870
I go out and I buy it. I stick it
in the stand. And uh, then my girl,

1321
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:54,020
she goes nuts. She decorates it
and she goes, does not look nice.

1322
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:57,890
What do you think about, you didn't
say anything. No, I think it's nice.

1323
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,550
I know that I thought, I thought you were
just going to come in and be like, wow,

1324
01:23:01,551 --> 01:23:04,490
look at it.
It looks beautiful.

1325
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:09,700
Christmas tree fell Christmas. See, I buy
that. You're going to do that. Really?

1326
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:11,440
What would you do if I did that?

1327
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:18,070
Speak of the devil.
Mino

1328
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:25,260
Hey, I'm doing my podcast.
I'm doing it right now.

1329
01:23:25,261 --> 01:23:29,410
You're on it,
everybody.

1330
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,510
All right. All right. All right. Okay.
Okay. Let me call you back in two minutes.

1331
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:40,410
I'm almost done. Hi. Bye. He's Christ.

1332
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:43,880
I'm such a space shot. I like half.
Forgot that I was doing a podcast is, hey,

1333
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:49,130
just calling to let you know then I'm
not home yet and I'm gonna be home soon

1334
01:23:50,821 --> 01:23:55,500
and I just wanted to start talking
to you are ready. Um, you know,

1335
01:23:55,501 --> 01:23:57,480
a lot of people, a couple of people
have been emailing me saying,

1336
01:23:57,481 --> 01:24:01,350
I'm mean to my girlfriend. I'm not, I'm
not meeting my girlfriend. I give a shit.

1337
01:24:01,351 --> 01:24:05,610
It's my way of, um, protecting
what I have in this relationship.

1338
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:10,290
All right? I keep it light. I
fucking break balls. Oh, by the way,

1339
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:14,100
I'm doing this on a Sunday because I'm
going to the Celtics fucking clippers

1340
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:16,240
tonight.
And uh,

1341
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:20,340
I'm actually walked away from
the TV last I saw was like 15,

1342
01:24:20,341 --> 01:24:23,700
14 cults over the jets.
Um,

1343
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:27,110
I dunno if I should say,
I'm not going to say this.

1344
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:30,840
You know what you guys remind me next
week to tell you my prediction of rex.

1345
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:31,281
I actually,

1346
01:24:31,281 --> 01:24:36,200
my prediction earlier this year of Rex
Ryan was that he was gonna break his

1347
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:41,201
tailbone in a failed attempt
to hang himself at some point.

1348
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:46,520
I've never seen, I have not seen
such a desperate need to be liked.

1349
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:52,850
I'm telling you,
that guy is emotionally on the edge.

1350
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:58,220
All right? That fucking bizarre
Christmas wishlist thing that he did.

1351
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:03,850
Like, uh, you know, I'm hosting SNL,
but I'm actually fucking a coach.

1352
01:25:03,851 --> 01:25:07,690
And he said to that guy is
out of his fucking mind,

1353
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:11,530
and he's broken down crying
a couple times, and I've
made predictions this year,

1354
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:16,650
Dad, I'm telling you, I can't tell
you who's gonna win a fucking game,

1355
01:25:16,651 --> 01:25:20,950
but shit like that. I'm telling you, I
watch that Pacquiao fight and I fucking.
