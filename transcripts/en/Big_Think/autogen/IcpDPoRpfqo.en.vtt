on their on the wine farms and have had
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.979
on their on the wine farms and have had
a kind of paternalistic relationship

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989
a kind of paternalistic relationship
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.350
a kind of paternalistic relationship
with the wine farm owners where they

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
with the wine farm owners where they
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.810

in wine and so the huge problems of
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.850

alcoholism so for me going in there

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
alcoholism so for me going in there
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.610
alcoholism so for me going in there
it was the beginning I think of my

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
it was the beginning I think of my
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.970
it was the beginning I think of my
disillusion actually with the process of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980
disillusion actually with the process of
 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.149
disillusion actually with the process of
using film as a research tool I'm not

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
using film as a research tool I'm not
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039
using film as a research tool I'm not
saying I wouldn't do it again but I

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
saying I wouldn't do it again but I
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.870
saying I wouldn't do it again but I
would be very wary of going into a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.060
with a video camera and clearly from a
different class and I sort of turned up

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070
different class and I sort of turned up
 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100
different class and I sort of turned up
on these on these wine farms initially

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
on these on these wine farms initially
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.440

does become an incredibly important

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
does become an incredibly important

power imbalance never goes away and if
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.330
power imbalance never goes away and if
you're not very careful I think it's um

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
you're not very careful I think it's um
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.180
you're not very careful I think it's um
it's very damaging

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190
 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.770

I think it's the Saints that I wouldn't
 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.720
I think it's the Saints that I wouldn't
want to ever film in a community again

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730
want to ever film in a community again
 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.620
want to ever film in a community again

since this sort of paternalistic labor

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650
since this sort of paternalistic labor
 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.310
since this sort of paternalistic labor
relations system ended for me to really

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320
relations system ended for me to really
 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.410

feel like these workers in the community

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420
feel like these workers in the community
 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.470
feel like these workers in the community
have had enough sense of agency to feel

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480
have had enough sense of agency to feel
 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.050
have had enough sense of agency to feel
that they you know could tell me know at

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060
that they you know could tell me know at
 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.450
that they you know could tell me know at
certain moments so it was a constant

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460
certain moments so it was a constant
 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.190
certain moments so it was a constant
sort of I was trying to read it but you

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200
sort of I was trying to read it but you
 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.920
sort of I was trying to read it but you
know I than I thought that I was

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930
know I than I thought that I was
 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.090
know I than I thought that I was
actually overstepping boundaries because

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100
actually overstepping boundaries because
 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.700
actually overstepping boundaries because
they you know didn't feel like they had

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710
they you know didn't feel like they had
 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.430
they you know didn't feel like they had
a right to maintain those boundaries so

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440
a right to maintain those boundaries so
 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.810
a right to maintain those boundaries so
and I think if I ever did work in a film

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820
and I think if I ever did work in a film
 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.660
and I think if I ever did work in a film
project again I would I would pick a

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670
project again I would I would pick a
 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.530
project again I would I would pick a
community that was of a more similar I

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540
community that was of a more similar I
 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.320
community that was of a more similar I
would say class particularly class

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330
would say class particularly class
 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.440
would say class particularly class
background so that you thought that they

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450
background so that you thought that they
 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.820
background so that you thought that they
were always Co participants in

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830
 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.600
maybe not yeah maybe it wouldn't and

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610
maybe not yeah maybe it wouldn't and
 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.040
maybe not yeah maybe it wouldn't and
there's always the argument that you

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050
there's always the argument that you
 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.140
there's always the argument that you
know disenfranchised people need a voice

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
know disenfranchised people need a voice
 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.790
know disenfranchised people need a voice
and their voices are silenced as it is

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800
and their voices are silenced as it is
 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.640
and their voices are silenced as it is
and that anything that can you know give

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650
and that anything that can you know give
 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.010
and that anything that can you know give
them a voice but again that the ethics

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020
them a voice but again that the ethics
 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.080
them a voice but again that the ethics
of doing that I'm not sure how it works

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090
of doing that I'm not sure how it works
 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.370
of doing that I'm not sure how it works
and I actually think it's a new

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380
and I actually think it's a new
 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.370
and I actually think it's a new
generation in South Africa of a black

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380
generation in South Africa of a black
 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.700
generation in South Africa of a black
middle class that is emerging emerging

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710
middle class that is emerging emerging
 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.860
middle class that is emerging emerging
at the moment and I think that's going

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870
at the moment and I think that's going
 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.920
at the moment and I think that's going
to very interesting generation to watch

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930
to very interesting generation to watch
 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.570
to very interesting generation to watch
just artistically I think they will be

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580
just artistically I think they will be
 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.230
just artistically I think they will be
able to create art that is indigenous in

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240
able to create art that is indigenous in
 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.560
able to create art that is indigenous in
a way that perhaps can sidestep some of

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570
a way that perhaps can sidestep some of
 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.800
a way that perhaps can sidestep some of
those collisions
