Adriene: Welcome to Crash Course
Economics, I’m Adriene Hill,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.069
Jacob: and I’m Jacob Clifford, and today we’re going to talk about labor markets, a pretty important topic.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.780
Adriene: Unless you're independently wealthy,
or fine with living in your parents basement,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.980
you probably need to get a job. But how do you even
get a job? And what kind of job should you get?

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.420
In a lot of ways, it comes down to
supplying a skill that someone else demands.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:29.500
[Theme Music]

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.520
This is Cristiano Ronaldo. He makes about
$20 million a year playing soccer. Or football,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.250
depending on where you live. Pretty much everybody
would agree no one NEEDS that kind of money,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.020
but does he deserve it? How do his employers, the
Real Madrid Football Club, justify this huge salary?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.100
Admittedly, the market for professional athletes is complex, but on some level, it’s supply and demand.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.800
The supply of people that have the skills to
be world class soccer players is low.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.540
And the demand for world class soccer
players is incredibly high.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.900
Ronaldo might be willing to play for only
10 million dollars a year; it’s a lot of money.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.200
He might even play for 5 million. And
if he really truly loved the beautiful game,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.580
he might do it for free. So why is he getting
20 million dollars?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.280
This goes back to that really high demand.
Having a superstar on your team generates

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.939
millions in ticket and merchandise sales.
It might help you win some of the many cups

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.689
up for grabs in international football. So
Real Madrid thought Ronaldo and his double

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.849
scissor move, were worth 20 million dollars,
and Ronaldo agreed, so they have a contract.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:38.360
These same ideas explain how wages are determined in nearly every labor market. Let’s go the Thought Bubble.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.920
Jacob: Usually when Stan goes to the mall
he's the buyer. He demands sunglasses and

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.119
giant pretzels and the businesses supply them.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.460
But if he wants a job at the mall’s pretzel
shop, the roles are reversed. Since he supplies

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.170
labor, he is now the seller and the pretzel
shop owner becomes the buyer. A buyer of labor.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.680
Now, that’s when wage negotiation ensues.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.240
Stan could insist on a wage of $25 an hour
for his pretzel skills, but the owner would

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.909
point out that they could easily hire other
people for much less. The owner could offer

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.100
Stan a wage of only $1 per hour, but Stan would point out that he could easily get paid more at the Froyo shop.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.040
In the end, they agree on a wage that makes
each of them better off. The owner gets some

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.150
help around the store and Stan earns money
so he can buy even cooler sunglasses.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.200
Economists call this voluntary exchange.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.180
The supply of labor depends on the number
of people that are qualified to do the job.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.010
Stan would love to get paid more, but since
warming up pretzels doesn’t require extensive

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.720
skills, the supply of capable workers is high
and consequently the wage is relatively low.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.040
But that doesn’t mean that Stan is going to work for peanuts.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.580
The wage offered has to cover his opportunity cost --

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.900
-- the value of his lost free time and the money he could be making doing something else.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.470
The demand for labor depends on the demand
for the products a business sells.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.340
Economists call this derived demand. If pretzel
demand is booming, then the store owners are

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.390
going to want more pretzel makers. If other
stores also need more employees, demand for

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.290
workers will increase and drive up wages.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.050
Thanks Thought Bubble. Supply and demand explains
why wages are different for different professions.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.960
Engineers are in high demand because they
produce the products that many consumers want

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.510
and their supply is limited because the training
for these jobs is pretty difficult.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.290
Social workers and historians, aren’t paid
as much, even though their work is important

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.620
because demand is relatively low and supply
is relatively high. It’s not rocket science.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.330
Adriene: Supply and demand explain a lot,
but there are several reasons why wages in

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.260
a labor market don’t end up at a competitive
equilibrium. Sometimes workers get paid less

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.500
not because they have different skill levels,
but because of their race, ethnic origin,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.980
sex, age, or other characteristics. This is
called wage discrimination.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.960
Wages might also be unfairly low when a labor
market is a monopsony -- when there is only

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.520
one company hiring and workers are relatively
immobile. When you’re the only employer,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.980
workers have to take what you offer, or they’re
out of luck.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.860
Take the NCAA, the organization that
regulates college athletics in the US.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.810
Many economists point out that high profile college athletes are generating millions of dollars for their

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.780
schools, but they’re forced to accept a very low
“wage” of a scholarship with free tuition.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.710
Now sure, baseball and hockey players can
skip straight to the pros, but the NFL prohibits

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.010
drafting football players until three years
after high school. And NBA teams can’t draft

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.930
basketball players until they’re 19.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.859
There are some situations where wages might
actually be higher than market equilibrium.

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.870
For example, some employers might voluntarily
offer higher than normal wages to increase

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.020
worker productivity and retention. Economists
call this efficiency wages.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.110
Henry Ford doubled the wages of assembly line
workers in 1914 to keep them from seeking

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.520
jobs elsewhere. And this still goes on
today. You may not be completely happy with

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.980
your job, but if it offers way more than what
everyone else is paying, you're less likely to quit.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.330
Unions can also drive up wages. A union is
an organization that advances the collective

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.510
interest of employees and strives to improve
working conditions and increase wages.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.930
They do this through collective bargaining.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.120
Representatives for the workers negotiate
with employers and if their demands aren’t met,

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.139
workers go on strike, and stop production
altogether. Although unions were once very

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.499
strong in the US, union membership and their
strength has declined since the 1950s.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.020
At their height, approximately 1 in 3 American workers were in a labor union. These days it's more like 1 in 9,

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.660
and the largest unions represent workers in the public sector, like teachers and firefighters.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.840
Wages might also not be at equilibrium when
there is a minimum wage -- basically a price

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.680
floor that prevents employers from paying
workers below a specific amount.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.280
Technically, in the US, minimum wage
affects less than 3% of workers.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.439
But the Brookings Institution estimates that
an increase in the minimum wage likely wouldn’t

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:44.039
just impact that small slice of the labor
market. It would also drive up the wages of

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.879
people who make just above the minimum wage.
According to Brookings, that ripple effect

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:52.569
could raise the wages of nearly 30% of the
workforce.

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.409
The debate over whether or not there should
be a minimum wage, and how high that minimum

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.879
wage should be, gets pretty heated pretty
fast.

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:05.499
Some classical economists argue against nearly all forms of government manipulation in competitive markets.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.860
They say the minimum wage not only leads to unemployment, but it actually hurts the people it claims to help.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.820
Their logic goes something like this: A minimum wage deters employers from hiring unskilled workers,

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:23.020
hiring only skilled or semi-skilled workers instead.
These economists argue that minimum wage

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.310
does little or nothing to alleviate poverty,
since instead of earning a minimum wage, unskilled

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.930
workers end up earning no wage at all.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.320
The economists that support a minimum wage argue that real life labor markets aren’t as competitive

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.620
or transparent as classical economists suggest. They believe that employers have the upper hand

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.639
when it comes to negotiating wages and that individual workers lack bargaining power.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.919
I’m not going to tell you what to think,
but think about it like this: if a grocery

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:54.830
store wasn’t required to pay $7.25 an hour,
and the grocery store was the only place hiring,

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:01.500
they could likely squeeze individual employees to accepting lower than market value. In this interpretation,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.780
minimum wage isn’t interfering with competitive markets, as much as it’s correcting a market failure.

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:12.189
Remember anti-trust laws that prevent powerful
monopolies from charging higher prices? Economists

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:17.940
that support minimum wage laws say they prevent
employers from using their power to exploit workers.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.080
The economists who are entirely opposed to
minimum wage laws are losing the policy battle.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.219
Most countries around the world have minimum
wage laws, and many of those countries without

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:32.139
them have de facto minimum wages, set by collective
bargaining agreements.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.460
But even among economists who support some
sort of minimum wage, there’s disagreement

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:42.200
over how high that minimum wage should be, and what raising the minimum wage might do to the economy.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:49.060
Consider the U.S.: the current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. In 2014, 600 economists, including

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:55.400
7 Nobel Prize winners signed a letter arguing that the minimum wage should be increased to $10.10 an hour.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.900
They argued that raising the minimum wage
could have a small benefit to the economy.

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:04.479
Workers, with their newly increased wages,
would spend more. This would increase demand,

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:06.839
and perhaps help stimulate employment.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.760
But some of those same economists balked when
it came to the question of raising the minimum

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:16.159
wage to fifteen dollars an hour. They argue
that even if a fifteen dollar an hour minimum

00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:21.499
wage might make sense in an expensive city,
like Los Angeles or New York, where the median

00:08:21.499 --> 00:08:26.879
income is relatively high, it could have a
significant negative effect on employment

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:29.559
in a city or town where incomes are lower.

00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:35.350
If economics was a pure science, we could
just test these ideas under controlled circumstances.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:40.500
We could have one state set a significantly higher minimum wage than its neighbor and see what happens.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.840
It turns out that happened in 1992, and
economists David Card and Alan Krueger studied it.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:52.880
New Jersey raised its minimum wage from $4.25
to $5.05 while Pennsylvania kept theirs at $4.25.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.760
The economists surveyed large fast
food chains along the state’s shared border

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.480
and found that workers didn’t get fired, in fact, employment in New Jersey actually increased.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.400
But it’s far from settled. There have also
been studies that indicate raising the minimum

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:13.100
wage DOES increase unemployment. A relatively
recent survey of economists, by the University

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.250
of Chicago, found that a small majority think
raising the minimum wage to nine dollars an

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.650
hour would make it noticeably harder for poor
people to get work.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.120
But, and this is where it gets interesting,
a slim majority also thought the increase

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.130
would be worthwhile, because the benefits
to people who could find jobs at nine dollars

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.250
an hour would outweigh the negative effect
on overall employment.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.690
Jacob: Very few economists argue a higher
minimum wage will end poverty, but some argue

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:45.410
that it could reduce poverty. The minimum
wage doesn’t exist in vacuum. Policies that

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.100
fight poverty should also focus on providing
education and skills.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.130
Adriene: Those skills are what the labor market
values. It’s those skills that are in short

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:59.620
supply and high demand, and will command higher
wages. So, while you’re waiting for economists

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.890
to figure all this out, you might want to
learn a new skill. Practice your double scissor,

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.020
and maybe take Ronaldo’s job.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.900
