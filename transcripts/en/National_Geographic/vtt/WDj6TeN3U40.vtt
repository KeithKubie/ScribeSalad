00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.467
So Travis, are you there?

00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:03.967
I am here.
I've been summoned.

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:05.567
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON
(VOICEOVER): Hey! [laughter]

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.433
[cheering and applause]

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:10.300
So you're a professional
psychologist but also

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.300
a fan of "Game of Thrones"?

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.400
Oh, yes.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.500
I am a psychology
professor, a big nerd,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.533
and I love using fiction to
talk about real psychology.

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:24.400
And I have here your book,
"Game of Thrones Psychology"--

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.967
that's the name of
the book-- "The Mind

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:29.867
Is Dark and Full of Terrors."

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:33.800
So what's the takeaway from
all this violence in the minds

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.200
of who's portrayed, in
their time and in their day,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.633
and what effect it might
have on the audience?

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.066
That's complicated.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.867
There are a lot of
different reasons.

00:00:43.867 --> 00:00:45.500
In real life it can
be hard to study.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.033
We know that in
experiments that watching

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:53.800
violence produces short-term
effects on someone's behavior.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.500
But it's hard to
study in the long run.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
If you have an idea that
this can turn someone

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.600
into a violent psychopath,
it's not exactly ethical

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.100
or practical to do that study.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.633
In fact, you look
in the military,

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.500
of course-- some
people would suffer

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.600
from PTSD and others don't.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.867
Others come home--

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:13.233
And you can not always
predict who it's going to be.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.500
That's interesting, because
if you could predict,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.633
that would be an amazing
advance in our understanding

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:20.100
of the psychological
state of warriors.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.300
There are people who,
as a form of coping

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.900
with horrible situations, do
shut down parts of themselves.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.133
We also know that traumatic
brain injury-- injury to areas

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.367
in the frontal
cortex-- can shut off

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:37.233
their empathy for other people.

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:38.300
OK.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.400
Tell me about the
psychology of revenge.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.500
This is a recurring theme
in "Game of Thrones."

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.767
And I have to confess, revenge--
you know that feels good.

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:52.867
So it's got to be something
deep inside of us.

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:56.400
We want to feel power--
power over our own lives,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.734
over others.

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:00.266
And when we feel mistreated,
when something horrible has

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.767
happened that made
us feel helpless,

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:04.567
it's hard to maintain a
sense of feeling strong.

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:07.667
Revenge is one way of
feeling we've restored

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:11.700
a sense of balance, of justice
in the world and a sense

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.834
of power for ourselves.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:16.734
So if that is something
fundamental within us

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:20.667
and you have a clever
screenwriter, storyteller,

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:23.667
cinematographer, they would
portray this and that would

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:26.934
resonate deeply within us and
we want to see more of it,

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:28.133
presumably.

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:30.400
And I always said I really
think "Game of Thrones"

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.133
is so popular because of the
psychology of the characters.

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:35.934
It's not about the dragons, the
White Walkers, or the magic.

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:37.667
It's about the human beings.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:39.533
They hadn't had
dragons in a long time.

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.500
For most of them, they're
concerned about dragons--

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.567
the idea of dragons.

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:45.667
Ideas affect their whole lives.

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:46.867
OK.

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:49.433
Thank you for sharing your
psychological insights.

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:50.233
Thank you.

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:51.300
This was fun.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.233
[applause]

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:53.066
So thanks again.

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:54.367
All right, everyone-- Travis.

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:55.367
Thank you.
