00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:07.006
- We're going to release the
chakras, starting with the top,

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.608
the second, the third,
the fourth, the fifth,

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:13.546 align:start size:88% position:13%
the sixth, the seventh,

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:16.516
(breathing loudly)

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:21.854
- Bro!

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:23.389
We gotta hit up Nothing.

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:24.623
- I don't know what that means.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.259
- No, Nothing, it's
the most popping club

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.461 align:start size:84% position:16%
in L.A., dude,
everyone knows that.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.296
- The club's called Nothing?

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.964 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Come on, man,
name's are played out.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:34.367 align:start size:84% position:16%
Anyway, I met this
dude at the weed shop,

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.937
he got me on the list plus
one tonight, and we're going.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.939 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Bro, I've gotta focus,
man, I can't go out

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.807
getting shitfaced,
what if Amy calls me

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:43.943 align:start size:94% position:6%
for an emergency
audition and I'm hungover

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.412 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I throw up all over
Tarantino, then I'm fucked.

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:48.714 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Okay, well I see Tarantino
out all the time, dude,

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:51.417 align:start size:94% position:6%
so it's good to be social,
it's called networking.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:54.119 align:start size:84% position:16%
Actors, directors,
producers, they're all

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.322
out shaking babies
and kissing dicks.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.224
- If I'm at a club and
I see a baby or anybody

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.126
kissing a dick, I'm
gonna kill myself.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.327
- You need to get laid.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.495
How long's it been?

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.729
- Who cares?

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.264 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Not since you
moved to L.A., huh.

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:07.567 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah, because I'm
focused on my dream, Rick.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.603 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Bro, I want you to
succeed, this is your dream,

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.906
and it's like yeah, I wanna
keep living out here too.

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.441
Eventually find my dream.

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.343
It ain't in a Iowa cornfield.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:18.844
We moved to Hollywood.

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:21.514
Let's fuckin' live in Hollywood.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:24.850
- That's a good point,
man, Tarantino, though?

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.252
- Yes.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.453
- I do miss boobs.

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:30.457
- You deserve 'em, two of 'em.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.992
(upbeat music)

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.767
- Hope my boy put
us on the list.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.502
- I thought you said
we were on the list.

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:45.772 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well yeah, I didn't follow
up or anything, he's not

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:49.609 align:start size:97% position:3%
responding to any of my
texts, so that's a good sign.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.810
Hey, what's up, man?

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.811
- Yo, name.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.947
- Rick Marcuzzi, plus one.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.983
- [Bouncer] That's a cool dance.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:02:00.019 align:start size:84% position:16%
Alright I got a
Marcuzzi, no plus one.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.220
- What?

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.387 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Bouncer] You don't
have a plus one.

00:02:02.387 --> 00:02:04.824
- Oh, you don't recognize him.

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:09.129 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No.
- Gary Scalzo, Game of Thrones

season 12, the
final arc, he played

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:18.504
the Raven's dad at the
Battle of Gargamill.

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:20.839 align:start size:94% position:6%
- There's only six seasons
of Game of Thrones.

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.510 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's no way this
little guy's an actor.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.045
- Oh yeah I am, I'm on season 69

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.848
of How I Fucked Your Mother.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:31.417 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Now both of you guys
aren't getting in.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:34.153
- Oh no, what do we do now?

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:37.257 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Have a nice night, you guys.
- Eat my shit.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:39.859
(upbeat music)

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:49.035
- [Rick] Season 69, dude
that was so fuckin' funny.

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.336 align:start size:81% position:19%
- What a dick door
guy, it's like

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.770
you can't even let
in one more dude?

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.006 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's insane, it's like,
you're just standing

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:55.841 align:start size:88% position:13%
in front of a door,
that's all you're doing,

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:57.743 align:start size:97% position:3%
there's no degree for
that, you know what I mean,

00:02:57.743 --> 00:03:01.213 align:start size:84% position:16%
like anybody can
buy a clipboard, I
can buy a clipboard,

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:03.215
it wasn't given to
you by a wizard,

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:05.418
it's not a special
thing, like fuck you,

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.953
you dickless fuck stick.

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:09.221
- [Woman] Who is that?

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:10.790
- Oh, hello.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.057
Babies.

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:15.061
- Holy shit.
- I'm going in.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:18.398 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Tell 'em that I
worked out awhile ago.

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:25.138
I mean, that's so hot.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:28.808
(screaming)

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:31.044
Oh hey, sup.

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:35.448
- He looks like a potato!
- No, he's a great human.

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:38.084
(upbeat music)

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.766
- You wanted boobs, I got
you eight, five are real.

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:58.404
Just breathe and throw
that Gary game, player.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.273
- Gary's here.

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.842
(upbeat music)

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:06.012
Those tacos were good, right?

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:08.514 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah they were great,
do you have any more coke?

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.117
- No I don't do coke.
- Of course you don't.

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:11.951
It's fine.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.190 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Maybe we could
get some more tacos.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What, so I can
snort some taco meat?

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.127
Fuckin' idiot.

00:04:22.527 --> 00:04:24.964
- [Woman] This is my profile.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:27.300
- Oh, these are all selfies.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.970 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah, but I have different
eyeliner on in each one.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.105
- Oh, right, that's
to distract people

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:35.641
from your lazy eye right,
so they don't notice it.

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:36.675
- Excuse me?

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:39.612
- Yeah, that one's like weird.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.214
- So he basically got me VIP
afterwards and I was like,

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:43.782
"Ugh, what do I look
like, a poor person?"

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:45.818 align:start size:97% position:3%
'Cause only poor people get
VIP, you know what I'm saying?

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:47.687 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I met this other promoter
who got me Artist Guest

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:50.322
and took me to see Calvin
Harris who was so dope.

00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:53.325
Who was your favorite
at Coachella this year?

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:55.995 align:start size:75% position:25%
- At Coachella?
- Yeah.

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:57.563
- I didn't go.

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:59.832 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You don't like Coachella?
- No.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:02.835 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Ugh, I was totally
gonna fuck you.

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:06.472
- I love Coachella, I love it.

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.574
- [Rick] Serious, I lobbed
up all those babies for you.

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.810
- I know man, I'm
a little rusty.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.480
- Rustier than the tin man
suckin' a waterfall's dick.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.483
Okay just repeat
this really loudly.

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:25.525
- What Rick, we have too much
molly, I guess just throw it

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:28.995 align:start size:88% position:13%
away or give it to
like a homeless family.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.363
(screams)

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:31.931
- [All] No, no, no.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.201
- Oh you guys want some?

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:54.120
I smell some fresh genitals.

00:05:55.454 --> 00:05:57.256
- [Woman] Ew it's that
guy who hates Coachella,

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.524
he's the worst.

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:02.261 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Gary, why don't
you go grab a joint.

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:03.863
Lighten up the mood, huh?

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.264
- [Woman] Yeah, go.

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:09.035 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Alright alright, lighten
it up, let's do it.

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.905
(upbeat music)

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:38.631
- Hey it's locked.

00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:40.466
(women exclaiming)

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:42.101
Door's locked.

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:43.836
Joint patrol is here!

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:47.940
- [Rick] Oh fuck yeah,
right there, right there.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.242
Hey, it's Gary.

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:53.279
(upbeat music)
