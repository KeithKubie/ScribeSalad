00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.366
My name is Tyehimba Jess

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:06.673
and the title of this poem

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:12.945
is “Negro Migration 1917–67”

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.621
The North lies waiting
with its concrete, hustler mouth,

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:25.591
with electric
boulevard pickpocket hands,

00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:29.495
with its icicled breath
of tenement dreams.

00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:33.833
The North lies with its clutch
of factory smoked paychecks

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:37.070
and its diamond toothed
stock holder grin,

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.106
salivating
for strikebreaker sweat.

00:00:40.675 --> 00:00:42.108
The North awaits,

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:46.445
its veins sprawled
and redlined and gerrymandered,

00:00:46.578 --> 00:00:49.848
dancing to “Red Summer
Blues” with a pistol on its hip

00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:53.320
and “Birth of A Nation” rattling
through its brain.

00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:57.856
The North lies waiting
in its kitchenette coldwater flat,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.483
its colored-only
YMCA,

00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:05.063
its Harlem/
Southside Chi/East St. Louis alleyways.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.500
It took off
its white hood

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:09.768
and raised
a billy club in celebration

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.638
against Detroit/Philadelphia
darkness.

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:16.308
The North lies
guttered in lay-away fine print,

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:20.113
sings its down-home
gospel of pawn broker receipts,

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:24.516
its morning work song of
cross-town subway number runner rush.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:29.890
It’s got a walk that leans to the sound
of desegregated sidewalks.

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:34.126
It drives a hot road
car bought with cold cash.

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:38.063
It’s got a jingle singing
’bout Saturday night in its pocket,

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:40.700
a fold in its wallet, and a
3 piece suit

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:44.136
that washes
a man clean of sharecropped hunger.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.940
It’s got a black pearl
necklace of washerwoman knees

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:51.076
and it knows how to paint itself
one stroke at a time

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.748
into burning trash can lullabies
of doo wop.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.650
It’s got liquor
store eyes full of worry,

00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:01.888
a throat of storefront churches
to hum each worry into moan.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.420
It left a cotton
field down south,

00:02:04.696 --> 00:02:09.395
along with a warrant for arrest
and a promise to never come back.

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:12.665
It looks
in the mirror each day,

00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:15.935
slips into its fresh,
ironed uniform

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.503
of tattered hope,

00:02:17.753 --> 00:02:22.040
and tells the world how it’s gonna
work itself past everything

00:02:22.173 --> 00:02:25.630
it was ever told it should
and couldn’t be

00:02:25.763 --> 00:02:27.678
before it struts out
the door,

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:31.916
deep in every footstep
a music it claims

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:33.653
for its own.
