00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.458
 Deep in the Siberian forest is the record of an explosion 

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:08.959
 that is a thousand times larger than Hiroshima 

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:16.917
 It was a summer morning in the Tunguska River Basin 

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:19.208
 a man was sitting on his porch 

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:22.000
 enjoying the sunlight on his face 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.875
 when suddenly he was blown backwards out of his chair 

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:30.542
 and he felt as if his whole body was on fire 

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:34.708
 he was 40 miles away from the center of this explosion 

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:40.667
 Windows shattered for hundreds of miles around 

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.500
 shockwaves rippled across Europe 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.041
 the night sky was illuminated for weeks after 

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:51.583
 and people were able to read their newspapers in the middle of the night 

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:53.625
 from London to Asia 

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:56.083
It was twenty years before a scientist was actually able 

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:58.375
 to make it out to the site of this disaster 

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:02.000
 Leonid Kulik, the chief curator of Meteorite collection 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.708
 at the Saint Petersburg Museum 

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:06.708
 made a journey out in 1927 

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:08.458
 it was an arduous trip 

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:13.792
 it took forever to get to this remote area in the Siberian wilderness 

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:16.291
 and what he found shocked him 

00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:20.792
 he found eighty three million trees felled in a circular radius 

00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:23.667
 covering over 600 miles 

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:28.583
 at the center of this the trees stood straight up 

00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:33.083
 burned to a crisp and stripped of their bark and their branches. 

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:36.959
 Locals were at first, really reluctant to talk to him 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.458
 they thought that this explosion had been the work of Agdy 

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:44.458
 a god who had come down to punish them 

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.125
 by destroying their land and their livestock 

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:49.792
 So a hundred years later there are still questions 

00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:53.000
 about exactly what happened at the Tunguska event 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.500
  A space object, maybe a comet 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.542
 but probably a meteorite 

00:01:57.542 --> 00:01:59.500
 entered the earth’s atmosphere 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.875
 this thing was two hundred feet wide 

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:06.708
 and probably weighed over two hundred and twenty million pounds 

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:12.333
 and it came into the atmosphere at around thirty three thousand miles per hour 

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:14.375
 as it speed towards the earth’s surface 

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:17.875
 it encountered the push back, the friction of the atmosphere 

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:21.291
 which heated it to over forty five thousand degrees 

00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:23.667
 and it was at this moment 

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:25.083
 that it exploded 

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:28.250
 it sent our a shockwave in a butterfly pattern 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.583
 imagine an explosions so powerful 

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:33.875
 that it could explode miles above the earth’s surface 

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:37.792
 and still measure as a 5.0 on the Richter Scale 

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:39.750
 had it happened over a city 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.166
 it easily could have leveled an area the size of Tokyo 

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:44.291
 and here’s the thing 

00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:46.625
 while it was relatively rare 

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:48.500
 astronomers have done the math 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.667
 and they think an event like this happens 

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:52.583
 roughly every three hundred years 

00:02:52.583 --> 00:02:55.083
 so, depending on probability 

00:02:55.083 --> 00:02:57.208
 we’ve got another Tunguska event 

00:02:57.208 --> 00:02:58.959
 in our near future 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.041
 Duhn dun duhhhhhh!

 and watch more videos here 

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.500
 There should be little explosions happening 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.208
 If little explosions didn’t happen 

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:15.000
 Then something went wrong 

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:19.083
 The debate still goes on 

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:23.667
 about whether it was a meteorite or a comet 

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:25.750
 there are good arguments for both 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.750
 Some Italian scientists believe that they have in fact found the impact crater 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.125
 Cheko Lake 

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:35.708
 Of course, the locals are like “No that Lake has definitely been here forever 

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:39.083
 so it’s a little bit hard to say 

00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:42.875
 there is a weird theory that it is a kind of a gas vent 

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:48.000
 that was releasing an enormous amount of I don’t know, methane I guess

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.959
 where it created a kind of huge pool of gas in the sky 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.083
going down to the vent 

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:55.250
 and then it was struck by lighting 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.166
 and it was like a wick down to this gas crater 

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:03.000
 and it exploded in this enormous insane way 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.375
 but it’s a lot more likely that it was just a meteorite
