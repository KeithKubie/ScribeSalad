00:00:00.147 --> 00:00:01.680
(music)

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.955
Voiceover: It's pretty
rare to have a conversation

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:05.278
about education policy in which the word

00:00:05.278 --> 00:00:07.629
"technology" isn't used at some point.

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:09.750
Occasionally, in the administrative sense,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.453
as a way to make education more efficient;

00:00:11.453 --> 00:00:14.275
but mostly in the classroom
sense, helping kids learn.

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:16.551
Which gets us to Salman Khan.

00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:19.280
He's a former hedge fund
manager turned educator

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.360
as the founder and sole faculty member

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.650
of the Khan Academy.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.550
It started as a tutoring service

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.198
for his cousins on YouTube.

00:00:26.198 --> 00:00:27.650
It's become a library of thousands

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.360
of instructional videos on topics

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.865
from basic arithmetic to organic chemistry

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.851
to the French Revolution

00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:34.357
with financial backing from,

00:00:34.357 --> 00:00:36.440
among others, the Gates Foundation.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.181
Sal Kahn, good to have you with us.

00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:39.322
Sal: Great to be here.

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.442
Voiceover: How, exactly, did you wind up

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:42.740
putting videos on YouTube?

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.638
Sal: I was a little
dismissive of it at first.

00:00:44.638 --> 00:00:46.852
I didn't think YouTube was
for serious mathematics.

00:00:46.852 --> 00:00:48.764
I thought it was more
for dogs on skateboards

00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:51.642
or whatever else, but I
decided to give it a shot

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:53.765
and people all over the
world started watching them.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:55.266
Some of them would say,

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.540
"Hey, this helped me on an exam."

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.194
But some of them would say,

00:00:57.194 --> 00:00:59.058
"Hey, this helped me not
drop out of high school"

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.923
or "This helped me get into the school

00:01:00.923 --> 00:01:02.143
"that I wanted to get into,"

00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:04.730
so it became a pretty
exciting thing to work on.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.419
Voiceover: What's the
education problem, though,

00:01:06.419 --> 00:01:08.227
that you think this technology can solve?

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:11.029
Sal: It's a pretty
straightforward problem,

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:13.732
is that everyone learns at different paces

00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:17.030
and right now everyone's
forced to go at the same pace.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.148
It's a more serious
problem than just people

00:01:19.148 --> 00:01:21.649
being bored or people being
lost in one classroom.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.330
What happens when everyone
moves at the same pace is,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.065
you and and I are in the
exam or we're learning

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:29.062
a basic subject; I don't
get 5% of the subject,

00:01:29.062 --> 00:01:30.730
you don't get 20% of the subject,

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.028
the whole class moves on
to a more advanced subject.

00:01:33.028 --> 00:01:35.730
I have a 5% gap, you have a 20% gap.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.141
Those gaps build up over time.

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:40.483
It pretty much guarantees
that most students,

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:41.928
by the time they get
to algebra or calculus,

00:01:41.928 --> 00:01:42.928
have so many of these gaps

00:01:42.928 --> 00:01:44.230
that no matter how hard they try,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.429
they just can't understand
what's going on.

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:47.983
What we're trying to address

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.646
is every student can go at their own pace,

00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:52.647
make sure that they master
something before moving on.

00:01:52.647 --> 00:01:55.923
When you do that, then
those gaps shouldn't happen.

00:01:55.923 --> 00:01:58.060
Voiceover: It's an
accumulation of failure, right?

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.830
Isn't that your phrase?

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.830
Sal: Yeah, I would say it's
an accumulation of gaps.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.329
The failure thing is
another interesting ...

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.148
Right now, when you take
an assessment, a test,

00:02:06.148 --> 00:02:08.058
in school, you get a label.

00:02:08.058 --> 00:02:09.642
You get an A, B or C or D.

00:02:09.642 --> 00:02:11.229
The A kids kind of feel
good about themselves,

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:12.230
they get self confidence.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.734
B students are a little bit neutral.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:16.145
You get a C, D or F,
it's not viewed as, hey,

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:17.481
you didn't understand 30%.

00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.522
Why don't you go and try to
learn it a little bit better?

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:21.029
It's viewed as you're not so smart.

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.111
Don't try to become an
engineer or a physicist.

00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:24.728
Voiceover: Where do you fit in, though?

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:26.531
Where does Khan Academy
fit in in the larger

00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:28.647
application of technology to education?

00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:29.645
How do you slide in there?

00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:31.329
Sal: For a while, whenever people talk

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.431
about technology in education

00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:34.063
they've just been talking about putting

00:02:34.063 --> 00:02:36.231
computers or iPads or whatever in a room

00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:37.930
and hoping something good happens.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.065
Even when there was something
to do on a computer,

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:42.731
it was always viewed as separate
from the core curriculum.

00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:44.230
It was viewed separate of what normally

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.229
goes on in a math class.

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.563
What we're saying is now we
can actually use technology,

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:49.566
we can use these videos,
we can use this software,

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:51.977
to allow every student to
work at their own pace.

00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:54.142
It's not an either/or proposition anymore.

00:02:54.142 --> 00:02:55.642
There's always this debate

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.481
of do you do more of the core skills

00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:59.647
or do more of the projects
and the investigations?

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:01.329
We're saying that you can do both.

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.729
You can use the technology to handle

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:04.628
a lot of the core skills, free up a lot

00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:06.832
of the teacher's time to do
more of the human interactions.

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:10.828
Voiceover: For the price
of a login, right ...

00:03:10.828 --> 00:03:12.428
You either login through
Facebook or Google,

00:03:12.428 --> 00:03:14.149
you get access to all these things.

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.645
Is there a thought in your mind

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:17.729
of somehow making people pay for this?

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:19.981
Sal: We want to at some
point be sustainable

00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:22.065
as a not-for-profit, but we
want all of this material

00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:24.431
to be 100% accessible by everyone.

00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:28.430
On the web and our core
tools will always be free.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.647
Right now, nothing on
our radar is non free,

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:31.628
I guess is the simple answer.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.231
Voiceover: What's the next
step for the Khan Academy?

00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:35.227
Sal: Right now, we have
about 2 million students

00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:37.029
a month who use our
site on a regular basis.

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.830
We want to start leveraging them

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.027
so that they can help each other.

00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:41.397
If you're in a classroom,

00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:43.032
your teacher knows that you need help;

00:03:43.032 --> 00:03:44.149
but if you're not in a classroom

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:45.731
or you need a supplement to a classroom,

00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:47.428
maybe one of the other community members

00:03:47.428 --> 00:03:49.728
of the Khan Academy can tutor you

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:51.478
or help you out or get
you passed your hurdle.

00:03:51.478 --> 00:03:53.328
Voiceover: Salman Khan.

00:03:53.328 --> 00:03:55.061
He's the founder of the Khan Academy.

00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:56.029
Thanks a lot.

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:59.000
Sal: Great, thanks.
