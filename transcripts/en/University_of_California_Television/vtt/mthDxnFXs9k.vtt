00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.912
(gentle music)

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.160
- This year's first
lecturer, Thomas Metzinger,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.970
is a leading philosopher of mind working

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.660
on consciousness and subjectivity,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.650
whose central thesis is
that there is no subject.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.140
I will let him tell you
more about his ideas.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.240
I was thinking over his accomplishments

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.230
and thinking what might be
good for me to tell you now

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.950
by way of introduction, and I
thought that I would tell you

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.530
something that you might
not know, which is that

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.340
Thomas Metzinger is a community activist

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.800
in a distinctively
philosophical sort of way.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.543
Philosophy, unlike science,
is not a team sport,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.970
but it is a collective
undertaking nonetheless.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.790
Philosophers need teachers,
they need interlocutors,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.010
they need readers, they need an audience,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.270
they need a community.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.580
Thomas Metzinger has done
much work establishing

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.530
philosophical community
where there was none before,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010
and I wanna just give two
examples, I can think of many,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.410
and I had to pick and
choose among the examples

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.783
to give you just two.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.380
If you've done work in
philosophy at the frontier

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.230
of philosophy and neuroscience,
then you will know

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.410
that that frontier can
sometimes be a fairly cold

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.740
and inhospitable place.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.230
Well, that certainly was true.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.210
It is much less true today,
and I think in good measures

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.470
as a result of the works
of Thomas Metzinger.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.340
And in particular, I'm
thinking of his work

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.830
establishing the international society,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.190
the Association for the
Scientific Study of Consciousness,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.940
which seeks to further
international collaboration

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.433
between philosophers and scientists.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.600
A little bit closer to home,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.483
closer to Thomas Metzinger's home,

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.194
Thomas has, under the
auspices of his office

00:02:18.194 --> 00:02:22.080
as professor of philosophy,
has brought together

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.690
young philosophers and neuroscientists

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.060
working in the different
corners of Germany

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.980
in relative isolation on
topics at the intersection

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.380
of philosophy and neuroscience.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.820
He's brought them together,
provided opportunities

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.350
for interaction,
discussion, collaboration,

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.250
and thus established community.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.393
I think you can safely say
that today philosophical,

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:43.870
there's a real critical
mass of work going on

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.630
in philosophical
neuroscience, especially among

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.420
young scholars in Germany.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.640
And there wasn't before,
and that is thanks

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.653
to Thomas Metzinger.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.490
Now Immanuel Kant, in the
Critique of Pure Reason,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.800
wrote that if you measure
the length of a book

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.673
not by how many pages it has,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.650
but by how difficult it is to read,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.230
by how much time it takes to read,

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.530
then many a book wouldn't
have been so long

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.590
if it hadn't been so short.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.490
I'm sure we can all think of examples.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.893
Thomas Metzinger's recent
book, Being No One,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.760
published by the MIT Press,
is not an example of this.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.660
It is not a short book.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.630
Weighing in at something like 700 pages,

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.070
it is a very long book.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.480
However, it is a book of
which one can say, I think,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.790
that this is a book that
wouldn't have been so short

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.930
if it hadn't been so long.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.850
It wouldn't have been so
accessible, so available

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.240
to writers working and
thinkers coming from

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.070
different traditions, it wouldn't
have been so influential,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.410
it wouldn't have been so
excellent if it didn't exhibit

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.170
the kind of muscular

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.423
scope which is in evidence in its length.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.020
So on that note, and
without further delay,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.642
I introduce to you
professor Thomas Metzinger.

00:04:12.642 --> 00:04:15.809
(audience applauding)

00:04:24.237 --> 00:04:25.490
- Thank you very much, Tony.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.590
Thank you very much, Alva, for
your beautiful introductions.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.497
You must have all noticed
how full of exaggerations

00:04:32.497 --> 00:04:34.973
Alva's introduction was.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.260
I'm very grateful for this invitation.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.200
Let me say this.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.420
And I feel deeply honored
for you to permit me

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.333
to speak to you today.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.100
And it's always a pleasure
to come back to Berkeley.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.550
When I got this invitation,
I thought, Thomas,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.690
when actually were you the
first time in Berkeley?

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.490
Then it appears it was more
than a quarter century ago.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.490
It must have been September 1977.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.590
I had just finished high
school, grabbed my backpack,

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.950
and flown into Montreal, Canada.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.240
And I hitchhiked down to
New York, came back up,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.130
hitchhiked all the way through
the Trans-Canada Highway

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.270
and came down here from Vancouver,

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.340
and somebody dropped me,
pitch-black dark night,

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.204
10 o'clock at night on the freeway.

00:05:27.204 --> 00:05:31.050
And the next thing that
happened is a car went over

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.883
my backpack and tore everything apart.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.350
And as I was there on
the freeway at 10 o'clock

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.920
at night gathering my belongings,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.900
my toothpaste here, my sleeping bag there,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.900
my camera there, the next car
that came was a policeman.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.250
So I ran to the man and
said, hey, hey, listen,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.330
somebody just destroyed everything I have,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.400
and it's actually easy, it's
the next car down the highway.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.360
Can you help me find these people?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.790
And he said no, you get $100 ticket

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.080
for pedestrian on freeway.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.080
And to be quite honest
with you, I spent almost

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.610
all of last Sunday trying
to find this notice

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.920
to appear in court for you,
but I actually didn't find it.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.010
And the next day, for the first time,

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.450
I worked the Berkeley campus,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.590
and I saw this policeman
walking the campus

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.480
in a really relaxed way,
swinging his, how do you say,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.220
riot stick or something like that

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.220
in a really relaxed way, and
he had this nice clean uniform

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.790
and a beautiful cap and hair down

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.323
to the belt of his trousers.

00:06:42.748 --> 00:06:47.150
And I thought that is really convincing.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.710
That would not have been
possible in Germany in 1977,

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.730
and I first realized there was something

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.970
about Berkeley that I like.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.163
And so I'm very happy to be back here.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.043
How many of you, do you
know the story of Mary?

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.450
Which was actually invented
by an Australian colleague

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.760
of mine, Frank Jackson, in 1982.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.140
It's the second half
of a thought experiment

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.210
that actually goes like this.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.083
Mary is the best neuroscientist
mankind has ever had.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.750
She knows everything you
can know about the physical,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.480
neuro-computational,
what-have-you underpinnings

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.053
of conscious color vision.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.920
The first premise of
the thought experiment

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.650
is as strong as you may want to have it.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.840
Neuroscience has come
to its historical end.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.930
Mary knows all the
physical facts underlying

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.840
conscious color experience.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.590
The second premise of a thought experiment

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.230
is she's never had a
color experience herself.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.330
Through some allergy or
something, she had to live

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.660
in an achromatic prison under the earth.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.220
Everything was black and white
and she did all her studies

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.570
through the internet with
a black and white monitor.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.350
In short, she has never had a conscious

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.010
color experience herself.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.170
She doesn't have any
first-person knowledge.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.780
Now the question is what happens

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.580
if Mary leaves her achromatic dungeon

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.990
and for the first time sees
the blueness of the sky

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.320
and a red apple on a tree?

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.990
Does she learn anything new about reality?

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.450
For most people, it seems
obvious that the answer is yes.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.800
She learns new facts
she didn't know before.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.770
For instance, facts about the
minds of other human beings.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.740
She knows suddenly what
her subjects she conducted

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.100
experiments with via her
black-and-white monitor

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.470
have been talking about all the time

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.900
when they talked about
their red experiences,

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.003
blue experiences and so forth.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.080
But if this is true, says Frank Jackson,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.720
there is a hole in a scientific worldview

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.060
which cannot be repaired,

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:16.060
because there are phenomenal
facts, non-physical facts.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.700
Here is how the argument goes.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.250
Before leaving her achromatic
prison, Mary knows everything

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.960
that can be known physically
or neuroscientifically

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.773
about the conscious color
vision of human beings.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.580
When first viewing a
colored object, she acquires

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.003
new knowledge, and this
knowledge is factual knowledge.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.253
Here's our man.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.490
Therefore, Mary, before
having her first conscious

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.510
color experience did
not know all the facts

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.383
one can know with regard
to color experience.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.590
Therefore, there are
non-physical facts, for instance,

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.040
about conscious human color
vision that can only be grasped

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.513
by phenomenal knowledge,
by first-person knowledge.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.313
And therefore, physicalism is false.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.920
I don't buy this.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.020
And I don't want to
speak about the knowledge

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.840
argument today, but what
I want to point out is,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.350
is that there's a very
important central term,

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.980
the notion of a first-person perspective,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.090
and the notion of a self from which this

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.113
first-person perspective originates.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.110
And in philosophy, it's
very fashionable these days

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.200
to say things like third-person facts

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.150
are not reducible to first-person facts.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.750
But nobody ever asks what a
first-person perspective is

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.734
and what a self actually is,
and this is what I will try

00:10:53.734 --> 00:10:57.660
to do together with you
today, and I also give you

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.660
two promise, at the end, I
will come back to the question

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.960
if there's any deeper meaning
in all this popular talk

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.730
you may have heard, that
the self is an illusion,

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.870
or that no such thing as a self exists.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.540
And of course also as
this is our first lecture,

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.870
I will come back to the question

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.883
of the immortality of the soul.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.820
If we want to understand what
a consciously experienced

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.340
first-person perspective
is, there are three

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.610
phenomenal target properties
we have to understand.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.470
The first one is the property of mineness.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.850
A phenomenal property is something

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.690
that exists in consciousness.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.220
In the Anglo-Saxon
world, you also call this

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.260
the sense of ownership.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.560
Mineness is a higher-order
property of particular forms

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.700
of phenomenal content.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.270
And here are some examples
how we refer to this private,

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.740
subjective property from public space

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.100
by using linguistic representations.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.170
We say things like I
experience my legs subjectively

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.460
as always having belonged to me.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.750
I always experience my
thoughts and my emotions

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.210
as part of my own consciousness.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:23.210
Voluntary acts are initiated by myself.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.543
Let me give you first brief example.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.043
And forgive me as I take off my jacket.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.290
This is something from a very
recent August issue of Nature.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.260
Have you ever, you can do this at home,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.570
heard of the rubber hand illusion?

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.903
Here is how it goes.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.080
Activation of the premotor cortex during

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.810
the rubber hand illusion.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.600
In the illusion, normal
individuals experience

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.210
an artificial limb, a rubber hand,

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.180
as if it were part of their own body.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.500
The subject observes a
facsimile of a human hand,

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.700
the rubber hand, while
one of his own hands

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.250
is hidden from view.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.790
Both the artificial hand and
the subject's hands are stroked

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.680
repeatedly and synchronously with a probe.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.990
The green and yellow
areas indicate the tactile

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.320
and visual receptive fields
respectively for neurons

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.810
in the premotor cortex.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.080
You see, something shifts.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.770
The subject experiences an
illusion in which the felt touch

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.470
is brought into alignment
with the seen touch.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.030
This brings the visual
receptive field into alignment

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.800
with the rubber hand,
resulting in activation

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.450
of premotor cortex neurons.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.950
This is just an illustration.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.220
I will not go into any technical details,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.380
but that's what I'm interested in.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.490
The moment where you
suddenly have the feeling

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.490
this is my hand, although you
cognitively know it's not.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:00.290
The property of ownership,
and as you see today,

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.590
we have good nuts and
bolts stories are appearing

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.470
about what actually happens in the brain.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.313
This is why we are living
in such an interesting time.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.170
You see how these people
can clearly delineate

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.400
per certain areas of premotor
cortex where you have a shift

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.650
of functional properties in the
moment where the rubber hand

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:25.450
becomes a part of your experiential self.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.109
And you can do this at home, try it.

00:14:28.109 --> 00:14:32.120
The thing is, you must
stroke synchronously

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.600
and you must stroke at
least 30 to 60 seconds,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.980
and you must make your
subject not look in your face,

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.510
but must make your subject
really look on the probe

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.210
or the brush or whatever you're using.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.830
So much about mineness.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.250
Here's the second target
property we have to understand.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.850
It's the property of selfhood.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.500
Some crazy German philosophers

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.617
call this (speaking in foreign language).

00:14:59.985 --> 00:15:01.030
(audience laughing)

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.830
Pre-reflexive self-intimacy,
the way of being

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.650
infinitely close to yourself
before you even start

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.120
any thought or cognitive activity.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.150
Here are examples.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:16.093
How we speak about this, we
say things like I am someone,

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:20.393
I experience myself as being
identical through time.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.840
The contents of my
phenomenal self-consciousness

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.443
form a coherent whole.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.680
Before initiating and independently

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.570
of any intellectual operations,
I'm already directly,

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.100
whatever that may mean,
acquainted with the contents

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.833
of my self-consciousness.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.960
And here's the third
and last target property

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.720
we must understand,
and that's the property

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.240
of perspectivalness.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.050
That is a structural property of your

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.950
experiential space as a whole.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.423
It possesses an immovable center.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.860
Now here is the mystery, a mystery

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.800
Thomas Nagel wrote a lot about.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.410
For each one of you, it is true

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.020
that you are the center yourself.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.430
To be phenomenally aware means to possess

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.240
an inward perspective and
to take on this perspective

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.240
and the subjective experience of the world

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.193
and of your own mental states.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.980
But if you say I am this center myself,

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.260
you don't really understand
what you're saying.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.380
This is where the puzzle
occurs, when you flip

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.910
from a third-person
description of a property

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.790
of conscious space into a
first-person description

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:42.040
by using a concept like myself.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.980
What I want to do now is I want to analyze

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.410
these phenomenal properties
on the representational list

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.050
and functionalist level on
lower levels of description.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.130
I want to ask what would
it mean for a given

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.530
information processing system

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.763
to instantiate these properties.

00:17:02.123 --> 00:17:06.930
Let us start by analyzing
these target properties.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:11.930
My first step will be to introduce
a new theoretical entity,

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:13.760
that's the phenomenal self-model

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.643
or the conscious self-model or the PSM.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:21.060
I say something like that
exists, and it will be found

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.970
on all levels of explanation.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.740
It's a distinct theoretical entity.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.070
And at the very end of
this talk, I will introduce

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.253
a second theoretical entity.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.280
It forms the representational
instantiation basis

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.920
of the phenomenal, the
conscious properties

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.253
that we want to explain.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.600
Let me give you some
ideas about what I mean

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.350
by the notion of a self-model.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.490
It's only episodically active,

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.115
it's a representational entity,

00:17:50.115 --> 00:17:53.720
and the content of that
representation is the very system

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.403
in which it appears.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.360
From a logical point of
view, you can distinguish

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.403
three classes of information
processing systems.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.270
Some can do simulations.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:11.640
Think of the meteorology
department, a computer

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.833
that simulates weather
movements, cloud movements.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.120
Then there are more complex machines,

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.500
machines that can emulate
non-observable properties

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.390
of another computer.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.710
For instance, if on your Windows desktop

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.760
you make the pocket calculator come up,

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.718
or if a very clever Turing machine

00:18:32.718 --> 00:18:36.550
pretends to be a stupid Turing machine,

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.960
then you have the situation where one

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.253
information processing
system emulates another one.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.900
It emulates the internal information flow.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.820
What I am saying is that we are a system

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.390
that do both of these things.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.880
We simulate and we emulate.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.940
And if you have the special
case that target system

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.070
and processing system are identical,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.570
then you have the case of self-modeling.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.610
So what I'm saying is that
you all as you're sitting here

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:08.360
are systems that simulate
and emulate themselves

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.153
for themselves as they
are listening to me.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.087
A background assumption
is that this self-model

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:18.250
possesses a true
neurobiological description,

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.270
some activation vector.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.870
It is some complex activation
pattern in the human brain,

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.343
but I will not talk about this
today being a philosopher.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.840
The phenomenal, the conscious
self-model is that part

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.850
of the mental self-model
which is currently embedded

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.910
into the highest-order
integrated structure,

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.610
the global model of the world.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.140
This will be very easy to
see for all those of you

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.668
are interested in psychotherapy.

00:19:47.668 --> 00:19:51.450
Human beings have an integrated
self-model in their brain.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.350
Not much of it is conscious,
but of course it is clear

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:57.150
that parts of your unconscious self-model

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.560
can have causal properties and influence,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.560
say, endocrinal output,
psychosomatic interactions

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.020
as we call them.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.410
So there is a conscious
and an unconscious layer,

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:13.450
and what is conscious is variable.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.740
As philosophers say,
the phenomenal content

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.400
of the self-model supervenes locally.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.170
That is, for the experiential
content it is true

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.320
that if all of your brain
properties are fixed,

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.660
all of your properties of
your phenomenal self-model

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.240
are fixed as well, which doesn't yet imply

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.383
that there's a reductive explanation.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.130
The phenomenal self-model in
our own case is a plastic,

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.160
structure changes over lifetime.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.480
It's a multi-modal structure.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.650
Many different sensory organs,
from your blood vessels,

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:52.630
from your vestibular organ,
and so forth feed into it.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.150
And possibly it evolved
from a partially innate

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:59.080
and hardwired model of the
spatial properties of the system.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.270
Some British philosophers
have spoken about

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.500
a long-term body image.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.710
You know the stories of
Damasio and Melzack maybe.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.043
More about this later.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.340
An active self-model it's
important to understand

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.600
this is not a little man in the head.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.720
It's a subpersonal functional state.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.040
That is again philosophically speaking.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.400
It is characterized by
a distinct causal role,

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.760
and from a strictly
analytical perspective,

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.127
it's a set of causal relations.

00:21:28.127 --> 00:21:30.750
And if anybody here still
believes in classical

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:35.080
cognitive science, we might
say something like that.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.040
It's a transient computational
module which is episodically

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.850
activated by the system
in order to regulate

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.720
its interaction with the environment.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.640
That's a very complicated
way of saying what happens

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.890
when you wake up in the morning.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:55.710
When you come to yourself, then
the organism which you are,

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.880
that's what I'm saying at least,

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.720
has to achieve complex
sensory motor integration.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.330
You have to go to the
refrigerator or to the toilet.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.760
And then it meets this
transient computational model,

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.820
the conscious self-model,
and it just switches it on.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.472
And this is the moment when you wake up,

00:22:15.472 --> 00:22:19.380
when you come into existence
as a conscious being.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.440
For those of you are interested in logic,

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.760
there's a formal proof
by Conant and Ashby 1970

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.940
that every complex system
that has a regulator

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.170
that regulates its own
behavior will automatically

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.040
by necessity turn this
regulator into a model

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.950
of the system as a whole.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.240
That's pretty intuitive.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.140
If you have to regulate
the different parts,

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.113
you have to map them somewhere.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.100
I also make a teleofunctionalist
background assumption.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:52.100
The development of the
activation of this module

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.760
plays a role for the system.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.120
It's good to have it
in pursuing your goals.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.740
The functional self-model processes a true

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.790
evolutionary description
that is, it was a weapon

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.600
which was invented and
optimized in the course

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.050
of a cognitive arms race.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.250
And that rather unromantic
quote comes from

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.170
Andy Clark from his 1989 book.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.210
So the idea is that what we have now

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.240
as our conscious self-model is something

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.610
that has a long history and emerged

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.260
out of a basically competitive process.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.840
It consists in a very specific achievement

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.000
the capacity not only to
open representational spaces

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.220
but to open centered
representational spaces.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.163
Space is centered around
a model of the self.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.290
And before all this gets too
boring, I want to give you

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.873
two low-level examples of
what I mean by a self-model.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.290
Astronauts in space

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.810
frequently get the following problem.

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.193
They cannot feel where up and
down is in their body anymore.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.853
It's like a radicalized
version of motion sickness.

00:24:10.363 --> 00:24:12.780
It's difficult, if you're trying to eat,

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.050
if you can't feel top
down in your body anymore.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.650
Every astronaut knows
how to help his buddy

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.500
if he has that problem,
you just hit very hard

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.610
on the heel from below
on the sole of the shoe.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.930
And instantly the body
image locks in again

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.280
and there's this conscious experience.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.360
This is down, this is up.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.990
And every astronaut knows
how to annoy his buddy,

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.033
hit them on the head right afterwards.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:42.700
So what that shows is
that the human self-model

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.820
is just a virtual model.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.440
It depicts a possibility, philosophically

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.530
very interestingly as a reality.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.140
It's just the best
hypothesis the system has

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.103
about its own current state.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.230
And if it is under constraint by input,

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.930
which it is in a spaceship,
then it can become

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:07.490
highly context-sensitive.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:10.530
You just have to knock
on the back of the foot

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:14.040
and it locks in, and
down suddenly is there.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.040
So the self model is a
simulation, a virtual model.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:25.200
Now I guess many of you
have heard of San Diego's

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.260
Ramachandran and phantoms in the brain

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.410
and the many patients he has.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.510
And I used to go to lunch
with him when I spent a year

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.760
at UC San Diego in '89, '99.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.430
And how many of you have heard

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.613
of these mirror experiments,
mirror synesthesia?

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.370
You have these people
have an amputated arm

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:51.980
and they have a phantom limb.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.590
And usually that phantom
limb will go away within

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.179
a couple of weeks with a
so-called telescoping effect.

00:25:58.179 --> 00:26:00.620
The phantom limb could
become smaller, smaller.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.060
You can make a fist in the
stump and then it disappears.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.640
Some people, however, have
a hurting phantom limb

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.490
that is paralyzed and
stays up to 12 years.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:14.930
I mean, how do you cure pain
in a non-existing limb, right?

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.590
If you want to help
these patients, one knows

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:21.030
the first thing you have
to do is you have to regain

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.380
volitional control, you
have to make it mobile.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.760
But it doesn't work.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.540
So the task Ramachandran
did with one of his patient

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.050
who had this paralyzed
phantom limb for 12 years

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:35.970
was now make butterfly-like
symmetrical movements

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.030
like this, what is your
conscious experience?

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.530
And a patient says, well, Doctor,

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.880
what is my conscious experience?

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.140
My good arm moves, the
phantom limb is paralyzed.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.450
Now what you do is you put
a mirror down in the middle

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.620
and say, can you please
do the same thing again,

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.600
and look at the mirror from the side.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.350
And the patient will
exclaim, Doctor, Doctor,

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.070
my phantom limb moves.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:03.070
I can move my phantom limb for
the first time in 12 years.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.190
You pull the mirror up
or you tell the patient

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.760
close your eyes, and
with great disappointment

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.773
they will say, oh, it's frozen again.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.710
What moves in that experiment

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.773
is what I call the phenomenal self-model.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.820
Here you have the setup.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.110
Technically speaking, you
install a virtual source

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:28.480
of visual feedback which
points into just the right

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.380
region of state space
where the system sends

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.440
its motor commands and
never gets feedback.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.960
And you see something is moving there.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.260
It's the phenomenal self-model.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:45.010
Now let us start to continue

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:47.000
our representationalist analysis

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.063
of our three target properties.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.103
Remember

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.223
the rubber hand illusion.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.180
What is mineness?

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.050
All representational
states which are embedded

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.600
into the currently active self-model gain

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.280
the additional higher-order
property of phenomenal mineness.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.313
That is a nonconceptual
sense of ownership.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.320
Nonconceptual, something
that a nonlinguistic creature

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.230
could have as well.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.690
An animal could have this as well.

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:22.210
If this integration process is disturbed,

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.820
different neuropsychological syndromes

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.533
or altered states of consciousness result.

00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:31.690
Here are some examples.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.970
Consciously experienced thoughts are not

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.060
my own thoughts anymore.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.580
You have that in florid schizophrenia.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.690
You probably have all heard about this.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.893
This is one of the main
problems schizophrenics have.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.880
If you cannot integrate your
own cognitive processing

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.010
into your own self-model
anymore, you cannot experience

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.493
your own thoughts as your own anymore.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.533
How many of you know what
unilateral hemi-neglect is?

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.773
Happens every day in
hospitals around the world.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.253
Somebody wakes up after surgery,

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.760
thinks the medical students have made

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.250
a particularly distasteful joke,

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.870
finds a dead leg in his bed,

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:25.160
tries to throw the leg out,
falls out of bed with it,

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.560
realize the dead leg is
grown to his own hip.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:33.010
The nurse comes, he
says, this is not my leg.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.990
The nurse will say, but then
you should have three legs.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.810
Can you count?

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:40.600
Patient will say, I cannot explain this,

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.820
but this certainly is not part of my body

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.160
even if it is fixed to me.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.220
This is something that is very
well documented and studied,

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.433
and it's exactly the sense
of ownership that is missing.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:58.070
In Alien Hand Syndrome, my
arm performs goal-directed

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.040
actions without my own control.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.010
The interesting thing about that syndrome

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:06.250
is that you have goal-directed actions,

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.240
typically with a sense
of intermanual conflict.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.940
The Alien Hand Syndrome
patient will pick up the phone

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.080
and the other hand will
slam the thing down

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.660
and interrupt it.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.450
One hand will button down the shirt,

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.433
the other hand will button it up.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.040
The interesting thing is
that some patients even

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.390
start to attribute
personality to that limb

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.200
because it's so obviously goal-directed.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.060
It's clear you can have
goal-directed motor behavior

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.690
which cannot be integrated into

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.550
your conscious self-model.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.160
Every day people come into emergency wards

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.200
and say things like this.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.070
Doctor, I am a robot.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.330
I am transformed into a mechanical puppet.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:49.530
My volitional acts are not my
own volitional acts anymore.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:51.690
You have that in depersonalization.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.020
You feel remote controlled and you lose

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.760
what German philosopher and
psychiatrist Karl Jaspers

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.817
called (speaking in foreign language),

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.410
executive consciousness,
the phenomenal experience

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:08.143
only of initiating an act,
but of carrying it through.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.050
But then you also have
states where people say

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.020
I am the whole world.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.310
All events in the world are controlled

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.303
by my own volitional acts.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.290
So to speak, the
self-model can also expand

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:25.300
to the boundaries of the world.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.100
And a couple of years I gave a talk

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.987
in a psychiatry institute in Germany,

00:31:29.987 --> 00:31:32.620
and they had two patients there.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.570
One of them was standing
by the window all day

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:37.763
making the sun move,

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.460
experiencing every little
movement as self-caused.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.010
And the other guy was
looking down into traffic

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.030
making the cars drive, the puppets walk,

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:50.040
turning the traffic lights on and off.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.430
So there are phenomenal
states in which every event

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.100
that is consciously experienced

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.860
is experienced as self-caused.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.430
And of course every
modern philosophy of mind

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.340
has to account for all these phenomena

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.643
or it is not an
interesting theory of mind.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:12.140
Let us move on to the
core property of selfhood.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.340
What is it?

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.230
It's the existence of a single coherent

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.980
and temporally stable
self-representation which forms

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.560
the center of the overall
representational space.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.230
And again, if this
representational module is damaged,

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.740
if it disintegrates or
if multiple structures

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.570
of this type alternate within the system,

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:35.630
you get different
neuropsychological syndromes,

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.239
different altered states of consciousness.

00:32:38.239 --> 00:32:40.950
Here are some examples for you.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:45.870
In Anosognosia and
Anosodiaphoria you have a loss

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.460
of higher-order inside
into existing deficits.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.470
For instance, in blindness denial

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.670
after a massive cortical
infarct, Anton's syndrome.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.800
You will have people
who are totally blind.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.280
They will never see
anything in their life.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.410
Not because anything is
wrong with their eyes,

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.053
but because something is
wrong with their brain.

00:33:06.053 --> 00:33:09.000
They show all functional
signs of being blind,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.580
they bump into walls,
they fall over furniture,

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.040
but they claim to still be seeing people.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.610
If you say how many fingers are these,

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.197
they say, oh, it's kinda
dark in here and I don't,

00:33:20.197 --> 00:33:22.610
I'm not interested in your experiments.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.524
And if you take your keys
and you say how many fingers,

00:33:25.524 --> 00:33:27.848
you know, what is this?

00:33:27.848 --> 00:33:30.200
And they say, well, it's keys, you know?

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.700
And they start to confabulate.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.930
I've had the most interesting discussions

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.590
with German (mumbles) in my own country

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.300
who claim that this doesn't exist

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.320
because it's logically excluded

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.230
that something like this exists.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:48.150
As a matter of fact, it
is documented since 1899

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:49.810
in many clinics around the world.

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:51.900
It's a well-understood phenomenon.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.730
But there still are philosophers who say

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:56.380
this is logically impossible.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.620
The opposite is true,
and modern theory of mind

00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.870
has to explain it.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.870
You may have all heard of
multiple identity disorder.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.230
It now has been renamed into DID,

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.530
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:12.200
I do not want to go into
this in detail today,

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.410
but in this framework, it
is of course easy to imagine

00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:20.360
how a system uses different
and alternating self-models

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.420
in order to deal with
extremely traumatizing

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.290
and socially inconsistent situations.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:31.290
Most DID patients have been
sexually abused by a parent,

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:34.170
and it's very clear that if a love object

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.180
becomes an aggressor
suddenly, you may have to

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.980
do something like a
division of emotional labor.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.550
You have to divide the emotions you have

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.840
to two different self-representations

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.660
and create an amnesia in between,

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:52.400
else you can't go on living with that.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.380
But this shall be enough for today,

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.433
and then you have what in Germany we call

00:34:57.433 --> 00:34:59.890
(speaking in foreign
language), hard to translate,

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:03.810
identity disorders,
delusional misidentification.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.681
There's a large class of
psychiatric disturbances

00:35:06.681 --> 00:35:09.820
which is accompanied by deviating forms

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.200
of the conscious experience
of one's identity.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.350
That is about how you experience it.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:20.400
That doesn't as such touch
the philosophical issue

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.123
of personal identity.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.773
Now what is it to have a
first-person perspective?

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.900
The existence of a single, coherent,

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.440
and temporally stable
model of reality, one world

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.870
which is representationally
centered around

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.810
or on a single, coherent,
and temporally stable

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.740
phenomenal subject that
is not only a self,

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.230
but a model of the system as experiencing.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.330
This is not circular.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.920
I will come back to this point in the end.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.790
That is if you have a model
of the system as being

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.840
tied to objects in the world
through perceptual relations

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.270
through grasping behavior
or something like that,

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.170
then you get a perspective.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.490
The structural feature of the
global representational space

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.400
then leads to what I call a nonconceptual

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.350
first-person perspective.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.180
Again, please note, you
do not have to be able

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:21.200
to think thoughts or speak
a language to have that.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.863
A dog that has visual
attention will have that.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.790
If this global representational
property is lost,

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:34.440
again, the phenomenology
will change, and you will get

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.580
different neuropsychological syndromes

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.175
or altered states of consciousness.

00:36:39.175 --> 00:36:42.170
Again, I've brought examples for you.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:45.870
You can have complete depersonalization.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.700
You can lose the phenomenal
first-person perspective,

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.070
and this can be accompanied
by dysphoric states,

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:56.670
by fear reactions and functional deficits.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.260
There are some psychiatrists in Zurich

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.740
who have developed a
big statistical battery,

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.110
and they have tested very
different types of altered states

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.410
of consciousness, drug-induced,
psychosis-induced,

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:14.260
through rhythmic drumming,
many different stimuli,

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.550
and have found what the
etiology independent

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.640
functional clusters are
in these altered states.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:26.071
And there's one very strong
cluster which they call

00:37:26.071 --> 00:37:30.530
(speaking in foreign language),
dreadful ego-dissolution.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:34.550
The interesting result,
however, is that there are also

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:39.550
experiences which are described
as selfless and noncentered

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.780
later by the people undergoing them,

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.380
which are experienced and described

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:49.090
as non-pathological and non-threatening.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:54.090
These Swiss researchers termed
this oceanic boundary loss.

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:57.130
And it is of course true that any modern

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:00.600
philosophical theory of
mind will also not be able

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.583
to shut its eyes in that direction.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.530
I will very, very slowly
start to come to the end

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:13.080
of my talk now by asking
the two major questions.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.580
What is the central theoretical problem

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.330
on the functional level of description?

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:22.760
And then I will ask what is
the central theoretical problem

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.680
on the representationalist
level of description.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.080
And I will briefly give you my own answers

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.403
and we can discuss this.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:33.160
Here's the question, in which way does

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.780
the phenomenal self-model
differ from all other

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.793
phenomenal models currently active?

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.393
Which functional property
characteristically marks it out?

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:47.100
How does it precisely become the center

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.850
of the phenomenal space of representation?

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.030
I mean, there's everything
here, bottles, laptops,

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:57.110
flowers, and the
phenomenal model of myself,

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.583
why is it the immovable center?

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.810
Here's my answer, the
self-model is the only

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:10.330
representational structure
which is anchored in the brain

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:13.290
by a persistent functional link.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:17.120
That is, by a continuous
source of internally generated

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.163
input, of input you generate yourself.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.420
Whenever you have anything
like conscious experience

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.170
at all, that is whenever a
stable and integrated model

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:33.170
of reality is there, you also
have this continuous source

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.940
of internal proprioceptive input.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.500
There is something in your
conscious experience now

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.420
which is so invariant

00:39:43.223 --> 00:39:45.343
that it is almost unconscious.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:47.610
And it has something to do

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:50.982
with the background
sensation of your own body.

00:39:50.982 --> 00:39:55.510
There's a man at McGill
University in Canada,

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:58.730
Ronald Melzack, who claims
that there's a hardwired

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.080
partition of the neural matrix underlying

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.720
the spatial model of one's own body

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.830
which is independent of external input,

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.550
and that becomes the center.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.480
That is, you have a
part of your body image

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.460
which is autonomously active,

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:18.113
and 50 times a second
tells you, this is me.

00:40:19.097 --> 00:40:22.573
Here are two empirical
hypotheses from a philosopher.

00:40:23.975 --> 00:40:26.460
But you see, they're stolen.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.680
New results concerning pain
experienced in phantom limbs

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.470
point to the existence of
a genetically determined

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:35.990
neuromatrix, the activity
pattern of which could form

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:38.820
the basis of the more invariant aspects

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.460
of your bodily self-experience.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.190
I just talked about that.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:46.420
Melzack calls it the
phylomatrix of the body image.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.070
So it's something we
share with our ancestors.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.890
Then there is the Damasio
story, which I'm sure

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.870
many of you will know.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.830
There's a second empirical
hypothesis which says

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:01.520
that the homeodynamics as
regulated by upper brain stem

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:05.820
in the hypothalamus generates
this continuous source

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:10.100
of input by which you feel yourself.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.700
I have termed this emotional embodiment,

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:18.363
the way you are anchored in
your emotional background state.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.140
Here's a quote from Ronald Melzack.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.410
He says, in essence, I postulate
that the brain contains

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:29.420
a neuromatrix or network
of neurons that in addition

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:33.950
to responding to sensory
stimulation, continuously generates

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:37.170
a characteristic pattern
of impulses indicating

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:41.690
that the body is intact and
unequivocally one's own.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:45.333
He says, I call this
pattern a neurosignature.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:49.920
If such a matrix operated in
the absence of sensory inputs

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.650
from the periphery of
the body, it would create

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:54.410
the impression of having a limb

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:57.493
even when that limb has been removed.

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:03.680
Here's a woman, Azet, a patient
from Zurich, Switzerland

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.080
from a department,
people I cooperate with.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:11.410
And this person was born
without arms and legs.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:15.140
She's an academic,
absolutely cognitively lucid,

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.520
41 years old.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:21.130
They told her please rate
how real your phantom limbs

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.340
feel to you compared to the
torso, to your real body,

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.710
on a scale from zero to seven.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.480
Say your real body feels like seven,

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.850
and I feel nothing is zero.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:37.720
And you see an interesting variance.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:42.720
You see some toes are 5.0,
another toe will only be 3.2.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:47.690
So these phantom limbs which
are there are not as real

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:51.160
phenomenologically as
is the body that sends

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.830
continuous input through
normal proprioception.

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.323
But they are also there all the time.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.070
Being a philosopher I will
not take a position there,

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:03.880
but the interesting issue
is if something like that

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.660
could actually evolve postnatally,

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:11.460
or if there is an innate
functional core to the body image.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:15.570
Intuitively, to many of us
who are not neurologists,

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.500
it seems like if something
like that can happen,

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.640
you must have a body image
you're born with, right?

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.320
There must be something
that is pre-structured.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.453
Some of my expert friends doubt that.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.403
Here's a bit of Damasio.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.540
Of course, he says, and
he tries to go deeper.

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.290
The brain does represent
muscles and joints and bones,

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:42.330
but before it ever gets
to the muscles and bones,

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:44.920
there are other aspects
of the body to consider,

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.270
namely the viscera and
the internal milieu.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:51.590
The internal milieu
corresponds to the chemistries

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:52.950
of the fluids in which all

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:55.480
of our living tissues are immersed.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.620
Not only must the body
model and the brain include

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.870
the latter aspect of the organism,

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.260
it is likely that the model

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.860
is anchored on those aspects
because they are indispensable

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.300
for the maintenance of life.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.490
The dynamic structure and
operation of internal milieu

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:17.060
and viscera are the beginning
of the body-minded brain.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.380
And he points out that
it is the first division,

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.500
the one concerned with
the organism's interior,

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.440
which is permanently
active, that's my persistent

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.210
functional link, permanently
signaling the state of the most

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:33.970
internal aspects of the
body proper to the brain.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:37.623
The brain is truly the
body's captive audience.

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:43.270
For a philosopher's point of
view, my friend Tony's theory

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:45.060
has many conceptual problems.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.620
It's not entirely coherent.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.140
But I think he's got a
very good point there,

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:54.120
because he can explain how self-modeling,

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:58.200
the process of becoming
self-aware, is actually anchored

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.880
in molecular level dynamics,

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:05.400
in autonomous self
regulation of body fluids

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.800
around the brain stem.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.100
And you can see also how far that is

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.470
from what any artificial
system can do today.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:19.470
The time by which we have
robots with body fluids

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.100
and that ultra fine-grained
emotional background state

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.913
we have is I guess is a
distant point in time.

00:45:27.471 --> 00:45:30.460
Now I want to ask the
second and last question.

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.540
What is the central theoretical problem

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.383
on the representational
list level of description?

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.573
Here's the problem.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.780
There seems to be no
necessary connection from

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:43.770
the functional and
representational properties

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:47.940
to our conscious target
properties of mineness,

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.530
selfhood, and perspectivalness.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.580
Somebody like Dave
could come along and say

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.820
all this could take conceivably place

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.160
without the emergence of
a genuine phenomenal self

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:04.180
or a subjectively experienced
first-person perspective.

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:08.200
We can imagine biological
information processing systems

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:11.720
which develop and use centered
representational spaces

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.350
without the emergence of
true self-consciousness.

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:17.920
Somebody could say,
Thomas, you're cheating

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.610
with the word self.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:23.060
A self model is not a
self, but only an internal

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:26.670
representation of the
system itself as a whole.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:28.343
It is a system model.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:32.700
So the question becomes,
how does one get from

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.030
the functional property of centeredness

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:39.170
and the representational
property of self-modeling

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.293
to the phenomenal property of selfhood?

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.640
Here's my answer.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.960
The transparency of the data structures

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.483
used by the brain.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:57.133
What is phenomenal transparency?

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.600
A standard philosophical
definition will say

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.080
that only content properties of certain

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.120
representational structures
used by the brain

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.200
are available to introspection.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.860
The vehicles, as
philosophers say themselves,

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.640
the physical states employed by the system

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.280
are transparent, that is,
they do not represent the fact

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.130
that they are representations

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.380
on the level of their content.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.640
This is an old philosophical notion.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.760
Goes back to G.E. Moore, 1903.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.160
Just look at these flowers here.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.700
We would say as philosophers,

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:38.600
this is a phenomenally
transparent representation

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.860
because you introspect
your perceptual processing

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:46.720
as hard as you want to, you
cannot recognize the fact

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.750
that this is all a state
in your visual system.

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:52.770
You cannot see the
representational state itself,

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:55.340
and that is why you are a naive realist.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.590
You have the feeling you are in direct

00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:00.700
and immediate contact with reality.

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:03.840
We are systems that so
to speak look through

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.230
their own representational
structures as if they were

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:11.973
in direct and immediate
contact with their content.

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:15.840
Now what you have to
do, now let me give you

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:20.210
two empirical hypotheses,
why we are beings

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:22.420
that are naive realists.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.210
The respective data
structures are being activated

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:29.871
so fast and so reliable
that the system cannot

00:48:29.871 --> 00:48:32.980
recognize them as such anymore.

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.980
And my idea on a small
time scale is simply

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.608
because of a lower temporal resolution

00:48:39.608 --> 00:48:42.310
of metarepresentational functions.

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:46.280
That is the earlier processing
stages, for instance,

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:50.120
leading to this coherent
pattern here are not available

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.050
for introspective attention.

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:54.690
You cannot penetrate them in principle

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.410
because they are just so much faster.

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:00.780
That is, systems like
us cannot become aware

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:05.023
of the construction process,
however hard they may try.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.730
I have a second empirical
hypothesis which operates

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:12.820
on a much larger time scale.

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.970
I think there has been no
evolutionary selection pressure

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:19.730
on the relevant parts of
our functional architecture.

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:22.740
For beings like us, naive realism has been

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:26.440
a functionally adequate
background assumption,

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.810
and it's easy to understand that.

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:32.510
We only needed to represent
the fact there's a wolf there

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.410
or there's a bear there.

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:36.690
We did not need to represent the fact,

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:40.123
there's an active wolf
representation in my brain now.

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:44.520
That would have what the experts call

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.010
a much higher metabolic price.

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:50.500
You would increase the
computational load on the system,

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.640
you would burn more sugar,
but that wouldn't pay.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.030
It wouldn't pay to burn
more sugar for that.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:59.490
At least that is my own hypothesis.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:03.530
For the functional properties
we needed to survive,

00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:08.103
we didn't need to distance
ourselves from ourselves.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:14.010
Now the crucial point in
my talk is that you have to

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:17.370
apply this point to the
notion of a self-model.

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:20.450
I'm claiming that we are
systems which are not able

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:24.440
to recognize their own
subsymbolic self-model

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.370
as a self-model.

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:29.940
Therefore, we operate
under the condition of what

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.140
I would call a naive-realistic
self-misunderstanding.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.370
We necessarily experience
ourselves as being in direct

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:42.410
and immediate epistemic
contact with ourselves.

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:45.600
So to speak, as you are
listening to me right now,

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.700
what I'm saying is that
metaphorically speaking,

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.270
you are a system that
constantly confuses itself

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:55.003
with the content of its own self-model.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:00.540
Now we can continue our
representationalist analysis

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.983
and come to the very last question.

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.990
We have an idea of what
consciousness could be maybe

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:11.490
and an idea how a phenomenal
self-model emerges.

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:15.343
But what makes conscious
experience subjective experience?

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:21.180
Here is very briefly a
second theoretical entity.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.510
I call it the phenomenal model

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:26.613
of the intentionality relation, the PMIR.

00:51:27.748 --> 00:51:32.748
And what I say is that we
are systems that co-represent

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:37.140
the representational relationship
while they represent.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:41.390
That is, the PMIR is a
dynamical and transparent model

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:45.320
of the self in the act of knowing.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.560
A PMIR is a continuously
changing inner representation

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.760
of ongoing subject-object
relationships, that is,

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:58.457
the relationship between
subject and perceptual object

00:51:58.457 --> 00:52:02.750
or subject and internally
represented action goal.

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:07.000
We are systems of capably
of dynamically representing

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000
ourselves as selves
standing in relationship

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.143
to object components in
the world or in our life.

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:21.480
So if the phenomenal model
of one's own perceptual state

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.350
contains a transparent
representation of their

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:29.350
causal history, then you will
have nested global states,

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:32.490
the content of which the system itself

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:37.023
can only truthfully describe
in the following way.

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:40.263
It can say things like this.

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.113
I myself,

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:48.380
that is the content of
the currently active

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:49.853
transparent self-model.

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:53.690
I'm seeing this object,

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:58.690
the content of a transparent
object representation,

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:00.913
and I'm seeing it right now.

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:03.510
Right now means as an element

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:05.500
within a virtual window of presence,

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:08.070
as an element of working memory.

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:11.300
And I'm seeing it with my own eyes.

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:15.300
And this with my own
eyes is the simple story

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:20.300
the brain tells to itself
about direct sensory perception

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.633
which sufficed for the
evolutionary purposes of the brain.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:28.810
Of course you don't see with your eyes.

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:31.740
I hope nobody of you believes that.

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.590
You see with your visual system.

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:38.410
But on the user surface so
to speak, on the top level,

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:41.270
there is this abbreviated short story.

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:45.403
The system tells itself
that it sees with its eyes.

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:49.710
And it creates this little
avatar which you are,

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:51.850
the phenomenal self-model.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:54.680
This avatar doesn't know
it has a visual cortex.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.800
It just sees with its eyes.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.560
It doesn't know it has a motor cortex.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.194
It just acts with its hands.

00:54:03.194 --> 00:54:08.194
So my final claim will be

00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:12.310
that to have a phenomenal
first-person perspective

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:16.223
is to possess a transparent PMIR.

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.600
And now I can come back
and keep the promise

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.283
I gave to you at the beginning.

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:30.223
Given all this, isn't it true
that the self is an illusion?

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.870
I think it is not true because it contains

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:36.070
a logical mistake.

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:39.010
On the level on which we are talking,

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:43.920
there is no such thing
as truth or falsity yet.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:48.920
There is nobody who could have
an illusion in this system.

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:52.780
So if you really wanted
to stay with the idea

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:56.280
that the self is an illusion,
you would have to say

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:59.933
that it is an illusion
which is no one's illusion.

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:03.970
And this brings me to the final point,

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:06.840
to the question, as this is
this year's first lecture,

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.930
the Immortality of the Soul.

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:13.660
If it is true that the self is not a thing

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:17.583
but a process as I've described it,

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:22.370
then it is also true that
the tragedy of the ego

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:26.040
dissolves because strictly speaking,

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:30.280
nobody is ever born and nobody ever dies.

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.315
Thank you very much.

00:55:31.315 --> 00:55:34.482
(audience applauding)

00:55:39.028 --> 00:55:41.611
(gentle music)
