00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.080
When it comes to sex, you gotta put your back
into it!

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.480
But not like...TOO much into it.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.790
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.180
Imagine having a magic night of sexytimes
and hurting your back so bad that you can’t

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.830
have sex again for MONTHS.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.360
It’s a thing, people.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.390
Sex can agitate all kinds of back aches and
pains - in fact, nearly 4 out of 5 people

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.500
will experience debilitating back pain at
some point in their lives.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.630
But we have (surprisingly) never had any hard
science on how to advise those people for

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.579
optimal comfort during sex - UNTIL NOW.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.329
While spooning was generally regarded as the
best sex position for people with back pain

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.420
in the past, new research at the University
of Waterloo has found that it’s actually

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.690
the WORST position.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.490
And to be honest, I kind of thought spooning
was just a cuddling position because it seems

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.600
like it would be really hard to move.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.610
Maybe I shouldn’t teach sex ed.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.510
To figure out the best positions, they hooked
couples up with 8 infrared motion capture

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.800
sensors -- similar to what animators use when
making video games.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.700
This monitored the position of the spine during
5 common sex positions for 20 seconds each.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.060
It also monitored what muscles were being
used during sex and orgasm.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.229
They wanted to test more than 5 positions,
and specifically “cowgirl”, but the lead

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.679
researcher said 5 positions is already a lot
to ask of the participants.

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:20.740
It’s unclear if he was in the room while
all this...data….was being collected….

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.049
The researchers found that, in general, doggy-style
is the best position if you have lower back

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.049
pain.

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.569
I can just hear it now: “but honey…..my
back!”

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.969
I also learned from the report, which was
published in the journal Spine, that scientists

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.779
refer to doggystyle as the “rear entry quadruped
position” - in case you’re trying to sound

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:40.060
official about it in bed.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.960
Missionary position where you’re on your
HANDS, not elbows, is also easier on the back.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.719
They advise that motions be made with the
hips and knees rather than the spine.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.499
We also learned from their data that it’s
not actually the back muscles but the abs

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:54.209
and butt that do the heavy lifting when a
guy orgasms.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.189
The research on women with bad backs will
be out in a few months.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.149
It’s exciting research and it’s good to
have some formal recommendations.

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.579
But it kind of makes me wonder...if you have
back pain, wouldn’t the best solution be

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.439
to do some of your own experimentation?

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.469
Y’know...try out a position and if it makes
you feel like you’re suddenly 90 years old

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:11.959
- try another one.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:12.969
Get freaky people.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.159
It’s for science.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.610
Thanks for joining me for DNews everyone.
