Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and all.

Speaker 1:          00:00:12       Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:12       just checking in on you. I'm just checking in to see how your week's going. You know, you know who I'm talking about. Oh, you brave warriors, you social justice people, you know, misunderstood, uh, you suffering white women in your fucking SUV is, I just, you know what you do day in and day out is so difficult and I'm just checking in to make sure that you're living your truth and whatever else is written on your fucking yoga pants. How are you everybody? I'm a New York City, New York City, skyscrapers and everything. Um, yeah, I've been here for a couple of days and a, I'm having a good time doing stand up, you know, even though it's like doing fucking stand up at a woman's college now I can, I have never, Eh, this trip, I swear to fucking Christ. I've gotten more grown standing on stage doing my bullshit act. Then I got my entire time when I lived here for New York for like 10 years. Like it's, it's fucking crazy what has happened to this comedy. This was one of, this used to be one of the great comedy cities. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01:29       You stand on stage. You feel like somebody is like fucking stepping on a puppy behind you. You're like, what did I say? What? What happened? Ah, like the old time. I am really holding on to this, this hope that this is just a ridiculous phase that this country is going through this ridiculous phase where we have allowed like 8% of the population in, they're unbelievably extreme lunatic ideas to push us so far to the fucking left at me as a lefty. Like now I feel like, do I need to start watching fucking Fox News? Is this where the middle is now watching those costs on that fucking channel? I mean I don't know what to do here.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:18       I Dunno. All I can tell you is when I did stand up over in Europe, like the, the level that they were laughing at us for, what the fuck we're doing because we're all in a bubble over here. I don't know what the deal is, but I think it's a sad state that I went to formerly communist Europe. Um, and I felt freer to speak over there then I fuck do here, but it's unbelievable. Oh. Um, but actually not in defense of New York City. I think I've been going further in the grown direction just as a reaction to it. Like, so I, I could give myself some space, you know, it's, it's fucking claustrophobic. I don't, I really don't understand. I just don't understand adults going to comedy shows and, um, I don't know. You know what? But you know, it was great. Was the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit that was fucking phenomenal.

Speaker 2:          00:03:13       And um, actually one of the comics, Mark Norman had a fucking great joke on shit like that, about people getting offended, which I won't tell cause it's his joke. So go out and go see them live. Um, thank you to everybody on that came out this year. I don't have the names in front of me, so I know I'm going to forget somebody. Michelle Wolf, Jay Oakerson, rich vos hosting it for the seventh year in a row. Mark Norman, Joe Lists, uh, Gary Gulman, Chris read, um, my mom and my mom. I know I'm forgetting like two or three people. I will, everybody went out and fucking killed. It was, uh, you know, we got great feedback about it. It was just, it's just, it's one of my favorite things in the world to do. And like I said, all the money goes to his mom and his wife and, uh, you know, and people have asked, well, why do you do it every single year?

Speaker 2:          00:04:05       You know, it's like boat, which is one theater gig. And Patrice was supporting those people. And I always hated it. When somebody dies. You do like one fucking, you do it once. He like, Oh gay, there's a sack of money. Try to stretch that out for the next fucking, I don't know, 20, 30, 50, 60 years that you live in, you know. Um, he was taken care of him. So, uh, he unfortunately passed away. So all the comics, make sure that we were taken care of who Patrice was taken care of. So, um, like I said, all they should have to deal with his degree for him not being here. Other than that, you know, we should all be helping them out, which we're doing. So thank you from the bottom of my heart to everybody who shows up to the thing and everybody comes out and donates their free time.

Speaker 2:          00:04:48       Oh, Maureen Taren, who puts the whole thing together. Um, it's, it's, uh, it's just awesome. So we're already thinking about the lineup for next year, kind of see if I can get Paul Versey, you know, got to get very easy to come down. Um, for some dumb reason, I haven't asked him to do it yet. There's always somebody every year. I'm like, why the fuck haven't I asked that person yet? So, uh, that is the deal. Um, anyways, let's talk in the news. Oh my God. You know, everybody is talking about this, uh, this Jessie Smith and Lewinski, whatever his fucking name is. Juicy, juicy, small, let Jesse Small that everybody's talking about that. But I don't think that's the biggest news. And, uh, the biggest story in the news right now, I think it's as I on Williamson's Nike. Okay. The brand that Paul Versey love, like it literally exploded on his foot and caused him to have injury.

Speaker 2:          00:05:49       Now, I can't imagine how many older white guys like me with the dad bod that are now going to reconsider buying Nikes because if it can't withstand the power of Zion Williamson, how is it with Stan? Me, I'm trying to think of some dads. Shit, I'm unfolding a stroller. Oh God. Can you imagine what those evil constant run Nike can you met that? I bet they bet they have the serial number on that sneaker. And they attracted down that fucking four year old that glued that thing together. Oh my God. What are they going? Oh, Jesus Christ. Probably going to hang them upside down for the next month by his fucking toes.

Speaker 2:          00:06:32       Yeah. Make them wear Adidas or some shit. I don't know what, but I can tell you something right now. They are rejoicing at Adidas, Reebok, uh, pro keds. Whoever else makes fucking sneakers. I gotta be honest with you man, that is like, I have not seen a guy, this is Zion Williamson. This if you Miss Bo Jackson, like this is what you're watching. Like somebody who just comes along. Yeah. I mean he's literally what the fuck this guy did. Like I could not do that to a sneaker if I got hit by a car, I'd have to get hit by some farm equipment and lose my leg for my sneaker to look like that. That was just the sheer strength of this man making a cut or whatever. I have no idea. But that reminded, the only thing I'd ever seen like that is you ever watched that shit on Bo Jackson?

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       How he ended up, um, having that career ending injury is he was running with such speed and had like a 250 lineback pound linebacker hanging on his leg as he continued to drag the guy down the field and just, it was weird. It was like his own strength worked against him because anybody else would have just fell down like a fucking sack of potatoes and he continued to run with 250 fucking pounds hanging on him. Um, unbelievable. So I help that kids. All right. I heard he is all right. Um, I'm sure nobody on the tar heels side of the fucking court was upset that he was out for most of the gang. I think he came back. I don't even know what happened. I, I'm missing everything. Like my Boston Bruins. Hey, we go bro words. Here we go. Um, have one seven in a row and I've missed every game.

Speaker 2:          00:08:19       I've been following it. Um, I heard there was a high stick goal that we got away with against the La Kings or whatever and uh, so we ended up winning in overtime. We just want in a shootout against Vancouver. Um, you know, big, big, big points. Getting 14 points out of 14 points this time a year going into March, moving up the playoff thing. I think we said they moved up to, uh, the sixth seat or something like that. Sweet 16. I don't know what the fuck they said, but all I know is what playing well. So that makes me happy. And when I get on the other side of my special here, uh, I will be looking forward to maybe take it in a game two. Um, all right, so let's talk about Jeff. Jesse smaller. Jesus fucking Christ. I, I've been watching this story just cringing. You know, in the beginning it was depressing. Like Jesus Christ. Like why would somebody do that to somebody? But then when it started to unravel, um, yeah, just like, oh no, please, no.

Speaker 3:          00:09:20       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       please tell me you didn't do this to your foot fucking guys on like one of the biggest shows on fucking TV. If this is true, that's why I don't like talking about it like, until it's like proven, but it's looking fucking bed. What? You don't, you know what I mean? You know what's fucked up is everybody, doesn't everybody have like a hero fantasy, you know, will you stop a bank robbery, uh, stops up terrorists. He ended up landing the plane or some shit, and next thing you know you're, you're on Oprah and she's talking to you. Just go in like, how are you so amazing? And you're like, ah, you know, shucks. I was just doing my job as a passenger. I did what anybody else you say of all your rush shuck slides and then all of a sudden you're like, you wake up from the interview when you realize you just drive it down the street or you or you were talking to yourself and somebody saw you, you know, at least performers, we're all a little bit nuts like that, but to fucking follow through with it. Then this guy ever watched the first 48 some of the ways they catch people. Now I, it's weird because I should be rooting for them, but it's just, you just, I watched some of these forensics shows. It's like, oh, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          00:10:35       You can figure it out from that. I remember one time this guy suffocated this woman using a fucking garbage bag and they somehow found her, her fucking face in the bag. Okay. You know, I gotta hand it to murder is the, I don't know if they just caught up on the emotion of it, but like they're fucking belief in themselves that they're going to get away with this shit. They should really just watch a couple episodes. I like the first 48 or one of these forensics fucking shows. I don't know how anybody gets away with anything, but um, I got us, be honest with you now that it's unraveling the bleach, the maggot hat magnet, what does it make? America great again. Mag a mag. I had the fucking, uh, the noose around his neck. It all kind of reads like, you know, when you do a first table, read up a script, you know, you're like, ah, it's getting there to get, he should've work.

Speaker 2:          00:11:27       Shopped it a little more. I would have gone, would not have had the hat, wouldn't have had the new, it's it. Oh, the news. So whatever. You know what it's like. It's like, you know, when one of the star light goes out and they, they accessorize too much and then they go, you know what, when it bright before you go out, take two things off. Like that's what he should've done. Should've got rid of the news and the fucking hat and uh, I don't get it. The only thing that doesn't make sense if this was fake, like what kind of a fucking asshole for 3,500 bucks is going to go to jail and then have a hate crime on your fucking record for the rest of your life? I guess they were assuming that they were going to get away with it. Um, I dunno man. It's just the eye. Is it weird? I feel bad for the guy. It just reminds me when I was a kid and I started lying to my parents and it's just fucking got out of control and then it's all, you know what it reminds me of. Okay. This is a true story. I'm going to show you my, my Jesse's, we all got a little Jesse similar smell let in us. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:12:37       Okay. So one time when I was in my first year of first grade, right. I loved it so much. I did it twice. Um, when it came to school, I was like, that fucking hurdler who just hit the first fucking hurdle and fell on his goddamn face in the fucking race was just over, you know, that was, that was my school career. So anyways, um, that was one of the first jokes I ever wrote. Talking about the second year of first grade, how fucking boring it was. Cause you learn how to read and you literally learn how to read the first grade. At least you did back then. So I remember like the first three months being bored out of my mind is these kids was sounding out the words. They would sit next to me going like, Duh, Duh Duh. In my joke on my hack was duck, the word is duck to matter.

Speaker 2:          00:13:28       The picture didn't give it away. That was my first really decent laugh. I've got my laugh. Am I act? It was, it was clean. People thought I was on my way to doing the tonight show with Johnny Carson. That's how long ago this was. Um, so anyways, that was in my first year of first grade and there was these two twins. All right. And I had a crush on one of them. Her name was Gwen and I can't remember the other one's name. Right. And, uh, so anyway, I think I might have told this story before on the podcast. Right. But so we're fucking, um, Aman, she's not in my class. I'm in the other class with the sister and her sister had this giant pink pen. Like, I dunno why it was like, like if it would be like the size of a number two pencil for like fucking Andre the giant. I don't know why she had the giant thing and for whatever reason, you know, I just looked at, I thought, I dunno, I just looked different. I thought it was cool. So she dropped it on the floor and we had like, all four of our desks were like made into a circle. She had like groups of four going around the teacher and it fell on the fucking floor. And um,

Speaker 4:          00:14:38       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       I fucking picked it up. And like an idiot, this is how dumb I was. I pick it up and rather than just stealing it, I just take it and I start writing with it. Like in the same fucking circle is her. So she looks

Speaker 5:          00:14:51       over at me, she goes, hey, that's my pen. And I go, no, it isn't like go, it's mine. So this is where my Jessie's story starts. If this guy's guilty, right. And I stick with this fucking story. She goes up to the teacher and she goes, Hey, took my pen and I'm going, no, it's, it's not her pen, it's my pen. It's a giant pink fucking pen. And the teacher just looks at me and she goes, you know, I think it's so and so's pet. I go, no, it isn't. It's mind. And then she described this crack that was in it, like to a t or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:15:27       And of course I got busted and the teacher's just looking at me like, you know, look at this little fucking Klepto Ron Howard looking mother fucker, right? So whatever, you know, you're a little kid, you blow it off 10 minutes late, you're probably talking to the person. You just did that too. But anyways, so the next day I go to school and in between, like during the class, they went to go to the bathroom. It just so happened that girl, Gwen, that I had the crush on, she just looks at me. She goes, I heard what you did to my sister. She had this fucking look on her face that she fucking hated me. And I just turned around and walked away, heartbroken to the, uh, to the bathroom, knowing that the first girl I had a crush on now knows that I'm a complete piece of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:16:08       And that was probably the first stepping stone on me becoming a fucking lonely comedian. I don't know how that ties into this, just, just these small epit this, oh my God, I can imagine that's a fucking felony. I didn't know that. Fake in a police report. I that act and nonetheless, yeah, he almost satis speckles they don't do that. Um, I guess it makes sense that the cops would be pissed if you fake something like all the fucking work they gotta do, you know what I mean? Putting this whole goddamn file together and like this shit doesn't make sense. It's like haven't write somebody a term paper for you. And it's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Just fucking with you. I'm not going to pay for that. And uh, I'd never really had to do a term paper and what the fuck was I doing over here for the last God damn three weeks.

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       Um, anyways, I got nothing to talk about. I am so fucking lonely right now. It's fucking ridiculous. Um, but my, my, my wife and kid are going to be flying out and meeting me soon. I can't wait. Thank God for facetime. All I do is sing baby shark. Get my kid going. You know. And then it's funny too is I say this thing like she always goes push the button, push the button cause she wants to hang up. So I just go, don't do it. Don't push that button. Don't push that button. She gets this big grin on her face. She loves nothing more. And right as I see, are about ready to laugh. Her face just disappears and then I become sad.

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       Anyways, Karl Lagerfeld died according to the New York Post. Jesus Christ. I know that. How sad and pathetic as this podcast right now it's saying it's his cat might get millions. I've be honest, man. You think I trash fat people? You should see fucking Karl Lagerfeld, Lara field, whatever his fucking name is. Um, he's just of, he was, I guess he was a fashion giant than he was very impressed with themselves. Um, all right. Somebody is about to get a golden litter box among those who could inherit a big hunk of the designer. Carl lager fields are $125 million fortune is the love of his life. His celebrity cat, is it show pay? Is that how you say his show pet is on an American would say Cho pet show pay all, um, Lagerfeld 85 who died Tuesday in Paris made it clear in the past that his blue eyed Berman kitty meant so much to him. Uh, that she would find a place in his will. Yeah. We probably knew like this to cats live like 18 years. You get one when you're 71 or whatever. Now wait, he was 85 probably got this thing when he was like 80.

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       He's probably be like, well, this thing is going to get fucking put down. That's not going to happen. This guy's a good shit. You know? I know he trashed fat people in short men and all of that type of stuff. I thought he was fucking hilarious. You know, there's a few people out there that I think should have been stand up comedians instead of what they did, even though they were wildly successful. Like both those brothers that are in oasis. I half the shit I read that they say, I like, this shit's funnier than anything I've ever fucking said. These guys really should put down their fucking Ukuleles and they should go on a fucking standup tour. I'm not saying they don't love their music. I'm just saying, and this Karl Lagerfeld, some of the shit that this guy said, it's like, just look up at this guy's quotes.

Speaker 2:          00:19:32       He was, he, he was like so fucking mean. It's funny, you know, unless you live here and then you're triggered and then everything needs to stop and we up the fucking do you know, I know I have a friend of mine, somebody said to where it said, uh, you know, hey, you know I'm really hungry. I'm going to go get something to eat. And she wrote back, she goes, me too. And then she wrote, not me too with like the Hashtag ha ha ha. And then the friend got all offended. Like, that isn't funny. You shouldn't joke about that. If we joke up, it's like between each other, you're fucking idiot. Nothing's happening here. And she literally had to talk this person off of a fucking emotional Ed like ledge. That's where we're at. Okay. That's where we're at in this country right now. And maybe that's why in this current comedy climate, somebody like this fucking poor pastor decided to fucking fake this goddamn thing, I guess. You know what, they give you a shit cause they could actually be out there solving real crimes. They you go build that only took your fucking 20 minutes to figure out,

Speaker 6:          00:20:38       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       Oh I could have been working on this domestic violence case, but I was this and it also probably had like this high level of like priority.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       Jesus Christ. Is this going to make a great made for TV movie?

Speaker 1:          00:20:56       You know what

Speaker 2:          00:20:58       I think considering magnum P I's not a white guy anymore. I'm throwing my hat in the ring to play Jessie Smollett in this, uh, you know, just a balance shit out. All right. If a, why didn't they give one in? They give magnum a new fucking Ferrari. Why is he still driving around in that fucking thing? You know, that's one of, there was one of the worst Ferrari's ever made. Why can, why can't you give the guy a nice ride? You know? Does that, does that make sense to anybody? I was so far. I mean, I liked it as a nice, cool that should be like his fucking weekend driver. You know what I mean? Like that was his high school car. So he kept it or maybe like, I don't know, maybe Tom Selleck fucking saved him from drowning. And when he was a kid, right after he bang that chicken, the bikini, you know, from the opening credits, then he's like, oh look at this.

Speaker 2:          00:21:45       I was bagging you hear in the sand and there's, there's a little fucking kid out. They're drowning. When are you saved him? He takes him in now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum. We're stuck here on this island, but we're having fun. Right. Right in the Ferrari. You can sit on the fucking console. Cause I got some hot ass sitting in the passengers to see, um, then he could have taken over the business. Right. You just have Tom Selleck, uh, you know, his character dies. It's how I would've done it. His character is dying. You know, you make it like somehow like a hot button issue. Like he dies of like a, I dunno, I dunno what prostate can't, nobody gives a shit about prostate cancer. He dies of male breast cancer. Okay. In October. And the NFL recognizes it by having pink mustaches put on top of their helmets, like looking like Lyft drivers.

Speaker 2:          00:22:41       Okay. In his dying words or tells this kid to take over the business and he's like, and I want you to take care of my car, make sure she's okay. Right. So on very special assignments. No, whenever he takes a woman out on the show, you know, I'm sorry, a warrior, a brave, courageous, so brave to get in those tee tops. Uh, that t top car and then he just takes them up at it. But the rest of the show, he has a brand new fucking Ferrari, you know, they chases people down in the street. And that's how I would've done it personally.

Speaker 1:          00:23:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:18       I don't want, I don't want to, you know, I'm not trashing the show. I'm just saying, you know, it's a network show. I know you've got the budget. You could have hooked the guy up with a new Ferrari. All right. I Dunno. I'll probably taken all this shit to fucking seriously. Yeah. I watched that show is, I didn't know, I didn't know what was up. What was down. Higgins is a woman now or I, I don't get it. That's like the new thing. You just do something that's already done, but then you just switch everything up. Yeah. This used to be a black guy and now it's a apparent, this was a white guy. Now he's Puerto Rican. This was a guy, now it's a woman in a, it's the same fucking show.

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       You know what they're doing right now. They're doing what Hanna Barbera did with all of their fucking cartoons with Hanna Barbera. God bless them because they did Johnny quest, my favorite fucking cartoon of all time, but those motherfuckers plagiarize themselves like 58 fucking times. They had the Scooby Doo than they are the Scooby Doo rip off. They had the Flintstones, which was a rip off of the honeymooners, and it was just placed in the stone age and then they did the sort of did the same fucking show in the future with the Jetsons. I forgot. I had this all mapped out, how they fucking rip themselves off. And then in the end they combined all of their characters and had these cartoon Olympics called the laugh Olympics, but somewhere. But it was all worth it. It was all worth it because of jinx the cat and uh, and Johnny quest. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:24:49       And with that, let me read a, let me read this here. A quip. One of the most important things we do for our health everyday is brushing our teeth. Yet most of us don't do it properly. How do you not do it properly? I mean, it's fucking, it's right there. Slide your tongue across your teeth. Does it feel gross? Which one feels gross? Brushed that one extra quip is a better electric toothbrush created by dentists and designers. Finally, they consulted the dentist. They got the pros in there. Quip was designed to make brushing your teeth more simple, affordable, and even enjoyable. Mm. I love this sensitive sonic vibrations. Sorry, I have to do the sound effects here. This is a very low budget. Read gentle enough on your sensitive gums. Why people brush too hard. And some electric toothbrushes are too abrasive. They could explain that better.

Speaker 2:          00:25:44       If you brushed too hard, you're actually gonna slowly wear away your gum line, which is going to lead to a, a a periodontal issue because what happens is is that enamel is on the party, your tooth, that that lives above the gum. All right below your gum, it doesn't have any enamel because it's supposed to be covered by the gum. It's protected there. So then when you start brushing too hard, um, you wear that away and eventually that part gets exposed and it's way more susceptible to tooth decay. Then what happens is eventually you're, you're looking at a crown or a root canal or God forbid you lose a tooth. Now when you lose a tooth, okay, you have to go to the fucking dentist and you have to get something put in there because what happens is, is the teeth next to it move to the side to try to close up the space and the tooth directly below it will erupt upwards to fill in that fucking space to help fill it in. And then when it erupts upwards, you got that party, a tooth that doesn't have an AML on it and that's exposed and then you lose that fucking tooth and then everybody starts fucking moving around.

Speaker 2:          00:26:50       It's a fucking shit show. You know what it's like. You ever seen those special forces when they, they, they got a hold the fucking log up to become like an army ranger and have one guy fucking quits. Then they all the other fucking guys, then they have to hold his weight up. They don't get to quit, right? It's kind of the same thing. But anyways, it's a built in two minute timer that pulses every 30 seconds to remind you when to switch sides, helping guide of full and even clean so you can be an absolute fucking moron and do it properly. Uh, up to 90% of us don't brush for a full two minutes. I guess. I don't, I guess I'm a moron or don't clean evenly. A multiuse cover mounts to your mirror and amounts to slide over your bristles a for on the go.

Speaker 2:          00:27:37       Brushing. Say why you love quip. I love quip cause they're paying me to say it. That's why I love quip. No, I love anything, anybody to be honest with you. Anybody that's helping you take care of your teeth. It's the number one fucking thing. So number one goddamn thing, you take care of your teeth like I like what you're going to do for yourself in life. All right? You chew your food properly. You don't have your fucking teeth, you're not going to do that. It leads to stomach problems, leads the gun problems. Then you got problems in your ass and next thing you know, if people are coming by on your deathbed, all right? Or You could just buy this toothbrush. That's why I love quip and why they're backed by over 20,000 dental professionals. Quip starts at just $25 if you get up, if you get, if you go to get quip.com burger right now slash bar right now, I could read that better get quipped Q u I p.com/burr.

Is that all that I had to talk about? Um, tonight I will be a, I'll be at the west side comedy club doing a little bit of time. Nothing crazy, but I'm just going to be doing my set until I fly over to jolly old England. Make sure it's ready to go. And uh, I'm starting to get butterflies, man. I'm might go almost a week out. Monday will be a week out and I'm getting ready to take this thing and I am very,

Speaker 7:          00:29:18       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:29:18       anxious to do it in a good way. I'm nervous, but in a good way. And um, I dunno, I can't, can't fucking wait. CanNot fucking wait and I'm gonna run the set tonight. What else did I want to talk about? Ah, fuck. I just had it.

Speaker 2:          00:29:34       See that you haven't and it just goes away. You know why? Cause I don't brush properly. If I did two total when I brushed, my brain wouldn't be fucking mush, I guess. I have no fucking idea. Um, anyways, it was fucking hilarious. It's not really hilarious. I was walking up the street and I was in a good mood and shit and there was this homeless person and she goes, can you spare some change or whatever? And I was like, yeah, I can. So I suppose that might give a change. I don't have any change. I'll give a dollar. So as I was reaching in to, uh, give our dollar, I would, I, you know, I felt weird because I was just standing there. So I was just like, hey, you know, how's it going? I said, how's it go into a fucking homeless person? And she just answered me honestly. She's like, well, I'm living in a shelter. My Dad died. And I was like, all right. All right. Dumb question. Kind of a fucking idiot in my, you know, so how are you, that's all I enjoy living on the street. Did everything you thought it was going to be?

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       Nope. I don't really think when I speak before, I speak a lot of the times and then I say it. And as it's coming up, I'm like, why did I say that? You know? But the good thing that I have is I know I'm a moron. I like to think this is one of my better qualities is I know I'm a moron. So as the person is fucking saying, why did you say that? I'm already agreeing with them. Like I know, you're right. You're right. I was stupid. So anyways, um, I hoped this Jesse Smollett guy somehow makes it come back. If this is all true, Ilb makes a comeback from this fucking shit. Jesus Christ. You hate to see. I hate to see it. You hate to see it. I've seen other people do shit like this. It's just, I just, you fucking, it's so fucking embarrassing.

Speaker 2:          00:31:21       It's fucking crazy to take it to that lack of, see if you just did this amongst your friends, you know, just tired one of your friends to punch you in the lip and then you walk into a party got jumped. But I fought him off. Oh my God, he's so heroic. And next thing you know, you're getting blown. You know, I can see the method of that madness, but to take it to this fucking level, you, you get to these fucking had gig come over the little fucking little brush, they start Dustin. Shit. It's all gonna fall apart. There's security cameras. You can't get away with shit. And now all these fucking people, they're sending their DNA into these goddamn things. It's, it's, it's, it's a fucking rep. It's a fucking rep. Put my man, man voice back on here. It is a fucking rap. You're not going to be able to do shit. And I'm not, I'm not defended people doing really crazy shit, but I mean, you're not gonna be able do shit. You know what I mean? Steal a Christmas tree sophomore at shit. Right. Go around knocking people's fucking mailboxes off with a baseball bat. Stupid Shit. Yeah, none of that. It's all going to be, there'll be a fucking drone following you around. Somebody had some in the future. I swear to God, these robots are going to show up with a little dusty fucking things that matter what, no matter what you do, you are at that

Speaker 8:          00:32:40       parking meter for all for 30 seconds more. Here is your ticket. But I got out of there before a cop came. Shut up. We will eliminate you. Speaking of elimination, the first mammal, I don't even know what it was. This little field mouse became extinct because of global warming. Cumin caused global fucking warming. Ah. Was the news going to talk about that? I going to talk about that, that I talk about it. Nah, talking about it in the end. I Dunno. I Dunno what the fucking solution is, but I do know this. When the water rises up your flat screen TV, you better get some flotation devices for it. You know, you know, it was gonna survive all the people that live in the middle, middle of the country. As the water rises up, they're going to fucking survive. You know? And that's going to be hilarious watching all the liberals who think they're so fucking smart running from for the fucking oceans rising.

Speaker 8:          00:33:36       You know, they're trying to hang out with all these, get her done fucking people. All right. That's a reality show that I, that's not going to have to be scripted. Um, anyways, why do I end up at such dark shit? I always do this one. I'm fucking alone. I just started thinking about the end of the world, I guess I just saying I missed my family. All right, I'm going to stop babbling. Um, God bless all of you. Enjoy your weekend. You fucking cunts. And I will, uh, I will check it on your argus. I Dunno. I'll do another fucking Monday morning podcast as I do. I've got to figure out when to do it. I don't know where I'll be. I think I'll be in England by then. Who knows? Maybe I'll put on a phony accent for you, Huh? Feel you deserve it. Kidding? Of course. All right. That's it. Please enjoy the music. And then we have another half hour of a Thursday afternoon just before Friday. Monday morning podcast, greatest hit episode. All right, that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:15       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:35:16       hey, what's going on? It's pilfer and it is the Monday morning podcasts for Monday, February 21st, 2011 I can't say that 2011, 2011 I fucking tongue gets stuck to the roof of my mouth. 2011 say, um, yes. What is up? It's Sunday afternoon. I am doing this podcast because I, I am, I am committed to finally getting these things up Monday morning all around the world. Unless you live in Japan, but if you live in Japan, you can't understand what the fuck I'm saying unless you're a US troop and you're stationed over there. At which point, I don't know what the fuck to tell you. All right, what am I supposed to do? Nobody in Australia complaints and there's 17 hours ahead of me. So stand down son. Um, I have a big day ahead of me. The NBA, all star game is, is, is fucking at the staple center, Staples Center home of the Los Angeles Lakers and they're 11 championship banners and then that one banner with all those ones from the BBA.

Speaker 5:          00:36:26       So anyways, you gotta be saying to yourself, hey bill, you're a big sports fan. Are you going to go to the game? Yes I am. I am going to go to the game. Can you fucking believe it kind of came out of nowhere. All of a sudden I had a hookup. Somebody came through with the ticket and I said, apps a Fuckin lutely. Somebody I know came through with the fucking ticket for the entire all star weekend yesterday for the three point contest and the dunking contest. He said, it starts at five 30 I'm like, fuck, I'm flying back from New Jersey. I land right about six and the guy's like, oh, just come on over. You'll get to catch the last half of it. I said, great. I go to get on my flight chief and he very full flight people. If you could not stand in the aisle, could you just can't find you sheets so we can expedite the fucking playable blow of the turmeric and I'm sitting there going, let's go.

Speaker 5:          00:37:19       People fuck them on. Sit down, sit down. Let's go. I finally got a hookup. Let's do something. Let's get this bitch off the ground. And one of the, what's the first thing that they say? I'm praying, praying for a nice 200 mile an hour tail wind or whatever the fuck I need to shave off a half hour. This son of a bitch. And what do they say? They say, we haven't very phone flight and a captain got on and he starts talking about how there's some fucking biblical level headwind that's going to slow down the plane, but we can try and make up the time at a different altitude. Didn't happen. They always stay. We say that this fucking flight is going to be about six hours and 15 minutes, all right? It doesn't take, that takes about five and a half hours with a usual goddamn headwind. Okay?

Speaker 5:          00:38:05       But they say six hours and 15 minutes just in case there's a delay, you know, take off or landing or whatever. They can still say that they're on time and if there's no delay, then they can be like, Eh, we got you in here about 20 minutes early. Like we can't do the fucking math. Like we don't know what they're doing. So it turns out this is fucking insane headwind and an ends up taking seven fucking hours to get to lax. And by the time I landed, I didn't even want to go. I didn't even give a shit. My fucking knees were fucking behind my shoulders at that point. Just cramped in there, you know an idea. I said, fine, I'll gives a shit. You know that Dunkin contest. I can watch all of that on Youtube, but I'm still going to the fucking game.

Speaker 5:          00:38:51       Um, and I'm psyched. I've never been to an all star game before. Never ever, ever. And I'm psyched to stand there and look at all the celebrities. They're going to be there and all their bitches. Huh? I don't want to see the wives. I want to see that bitches. I want to see they a gold digger and fucking whores. That's what I want to see. Fuck the NBA players. I don't give a shit about them. Bunch of Goddamn Weirdos. You're all six foot 10. You should be able to dunk. All right? And you look weird in street clothes. Do you ever see an NBA player in a suit? You know, we looks like that they have like giantism of something. They don't look right. They don't look right unless they're in a tank top and shorts standing next to another guy who's also six foot fucking tents. I don't give a shit about those guys.

Speaker 5:          00:39:35       They don't give a fuck about me, right? I'm there to see the gold digging whores. I want to see that whole fucking game going down. Right? Okay. It's the All Star Games. You know all these celebrities. They got to bring their bottom bitch to that one. They got to bring their wife. They got to bring this serious girlfriend. That's what the fuck they have to bring. All right. The, she's in the pride, but on the outside, little fucking hyenas trying to steal a little piece of meat, right? That's going to be all the horse. That's the game. That's, that's the fucking game I'm going to be watching. I want to see what ridiculous fucking outfit the gold dig and horror is. Gonna is gonna fucking be wearing the length that she's going to have to go to. To get this, these fucking multimillionaires, to notice him right in front of their fucking wife. I can't wait. I cannot wait. You know what? I got an idea. How about it takes some pictures. I'll take some

Speaker 9:          00:40:39       do that. That goes against everything that I'm about. I can't fucking do. I can't rat out people. I can't wait. That's what, that's what I want to see. I want to see that and absolutely no defense. You know, one 72, one 68 games. It's going to be fucking awesome. I can't wait and uh, and that's it. So believe it or not, I'm actually in a great mood. I had an awesome weekend. I have no funny stories to tell everything. Everything worked out. I did the Tarrytown, a music hall and Tarrytown, New York. Beautiful, beautiful,

Speaker 5:          00:41:11       full, lovely, safe, creepy, scary white is fucking town ever. You guys ever been to West Chester, New York? There is a level of wealth, a level of whiteness and a level of overall piece yet unbelievable fucking

Speaker 9:          00:41:34       to that part of the country. I can see. I'm tried. I tried to explain. I was talking about it on stage and people were laughing. I couldn't tell if they were just laughing because I was in that town making fun of it. But like Terry towns, like ridiculous. It's like,

Speaker 6:          00:41:50       yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:41:50       these, these, I mean you could shoot a period piece there, some Charles Dickens novel. If you ever wanted to turn it into a movie, you could very easily just remove all the cars and just dress everybody up. Like it was a 17 or 18 hundreds and just have them going up the street and a God damn horse. It wouldn't be a fucking problem. Put it this way, the next town over is sleepy hollow. All right. Headless Horseman Shit. Okay. And right next to that is the Hudson River. All right. And which is eerily quiet at night and a little bit south. You've got the Tappan Zee bridge, the whole thing. It looks like you're on. You feel like you're on a movie set. That's what I was joking about, that everything just felt so wonderful, peaceful and safe. And you felt every time you turned a corner, you felt that there was just going to be like a hundred zombies just standing there and then they'd look at you.

Speaker 9:          00:42:40       You know, when they get that, that excitement that they see fresh meat and I don't really happen to zombies, but all of a sudden they can run now, which is pretty fucking awesome unless you're getting chased by one. Um, that was the vibe of, of, uh, of Terry town. But I went in and I did, did my show. And you gotta understand like I did that theater like five, six years ago as part of a tour for the Montreal comedy festival. And I was on that tour with like, like six or seven other comedians. So all I got to do is like 15 minutes. And I remember I was excited then to be doing it. And you know, you start thinking like, man, am I ever going to be able to play this place on my own? It was fucking awesome. They showed up and the place was packed.

Speaker 9:          00:43:24       And then the next night was, uh, the count Basie theater in Red Bank, New Jersey. And that place was gigantic. And the second, you know, we booked it. I was paranoid that they're going to have to cancel it or I don't want you to only be like half fucking full. And that one ended up fucking selling out. And, uh, so I just want to thank everybody and creepy ass Tarrytown, sleepy hollow, Westchester County who showed up to my gig. Um, and everybody out in New Jersey now, people fucking sleep on New Jersey, by the way, you know, because all they do is they come out of Manhattan and they jump on the Jersey turnpike and they see all those chemical fucking plants and uh, they just think it's, it's a shit hole. But I'm telling you, there's some absolutely gorgeous parts of it. And Red Bank, New Jersey was one of them. Like I saw, have you ever seen what a $20 million home looks like?

Speaker 9:          00:44:18       You know, live. I've never seen it. It's, it's it. It's like these fucking people live in houses as big as schools and you know, and as much as they were beautiful and as much as I was in awe of them, I just remember thinking, how could you possibly do, have done anything remotely legal together, that fucking house, you know, I'm telling you, I swear to God, I bet 90% of them were bankers and people in finance. I'm telling you. And then the other will be like the, Oh that guy created a then the mutant Ninja turtles or something huge. But other than that, if you're just a regular fucking person, the only way to make that kind of fucking money is you've got to be in banking. Fucking genius. Whoever came up with the idea of a bank, hey everybody, you guys work all week and then you give you money to me. All right. Then I'll pull it all together and I'll loan it back to yet interest and then you give me more money on that while you continue to give me all your other money every fucking week. Don't worry, I'll keep it safe. You piece of shit, motherfucker. You fucking kidding me. Well, how do you justify, how do you earn enough fucking money?

Speaker 6:          00:45:43       Yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:45:43       I could see if Derek Jeter add one of those houses, I get it. I get it. He fucking shows up to a stadium and 60,000 people show up. What do you think? What would have happened if they said, hey, a bankers giving a lecture at Yankee Stadium? How many fucking people you think would show up fucking asshole? He probably couldn't even fill up the stress factory.

Speaker 6:          00:46:07       You know?

Speaker 9:          00:46:10       That's what I swear to God. That's, that's, that's my feeling when, when I, the few times that I've gotten into those types of areas, I drive by them and I am in absolute fucking are of the level of wealth. And then that's immediately what I think. Like there's no fucking way, there's no legal fucking way to do this.

Speaker 6:          00:46:32       You know,

Speaker 9:          00:46:34       take it from me, take it from me. I'm doing all right now. You know, selling out theaters. Let me, you should see the laws that they have to make sure that I don't get rich. They are just, they're taking a fucking machete to my knees right now.

Speaker 9:          00:46:50       When we do an impression of my, of me talking to my accountant every quarter, what do you gotta be? You know, sat to this fucking country that, that's 0.3 seconds. But I get it. I get it. We're fighting to fucking wars. Somebody's got to pay for it and it can be those rich [inaudible] Jesus fucking Christ. Anyways, the fuck was I talking about? Yeah. You know what it's like. It's like that, that president over there in Egypt, you know, he was like a bank. He had all their fucking money and it was just sitting there. He took it. Of course he took it, you know something. I'm not even mad at bankers. I'm not even fucking mad at him because I think, well, I don't know. I can't, I can't say money. That isn't the thing that gets me going. Women, I would say that you got to pick your weakness.

Speaker 9:          00:47:47       Some people you'll weaknesses money. Some people, your weakness, his power. Mine is the fucking Bra. I'll tell you right now, if making people laugh ever gets me to the level of being a dictator, there is no fucking way I'm going to be able to remain faithful. I will have, who is, do you understand me? People I will have fucking who was listening to me. I'm going to the fucking NBA All star game tonight. All right. And um, it's, I'm more excited to see the level of gold digging fucking whore that's gonna show up the temptresses I can't wait. I cannot fucking wait to see how high up you have to Jackie a fucking ass up to get noticed at the all star game. Cause you know, every horror out there is she's going with the fucking four, five inch Goddamn stilettos. Ah, walking down those, those, those fucking, you know, they're all going to be sitting, you know, where did gold digging whores sit? The wives sit court side, they sit, they sit in a group. You've ever noticed that they all keep the wives all you know, together. It's a very smart move by the men, you know, cause you got a bunch of women together. Eventually they're just going to be running their mouths. They're not gonna be paying attention to shit. I don't think we doing that shit while the fucking games going on. They don't give a shit, right. I'd say the gold digging whores.

Speaker 4:          00:49:16       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:49:17       I'm going to say that they're going to start at about row about 20 maybe 21 it's a more believable number, right? 20 was to even, you know, wrote 23 that's where they're going to start. All right, and that's going to be like the gold digging whores, gold digging whore. You know what I mean? Like the quarterback, quarterback, the comic's comic, the whores whore is going to be at the NBA All star game already. Bang in. Somebody's already hooked up. She's going to be about road 20 right? She's already gonna have guilted. Somebody down there, somebody connected that you know, how come your wife is sitting? Seven rows in front of me and Aa. I got to do what I got to fucking do and don't worry. I'll make it up to you. So she already has something shiny coming her fucking way. All right. And then you go back.

Speaker 9:          00:50:14       You Go, you go up while staple is weird where it's kind of the haves, the have nots, you know, see if he get to the upper deck, those are like the open miker horse. All right? That's someone who just fucking blew somebody in a ticket booth to get up to the 300 fucking level. All right? So what they're going to do is they're basically going to be dressed and hot for, uh, you know, I dunno, they're going to be updated with the fucking, uh, potato skin. Eaton sports bar guy, right. The season ticket holder assumption. I don't know what the fuck I'm consulting things kind of unraveling all I know. Is this going to be a bunch of fucking whores down there and I can't wait. I can't wait to look at him. No, I've got, I've come to this level in life where I, I really am. I don't judge people. I know I'm saying whores and gold digging. I, you know, I know I'm saying that ship and I'm not in a judgmental way. The same thing. I don't judge that. The, the, the fucking piece of shit. I guess that's judgemental, but you know, whenever I'm a piece of shit, the piece of shit guy who was running, shipped over there in Egypt, you know, I get why he stole all that fucking money because it was right there.

Speaker 6:          00:51:26       You know?

Speaker 9:          00:51:29       Right fucking there. I mean, until you are in that position where you're, you're at that level of temptation till you faced it and passed that test, you can't judge that guy. Can you imagine that? Just a mountain of cash just sitting right to the right. Your lazy boy, like a big bowl of fucking m and m's and you guys out there, you've got your little fucking m and m's right next to your TV chair. How many of those deed at night? You know, you ever tell yourself, this is the last handful. You tell your kid, go right back for more. You have a get it so fucking, you know you're doing that thing where you're making the fist and then you'd get fucking dropping them out of the bottom of your fists. You know, like some fucking, I don't know what, like some Goddamn guppy feeding at the top of a fish tank.

Speaker 6:          00:52:21       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:52:22       We're all gluttonous assholes and I'm, I'm, I'm right up there with them. I don't know what the fucking point was. I'm just telling you I'm excited.

Speaker 9:          00:54:40       Um, all right. I got a little backlash this past week from, um, from a number of things. One from, is it racist and another number from, uh, the two drink minimum. Let's start with two drink minimum first. Um, last week someone was talking about the two drink minimum. Uh, why they have that. A comedy clubs and I was trying to explain that that's basically how the comedy club makes money. So this guy says, Bill, as I listened to the podcast today, I must disagree with your diatribe on the two drink minimum yet you love that rather than my opinion becomes a diatribe. I ain't went to, I tried means, but that just sounds like made and seem like I was going on and on and on. Um, I agree. That comedy club, I agree that comedy clubs need to make money. Well, thank you sir. Thank you for extending me that fucking olive branch.

Speaker 9:          00:55:28       I agree that sometimes they promise certain payouts. Okay. I wasn't asking you to agree with it. That's how it is. But the two drink minimum is the equivalent of every other company's hidden charges. If the club needs to make money, add $20 to the price of a fucking ticket. People that don't drink have a real issue being forced to buy drinks because some clown can't manage his business any tighter. Whatever happened to truth and advertising, tell me up front what the entertainment bill is going to cost me regards. All right, whatever happened to truth in advertising. Um, sir, if you can tell me an era when there was ever any truth in advertising. Um, I will give you a box of free DVDs. There's never been any truth in advertising, and that includes you when you went out to bars and you're trying to get your dick sucked the way you made your job sound a lot more important

Speaker 9:          00:56:24       than it was. All right? So get off your fucking high horse right there. That's the first high horse you have to get off. All right? In a nice little you, it's like you're fucking driving. You ever see the Budweiser Clydesdale fucking thing? You know that. I don't know what it does. The stage coach for the guy who owns Budweiser, I never really understood what the fuck that thing was supposed to be. But uh, you have a team of Clydesdale high horses here. All right. The fact that you have to state that of Goddamn business needs to make money and that they actually promised to pay the ax. I don't understand those points. Um, and s okay. First of all, he's saying that a two drink minimum is the equivalent of every other company's hidden charges. There's nothing hidden about the two drink minimum. It's written on the fucking ticket.

Speaker 9:          00:57:12       It's on a sign inside the club as you're walking in, it's announced before the show. Everything two drink minimum, they actually have called comedy should teach shows on TV to drink two drink minimum. They used to be a show called two drink minimum. You know what I mean? It's like you'd saying that there's some sort of hidden thing that a fire engine is red. You go into a club, there's a two drink minimum. All right? What I think is really going on here is you, you don't understand the business of running a comedy club. All right? The, the, I don't understand why you're saying, why don't you, why don't you, uh, people that don't drink have a real itch. Everybody drinks, sir. Everybody drinks. All right? You don't drink. You don't drink it all. You don't drink water. You don't drink soda, you don't drink at all. You don't have to buy a drink that has alcohol in it, but you have to buy a drink. All right, and you're getting mad at the wrong fucking people. You're getting mad at the club because they're forcing you to buy drinks. Why do you think that is? Why do you think he cut the club owners greedy? The reason why they force you to buy drinks is because of the amount of fucking tightwads that show up to clubs and go, can I have a water? Two straws, police. That's the problem. All right.

Speaker 5:          00:58:40       See, back in the day that probably wasn't a two drink minimum because back in the day the artists used to get unbelievably fucked by the promoter, believe it or not, back in the day. This is like before free agency in sports back in the day believer it or not, when a band, a comedian, any sort of entertainer, went to a venue to perform. The promoter got 80% of the door and the artists got 20% all right. But because of the brilliance and the balls of Peter Grant with led Zeppelin, as far as I know, I'm giving him credit. He's the first guy I read that finally went up to the and said, listen mate, they come in here to look at the fucking building. Alright, you silly cunt that come in here to see fucking led Zeppelin. I know it's a brutal, brutal British accent, but he was the guy going, listen, nobody gives a fuck about your building. I could stick these guys in any fucking building out here. They're going to sell out because they're coming to see the band. So he was the guy who said, listen, we get 80% you get fucking 20% all right?

Speaker 9:          00:59:47       So the promoter has to make his fucking money and he makes money by selling food and drinks, all right? That's how it is. But the problem is, is people will go in there and they won't fucking buy drinks or they won't buy food. They'll go in there and they will sit there and they will sip on a fucking water. That's why there is a two drink minimum, which is advertised on the fucking ticket. It is advertised. They haven't on a signed before you even fucking walk in there. The you call up the comedy club. They say there is a two drink minimum. This show is 21 and older with a two drink minimum. I've heard that maybe 40 million times in my comedy career. There is no sort of false advertising going on here, sir. All right.

Speaker 5:          01:00:31       That is why they have to make money, dude. Do you know much money it costs to run a fucking club? Do you know much money? It costs to get a liquor license. You want to people, you have to grease the amount of taxes you have to

Speaker 9:          01:00:42       pay the amount you have to pay and fucking rent. All of that bullshit. You know what? You don't. I know a guy who opened up a fucking theater and it was these union guys. All right. And to change the sign, he had to hire two union guys, one guy to go up the ladder, one guy to hold the fucking ladder and a cop to stand there and make sure everything was fine, was costing him like 1500 bucks to put up. And this week come down and check out Bob Saget or wherever the fuck was there. So he had to sit there in lobby with politicians and lobby with all these fucking people and try and go around unions and all this fucking horseshit just so he could get a sign out front that he could change electronically from inside the building. Do you want to stand that fifth 1500 bucks a week times 52 weeks a year? That's just, if you just change it once, forget about this guy. The way he had it running, he had a musical act and a comedy act and then a musical act every fucking week. So it's three times a week. That's what, 3040 500 bucks. That's like, what? 250 fucking grand a year to get a guy to change letters on a fucking sign. Okay. It costs money to run a goddamn business. All right. I don't know what else to tell you.

Speaker 4:          01:02:00       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:02:01       But you getting mad at clubs for having two drink minimums. It's, it's, you know, it's not the club. It's not the club. It's all, it's the tight Fox sit next to you. Who's going to bring cheese? It's in and a little butter knife to spread his cheese on and that shit, you know, I don't

Speaker 9:          01:02:20       fucking stay home. I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to tell you. Uh, what else? Oh, what are the backlash shake? I've got to this week on the, uh, the fuck was it? Is it racist? Went back and forth with this fucking guy, which was hilarious. This guy was, he wrote that guy last week who wrote the thing where you said a bill. Older Asian is racist as shit. I'm sorry, but it is. So I wrote him back where I was like, well dude, you kind of have to elaborate on your point. And number two, why are you apologizing? That's kind of a pet peeve of mine. I hate when someone does is agree with you. And then they apologize. I'm sorry, but your angst like, dude, you're not, you're not sorry. Why are you saying you're sorry? What are you sorry about?

Speaker 9:          01:03:06       You're not fucking sorry. Stop saying you're sorry. So this guy goes on and on and on and he proceeds to basically say that I was playing on Asian stereotypes. Um, and that, and I had preconceived notions about Asians and all this type of shit. You know, and I don't give a fuck if you are just joking. That is racist. I don't give a fuck how you meant it. It's fucking race. All that psycho shit. And then he proceeds to prove his point by then hitting me. I Dunno what he, the rest of his fucking email, he was trying to give me examples that my preconceived notions, my alleged preconceived notions about Asians was fucked up as he then dumps of all his preconceived notions about white people. He goes, really? Are the Asians the only bad drivers? What about all those rich white kids denting their dad's Mercedes on the regular fucking Hilarious, you know?

Speaker 9:          01:04:04       All right. And then I just asked him to name who those rich white kids were because you know, I hung out with a letter, wrote white kids growing up, all white kids and none of them are dads had fucking w who are these rich white kids, sir? Where did you meet these rich white kids? Where you and your younger brother with the fucking kidney disease adopted by a rich white man? Is that how you ran into all these rich white kids? You're fucking generalizing. You're doing the exact same horse shit. So, but it ended up being a great debate. And this is, this is what I, this is what I've, I've, I've come to realize about jokes when it comes to race. I think I could be wrong here, but I think they threw, there's three categories when you do it. When you joke in a racial way, it can either a be straight up, funny B, be offensive or c be racist and it all, and there's a bunch of variables that play into it.

Speaker 9:          01:04:57       It plays in to the intent of the person. If your intent is not to be fucking racist, what you said I believe is not racist. What it is at that point is offensive. You made a joke, you thought it was going to be funny, but people took it a different way. They didn't find it funny. They're saying it's racist. You acknowledged just fucking around and it's like, well at that then it becomes offensive I think. All right, and then it also comes down to your relationship because if you know you're fucking white and somebody else is black or whatever and your friends, the level of being offended gets pushed way down the goddamn streets. You know, to the point. Sometimes if other people are listening, they can't believe what the fuck the two of you were saying to each other, but I still maintain, it comes down to intent now that older age.

Speaker 9:          01:05:58       Oh and and the social situation, all the region of just fucking around. It's a joke. It's not racist because I don't have any fucking bad feelings about agents. It's just something for, it's a funny fucking game. I came up with driving and traffic after I saw a pattern, I kept getting cut off and it just seemed that 80% of the fucking time it was either some old due to some Asian dude, so it was a joke. I started playing that game with my girl. What do you want? Older Asian, what do you got? Put your money on the table just fucking around. Now obviously if I'm doing that outside of the car, I'm going to fucking offense. I'm going to offend somebody, but it's still not racist because I don't mean it that way, you know? I know a lot of people gonna fucking disagree with that, but I truly, you can't tell me what the fuck.

Speaker 9:          01:06:50       I mean, I know what I'm thinking. You know? Does that fucking May, I don't know. I don't fucking know. But in the same thing is that that older Asian thing, Barack Obama couldn't be in the middle of doing the state of the union. Go on. We're going to get turns into country around, we're going to do this. We'll do that. And you know what? You know what, I like to play in the back whenever my limo gets cut up. I played this game called older Asian, you know, that's even that. If he's just fucking around, I don't think that's racist. It's incredibly irresponsible and would be taken that way. And at the very least it would be unbelievably fucking offensive. But I, that's what I think. You guys tell me what you think. I think if you just fucking around, if you don't mean it in a malicious way, it's, it's not racist.

Speaker 9:          01:07:34       You can be ignorant. You can offend fucking people and that type of stuff. But you know, I really don't think that me playing a game called older Asian is, is racist. Like some fucking guy in the clan going, we need to get these people out of the country. They're beasts and that type of shit. All right. I know. Say we'll do the two dot. So you're, what you're doing is a lighter form now. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. You're an oversensitive fucking cunt. All right? And you're so far to the fucking left. You're actually doing like this McCarthyism, bleeding heart horse. Shit. Go Fuck Yourself. Lighten the fuck up. Okay. Like when when I a black comic or somebody's given me shit that white people can't dunk a basketball or they can't fucking dance, you know, depending on how they say, if they say it in a mean enough way, I could get offended.

Speaker 9:          01:08:29       I maybe could get offended. But first of all, my honestly going to sit there and act like generally speaking, white dudes can fucking dance. Well, white people in general or that were dunking a basketball, how many six foot 11 fucking guys have I seen two and a half step and they just fucking dislocate their shoulder, hitting the ball in the front of the fucking room. You know, I think, you know what? I think a lot of people they don't have, they don't have a fucking sense of humor either. So, uh, I don't know. I think that guy last week at the Tony Gwynn game, that's fucking hilarious. That game that other guy played where he sits there saying, you know, he turns his back to the news and he hears the crime and he tries to guess the race is fucking hilarious. This guy had three heads in his refrigerator, crazy ass white guy, crazy as cracker or whatever. Like that's, it's funny.

Speaker 9:          01:09:19       Am I saying anything funny in this week? I feel like I've just been ranting for the past 20 fucking minutes. All right, let's, let's plow ahead here. Oh, some advice. All right. Advice Bill. Uh, I've heard you mentioned a few times that when you dedicated yourself to following your dream, you sa as a comedian, you sacrificed everything to throw yourself completely into comedy. And then you usually say that on some level it was easier for you to put everything on the line because you were young and it didn't have a lot to risk. I'm 37 years old, old jeans with a wife and two young boys who are ages four and six. A year ago I decided that I wanted to be a comedian. I've been doing open mikes consistently for a year and I feel like I have real potential. I know it takes a lot of time to get good.

Speaker 9:          01:10:01       My problem is I can't pay this month's rent. I'm scared to get a better fulltime job because it will take, um, Mr Away. It'll take me away from my dream. A little typo there. When you are older and have responsibilities like kids and a wife, how do you justify taking risks to go for your dream? All right, dude. All right. This is a rough one for me to give you advice on because I had never, I've never been in that situation. And also I never want to talk somebody out of, of doing what you want to do. You should definitely keep doing standup if that's what your heart's telling you to do. But as a man, you cannot have a wife and kids and not be able to pay the rent. All right? Um, you need to get a better full time job and you just need to fucking work harder and be more efficient when you go out to the club.

Speaker 9:          01:10:57       If you've been hanging out a little bit, don't hang out at all. And um, you know, it's what you're trying to do is not impossible, but I will tell you this. You can't LACUSC kid hope. All right? The number one job of a man is to fucking provide. He have to provide for your family. If you're not, you know, I, you know, I, I, I don't want to say this, but a lot at you, the women look at you like you're fucking useless. All right? That's like them without a fucking vagina. And I hate to reduce them as sex objects, but that's just how we view you fucking with you. But seriously, all right, you have to provide, okay. This is the thing I think, you know, if your wife is cool, she will understand that you want to make this transition, but you have to make it as smooth as possible.

Speaker 9:          01:11:56       You can't be in a situation where you're, where you can't pay the fucking rent. All right? So, um, I would get a better day job if you had to at this time. So you can pay the fucking rent and then you can burn it at both ends and do your stand up at night or whatever, right? And then eventually when you start getting paid gigs with that, then you can start to phase out the fucking day job. All right? But, uh, if I was you, I would sit down and have a heart to heart with your wife. So she gets where your head's at, you know, and just tell her, look, I really want to do this, but I understand my job as a man, as I have to provide. So I have, this won't happen again. Yeah. You know, you gotta have you got up, you got to pay the fucking pills. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:12:45       Yeah. You know, you gotta pay the fucking bills. It's just, it's your job as a guy. It really is. I don't give a fuck about all is equal rights in fucking independent women. Put Your fucking titties in the air or whatever. How the fuck that Goddamn Song goes? All right. Providing is our job. That's our fucking job. We have to, you have to do it. Wait, you have to fucking do it. You know? What do you fucking Steadman, you know? I guess that's okay if you're, if you're, if you're, you're, your chick is Oprah. Speaking of which you ever seen some of the operas houses. I became fascinated with that when I did that red bank and I was just looking at those fucking houses, the level of wealth, and I just started typing in Bill Gates' house, Oprah's house and just like the most, the richest people I could fucking think of. Like Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, m and m's house looked up his for some reason. Um, they're unbelievable. These, the first of all, they always like in like surrounding them was always like a forest like that maybe would have, they're so rich that we have neighbors. Some of them, some of them are, they've lived, you know, crowded areas like Miami beach. But some of these fucking people like m and m's house look like a, like a, I don't even know how to describe it.

Speaker 9:          01:14:11       It looked like a house.

Speaker 9:          01:14:14       That guy looks like an optical illusion. Like it was a house. And then you give us, he like in a movie, like where it, all of a sudden a guy just gets a hunchback. That's what his house looked like. It was a house. And then bomb, there's another part of the house. And then, then another house who's like, he just took like these 20 fucking houses and just stuck them all together. That'd be a great house to have if, if, if you were wanted by the law, you know what I mean? You could literally hide out in your own fucking house, take by, by at least another two and a half weeks of freedom by the time they fucking found you. You know, I don't know. I don't know what the Hell I'm saying. Um, so anyways, do that. That's, that's a real tough situation. I hope you work out. Don't give up on your dream, but, uh, you know, your wife is going to be way more supportive if, if, if you're, if you're paying the Goddamn, but you gotta pay the bills. Got To pay the bills. All right, here we go. Next one. Hey, Bill. Uh, as for advice a couple of months ago about a friend of mine, this was another brutal one.

Speaker 6:          01:15:17       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:15:17       But a friend of mine who's girlfriend was having a kid and I was suspicious about whether or not, um, it was his, because he had gone and gotten checked twice to see if he could have kids. And the doctors said, no. Oh, I remember this guy. Remember that one? The doctor said this guy got checked twice. They said he couldn't have kids and all of a sudden his girl was pregnant and there was questions about her being faithful. I remember this, I remember this well, this is the update of this. He said, well, about five months into the pregnancy, she miscarried. So the problem kind of solved itself, but it was a terrible thing to happen. Now they are living together and I'm still pretty positive she was cheating on him and he's hanging onto the relationship now through some sort of guilt because of the lost child.

Speaker 9:          01:16:07       It just feels like my friend got one pulled over on him and I really want to talk to him about it, but I can't find a good way to do it. Uh, your podcasts rules and I help you come to Edmonton sometime. It'll comic strip, right? The comic strip in Edmonton. I'll make my way up there at some point. Um, dude, that is a brutal, brutal, brutal, brutal situation. And uh, it all depends on how you feel. How are you going to be able to live with yourself if you just say, listen, this kid is just a moron. He's my friend, but he's a fucking moron because that is an option. You know, the good moment, you know, when he, uh, they tell that joke in Italian and Deniro says, what does it mean in, in pet? She goes, it means he's, he's content to be a jerk.

Speaker 9:          01:16:52       You know, what am I going to say? My wife two times me that joke basically about a guy who knows his wife's fucking around on him and he just doesn't, he just looks the other way. He's content to be a jerk. So that's what your friend is right now. I know this emotions involved, so there's, there is hope for them, but you know, he's, he's fucking himself over. So this is the deal. If you can live with yourself and just say, this guy's contend to be a jerk. I'm not going to get in the fucking middle of this because there's so many obvious red flags here and this kid is just choosing to ignore them. Um, you could just say, fuck it. He's content to be a fucking idiot, but if you're not going to be able to live with yourself, then I would just sit down and talk to them. All right? And, um, hopefully listens to you and if not, and he stops being your friend. Um, there's nothing you can fucking do about that. And I got a feeling probably seven or eight years from now, you might get a phone call to him saying, you know what, you are right. But the, those are impossible situations. Jesus Christ. How the fuck would I handle that?

Speaker 9:          01:18:11       I would, uh, I would say something. You know what? I would, I would definitely say something, but uh, I don't know how to do that, to be honest with you. I didn't fuck what I was sad. I say, listen, you know, I'm friends with you. We've been friends a long time. That's what your buddy knows. Something fucked ups coming. Let's see. We've been friends a long time, right pat? A lot of good times, right? You know, you know, you know that I've always been there for you and I never tried to steer you wrong. Right? Like I think your girlfriend, is it two timing?

Speaker 9:          01:18:50       Yeah. How do you say that? I would just rip the bandaid off. Just say listen to something I have to talk to you about. We're friends and as a friend. All right. I can't stop thinking about this and it would kill me to not bring this up to you. I have to do this. I'm not trying to be malicious. I'm doing this because you're my friend and then I would just say, look, ah Jesus. I just had it narrowed. He forgets how fucking difficult disease. I would just be. It's fucking ridiculous. Look, you told me you couldn't have kids. You went to the doctor twice. You got tested. They said you couldn't have kids yet. This girl somehow got fucking pregnant. Don't say fuck there yet. Your, your, your girls somehow got pregnant. Okay. Then you just sort of stare at them. I Dunno where to go from there. All right. My guts telling me that that wasn't your fucking kid too. That's a hard one to that one, that, that kid you just fucking cried over that didn't get born. I don't think it was yours. Anyways. Ah, Jesus, dude, this is fucking brutal. Brutal.

Speaker 6:          01:20:11       Um,

Speaker 5:          01:20:12       I would do, this is what I would do. I would do what I'm doing right now into a mirror and just keep correcting it as you go the same way I said, okay. Don't say fuck there. And then you back it up again and just somehow figured out a way to say that I think your girlfriend is a whore. I don't think that she's being, I don't think you're, I don't think the woman that you're with has been a 100% honest with you. And I don't think

Speaker 5:          01:20:40       that she has been 100% faithful. And my gut was telling me that that wasn't your kid. See, that's brutal. Taking it to there. All right. I think you need to get out of this relationship. I mean, I don't do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to fucking, yeah, you stumped me. Stumped the Schwab. Me, I, you know now like I know everything obviously, but uh, I usually can come up with some sort of angle. I don't know what the fuck to tell you what for whatever you do, don't write it down. Don't put it in a letter cause he'll probably show it to her and then, then, uh, then it'll just be brutal. The fuck that. Don't, don't do that. Just a huge, that's a uh, yeah. I don't want to tell you dude, that's a fucking brutal one.

Speaker 5:          01:21:24       Jesus. Does it work to just say it? Listen, man, you're best. We're best friends, right? We can say anything to each other. Yeah. I think your girlfriend, uh, fuck somebody else without a condom and got pregnant and said it was yours and it's such a fucking psycho cunt that she was about ready to let you take on the responsibility and invest that sort of time, your life. She was content to throw away your fucking life because she can't keep her fucking legs on the ground and our panties up around a fucking waste. Do you understand me? She's a fucking whore. All right. You went to two fucking doctors and they said you can't get pregnant, dude. How dumb are you?

Speaker 9:          01:22:07       Get your fucking head out of her fucking vagina. Wake up. It's not your kid. All right. That was God. God gave you a fucking Mulligan. He gave me a pass. All right. They go, you want to get old? Jesus. You want to get fucking religious about it? Get out of the goddamn relationship. Stop being such a fucking pussy.

Speaker 5:          01:22:27       Leave her

Speaker 9:          01:22:29       cry about it for fucking six weeks. Whatever you gotta do, go join a fucking gym and get on with your fucking life and start wearing a condom. All right. Now I know that team that we saw in the first half is not the fuck attain that. I know. Well, we got enough 30 minutes of fucking football and I want you to get out there. It proved to me that you could play and I got the way. I know you could play. That's what you do. You got there where we go. It took me a minute to work it out. You go fucking Vince Lombardi, grab, grab, grab nobody tackling.

Speaker 6:          01:23:02       Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:23:03       She's a fucking whore. You gotta go like Dad. You've got to build up. You've

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       got to start slow. You got to start slow. Oh my years are looking at relationships. I don't think I have ever in my life seen a woman. So pull the fucking wall, a pubes over somebody's fucking eyes like I did at first half. You know what I saw out there? I saw bullshit. Just some, I don't know how to do it. I'm out. I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to tell you. Tell that fucking kid. He needs to make some halftime adjustments. All right, pull the ripcord. Get the fuck out of that gene as well. See these, these, these are the things they, they don't, they don't, they don't talk about these kinds of, of, of women on, on those real shows. They'll show women like that on Jerry Springer and everyone looks like a retard, so nobody gives a fuck. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:23:56       But they won't show those kinds of women on those. Those real sort of issue shows when they're just always talking about guys who beat their women, which they're horrible fucking people and they should talk about them. But why don't they ever talk about horse? You know, the only time they talk about whores is just when they try to figure out why there a whore. You know, dad didn't stick around fucking uncle dental, Domo, you know, whatever. They always got a fucking reason. Now he's got a goddamn excuse. You know? Maybe they're just horse. You ever think of that? I think there's already women out there as a woman out there when I want to know this. Okay, this is totally anonymous and I'm not judging you because I'm a male whore myself. All right? I want to know this. Is there a woman out there with dad stuck around?

Speaker 5:          01:24:42       You had a great family. You weren't touched in any funny way. You went to school, you know you are girl scouts, you did all the right things, but you just love Dick. And not only do you love Dick, you love a bunch of different dicks and you are in a relationship, but every once in awhile you just got to go out and go back somebody else because you're fucking bored basically. Are you wired like a man? That's what I want to know. Okay. And you can be totally honest. Let's examine. Let's examine that because I don't even think it's fair to just brand them all horse. I don't, I think some of them are raw, actually really intelligent and they've actually sat and contemplated it, Jeff or you know, done. What I've done is justify their piece of shit moves.

Speaker 5:          01:25:45       Ah, you know something. This is the time when I really should just have a guest. I don't have a guest. I got to have more guests on this fucking podcast. What do a what? Do what do? What do you, what do you want from me? All right. You guys want some youtube videos for this week? Huh? Have you slumped over and your cubicles left yet? Have you done that with five minutes left and you fucking day. All right. Youtube videos for the week. Uh, the truth about Facebook privacy, I actually haven't a chance to watch this yet. This was suggested to me by somebody close to me, so I just put that on there. I hear it go when fireworks fail, this guy shoots off one that should, it should have gone on after the fucking Boston pops. And he basically shoots it off in his own neighborhood. And for some reason it goes off about, oh, I don't know about maybe 30, 35 feet in the air, a bunch of houses around. Um, here's another good one. Angry skateboarder. Here's a hockey one. Blonde Jaga is in Jaromir Jaeger and a band called a mute math. Great musicians, great albums, albums, and they have a fucking insane drummer.

Speaker 9:          01:26:46       Oh, speaking of which people, speaking of which, um, I've been taking my drumming to a new level, to a brand new fucking for me. For me, I still suck. But after plateauing, I, uh, I just sort of, I got fucking add, right as you could tell from my podcast, hey, have you noticed that I started to make a point than something else reminds me of something else. And then maybe I'll drive over to the left for a while. You know, I can't sit still, I can't focus unless, uh, unless something really fucked up is happening. That's the only, they something really fucked up has to be happening before you will get 100% of my attention, you know? I don't know why, but that's how it is. So, uh, with my playing drums, I'm the same way. I'm always learning,

Speaker 5:          01:27:44       trying to learn five different things at the same fucking time.

Speaker 9:          01:27:49       You know, I'll do this for like three minutes and I'll do this for three minutes. I'll do this for two minutes and then, and then I'll fuck, you know, and then I have three new things that I'm trying to learn and rather than just learning one and getting it down, I don't, and, and uh, it's something I've known for a while. I watched this guy, Mike Johnston, who has these great lessons, any, he had this, he basically mapped out on how to practice. He teed show you something and it was, it was pattern. You get the pattern down and then you bring it up to speed and then you'd move it all around the kit. So it's just patterns, speed, movement, ABC one, two, three could, couldn't have got any more basic, but my fucking add, I couldn't fucking do it. So I finally decided I was fucking sick.

Speaker 9:          01:28:40       I was sick of this shit. So I just decided to focus on a couple of things and one of them was at Joe Joe May or fucking thing with your bass drum foot. It's something I saw Steve Gadd do. A lettuce is really for drum heads here. Steve Gadd Duwan is up close video a long time ago and I sat down and I fuck with that thing after borderline messing with it for a year and a half. I sat down for like like three days in a row and religiously worked on it and was blown away by how much faster I got my foot as far as being able to do three hits in a row because I'm Ah, who's kidding who? Any Zeppelin fans out there? There's two licks, three licks that I've been trying to get down. Okay. I finally be able to get the good times, bad times, 16th note, triplets.

Speaker 9:          01:29:26       I can do those fucking things up to speed. I can play good times, bad times, but when he does the three in a row like that, licky does on a, I can't quit you babe. When he does the three in a row there and out on the tiles, there's a lick in there where I think, I think I'm hearing three and then the want and soc, which is a big debate on how to this is so fucking is I'm really going to lose a lot of listeners here, but there's a big debate on how the fuck he plays that. Does he pay bone that the debt, the debt or done that? The debt that the debt, I think he does three after the snare, he and uh, on the to us is so fucking stupid. Why am I talking about this anyways? What that Jojo Mayor Shit. Okay. They play that at about 101 hundred two beats per minute, but that Jojo mayor thinks I can play that lick with the three hits on the Bass Drum after the snare on too. I can play that at 90 beats per minute.

Speaker 1:          01:30:24       MMM.

Speaker 9:          01:30:25       Permanent. Yeah. I can play it at data at this point. So I'm within fucking striking distance of that after, you know, fucking with this thing for a year and a half, finally just sitting down. Um, and if drummers out there wasn't any sort of advice, I can show you what I did because I'm just really nervous that this is just, I mean, it's already bad enough. I have people in Europe listens to me, go off on American sports and in Australia and shit. For me to actually sit here and describing drum licks, it's pretty fucking pathetic. But, um, anyways, I think I'm winding down here. I got to make sure I edit this thing and get this thing up on time and I also have to make sure, oh my God. Oh fuck. What time is it? I got to go three 15. I gotta be down at the fucking place to buy four. Fuck. All right. I gotta go. Thanks for listening to the podcast. Uh, God bless all. You don't take any shit. Go Fuck Yourself. See it.
