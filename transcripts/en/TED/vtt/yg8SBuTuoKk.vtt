00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:15.800
My best friend recently had a baby.

00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:18.963
And when I met him,

00:00:18.987 --> 00:00:24.945
I was in awe of witnessing this tiny,
beautiful being enter into our lives.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:30.926
I also had this realization
that he wasn't just entering our lives,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.587
he was entering the world --

00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:38.248
this crazy world that, especially now,
feels so incredibly challenging.

00:00:39.537 --> 00:00:44.026
I spend a lot time in my work
talking to people about who we are,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.516
who we must be

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.618
and what our healing looks like.

00:00:48.327 --> 00:00:50.756
So the first time I held him,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.272
I had my pep talk ready.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:56.828
You know, I wanted him to know
that the way we find our strength

00:00:56.852 --> 00:00:58.406
is through our challenges.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.080
I wanted him to know
that we can all do something big

00:01:01.104 --> 00:01:02.295
when we start small.

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.762
I wanted him to know
that each of us is more resilient

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:07.457
than we could ever imagine.

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:10.520
So here I am holding little Thelonious.

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:12.932
I look down at him,

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:14.893
and it hits me:

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:17.095
he's a baby.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.120
(Laughter)

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:21.081
He's not going to understand
a single word I say to him.

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:24.810
So instead, I thought
it would probably be a better idea

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.089
if I went home and wrote.

00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:28.569
So, this is for grownups,

00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:31.990
but it's also for Thelonious,

00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:33.636
when he's old enough to read it:

00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:38.811
The world will say to you,

00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:41.042
"Be a better person."

00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:44.873
Do not be afraid to say, "Yes."

00:01:45.777 --> 00:01:48.561
Start by being a better listener.

00:01:49.214 --> 00:01:52.161
Start by being better
at walking down the street.

00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:53.922
See people.

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.422
Say, "Hello."

00:01:55.446 --> 00:01:58.557
Ask how they are doing
and listen to what they say.

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.559
Start by being a better friend,

00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:04.443
a better parent,
a better child to your parents;

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:07.541
a better sibling, a better lover,
a better partner.

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:10.789
Start by being a better neighbor.

00:02:10.813 --> 00:02:14.155
Meet someone you do not know,
and get to know them.

00:02:15.242 --> 00:02:16.889
The world will say to you,

00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:19.022
"What are you going to do?"

00:02:19.914 --> 00:02:21.939
Do not be afraid to say,

00:02:21.963 --> 00:02:24.726
"I know I can't do everything,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.958
but I can do something."

00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:29.697
Walk into more rooms saying,

00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:31.140
"I'm here to help."

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.935
Become intimate with generosity.

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:37.795
Give what you can give,
and do what you can do.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.389
Give dollars, give cents, give your time,

00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:41.971
give your love,

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.860
give your heart, give your spirit.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.033
The world will say to you,

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:50.808
"We need peace."

00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:53.737
Find your peace within,

00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:55.998
hold it sacred,

00:02:56.022 --> 00:02:58.659
bring it with you everywhere you go.

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.989
Peace cannot be shared
or created with others

00:03:03.013 --> 00:03:05.589
if we cannot first generate it within.

00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:07.830
The world will say to you,

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.619
"They are the enemy."

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.700
Love enough to know

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:14.733
that just because someone
disagrees with you,

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:16.580
it does not make them your enemy.

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:18.859
You may not win an argument,

00:03:18.883 --> 00:03:20.898
you may not change a mind,

00:03:20.922 --> 00:03:22.823
but if you choose to,

00:03:22.847 --> 00:03:27.759
you can always achieve
the triumph of radical empathy --

00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:30.016
an understanding of the heart.

00:03:31.324 --> 00:03:33.203
The world will say to you,

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:35.619
"We need justice."

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:38.104
Investigate.

00:03:38.803 --> 00:03:41.611
Find truth beyond
the stories you are told.

00:03:42.012 --> 00:03:44.568
Find truth beyond the way things seem.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.249
Ask, "Why?"

00:03:46.756 --> 00:03:48.423
Ask, "Is this fair?"

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:50.969
Ask, "How did we get here?"

00:03:51.488 --> 00:03:53.340
Do this with compassion.

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.683
Do this with forgiveness.

00:03:56.183 --> 00:03:58.271
Learn to forgive others.

00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:02.283
Start by truly learning
how to forgive yourself.

00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:05.315
We are all more than our mistakes.

00:04:06.187 --> 00:04:09.140
We are all more
than who we were yesterday.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.202
We are all deserving of our dignity.

00:04:13.022 --> 00:04:14.789
See yourself in others.

00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:18.269
Recognize that your justice is my justice,

00:04:18.293 --> 00:04:19.885
and mine is yours.

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:24.821
There can be no liberation for one of us
if the other is not free.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.703
(Applause)

00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:30.782
The world will say to you,

00:04:30.806 --> 00:04:32.344
"I am violent."

00:04:33.014 --> 00:04:34.850
Respond by saying,

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:36.055
"I am not.

00:04:36.548 --> 00:04:39.953
Not with my words
and not with my actions."

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:42.439
The world will say to you,

00:04:42.463 --> 00:04:44.040
"We need to heal the planet."

00:04:44.995 --> 00:04:48.280
Start by saying, "No, thank you.
I don't need a plastic bag."

00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:50.348
Recycle, reuse.

00:04:50.372 --> 00:04:54.491
Start by picking up
one piece of trash on your block.

00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:56.973
The world will say to you,

00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:59.600
"There are too many problems."

00:05:00.415 --> 00:05:03.171
Do not be afraid
to be a part of the solutions.

00:05:03.865 --> 00:05:05.964
Start by discussing the issues.

00:05:06.364 --> 00:05:09.978
We cannot overcome what we ignore.

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.501
The more we talk about things,

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:15.771
the more we see
that the issues are connected

00:05:15.795 --> 00:05:17.925
because we are connected.

00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:20.257
The world will say to you,

00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:22.032
"We need to end racism."

00:05:22.587 --> 00:05:25.522
Start by healing it in your own family.

00:05:26.168 --> 00:05:27.828
The world will say to you,

00:05:27.852 --> 00:05:30.374
"How do we speak to bias and bigotry?"

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:35.699
Start by having the first conversation
at your own kitchen table.

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.587
The world will say to you,

00:05:39.044 --> 00:05:40.809
"There is so much hate."

00:05:41.568 --> 00:05:43.292
Devote yourself to love.

00:05:44.022 --> 00:05:48.109
Love yourself so much
that you can love others

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:50.951
without barriers and without judgment.

00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:56.172
When the world asks us big questions
that require big answers,

00:05:56.196 --> 00:05:57.618
we have two options.

00:05:58.013 --> 00:06:02.251
One: to feel so overwhelmed
or unqualified, we do nothing.

00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:07.364
Two: to start with one small act
and qualify ourselves.

00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:11.350
I am the director of national security,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.047
and so are you.

00:06:14.147 --> 00:06:17.712
Maybe no one appointed us
and there were no senate confirmations,

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:20.354
but we can secure a nation.

00:06:20.673 --> 00:06:24.148
When you help just one person
to be more secure,

00:06:24.172 --> 00:06:26.195
a nation is more secure.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.042
With just one outstretched hand
that says, "Are you OK?

00:06:30.066 --> 00:06:31.909
I am here for you,"

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:35.709
we can transform insecurity into security.

00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:39.051
We find ourselves saying to the world,

00:06:39.075 --> 00:06:41.822
"What should I do?"
"What should we do?"

00:06:41.846 --> 00:06:43.603
The better question might be:

00:06:43.627 --> 00:06:44.923
"How am I showing up?"

00:06:45.393 --> 00:06:48.260
I ask the world for peace,

00:06:48.284 --> 00:06:51.441
but do I show up with peace
when I see my family and friends?

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:54.829
I ask the world to end hatred,

00:06:54.853 --> 00:06:59.088
but do I show up with love
not only for those I know,

00:06:59.112 --> 00:07:00.517
but those I don't know?

00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:05.423
Do I show up with love for those
whose ideas conflict with my own?

00:07:06.074 --> 00:07:08.423
I ask the world to end suffering,

00:07:08.447 --> 00:07:11.920
but do I show up for those
who are suffering on my street corner?

00:07:12.549 --> 00:07:13.726
We say to the world,

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.332
"Please change; we need change."

00:07:16.356 --> 00:07:18.998
But how do we show up
to change our own lives?

00:07:19.402 --> 00:07:23.582
How do we show up to change the lives
of the people in our communities?

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:30.529
James Baldwin said, "Everything now,
we must assume is in our own hands;

00:07:30.553 --> 00:07:33.118
we have no right to assume otherwise."

00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:35.651
This has always been true.

00:07:35.987 --> 00:07:39.327
No one nominated
Harriet Tubman to her purpose,

00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:41.812
to her mission, to her courage.

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:43.899
She did not say, "I'm not a congressman

00:07:43.923 --> 00:07:45.764
or the president of the United States,

00:07:45.788 --> 00:07:50.213
so how could I possibly participate
in the fight to abolish

00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:52.061
a system as big as slavery?"

00:07:52.493 --> 00:07:56.469
She instead spent 10 years
making 19 trips,

00:07:56.493 --> 00:07:58.370
freeing 300 people,

00:07:58.394 --> 00:08:00.272
one group of people at a time.

00:08:00.922 --> 00:08:03.324
Think about the children
of those 300 people,

00:08:03.348 --> 00:08:06.587
the grandchildren,
the great-grandchildren and beyond.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:11.069
Our righteous acts create
immeasurable ripples

00:08:11.093 --> 00:08:13.669
in the endless river of justice.

00:08:15.052 --> 00:08:21.949
Whether it's Hurricane Katrina, Harvey,
Irma or Maria, people did not say,

00:08:21.973 --> 00:08:24.696
"There is so much damage.
What should I do?"

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.020
They got to work on what they could do.

00:08:27.044 --> 00:08:28.712
Those with boats got in their boats

00:08:28.736 --> 00:08:32.258
and started loading in every woman,
man and child they came across.

00:08:32.282 --> 00:08:35.037
Near and far, people gave their dollars,

00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:36.803
they gave their cents,

00:08:36.827 --> 00:08:38.236
they gave their hearts,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.874
they gave their spirit.

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:43.968
We spend so much time

00:08:43.992 --> 00:08:46.946
thinking we don't have
the power to change the world.

00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:51.346
We forget that the power to change
someone's life is always in our hands.

00:08:51.994 --> 00:08:56.724
Change-making does not belong
to one group of people;

00:08:56.748 --> 00:08:58.984
it belongs to all of us.

00:08:59.448 --> 00:09:03.558
You don't have to wait
on anyone to tell you

00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:05.208
that you are in this.

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:06.845
Begin.

00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:11.717
Start by doing what you can
with what you've got,

00:09:11.741 --> 00:09:13.126
where you are

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.789
and in your own way.

00:09:15.952 --> 00:09:18.440
We don't have to be heroes,

00:09:18.464 --> 00:09:19.771
wear a uniform,

00:09:19.795 --> 00:09:21.418
call ourselves activists

00:09:21.442 --> 00:09:23.394
or get elected to participate.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.387
We just have to be brave enough to care.

00:09:28.994 --> 00:09:33.047
Now, around the time Thelonious was born,

00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:36.769
I went to the birthday party
of a man named Gene Moretti.

00:09:38.064 --> 00:09:40.545
It was his 100th birthday,

00:09:41.955 --> 00:09:45.738
which means he lived in the United States
through the Depression, World War II,

00:09:45.762 --> 00:09:47.367
the struggle for workers' rights,

00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:49.427
the achievement
of a woman's right to vote,

00:09:49.451 --> 00:09:50.735
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:52.453
a man on the moon, the Vietnam War

00:09:52.477 --> 00:09:54.698
and the election
of the first black president.

00:09:55.175 --> 00:09:56.953
I sat with him, and I said,

00:09:56.977 --> 00:10:01.839
"Gene, you have lived
in America for 100 years.

00:10:02.696 --> 00:10:05.555
Do you have any advice
during these current times?"

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.311
He smiled and said to me simply, "Yes.

00:10:09.981 --> 00:10:13.130
Be good to as many people as possible."

00:10:14.252 --> 00:10:16.088
And as he danced with my mother,

00:10:16.112 --> 00:10:18.361
who is, by the way, half his age,

00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:23.546
in a room full of generations
of his family and hundreds of people,

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.663
many of whom traveled thousands of miles
to be there to celebrate him,

00:10:28.599 --> 00:10:32.257
I realized that he had not
just given me advice,

00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:34.584
he had given me the first step

00:10:34.608 --> 00:10:37.918
that every single one of us
is capable of making

00:10:37.942 --> 00:10:41.761
if we want to create
a real, wholehearted impact

00:10:41.785 --> 00:10:44.318
on the world around us, right now.

00:10:45.147 --> 00:10:49.259
"Be good to as many people as possible."

00:10:50.158 --> 00:10:51.309
Thank you.

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:54.565
(Applause)
