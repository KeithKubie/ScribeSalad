come well the first reason in my opinion
 

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.390
come well the first reason in my opinion
is that it didn't work the first time

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:49.400
is that it didn't work the first time
 

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.230
is that it didn't work the first time
and so it's difficult to use it a second

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:53.240
and so it's difficult to use it a second
 

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.420
and so it's difficult to use it a second
time so basically if you say they're
