00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:14.230
SingularityNET is a blockchain-based platform
for artificial intelligence and it originated

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.269
really when I realized that two goals that
I had could be fulfilled simultaneously by

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.500
the same software platform.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.230
One goal being providing a tremendous variety
of AI services created by a huge variety of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.149
different developers across all areas in a
way that's decentralized and democratically

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.550
controlled rather than within the proprietary
silos of big tech companies; and the other

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.780
goal is to work toward powerful and beneficial
artificial general intelligence.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.910
And what I realized at a certain point is
you can achieve both of these goals by making

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.379
a framework where multiple AIs written by
multiple people can be put into a common platform

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.940
where they can not only serve requests from
end users but they can exchange data among

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.860
each other and the different AIs in the network
can ask questions of each other and help each

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.750
other solve problems.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.550
So you have multiple AIs in the same network
that, you know, they can compete with each

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.930
other for providing services, but they also
cooperate and link together into networks

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.150
of cooperation.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.680
So the whole network of AIs becomes this sort
of meta-AI, a society and economy of minds,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.000
which is in itself a kind of emergent-level
mind.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.080
So there's a commercial aspect of low cost
AI services across vertical markets providing

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.720
incentive for any AI developer to contribute
into the network, and there's sort of a broader

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.280
singularity-aterian motive, which is 'Hey
what's the best way to create the framework

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.310
within which artificial general intelligence
can crystallize and emerge?'

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:11.360
The role of blockchain in SingularityNET is
really to enable secure decentralized control.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.291
So without blockchain, of course we could
make a distributed network of AIs that all

00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:22.930
talk to each other and share data and outsource
work to each other, but we need to have like

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.060
some central control point that kept a record
of who's in the network, who's allowed to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.720
enter into the network and what each guy in
the network can offer to whom.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.519
And then if there was going to be a change
to how it operated all the changes would propagate

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.860
from the central control point.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.951
What blockchain lets you do is have a network
of AIs all cooperating and operating by a

00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:52.810
common protocol but have no central controlling
and governing agent.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.861
Rather the records of what happens in the
network are stored distributive â€“ we have

00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:00.700
copies of the records everywhere.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.420
And then control is governed by democratic
decision making among all the participants

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.959
so it's like a digital biological organism
with no central point of control, and this

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:23.209
has various advantages in terms of the inter-operation
of this network of AIs with the human world

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.340
and with countries and companies and people
because it means there's no one person or

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.090
company or government who owns the thing or
controls the thing.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.510
And this puts the network in a quite different
status relative to the world economy and human

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.950
society than if there was a single human owner
who is responsible for everything.
