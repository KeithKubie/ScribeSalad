If you open up the documentation,

00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:05.271
you can see a couple of examples
of typical screen widths.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.602
Then it suggests how you can setup 
your layout folders,

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:09.827
so that you can have 
a different mean activity layout

00:00:09.827 --> 00:00:11.862
for tablet's versus for handsets.

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:16.782
Here we define tablet's as having 
a smallest width of at least 600dp.

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:21.362
To customize the UI further, 
we can create a layout-sw720dp folder.

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:23.662
That way, we can have 
a different main activity layout

00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:26.070
for ten inch tablet's versus 
for seven inch tablet's

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.885
versus for handsets.

00:00:28.572 --> 00:00:30.025
So back to our quiz.

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:34.279
We need to define activity_main.xml file
in our base layout folder

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:36.818
so that we can accomplish 
this layout on the phone.

00:00:36.818 --> 00:00:39.858
This layout applies to both phone, 
portrait, and landscape,

00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:43.562
so we don't need a special version 
of the layout in the layout land folder.

00:00:43.573 --> 00:00:46.631
We do also need to declare 
activitymain.xml

00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:49.349
in the layout-sw600dp folder.

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:53.726
That way it will override the one pane UI 
and use a two pane UI in this case.

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:57.061
It will be picked up on devices 
that have greater than 600dp

00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:58.449
in both width and height.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.077
That means seven inch and ten inch devices
in both portrait and landscape mode.

00:01:03.077 --> 00:01:08.216
And lastly, we don't need layout-sw720dp
because we don't have different layouts

00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:10.631
for seven inch versus ten inch devices.
