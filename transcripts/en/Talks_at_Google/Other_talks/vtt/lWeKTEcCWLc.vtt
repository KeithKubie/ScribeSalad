[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.377 --> 00:00:08.460
SARA HAMDAN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.540
Thank you so much for being here
for this exciting Google talk,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.070
exciting for two reasons today.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.150
One is because we are the first
to be doing it in this room.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.890
Yay.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.970
And second because we have
with us a very famous movie

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.681
director, Ali Mostafa.

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:26.180
Not many people can
say that they've

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.510
been credited with such amazing
success on a personal scale,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.420
but also on a kind
of regional level.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.750
So his film "City of
Light" is actually

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.270
credited with being the
first Emirati feature

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.800
film, which is huge.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.310
And it's kind of changed
the face of Dubai cinema.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.760
So we're going to hear about
this journey, how he even

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.020
began all of this.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.840
We're very keen to hear
about your creative process,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.290
your creativity.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.507
So I just want to start with
how did you get into filmmaking?

00:00:55.507 --> 00:00:57.590
I think it's a dream we
all have when we're young.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.910
It sounds very glamorous.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.240
Why did you choose
it as a career?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.780
ALI MOSTAFA: Well, thank
you all for being here.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.910
Thank you for having
me, first of all.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.930
I just want to make a
small little correction.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.650
Yes, it is labeled as the
first Emirati feature film.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.600
But technically, it
isn't because there

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.430
was a film that was released.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.680
It may not have gotten
a theatrical release,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.050
but there was a
feature-length film

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.820
that was made prior to mine.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.220
It was only because mine was
on an international scale,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.860
and it did quite well
in the box office

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.230
that they labeled
it as the first.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.440
So let's get that
technicality out of the way.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.980
SARA HAMDAN: If it's on
the internet, it's real.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.940
ALI MOSTAFA: Exactly.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.320
There's no fake news there, no.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.380
So I started-- how did I start?

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.760
Well, since I was a child, ever
since I was nine years old,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.890
I've been making films.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.330
And when I say
making films, I've

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.310
been taking my
parents video camera

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.340
and shooting my toys
and my younger brothers

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.140
and whatever I could do.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.050
It started, I guess, with this
massive Betamax collection.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.660
I don't know how many of you
remember what Betamaxes are.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.040
OK, it was before VHS.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.590
There was the little
ones called Betamax.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.660
And he had a massive collection.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.910
Actually, my father
always managed

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.820
to start a collection of things
that were bound to be obsolete,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.080
which was the Betamax, and then
he later went to LaserDiscs.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.550
Anyway, that's another story.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.520
So I watched "Star Wars"
for the first time.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.820
And I was, like, blown away.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.570
I said, I wanted to be
the guy who created that.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.151
There's a lot of
times that people

00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:39.650
would watch something and say
they want to be the person who

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.775
was acting in it, or they
want to be the person who

00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:43.910
was involved in such and such.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.980
I immediately knew
I wanted to be

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.760
the guy in the background who
kind of created that world.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.880
And so when I watched
"Star Wars" and, obviously,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.521
a lot of stuff from George Lucas
and Spielberg-- it was "Jaws."

00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:57.020
It was "Star Wars,"
"Indiana Jones,"

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.440
stuff like that that really,
really got me excited.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.690
And then when I saw--

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.780
it was to me, it was the first
kind of epic Arab kind of film.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.370
It was called "Ar-Risalah,"
which translates "The Message."

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.320
It was by, God rest his
soul, Moustapha Akkad, who

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.590
was very well known
for having produced

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.820
the "Halloween" movies,
those horror films.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.297
So after seeing that and seeing
the scale of that film, I said,

00:03:26.297 --> 00:03:26.880
you know what?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.439
There is a chance for
someone in the Arab world

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.980
to be able to do
something like that.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.860
And so it was always
a dream of mine.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.190
So from stealing my parents
camera to eventually getting

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.999
having one given to me
as a birthday present,

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.540
to then doing
stop-motion animation--

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.520
SARA HAMDAN: So they
sound really supportive.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.436
ALI MOSTAFA: Oh, yeah.

00:03:43.436 --> 00:03:46.640
They were supportive because
that's all I kind of did.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.090
It was either filming my toys
or doing stunts and filming

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.044
myself doing stunts.

00:03:54.044 --> 00:03:55.460
Actually, I was
torn between being

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.625
a stuntman or a filmmaker.

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:57.814
SARA HAMDAN: I wanted to
be a costume designer.

00:03:57.814 --> 00:03:58.738
ALI MOSTAFA: Oh, yeah?

00:03:58.738 --> 00:03:59.200
SARA HAMDAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.124
ALI MOSTAFA: So yeah.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.570
So yeah, so basically, that's
how it really all started.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.690
It started from
when I was a child

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.883
and how my parents
really supported me.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:11.562
SARA HAMDAN: And
then you studied

00:04:11.562 --> 00:04:14.060
film And was "City of Light"--
what was your first project?

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.120
ALI MOSTAFA: OK, so there was a
lot that happened before that.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.430
So I was doing film, obviously
childish amateur stuff.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.420
And then before graduating
from high school,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.560
I had a lot of friends that were
about 10 years older than me.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.316
And they were all
working at the time.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.190
And so they were all
having their own income.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.682
And I was still on
like a pocket money.

00:04:39.682 --> 00:04:40.640
SARA HAMDAN: Allowance?

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.020
ALI MOSTAFA: Allowance.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.220
And so I really wanted to
start having my own money

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.890
and feeling a little
bit more responsible.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.730
And my mother has
an events company

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.890
called Blooms, which started
as a flower shop in the '80s.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.779
And she has a trade license
for interior design.

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.320
Now, I grew up in a household
where my father's an architect.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.760
My mother was doing a lot of
events and creative stuff.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.380
So I got to see how a
lot of stuff was built.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.160
And I was also blessed to be
able to sketch and draw things

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.520
from a very young age.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.220
So I went to her and said,
you have this trade license.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.896
You're not really
doing much with it

00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:22.520
because you're focused
on other things.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.190
What if I set up a division of
interior design with you guys?

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.950
And the first thing I did was
design my sister's wedding

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.300
stage.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.720
Now, in this part of the
world, weddings are massive.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.180
And you would have the
wedding stage to be themed.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.084
SARA HAMDAN: This should
be your next film.

00:05:45.084 --> 00:05:46.630
ALI MOSTAFA: What,
my life story?

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.715
SARA HAMDAN: The wedding.

00:05:47.715 --> 00:05:49.020
Have an Arab wedding.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.430
ALI MOSTAFA: So basically--
yeah, there's one, as well.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.214
So basically, you have
these massive wedding stages

00:05:57.214 --> 00:05:57.880
that are themed.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.280
And my sister's wedding stage
was a secret garden theme.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.060
So that was my--

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.910
and I designed it, sketched
it, and then we built it.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.522
And kind of my wedding stage
career kicked off after that.

00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:11.230
SARA HAMDAN: Wow.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.230
ALI MOSTAFA: And I was
just doing wedding stages

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.410
for about a year and a half.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.229
I had about 30
people underneath me

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.020
in terms of people who
were working for me.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.830
And we were building
these wedding stages.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.350
And I became really
popular doing this.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.750
And then I reached a point--

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.708
and this is before
graduating from high school.

00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:29.060
So I graduated from high school.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.970
And that's what I kind
of did for a while.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.160
And I'm like, I have
to actually stop

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.690
what I'm doing because
my goal is to make films.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.720
I just started this as
something to just make

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.270
a bit of money on the side.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.830
I wish I didn't stop
it because I was

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.940
making a lot more money then.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.750
But anyway, so basically,
I stopped that.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.440
And I started searching
for film schools.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.735
And I looked everywhere.

00:06:58.735 --> 00:07:01.311
I looked in New York, Los
Angeles, all the places

00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:01.810
in Europe.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.351
And then I found this one that
I was really comfortable with,

00:07:04.351 --> 00:07:06.460
which was the
London Film School.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.570
And it was close to 50
years as a film school.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:16.400
But unfortunately, it
was a master's course.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.160
And so when I graduated
from high school,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.961
I started this division
in this company.

00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:21.210
And I was working for a while.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.160
So I didn't even go
and do my bachelor's.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.054
But then I saw that you needed
a few things to actually get

00:07:28.054 --> 00:07:28.720
into the school.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.360
Number one, you needed to
have some kind of, like, work

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.720
experience in the industry.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:40.630
You needed to have made a
short film, critique a script,

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.940
and do a storyboard.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.000
So I gathered all of
my wedding stages,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.920
and I put it in this portfolio.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.950
And I sent it to the
school as though it

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.670
was a production design,
which is a part of filmmaking.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.670
SARA HAMDAN: Yeah, true.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.950
ALI MOSTAFA: Because you know,
you're building sets and films.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.330
And what we do in
wedding stages,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.300
we're literally building sets,
and then taking them down.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.927
So I got into the
London film school.

00:08:03.927 --> 00:08:05.260
SARA HAMDAN: Based on your work.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.615
ALI MOSTAFA: Based on my work.

00:08:06.615 --> 00:08:07.240
So I ended up--

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.330
SARA HAMDAN: That's amazing.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.788
ALI MOSTAFA: --skipping the
bachelor's, and I went straight

00:08:09.788 --> 00:08:10.394
to a master's.

00:08:10.394 --> 00:08:13.900
SARA HAMDAN: So independent,
ambitious, creative,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.050
think outside the box.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.190
ALI MOSTAFA: Think
outside the box.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.731
SARA HAMDAN: That's
your personality.

00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:20.316
And I feel like I can describe
"City of Light" the same way.

00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:22.690
I mean, I don't know how many
of you have seen this film.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.760
But the reason why I agreed
to moderate this talk

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.680
is because I loved it.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.470
I found it extremely--

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.329
all the things I just said,
but also controversial.

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:34.870
Can you tell us a
little bit about it

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.411
for those who haven't
seen it and are

00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:38.890
going to run out and see
it immediately after this?

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.250
ALI MOSTAFA: Right.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.960
Well, I don't know if you'd feel
the same way about seeing it

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.460
now.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.420
That film was done
almost 10 years ago.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.340
So "City of Life" was--

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.620
so after graduating
from film school,

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.910
I wanted to get
into the industry.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.870
So I think I should say this
before actually going straight

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.690
to "City of Life" because it
was a journey to actually get

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.070
to "City of Life."

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.700
"City of Life" was a
film that I wanted to do.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.560
But after graduating
from film school,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.070
I had to do a graduation film.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.374
And in order to do
the graduation film,

00:09:12.374 --> 00:09:14.540
you had to kind of select
where you wanted to do it.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.540
So I picked Dubai.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.350
And it was the first
film or short film

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.750
or whatever film of
any capacity that

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.700
was shot on celluloid,
which was meaning we

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.100
shot it on 16-millimeter.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.220
And that was in 2003.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:29.970
And I was shocked.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.940
I'm like, is this really the
first film to be shot on film?

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.020
And that short film went on to
a competition in the country

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:43.305
to win Best Emirati Film amongst
many other Emirati films.

00:09:43.305 --> 00:09:44.680
It was actually
quite surprising.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.510
We had a lot more people
interested in film

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.610
those days than they are now.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.421
So fast forward.

00:09:51.421 --> 00:09:53.670
Trying to get into an industry,
the only industry that

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.700
existed here was a
commercial industry,

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.460
which I ended up
trying to get myself

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.650
on as many sets
as possible, where

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.700
I was helping with the grip
department, the gaffers, and--

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.667
I don't know, these are
all terms used in film.

00:10:06.667 --> 00:10:09.000
But the gaffer is a guy who's
in charge of the lighting.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.580
The grip's the guys in
charge of what you would

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.699
have as a tripod or a dolley.

00:10:13.699 --> 00:10:15.240
So that would be
the grip department.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.156
So I would be helping
all of these departments

00:10:17.156 --> 00:10:19.170
until eventually, I
would go and become

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.980
a third assistant director.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.747
I was fourth for a
very short period,

00:10:24.747 --> 00:10:26.205
but third assistant
director, where

00:10:26.205 --> 00:10:30.120
I'd control a crowd
in a football stadium

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.970
for a beverage
commercial, where we have

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.070
to move the crowd from
one side to the other,

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.420
and just screaming
down a megaphone,

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.100
to becoming a second
assistant, trying

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.710
to get myself as close
to director as possible,

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.960
till eventually becoming
an assistant director,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.660
and then wanting to
make my own commercial.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.890
That's a story on its own.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.950
But eventually--

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:51.630
SARA HAMDAN: We'll
definitely get back

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.130
to that later
because a lot of us

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.929
work with advertisers
and brands.

00:10:54.929 --> 00:10:55.720
ALI MOSTAFA: Right.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.720
SARA HAMDAN: And we do
want to learn about that.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.000
But about your film first.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.791
ALI MOSTAFA: Right.

00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:04.410
So to skip all of that, I had
to stop getting into commercials

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.119
because it was
something that you were

00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:07.410
kind of getting sucked into it.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.190
SARA HAMDAN: A different path.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.520
ALI MOSTAFA: A different path.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.460
So I had to stop
doing commercials.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.640
And as you can imagine,
it was a very tough period

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.440
for kind of just
stopping work entirely

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.680
because I was married at the
time, trying to start a family.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.540
And I didn't have a job.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.550
I had to stop it and
focus on my dream, which

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.030
was making this film.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.270
I remember selling my car
to fund my first script.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:38.214
Anyway, 28 scripts later,
I came up with this idea.

00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:39.630
And this was around
the time where

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.800
Dubai was being bashed a lot.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.570
There was a lot of Dubai
bashing going on in the West.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.755
You know, calling it this fake
place, this artificial place,

00:11:49.755 --> 00:11:52.030
it's made of plastic
fantastic and all of that.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.238
And it was something that
was affecting me because it

00:11:54.238 --> 00:11:56.080
was a place that I grew up in.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.920
And them calling it soulless, I
said, how can you call a place

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.070
that all of us grew up in
something that was soulless?

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:07.020
Yes, it's evolved
in an amazing way.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.720
But it wasn't
soulless, you know?

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.310
So I decided that I wanted
to try and make a film that

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.920
spoke about the Dubai I knew.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.610
So I did-- it was a film that
was about three characters.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.750
There was an Indian taxi driver.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.770
And the entire part of that
film was spoken in Hindi.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.430
Then we had the
Western characters,

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.120
the Western storyline,
which was in English.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.410
And then you had the
Emirati storyline,

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.230
which quite a lot,
actually, was based

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.940
on events that happened
in my life, which

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.850
was spoken in Arabic.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.180
So there was three
languages, three characters,

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.920
and it was very much
a Dubai-centric film.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.959
And I remember when we got
to start making that film--

00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:58.500
even though that again, that's
a huge story for it to get off

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.590
the ground because that film
took me almost five years,

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.040
four and a half years
to make that film.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.770
And how we even got to
making that film-- but once

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.580
the film was made and
released, it really

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.480
had this buzz around it because
it was something that was never

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.220
done before at the time.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.380
It was something that
spoke to so many people.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:26.760
And it for a good nine years
held a record in how long

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.670
it lasted and how well
it did in the box office.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.290
SARA HAMDAN: I
remember when I first

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.090
heard that this film
came out about Dubai,

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.980
and I'd been living
here for about 10 years.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.590
I was excited to see it.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.520
But I was also taking
it with a grain of salt

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.910
because I thought
it must be censored,

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.600
or it's going to just
be happy happy, light.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.000
But he's been very
humble about it.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.170
It's powerful because just from
what I remember from seeing it

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.340
so long ago, the characters go
through some really emotional

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.790
things that you wouldn't expect
to see in a movie in Dubai

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:00.920
at the time, especially.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.720
So there's a stewardess who
gets pregnant out of wedlock.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.919
There is an Emirati
man who loses--

00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:12.085
I can't remember if it's a
brother or a best friend?

00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:12.350
ALI MOSTAFA: Best friend.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.320
SARA HAMDAN: His best friend
and develops a drinking problem.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.040
So you see an Emirati drinking.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.130
These are very, very strong
themes to tackle long ago.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.400
So I have to ask, how
did you get away with it?

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.730
ALI MOSTAFA: Oh, by
the skin of my teeth.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.230
That's for sure.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:36.770
Because not a lot
of people know this,

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:42.190
but the film was banned at one
point before being released.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.400
And this was even
before it was released.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.330
So it was--

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.690
OK, I guess I'm going
to have to get into it.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.650
Before making the
film, in the country,

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.230
you have to go to what is
called the National Media

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.430
Council, which you can't shoot
anything here unless you've

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.092
got script approval.

00:15:02.092 --> 00:15:04.300
You need to get a certificate
from the National Media

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.810
Council giving you
approval to make a film

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.220
and based on the
script or whatever.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.640
So it was six months of
driving back and forth

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.020
to Abu Dhabi of them rejecting
the script, of me trying

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.760
to convince them how this is
important for the industry,

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.380
and we have to be talking
about things like this,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.200
even though I was only
scratching the surface when

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.120
it comes to controversy.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.590
But there needs
to be some drama,

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.000
and this is what we have to do.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.800
And it just kept
getting rejected.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.790
And I think they got sick
and tired of seeing my face,

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.320
where there was a
compromise of OK,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.990
this is what's going to happen.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.320
And by the way, in the
four and a half years,

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.860
I managed to raise about $5
million to make this film.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.470
OK?

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.178
And a guy who's never
made a film before,

00:15:52.178 --> 00:15:54.100
so that's a story on its own.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.280
So I got to a point where
they said, you know what?

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.100
OK, shoot the film.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.730
And once it's finished,
we will watch it,

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.620
and then we will decide.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:12.400
So imagine the pressure of
shooting your first film where

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.970
only you and the producer know
stepping onto set every day

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.860
that it might never
see the light of day.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.210
So we go ahead.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.614
We make the film.

00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:23.530
There's this huge buzz,
again, around the film

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.020
because there's press
hearing about it.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.520
They're seeing us
shooting on the streets.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.920
We're, like, on
[INAUDIBLE] Road.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.830
We're by the desert.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.820
We're around Dubai.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.010
There's this buzz about this--

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.370
it's the first big
production Emirati film.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:42.110
And then we reach a point where
I have to now screen the film.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.940
So I gather everyone.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.420
I rent a screening room
in one of the hotels here.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.890
And so all of kind of like
the heads of media show up.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.050
And they watch the film.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.830
And I'm in a room
similar to this.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.070
And I'm standing at
the back by the door.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.240
And the film finishes.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.590
The credits roll.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.170
A bit of silence.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.630
People leave.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.089
And one by one, they look at me.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:09.319
OK, nice movie.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.050
Nice movie.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.310
And they start leaving.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.116
And I'm like, OK.

00:17:12.116 --> 00:17:13.740
So I run to the valet,
where everyone's

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.300
waiting for their car.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.609
And I say, so do I
get the approval?

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:19.589
He said, listen, you
know, it's a very strong--

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:20.430
it's a good film.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:21.930
But why don't you
speak to that guy?

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:22.829
So OK.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:23.940
So I go to that guy.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.160
And I ask him, so what
do you think of the film?

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.244
They said, well, you
know, I think it's--

00:17:30.244 --> 00:17:32.160
I think maybe better you
speak to that person.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.690
SARA HAMDAN: Nobody
wanted the responsibility.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.040
ALI MOSTAFA: They were
passing the buck, which--

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.630
it was understandable also.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.860
Looking back at it, I mean, it
was something that was so new.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.600
And no one knew
what you were going

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.810
to do with something like this.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.580
Till eventually, one
of the guys there

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.400
was the director of Dubai
International Film Festival.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.610
He realized that no one
really said anything.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.160
I want to premiere this at
my festival, which would

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:56.800
be the Dubai Film Festival.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.258
SARA HAMDAN: That's
where I saw it.

00:17:58.258 --> 00:17:59.560
ALI MOSTAFA: We announced it.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.820
It's going to be in
Dubai Film Festival.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:09.077
Three weeks prior to the
festival, I got a call--

00:18:09.077 --> 00:18:09.910
three or four weeks.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:14.756
I got a call saying, Ali, I am
sorry to give you this news.

00:18:14.756 --> 00:18:16.005
You're about to receive a fax.

00:18:16.005 --> 00:18:16.840
It was fax.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.010
Those days, it was fax.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.780
Receive a fax.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.410
I said, OK.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.220
Sorry, here's the fax is coming.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.620
My hands are tied.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.300
[BUZZING] You know,
the fax comes through.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.187
I rip it out.

00:18:29.187 --> 00:18:29.770
And I read it.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:36.760
And it's an official letter from
a very high place in the media,

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.140
signed by the head of
the media at that time,

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.170
and saying, this film
will not be screened,

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.330
showcased in any shape or form.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.820
It was pretty bad.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:52.160
And so I got a call back
saying, so what do you do?

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.710
I said, I'm not
gonna listen to that.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:54.650
It's impossible.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.000
You can't listen to
someone, this person who

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.410
made this decision on
something like this.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.690
We've just four and a half years
of trying to make this film,

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.140
finally getting it there,
getting a platform in Dubai

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.000
Film Festival, everyone
being excited about it,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.410
and then because someone being
a little bit closed-minded,

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.200
for it to just vanish--

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.960
obviously, we would not
have a film industry.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.160
We still, by the way, don't.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.310
We're getting there, but
it's really moving fast.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.290
But we would not be anywhere
had we not really pushed

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.010
for this film.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:35.410
So what I decided, and God bless
our leaders in this country,

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.310
is that I decided--

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.220
I said, look, I did
not make this film

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.220
based on that individual city.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.280
I made it on His Highness
Sheikh Mohammad's city.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.720
Now, if his highness says, I
don't want to screen this film,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.290
I will shut up.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.450
You know?

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:58.630
So what I did is I managed
to speak to someone.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:03.230
Actually, it was one of the
lead actors in "City of Life."

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.140
And I told him to
come to the house.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.956
I said, look, this
is what we received.

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.080
He was obviously surprised.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.496
And this guy grew
up in the media,

00:20:09.496 --> 00:20:12.370
since he was a presenter
since he was nine years old.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:16.510
I said, look, I need you to
take this film to his highness

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.090
and tell him the fate
of Emirati cinema lies

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.910
on your decision of this movie.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.980
He's like, [NON-ENGLISH]
which means I'll do it.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.440
And he goes ahead.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.160
A couple of weeks later,
I was in another festival

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.786
for something else.

00:20:32.786 --> 00:20:33.910
And I was with my producer.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:35.743
And we were trying to
figure out this rescue

00:20:35.743 --> 00:20:37.543
plan, what are we going to do?

00:20:37.543 --> 00:20:41.560
And I think it was
two weeks later.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.579
It might have been
two weeks later.

00:20:43.579 --> 00:20:44.620
And he told me the story.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.960
He said he had
gone to the palace.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.250
And his highness was leaving
with the king of Bahrain,

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.470
as he was on his way.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:54.310
And he saw the guy.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.226
And he went up to him.

00:20:55.226 --> 00:20:56.730
He said, listen,
I have this movie.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:57.730
And he said those words.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.650
And Sheikh Mohammed
actually visited

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.292
set when we were shooting.

00:21:02.292 --> 00:21:04.000
I don't know if he
intentionally visited,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.890
but he was driving past
and saw a shooting,

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.240
so he came to see
what was going on.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.590
So when he found out that
he's presenting the film,

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.780
he's like, oh, so the
film is not released?

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:14.590
It's not made?

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.800
He was unaware and
was given the film.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.940
And I got a call
two weeks later.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.842
And I saw it was him.

00:21:24.842 --> 00:21:25.800
Well, not his highness.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.990
It was [INAUDIBLE],,
who I gave the film to.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.430
And I answered the phone.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.710
And he was screaming
down the phone.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.760
And he was yelling,
screaming, [ARABIC]..

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.480
And I just was silent,
and I was listening.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.090
And I said, so what happened?

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.630
He's like, Sheikh Mohammed
called me just now

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.860
and said that he thought
it was a great film.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:58.160
And he said that we should be
very proud of what we achieved.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.440
And he goes, but is it approved?

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.210
He goes, of course
it's approved.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.710
And if you need any support in
the future, just let us know.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.840
And I had just a
tear run down my eye.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.570
And I was like--

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.820
you know, this was,
like, almost five years

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.140
of trying to make this film.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.890
And then I was like, no
one can say anything now.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.530
This film is getting
its world premiere

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.720
in Dubai Film Festival.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.320
And it did.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.230
It got its premiere.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.250
And it did as well as it did.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.450
And I knew.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.972
I knew with the
vision of the leaders

00:22:28.972 --> 00:22:31.430
that we have today that they
would understand the vision we

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.170
had with this movie.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.050
The movie was not
sugarcoating Dubai.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.050
SARA HAMDAN: Not at all.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:40.130
ALI MOSTAFA: It was
making it a real place.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.460
And this is what we were trying
to achieve with this film.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.920
So yes, that's how we
dealt with the controversy.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.380
SARA HAMDAN: Round of applause.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.338
ALI MOSTAFA: Thank you.

00:22:47.338 --> 00:22:48.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.430
Not to me.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.400
It's for them.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.120
SARA HAMDAN: And also,
round of applause

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.132
for having friends
in high places.

00:22:55.132 --> 00:22:56.860
ALI MOSTAFA: Does help.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.970
SARA HAMDAN: But after
such a big success--

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:03.020
I imagine this is something
that a lot of artists face--

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.290
what comes next?

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.810
How do you top that?

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:06.780
It's hard.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.760
ALI MOSTAFA: Yeah,
you think its going

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.593
to happen very quickly
after that, you know?

00:23:09.593 --> 00:23:12.112
You become almost this
poster boy for a little bit.

00:23:12.112 --> 00:23:14.570
And you go, oh, I'm going to
make my new film very quickly.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.020
And then you realize,
what is my next movie?

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.450
What is it going to be about?

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.760
And I was stumped.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.210
I didn't know what
I wanted to do.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.320
Do I make another drama?

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.480
Do I make a comedy?

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.530
Do I make a musical?

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.540
What do I do?

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:34.400
And then it was trying to run
around and think of ideas.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.020
Who's going to then fund it?

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.950
I have to start raising money
again, come up with a script.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.270
I love the idea of road
films, like road-trip movies.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:45.980
And I also wanted
to do a comedy.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.740
I also kind of wanted to tap
into a very different genre

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.640
to "City of Life."

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.050
So four and a half
years later of trying

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.490
to make my second
feature, we made

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.890
a film called "From
A to B," which

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:02.280
is from Abu Dhabi to Beirut,
about a group of friends who

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.650
take that journey from
Abu Dhabi to Beirut

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:08.940
in honor of their friend that
they have lost in high school.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.210
That film became the
first Emirati film

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:17.130
to be the opening-night film
at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival,

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.980
which was quite a
big deal at the time,

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.090
although it was the
first and last Emirati

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:23.970
film to open because
Abu Dhabi Film Festival

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.870
the year after was no more.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.587
But it was a very exciting
time because for many years--

00:24:29.587 --> 00:24:31.170
and even in Dubai,
by the way, there's

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:34.250
been no Emirati film to
actually open the festival.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.150
"City of Life" was
the first Emirati film

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.529
to have a gala on
the red carpet.

00:24:38.529 --> 00:24:40.320
But there was no film
to open the festival.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.380
So after many years of
it being around, for us

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.450
to get given that recognition
and that platform of being

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.786
opening night was great.

00:24:50.786 --> 00:24:54.477
So yeah, that's how we
did our second film.

00:24:54.477 --> 00:24:57.060
SARA HAMDAN: What do you think
of the UAE's film industry now?

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.690
You're saying things like there
aren't that many filmmakers.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.846
I imagine there aren't
that many role models.

00:25:03.846 --> 00:25:05.220
Film festivals
are shutting down.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.770
You're painting a pretty
bleak picture here.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.170
ALI MOSTAFA: Well, I
wouldn't say bleak.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.289
It's definitely positive--
well, except for that festival

00:25:13.289 --> 00:25:13.830
closing down.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.740
But there's a reason that
festival closed down.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.980
The reason I'm aware of is
because there was twofour54,

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.510
Image Nation Abu Dhabi.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.160
And they realized--

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.070
I mean, the country, yes, we
are the United Arab Emirates.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.980
A lot of people feel we're not
united, but we're very united.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.070
And they realized, we have
a massive festival in Dubai.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.639
Why was it needed to have a
second festival in Abu Dhabi

00:25:34.639 --> 00:25:36.930
that a lot of the money that
was going to that festival

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.940
could be put in the
arts and culture,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.650
like Image Nation
and funding films

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.920
and stuff that's
happening like the Louvre?

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.160
You know?

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.220
So that was one of
the main reasons.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:52.230
And in terms of the
industry being--

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:57.060
when I say there's a positive
outlook on what's happening,

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.690
it's because it is
really moving fast.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.310
Last year in Dubai
Film Festival,

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.310
we had 13 Emirati films.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:10.060
Not necessarily features, but
there were 13 films over there.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.850
Last year in the theaters, we
had about three Emirati films

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.140
playing.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.165
It used to be one Emirati
film every two years.

00:26:19.165 --> 00:26:20.040
You know what I mean?

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:20.490
SARA HAMDAN: So it's growing.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:21.930
ALI MOSTAFA: So it is growing.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:27.300
And obviously, we are
such a small industry.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.430
And again, I don't want
to call it an industry.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.100
I would like to call
it more of a movement

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.596
because an industry
sustains itself.

00:26:36.596 --> 00:26:37.780
And we're not there yet.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.830
But we will get
there fairly soon.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:43.680
And how we've moved so fast
from when we made "City of Life"

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.610
in 2009 to where
we are now in 2018

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:52.380
is an amazing leap, even
when it comes to censorship.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.220
Because to me, "A to B" is
a lot more controversial

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:01.091
than "City of Life," and I
got approval in six days.

00:27:01.091 --> 00:27:01.590
You know?

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.268
SARA HAMDAN: Because they
know who you know now.

00:27:03.268 --> 00:27:03.762
ALI MOSTAFA: No.

00:27:03.762 --> 00:27:05.082
SARA HAMDAN: No, I'm kidding.

00:27:05.082 --> 00:27:06.769
Because they've seen your work.

00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:09.060
I'd like to jump back really
quickly to the commercials

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.100
that you've done.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.330
So after that stint before you
released the big groundbreaking

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.650
film, did you go back
to commercials at all?

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:18.240
ALI MOSTAFA: Oh,
yeah, of course.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.080
SARA HAMDAN: So you
continued to do them?

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.205
ALI MOSTAFA: And I have to.

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:23.060
I mean, commercials really
is my bread and butter.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.630
SARA HAMDAN: You've worked
for some really big brands, as

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.125
well, right?

00:27:25.125 --> 00:27:25.440
ALI MOSTAFA: Yeah.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.330
Yeah, I was very lucky
to be able to do that.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:28.125
SARA HAMDAN: Like?

00:27:28.125 --> 00:27:30.042
ALI MOSTAFA: Land Rover.

00:27:30.042 --> 00:27:31.500
Not only did I work
with Land Rover

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.916
in shooting a
commercial for them,

00:27:32.916 --> 00:27:34.620
I represented them
as an ambassador

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.510
for about five years.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:42.120
So I worked with [? Etisalat, ?]
[? Vilbrequin, ?] top,

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.550
top brands.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.870
And actually, the latest
commercial that I've I done,

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.560
which I think came
out yesterday,

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.266
which I'm really
excited about because it

00:27:54.266 --> 00:27:56.500
was by DU, the telecom company.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.820
And last year, they started a
campaign called #PostWisely.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.210
It was basically based on how
people just post everything

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.660
on social media.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.480
And it was based
on these two events

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.480
where someone sees
that this guy,

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.760
he posted his boarding pass.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.920
He's in this country.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.920
And he just had his
whole house robbed.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.500
Or this person posting
their child in this park,

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.110
and then they had someone want
to try and kidnap their child.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.566
So it's about sharing your
entire life on social media.

00:28:22.566 --> 00:28:23.940
So that was last
year's campaign.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.310
And this year's campaign--

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.900
and that was all done in the UK.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.950
So I was very lucky
to be asked to direct

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.962
the ones for this
year, where it to me

00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:36.420
was even a bigger technical
achievement because they wanted

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.790
to do the entire thing from
the perspective of the victim.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.760
So it was a point-of-view film.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.989
And it's a film where
they would have--

00:28:45.989 --> 00:28:48.030
there was actually a thing,
a very drastic thing,

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:53.580
that happened in Kuwait where
an employee, a Kuwaiti woman,

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.630
was filming her maid hanging
from the side of the building

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:58.660
screaming for help.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.490
And she was just filming her
until she kind of lost her grip

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.525
and fell seven stories.

00:29:03.525 --> 00:29:04.110
SARA HAMDAN: Oh, wow.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.640
ALI MOSTAFA: Luckily
she survived.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.360
She landed on, like, a 2 by
4 aluminum roof and survived.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.540
But there's quite a lot of cases
like that, where people drive

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.310
by car accidents and
then film dead bodies

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.030
or mutilated bodies.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.800
And then they have
these bullies in school

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.880
who are bullying this person,
and people are just filming it.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.380
You know?

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.820
And instead of
taking that footage

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.861
to the authorities or the
headmaster or whatever,

00:29:28.861 --> 00:29:30.400
they're sharing it
on social media.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.467
SARA HAMDAN: There's a
good "Black Mirror" episode

00:29:31.467 --> 00:29:31.783
about this.

00:29:31.783 --> 00:29:32.256
ALI MOSTAFA: Oh, yeah?

00:29:32.256 --> 00:29:34.770
SARA HAMDAN: If anyone's
seen the show on Netflix.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:35.670
ALI MOSTAFA: So
we've-- actually,

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:36.630
I'm still to watch
"Black Mirror."

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:37.590
SARA HAMDAN: It's very good.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.464
ALI MOSTAFA: I heard.

00:29:38.464 --> 00:29:40.170
I heard.

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.262
So these commercials
are come out now,

00:29:42.262 --> 00:29:44.220
where the first one that
was released yesterday

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:48.420
was basically a perspective
of a laborer in a bus,

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.170
where he gets into
this car crash.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.320
And this person
starts filming them.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:56.490
And the tagline is "if it were
your pain, would you share it?"

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:58.029
#PostWisely.

00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:59.820
And I was very proud
to be involved in them

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.750
because they're very
powerful commercials.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:01.440
SARA HAMDAN: Wow.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.510
Because the other DU
commercials that come to mind

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.500
are all quite funny and light.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:04.840
This is--

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.880
ALI MOSTAFA: No, this is quite--

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.260
SARA HAMDAN:
Different direction.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.426
ALI MOSTAFA: --hard-hitting.

00:30:07.426 --> 00:30:08.340
It's quite graphic.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.200
And it's about time.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.970
I think we need ads like that.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.670
Because I mentioned to them
when I would go back and forth

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.739
to the UK a lot, there used to
be this campaign called think,

00:30:17.739 --> 00:30:20.280
where it is about texting and
driving or drinking and driving

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.890
or not wearing your seat belt.
And those car accidents, they

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.480
used to be quite graphic.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.580
And it would really
leave an impact.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.960
So for a while, I thought
given the amount of accidents

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.610
we had here, the
police needed to start

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:33.660
making adverts like that.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.717
So now we started it
with this new campaign.

00:30:35.717 --> 00:30:36.800
SARA HAMDAN: That's great.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.630
ALI MOSTAFA: It was cool.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.480
SARA HAMDAN: From your
professional opinion,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.950
then, having worked on so
many different ads, what's

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.680
the kind of ad that
really pops or connects

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.854
with audiences that you imagine
might go viral on YouTube?

00:30:50.854 --> 00:30:51.520
ALI MOSTAFA: Oh.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.970
Well, usually the
funny ones actually

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.980
tend to go quite viral.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.130
But something really that people
haven't really seen before,

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.630
because it's become--

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.970
I mean, the industry's
like a cookie cutter.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.850
I mean, they just keep
copy-pasting similar things,

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.130
change the way the person looks.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.650
So when you start doing
something that's more original,

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:17.930
which, by the way, is
next to impossible to do,

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.120
it starts when those
things actually go viral.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.940
When you can make someone cry--

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.720
and really, when I say
cry, whether they cry

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.590
or whether they're impacted
by something or whether they

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:34.741
laugh, when you
tick those emotions,

00:31:34.741 --> 00:31:37.240
that's when they want to start
sharing it with other people.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:37.760
SARA HAMDAN: The emotional role.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.470
ALI MOSTAFA: And it
starts going viral.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.015
But again, it has to
have an original--

00:31:42.015 --> 00:31:42.890
SARA HAMDAN: Concept.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:44.364
ALI MOSTAFA: --concept, yeah.

00:31:44.364 --> 00:31:45.030
SARA HAMDAN: OK.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.030
I'd love to hear if you
guys have any questions.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.430
I'm hogging all of the time.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:50.680
Anybody have any questions?

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:50.990
ALI MOSTAFA: Do we have--

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:52.470
I mean, how long have
we been going for?

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:53.761
I feel like I've been rambling.

00:31:53.761 --> 00:31:55.340
SARA HAMDAN: It's
been half an hour.

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.660
ALI MOSTAFA: We got time?

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.243
SARA HAMDAN: I've
been keeping an eye.

00:31:58.243 --> 00:31:58.960
ALI MOSTAFA: OK.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.210
Questions?

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:00.710
Go ahead.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:01.616
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit

00:32:01.616 --> 00:32:02.975
about the film "The Worthy"?

00:32:02.975 --> 00:32:04.790
Because it's also
quite [? different. ?]

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:05.781
ALI MOSTAFA: Ah, yes.

00:32:05.781 --> 00:32:06.280
OK.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.760
So "The Worthy"
was my third film.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:15.296
And there was many reasons
I wanted to do "The Worthy."

00:32:15.296 --> 00:32:16.670
One of the biggest
ones is that I

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:19.640
didn't have to wait four years.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.530
I was in post-production
for "A to B,"

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:25.790
and Image Nation Abu Dhabi,
they funded half of that movie.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:29.780
And they had this script
concept called "The Worthy."

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.680
And they had two amazing
producers attached to it--

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.990
Peter Safran, who produced
"The Conjuring" and "Annabelle"

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.740
and those horror films,
and Stephen Schneider, who

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.650
did "Insidious" and
"Paranormal Activity."

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.940
So these guys made these
blockbuster Hollywood horror

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.170
films.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.260
And they had this genre film
idea called "The Worthy."

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.380
And it was set in a dystopian
post-apocalyptic world

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.570
and about survival and so forth.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.580
And I read the script.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.590
But what I was told is
that I have to take this,

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:09.530
and I have to make it our own,
Arabize it, and try and set it

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.060
in the region.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:14.210
And so like I said, I didn't
have to wait four years.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:17.300
But also, it was a
genre that I would never

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.520
have even thought of doing.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.145
I don't know how many
of you are horror fans.

00:33:22.145 --> 00:33:23.450
SARA HAMDAN: No.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.240
ALI MOSTAFA: But I would
not go to the cinema

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.550
to watch a horror film.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.980
Doesn't mean I don't
appreciate horror films

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.270
or respect the
difficulty in making one.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.070
But it's just not
a thing I would do.

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.260
It wouldn't be my first option.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.860
So the fact I've done
an ensemble drama,

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.440
I've done a comedy,
this would be

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.560
a challenge, something that
I would never think of doing.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.480
And I did it.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.580
And we shot it entirely
in Bucharest, Romania.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.250
So that was a great experience.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:34:00.320
And the film is now picked
up by Netflix worldwide.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.130
And so if you want to watch my
third film, it's on Netflix.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.130
SARA HAMDAN: Nice.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.566
Go ahead.

00:34:08.566 --> 00:34:10.316
AUDIENCE: So you say
the industry does not

00:34:10.316 --> 00:34:12.220
exist as such.

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.255
It's not sustainable.

00:34:14.255 --> 00:34:15.130
ALI MOSTAFA: Not yet.

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:18.495
AUDIENCE: Do
filmmakers make money?

00:34:18.495 --> 00:34:21.124
Did you break even
in your movies?

00:34:21.124 --> 00:34:23.889
ALI MOSTAFA: That's
a great question.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.170
Not one.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.929
Not one of the films broke even.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:29.650
Not one.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.150
AUDIENCE: Even "City of Life"?

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.139
ALI MOSTAFA: Even
"City of Life."

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:33.469
"City of Life" did really well.

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:36.280
But "City of Life" was
a $5 million movie.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.750
You can't make $5
million in ticket sales

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.250
in Dubai those days.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.370
It was impossible.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:46.449
Now one of the
top big box office

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:48.620
hits, the summer
box office hits,

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:53.050
in Dubai could go
up to $2 million,

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.380
now, with the amount of cinemas.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.480
So that film needed
to have gone globally.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.610
Although we did sell
in different markets,

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.520
still, it's a very
difficult industry

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.680
to try and make money with.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.460
That's why you have to start
making films, which is a film

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.490
that I would
probably like to do,

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:14.680
that are very low budget
now because you know

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.980
you can start breaking even.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.460
So once those films
start happening,

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.620
they start to then
become sustainable.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.870
Then you can start
funding your next film.

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:27.530
But unfortunately, my dream
was too big, too early.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.284
So I was making
big-budget movies.

00:35:29.284 --> 00:35:31.180
AUDIENCE: So people
actually fund

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.230
them knowing that they're
going to lose money?

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.230
ALI MOSTAFA: Well, "City
of Life" was the first,

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:36.063
so they had no idea.

00:35:36.063 --> 00:35:37.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.010
The second one was-- both
were semi-government, who were

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.130
trying to start an industry.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:49.000
And the last one was fully
funded by Image Nation.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.950
And that's their mandate, is
to help create a film industry.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.719
AUDIENCE: Does it come with
strict strings attached?

00:35:56.719 --> 00:35:57.760
ALI MOSTAFA: In what way?

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.394
AUDIENCE: Creatively.

00:36:00.394 --> 00:36:01.560
ALI MOSTAFA: Well, luckily--

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.270
usually yes.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:08.580
Because when I did my
second film, I wrote.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.110
My first film, I wrote.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.700
So I wrote, produced, and
directed the first two films.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.020
This one, I was only
hired as a director.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.280
So usually, yes.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.950
Usually when you're with the
kind of the studio system,

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:25.350
where you're hired as a hired
gun, in the creative side,

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.290
you don't necessarily get
final cut of your edits

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:29.375
or how you want it to be.

00:36:29.375 --> 00:36:31.500
But what was amazing with,
obviously, Image Nation,

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.640
is that not only
are they producers

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.770
that are driven to
create this industry,

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:39.780
but they're also
very creative people.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.000
And they support you.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.700
So yes, there was a
lot of discussions.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.420
But all the discussions were
very positive because we all--

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.290
I think I'm now
on my third film.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.820
You kind of get what
you're trying to do.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.575
And everyone understands
we're doing this

00:36:56.575 --> 00:36:58.200
for the bigger picture
and for everyone

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.020
to kind of be happy
with the end result.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:06.300
So not necessarily now, but
probably it will happen.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.290
But usually, yes.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:08.850
You do get a lot of constraints.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.266
Like, if I were probably gonna
do a film in Hollywood now,

00:37:11.266 --> 00:37:12.075
yeah.

00:37:12.075 --> 00:37:13.620
I'd be under reigns for sure.

00:37:17.786 --> 00:37:19.160
AUDIENCE: So I'd
like to also get

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.322
your thoughts on the
[INAUDIBLE] movie

00:37:22.322 --> 00:37:24.322
and just overall, what
do you think is happening

00:37:24.322 --> 00:37:25.769
across the Arab world?

00:37:25.769 --> 00:37:27.310
Are there directors
you enjoy seeing?

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:30.547
And I'd also like to see, are
there collaborations happening

00:37:30.547 --> 00:37:32.657
in Mideast in terms of
how the industry works?

00:37:32.657 --> 00:37:34.282
Is there a governing
body or something?

00:37:34.282 --> 00:37:36.280
Or there's really
nothing [INAUDIBLE]??

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.400
ALI MOSTAFA: No,
we don't really--

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.310
OK, the Egyptian cinema
obviously is a huge industry.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:43.350
Huge industry.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:48.070
They're their own beast,
their own machine.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.810
But there was a period--

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.670
there was the golden
era, and then there

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.920
was a period where they
were just producing--

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.380
where even Egyptians would
say they were nonsense.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.140
And now they've come back
to start to produce and make

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.874
some amazing films again.

00:38:01.874 --> 00:38:03.790
I was actually there
recently as a jury member

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:07.527
for the first Gouna
Film Festival in Egypt.

00:38:07.527 --> 00:38:08.860
And I saw some incredible films.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.276
I actually saw
"The Insult," which

00:38:10.276 --> 00:38:12.980
is now nominated for Best
Foreign film at the Oscars,

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.310
which is a Lebanese movie.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.020
And I really liked
that filmmaker.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.550
I liked his previous
work, as well.

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:20.620
Ziad.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:24.280
And so is there a
real collaboration?

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.390
There's trying to be one.

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:30.940
I mean, there's this
Arab Film institute

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.850
that's been created so we can
kind of break those borders

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:35.560
and kind of work together.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.940
But I think there's
a bit of time

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.300
with that because I made a
film, "From A to B," which

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:45.670
was a Saudi, Syrian,
and an Egyptian,

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:50.660
high-school friends go on a road
trip throughout the Arab world.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:55.360
So it was a very
pan-Arab movie, right?

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.780
And it could have been
the time it was released

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.295
or the marketing,
whatever may be.

00:39:00.295 --> 00:39:02.711
But it was a film you would
have thought, because it being

00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:05.740
so pan-Arab, that it would do
very well with Arab audiences,

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.890
like in Egypt or in Jordan
or whatever it may be.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:09.970
And it didn't.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:13.630
So it was almost
like you almost felt

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:19.906
that when the Egyptian films
come out here in Dubai, yes,

00:39:19.906 --> 00:39:21.280
they get a lot of
Arabs involved.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.890
But a lot of the Egyptians
go to see their films.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:25.750
A lot of Emiratis will
go see their films.

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.750
And a lot of Lebanese
will see their films.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.650
Those films don't necessarily
kind of cross borders

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.040
so well, which is a
shame because there

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.981
are some Lebanese
films, I believe,

00:39:36.981 --> 00:39:38.230
could do really well in Egypt.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.470
Or an Egyptian
film, I mean, they

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:47.750
do really well regardless
given their [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:49.510
massive population.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:52.490
But now that we
have Saudi Arabia,

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.165
that it decided
to open theaters,

00:39:55.165 --> 00:39:56.790
this is one of the
things why it's also

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:01.510
so positive because "City
of Life" released today,

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.490
we would have made our
money back, you know?

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:07.460
So the industry is growing.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.580
The fact there's now
Saudis opening cinemas,

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:13.000
the fact there's this Arab
Film Institute is happening--

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.210
we have a Lebanese film
who's nominated for an Oscar

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:17.580
this year.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.490
And I think it should win.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:22.990
I haven't seen the
other contenders.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:28.630
But since "Paradise
Now," we need one.

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.630
And it's important.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:34.180
But I do think those
borders are gonna drop,

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:38.830
and it is gonna become
a lot more accessible.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.224
Yeah, for sure.

00:40:41.224 --> 00:40:42.907
AUDIENCE: Do you
get your films to be

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:48.540
screened in Emirates or Etihad
in-flight entertainment?

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.790
ALI MOSTAFA: I was very lucky.

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:53.342
Actually, my first
film, "City of Life"--

00:40:53.342 --> 00:40:55.740
actually, I should
not talk about that.

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:59.410
But my first film,
"City of Life"

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:04.190
was in Emirates, although
we had a flight attendant

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:07.040
and we had an airline
in "City of Life."

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.540
But I had to make one up.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.770
But after the fact, Emirates
were very supportive

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:16.370
and saw that it was
something that was important.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:19.270
They put it as the
first film on in-flight.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:21.470
I think it was on the plane
for, like, two months.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:24.350
They put me on the cover
of "Open Skies" magazine.

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:25.810
I was interviewed during--

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.266
while people would see the
opening film of the safety,

00:41:28.266 --> 00:41:30.890
after that, there was me giving
an interview on "City of Life."

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.770
So they were very supportive.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:37.260
"A to B," obviously, had some
Etihad exposure in the film.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.690
So it was played in Etihad.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.030
Actually, it was also
played in Emirates.

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:45.030
But there were certain
scenes that were removed.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:48.800
And yeah, so the airlines
are very supportive.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.930
We're very lucky to have
the airlines, the press.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:54.830
They're excited.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:58.550
I mean, I think everyone's as
hungry to have a film industry,

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.490
also.

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:03.430
SARA HAMDAN: You had
a question back there.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.737
AUDIENCE: What was the reaction
from the general public

00:42:05.737 --> 00:42:09.489
in Dubai-- can you break it
down in terms of expats versus

00:42:09.489 --> 00:42:11.365
locals--

00:42:11.365 --> 00:42:15.200
to some of the controversial
subjects in the movie?

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:20.050
Has it stimulated the debate
about Dubai's identity

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:21.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.864
ALI MOSTAFA: You see,
I guess the movie that

00:42:27.864 --> 00:42:29.280
comes to mind,
obviously, would be

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.530
"City of Life" for me in that.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:33.497
Because when that film was
released in the theaters,

00:42:33.497 --> 00:42:35.580
and I was going to the
cinema to watch, let's say,

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.040
another movie, I would
pass by the hall.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:41.070
And I would hear
my film playing.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.072
And I would tell the
usher, just one second.

00:42:43.072 --> 00:42:45.030
I just want to take a
quick look from the back.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:46.870
And I would just step
in every now and then

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:51.750
in the theaters to see reaction,
but also to see the audience.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:58.140
And it was such a huge mix
of different nationalities.

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:01.530
There was the Indian community.

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:03.420
You had the Western
community, the Emiratis,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.830
and all of them sitting
there watching this one film.

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:13.820
What I found unfortunate
is that that is slowly--

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:18.500
because it was such a film that
spoke to so many nationalities,

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.830
that I feel it's unfortunate
that we have not now

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:26.120
made Emirati films of
a standard, as yet--

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.060
when I see Emirati,
like, pure Emirati--

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.120
that can bring in an
international audience

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.350
to watch it, too.

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:35.240
I think once we reach
that stage where

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:41.720
we make a fully Arabic-spoken,
Arabic-produced, cast Emirati

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.080
film and still have a
similar audience, that

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.970
will go to show that
we've reached a level

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:51.440
where we're now
speaking to Dubai.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.250
And what is Dubai?

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:56.180
Dubai is such a
multicultural place.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.715
So I think you need a
bit more time with that.

00:44:00.715 --> 00:44:02.840
SARA HAMDAN: You can test
it out by doing a YouTube

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.210
show, a series, episodes.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:08.610
Just putting that out there.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.776
ALI MOSTAFA: I would love
to do a series on YouTube,

00:44:10.776 --> 00:44:13.130
but not one of those
kind of blogger, selfie,

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.180
influencer ones now.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.230
That's not something I can do.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.480
I'm not good at that.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:17.768
SARA HAMDAN: I'm a blogger.

00:44:17.768 --> 00:44:19.601
AUDIENCE: I have a
question related to the--

00:44:19.601 --> 00:44:21.735
ALI MOSTAFA: Well, but
you're a good blogger.

00:44:21.735 --> 00:44:22.860
I'll be a terrible blogger.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.109
SARA HAMDAN: I'm just kidding.

00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.866
Go ahead.

00:44:24.866 --> 00:44:27.830
AUDIENCE: I have a
question related to when

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:29.331
you work with advertisers.

00:44:29.331 --> 00:44:30.080
ALI MOSTAFA: Yeah.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.430
AUDIENCE: You said that
it's very difficult

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.305
to do something different.

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:37.430
ALI MOSTAFA: I don't blame
the advertising, though.

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:38.165
I blame the clients.

00:44:38.165 --> 00:44:38.915
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:44:38.915 --> 00:44:45.394
But I want to understand
what other kind of friction

00:44:45.394 --> 00:44:50.204
you have with them in trying
to pitch new ideas or new kind

00:44:50.204 --> 00:44:50.940
of--

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.523
ALI MOSTAFA: You know, I've also
been very lucky where clients

00:44:53.523 --> 00:44:55.292
sometimes approach me directly.

00:44:55.292 --> 00:44:56.750
And they approach
me, and they say,

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.140
listen, we have this product, or
we have this-- whatever it be,

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.660
this car, this resort.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.202
Would you be able to
make an ad or film on it?

00:45:06.202 --> 00:45:08.660
That's when we can go back,
and we can start creating ideas

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:09.710
ourselves.

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.866
And you skip the
whole middleman.

00:45:11.866 --> 00:45:13.490
And because they
approach you directly,

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.910
they kind of listen
to what's going on.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:22.070
But when you have the
client, the agency, and then

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:26.630
the production, unfortunately,
a lot of the times,

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:30.290
you end up giving up the
fight because you realize,

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.390
is it really worth it?

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:35.540
But sometimes you really like
the commercial or the content

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.310
or the copy, and you really try
and fight it to make it better.

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:42.290
But unfortunately, I feel it's
the client that needs to be

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:48.710
more educated on what they can
or cannot show or understand

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.150
film.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:51.530
Because there's
a lot of the time

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:54.410
you would have this person who
might be the head of marketing

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:59.060
for whatever company
who has no idea

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.312
or has no background about what
is a good commercial, what's

00:46:02.312 --> 00:46:03.020
a bad commercial.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:06.530
It's pure feeling on the day.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:12.350
I had an instance where I
was shooting a certain car

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:16.160
commercial many years ago, where
the head marketing of that car

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.355
brand decided, after I
edited the director's cut,

00:46:19.355 --> 00:46:22.830
came in the next day, edited
the whole film himself,

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.380
and then released it.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:27.980
And I said, you have to
remove my name from that.

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.350
Because it's not
what I had done.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.650
So there's a lot of the
times where-- obviously, it

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:34.670
wasn't very good.

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:41.660
So it's more about educating,
I think, the client and also

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.670
having the agency to
be a little bit more,

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:46.730
I guess, courageous
with the approach.

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:49.380
Because there's always
this time where they say,

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.090
we don't want to
upset the client.

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:52.670
Well, it's your job.

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:54.230
They're paying
you a lot of money

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:58.100
to tell them what is creative,
what is cool, and what is not.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:58.970
Right?

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:00.260
That's not theirs.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.940
That's why you are there.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.430
And once that happens,
once the client

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:08.420
becomes confident and accepts
what the agency have to do,

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.340
then I think the
content in the region,

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.502
because we have the
capabilities to produce,

00:47:12.502 --> 00:47:14.210
is that they're going
to be a lot better.

00:47:15.739 --> 00:47:17.780
SARA HAMDAN: I think that's
all the time we have,

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.440
unfortunately.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.450
But it's been an amazing talk.

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:23.040
Thank you so much for
sharing your stories with us.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:23.190
ALI MOSTAFA: Thank you.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.890
SARA HAMDAN: And I hope that
we get to host a little--

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.960
ALI MOSTAFA: It was
an absolute pleasure.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.980
SARA HAMDAN: --Oscars party for
you here in this very room--

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.220
ALI MOSTAFA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.590
SARA HAMDAN: --in a few
years for your YouTube show.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:32.830
ALI MOSTAFA: God willing.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:33.430
SARA HAMDAN: All right.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.930
Thank you.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.480
[APPLAUSE]
