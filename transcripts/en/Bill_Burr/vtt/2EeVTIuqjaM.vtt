1
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.130
Like a boss.
Let's see.
Here's one for you.

2
00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:12.790
This is actually an interesting one that's really fucking obscures is one from a

3
00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:16.930
movie that the dude ended up selling.
This is from cool hand Luke.

4
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.890
All right.
For those of you who have seen cool hand Luke,

5
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.740
if you haven't seen cool hand Luke,
he got to fucking watch that movie.
Right.

6
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.390
And basically the guy who did the score,
uh,
wrote this song.

7
00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:32.350
There's a scene where they have to tar this road and uh,

8
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.810
Paul Newman's character,
you know,

9
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.190
rather than just sitting there being like,
this is a miserable fucking job.

10
00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:40.600
He gets them all amped up

11
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.400
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.260
<v 1>that it's supposed to take all fucking day,</v>

13
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:55.920
but he gets these guys so fucking amped up.
They just,
they just fucking,

14
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:58.170
they just,
it's like they took five hour energy,

15
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.090
<v 0>five hour energy.
Huh?
500 hours.</v>

16
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.150
I drink it for the taste.
Okay.
God,
you're going to jog to Florida after that.

17
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.580
<v 1>Yeah.
Before they,</v>

18
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.160
they're just flying down the fucking road and they're all laughing,

19
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:16.420
having a great fucking time.

20
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:20.350
And they finished the road and they actually have an afternoon off.
Right.

21
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.540
So it was like Paul Newman's way of saying fuck you to the,
to the,

22
00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:28.270
to the,
to the screws.
Is that what they called them back down to the,

23
00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:31.700
to the guards.
Right.
So they had to have this music so they,

24
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.100
this guy wrote this score for this scene.
Uh,

25
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.620
but the problem was it was perfect for the movie but the problem was years later

26
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.410
he sold it or I don't know how far along he sold it

27
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.530
<v 2>to use it as.
So</v>

28
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.170
the only thing I do is
when they informed me that fine,

29
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.380
no problem are you,
I laugh all the way to the bank

30
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.080
<v 1>and it got played so much in this other shit that it actually kind of fucks up</v>

31
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:07.730
the movie.
This is,
this is the score.

32
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.900
This is going to be for some older people to actually understand this is the

33
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:14.390
music that they had for the tea.
It's called tar sequence.
When they,

34
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.120
when they tar the road and they ended up selling,

35
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:21.000
the guy ended up selling the song for something else here at it's just listen to

36
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.850
this shit.
Ah,
you suck.

37
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.070
God dammit.
Fuck this.
See is why I got out of range.

38
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.720
I used to do shit like that on the air.
That would be the worst break ever.

39
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.280
I am the fucking worst.
I had what a great intro.
I gave that song.
All right,

40
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:44.710
here we go.
This is the tar in the road.

41
00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:45.580
Totally makes sense

42
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.963
for it.

43
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.483
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

44
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.480
<v 1>good evening and welcome to the six o'clock news.
It was a four car accident.</v>

45
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.010
The mother fuckers sold it to every six o'clock news station.

46
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.460
This was the classic with your fucking old like me.

47
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:22.090
Anytime the fucking news came on,
this is the fucking song that they played.

48
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.881
This is back when the,

49
00:03:23.881 --> 00:03:28.420
when they actually had fucking journalists telling you what the corporations

50
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.260
wanted you to know.

51
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.880
<v 0>[inaudible] this is eyewitness news with Larry King and the eye witness news</v>

52
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.510
team.
Thursday,
July,
1419 77

53
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.153
yeah.

54
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.080
<v 1>Good evening.
I'm Jake.
Why do I say,
Gee,
I'm a chick.
Show it.</v>

55
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.660
I was.
That's how fucked up my brain is.
I was trying to think,
uh,
Chet Curtis.

56
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.280
I was like,
well,
I can't see,
I can't say Chet.
That's an actual fucking name.

57
00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:07.560
I don't name names,
so then I'll go,
I'll go with Jake.

58
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.740
And then for some reason I don't.
It just got crossed up and I said,

59
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.070
Jake Johann's I gave Jake,

60
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.030
Joe answered a fucking shout out the best God Damn Comedians the last fucking 20

61
00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:18.050
years from my money.

62
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.380
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

63
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.960
<v 1>So anyways,
yeah,
it's called out of the tar sequence.</v>

64
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.040
So that one actually doesn't remind me of the,
the,
the,
the fuck it.

65
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.920
That's a reverse one.

66
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:29.920
I actually watched the movie and I'm getting into that scene,

67
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:30.760
and then I think there's like,

68
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:34.900
all of a sudden I'm going to start listening to the news.
So Jesus Christ,

69
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.270
that was,
that was probably the worst debut of any segment.

70
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:43.570
But you knew,
you got to admit you were definitely into it,
right?

71
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.890
I know you guys have suggestions.
Can you help me out?
All right.

72
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.230
I'm fucking burned out with this fucking podcast.

73
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.040
Here's Jake Johanne.

74
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.150
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>
