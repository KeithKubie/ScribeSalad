00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.310
Oh, it’s almost there, it’s almost there!

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.310
Ooooh!

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:16.160
This has to be one of the most phenomenal,
astronomical events that you can see with

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.050
your naked
eye. I mean, I’m just looking at the sun

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:30.060
right now. Ohh,
it got a little bit brighter around the edge.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.800
MUSIC

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.670
Well we are here at the University of Nottingham,
in

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.590
Nottingham, but we are getting ready to jump
on a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.880
couple of planes to go to China so that we
can still be at

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.120
the University of Nottingham.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.970
Well there happens to be a total solar eclipse
that’s

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.710
happening in just a little over a day, and
it passes, the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.800
path of totality, passes right over the University
of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.120
Nottingham in Ningbo, China. At the moment
it looks

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.430
like it is going to be cloudy, so I am really,
really hoping

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.360
that the clouds are not with us.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.360
Give us a smile

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.360
LAUGHS
Hello!

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.360
AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT
MUSIC

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:28.810
The forecast looks very grim. It seems that
there is a

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.150
front moving in tomorrow morning…it doesn’t
look good.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.150
MUSIC

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.300
So here we are in China at the University
of Nottingham,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.630
Ningbo Campus. We finally arrived. And so
we are

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.420
anticipating this big solar eclipse tomorrow,
while we

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.310
are watching occasional lightning bolts. Quite
on cue,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.620
right there. They just cover the entire half
of the sky, in

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.909
the direction where the sun is actually supposed
to rise

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.479
tomorrow morning, where we are going to see
this

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.720
fantastic astronomical event. Maybe! So I
am still

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.930
keeping my hopes up but, I am not positive
that we are

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.390
actually going to be able to see it.
MUSIC

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.299
We have been travelling for two days, two
and a half, I

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.549
forget what day it is at the moment, but I
know that

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.230
tomorrow morning at 9:37 am local time…
LAUGHS

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:29.510
is when the big event happens.
MUSIC

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.700
Well its 4:54am and we just came out to see
what the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.459
sky looks like and to see what the potential
is for the

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.129
solar eclipse this morning and it doesn’t
look very good.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.590
Not very promising indeed.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.680
BIRD CHIRPS

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.879
Beautiful, but not good for a sun … for
a solar event

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:55.939
MUSIC

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:01.620
We went out for the sunrise this morning and
the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.849
weather did not look terribly fantastic but
after a little

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.090
break and a cup of tea we came back out again
to see

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.609
the clouds not quite so thick and we can actually
see the

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.200
sun up there, so what I have right here is
my very own

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.099
solar filter that I made. This is a roll of
black and white

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.689
film. Now it has to be actually black and
white and not

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.379
the colour film that they just develop black
and white

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.659
but real black and white film. So you expose
it to the

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.439
sun and then you send it off to be developed
and then it

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.459
has this nice layer of sliver on there that
acts as a filter

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.060
for the ultra violet and the infra red that’s
the most

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.989
damage… most harmful for your eyes. But
we have a

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.989
good chance of actually getting a solar eclipse.
Ok, now

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.709
I am really excited!
LAUGHS

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.949
Yeah! In ten maybe! Ten minutes!
MAN REPLIES IN CHINESE

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.409
Ten minutes it will cover!
MUSIC

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:03.420
So we have just reached the first contact
point and

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.260
that’s when the edge of the moon first touches
the edge

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.029
of the sun, so it is now just starting to
pass in front of it.

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.819
We have about an hour now until the total
eclipse phase

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.969
starts. So it’s the sun, moon and earth
in a straight line.

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.600
The moon actually covers the sun. Well it
might seem

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.190
slow, it takes the moon a while to cover the
sun

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.120
completely but actually the shadow of the
moon is

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.920
barrelling across the surface of the earth
at about 2,000

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.900
miles per hour. I am fascinated by the idea
of what

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.699
ancient people thought when the sun just completely
went away. There are different stories about

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.699
how they
reacted. The ancient Chinese in fact, thought

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.639
that
dragons were attacking the sun and they were

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.190
going to
eat it and take it away so what they decided

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.420
to do was
just to make noise, beat drums, scream, make

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.840
as much
noise as they could to get rid of the moon

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.129
and to keep
the sun and so luckily every time that actually

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.319
happened
and they got the sun back.

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:01.169
LAUGHS
MAN SPEAKS IN CHINESE

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.520
Well people have just decided to gather to
watch, they

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.810
have been using some of our solar eclipse
glasses and

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.180
the kids are playing with feathers, they don’t
really know

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.770
what’s going on. They think the sun looks
like the

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.319
crescent moon, or they keep saying “I see
the crescent

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.280
moon”. Because the moon is actually covering
the sun.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.020
Yeah.
MAN SPEAKS IN CHINESE

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.539
So normally when the sun goes down the animals
start

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.800
to go back to their burrows and go to sleep
and so right

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.880
now they start to, they look like they are.
The birds are

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.759
kind of going away. There are small little
floaty things

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.409
that are leaving and the ducks just started
to go hide in

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.539
the trees, but a couple of kids went and yelled
at them

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.669
so they did not really know what to do.
LAUGHS

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.830
Oh it’s fantastic.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:06:02.870
Oh, it’s almost there, it’s almost there!

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.030
Ooohh! Wow!
LAUGHS

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.030
Oh my gosh!

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.780
LAUGHS
Oh my gosh. This has to be one of the coolest

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.750
things I
have ever seen. You can see the corona glowing

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.160
around
the sun and the temperature just dropped completely

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.110
and everyone started cheering
LAUGHS

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.110
It’s amazing!

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.180
I completely didn’t think we were going
to be able to see

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.360
it like that. Fireworks are going off
LAUGHS

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.560
You could see a little bit of red at the very
edge where

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.419
the …. where we could see the last bit of
light. It’s

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.350
amazingly dark. When I look through my binoculars
I

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.300
can actually see some of the outer ring, some
of the

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.970
corona sort of flickering and I don’t think
that is entirely

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.750
due to the clouds. I actually think that has
to do with the

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.750
light coming out.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.750
Oh man, that is the coolest, coolest!

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.669
I mean can you imagine, even thousands of
years ago

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:51.990
seeing something like this and having any
idea what was

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.259
going on. You can hear people yelling in the
distance,

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:58.090
screaming and cheering.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.879
LAUGHS
Oh my gosh! If we could actually see, if there

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:08.229
weren’t
any clouds. Oh we can, there’s Venus. Hey

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:10.250
there’s
Venus!

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.849
So we can see the planet Venus right there
really bright.

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:16.699
And if we could see the clouds around the
sun we would

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:21.210
be able to see Mercury. Yeah! This is amazing,
this is

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.680
amazing! The clouds are coming in a little
bit more now

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.050
so you can’t see it quite as well but…

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.870
How does this rate on your astronomy experiences?

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.230
I mean, even with the clouds this has to be
one of the

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.860
most phenomenal astronomical events that you
can see

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.930
with your naked eye. I mean I’m just looking
at the sun

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.830
right now. Ohh it got a little bit brighter
around the

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.970
edge.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:49.340
Ohh! And it just doesn’t happen very often
in each spot

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.689
on the earth.

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:51.800
Oh my gosh!

00:07:51.800 --> 00:08:00.560
It just popped back out! That was a quick
four minutes I

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.860
have to tell ya!
LAUGHS

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.379
So the sun just popped back out on the other
side of the

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:07.620
moon so it is brighter again instantly so
I am wrapping a

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.529
foil around our camera so we can actually
look at it

00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:14.860
again and now I have to use these.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.689
The next total solar eclipse will be in about
one year

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:21.469
from now, its July 11th, 2010 and it will
go past, it will

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:24.689
go over Easter Island and Chile and some of
Argentina,

00:08:24.689 --> 00:08:28.500
so I have to figure out a good reason to go
down there.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.500
LAUGHS

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.500
So, a University of Nottingham campus, Easter
Island

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.500
maybe?

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:47.450
We are just sitting here glowing with the
enjoyment of

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.070
what we just saw! It’s amazing, that four
and a half

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.370
minutes went so quickly! Wow!
