1
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.030
And this is actually the historic and of the Spanish civil war.

2
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.560
Um,
obviously,
um,
the Republicans lost,
uh,

3
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.680
they wanted to losing sight and,
um,

4
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.700
the winner gets to appear on the cover of Time magazine.

5
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.040
Um,
March 27,

6
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.870
1939 general Franco,
um,
there.

7
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.060
So,
um,
even though,
um,

8
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.330
it actually ended a little slightly later than that,

9
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:43.670
but already at that point it was clear that there was no way,
um,

10
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.150
the fascist would not win.
So that's why he was on the cover of Time magazine.

11
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.130
Um,
so,

12
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:55.131
but what we are looking at obviously is a some time before that when things are

13
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:59.160
still,
um,
basically up in the air.
Um,

14
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.850
and so when,
when we get to the end of the film developed holes,
Ashley,

15
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:06.930
there's still hope for Robyn in many ways.
Um,

16
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.200
and so we'll be looking at that at the end of today's lecture.

17
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.790
But I also want to call your attention to a very interesting fat,
um,

18
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.240
about the Spanish civil war,
uh,
which is that it was very much,
uh,

19
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.770
a women's war.
Um,
one of the,

20
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.820
unlike world war one or in the world war two,

21
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.690
where there weren't a lot of women doing the actual fighting,

22
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.490
um,
the spend,
this whole world was one that was very proud of the fact that,
um,

23
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.380
there,
that women were participating,
um,
in,
in a fairly significant way.

24
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.830
So we can see that both in the posters,
um,

25
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.880
celebrating that fact.
Um,
but also in,

26
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.333
<v 1>yeah,</v>

27
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.740
<v 0>in numerous,
um,</v>

28
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.810
picked photos that we have a of women at either training or actually in combat

29
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.020
situations.
So that's just one of them.
Um,

30
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.700
they were trained just as a man would be trained,
um,

31
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.530
and they were in uniform.
Um,
and this,
uh,
where the,
uh,

32
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.440
women,
Alicia from Barcelona I think,
and once more,
um,

33
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.940
more women are fighting.
So,
you know,

34
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:25.890
partly I think that accounts for feather pillows is such a powerful figure in

35
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:30.120
for whom the bell tolls.
That this is one of the few Hemingway novel was where,

36
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.920
um,
there's a fairly strong,
a woman's voice.

37
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:35.221
We,

38
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:40.140
my thing that maybe she's too good to be true of that maybe is overly idealized,

39
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:42.020
but in any case,
pillows with,
um,

40
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.340
rare instance of a very powerful woman who would dare to,

41
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.620
um,
cast adjustment Paskel judgment,
um,

42
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.910
on the conduct of her own site.
You know,

43
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:58.650
when she was thought that the revolution had begun badly,
as we saw last time,

44
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.020
a woman who's not afraid to have that opinion.
Um,

45
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.450
so partly had to do with the fact that the women were so important,
um,

46
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.650
in the Spanish civil war as soldiers.
Um,

47
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.680
but I think that it also has something to do with the personal circumstances and

48
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:18.730
Hemingway's own live.
Um,

49
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.880
if you turn to the friend of the for whom the bell tolls,

50
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:26.370
you'll see that is dedicated to Martha Gellhorn,
um,
who,
uh,

51
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.400
Hemingway was married to Martha Gellhorn.
Um,
then when they were writing,

52
00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:33.820
when they were covering the Spanish civil war.
Um,

53
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.320
and she very much was very important.
Journal is on her own right.

54
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.640
So,
um,
this is the book that she wrote,
uh,

55
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.290
both about the Spanish civil war,
but also about World War II.
Um,

56
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.000
and,
um,
about,
um,
in fact about Vietnam,
um,

57
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.820
when all the way to the six days.
Um,

58
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.850
so she really hadn't very long and distinguished career as a war journalist and,

59
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.120
um,

60
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.910
in recognition of the fact that as we was to the United States Post [inaudible]

61
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.990
stamp celebrating her writing,
uh,

62
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.350
with her wartime writings from Japan,
China,
this right.
Uh,

63
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.670
the Chinese revolution was very important part,
however,
writing,
um,

64
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.560
and the Normandy and Darko,
um,
the World War II episodes.
Um,

65
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.190
so,
uh,
I was tempted actually to read some of her writing,

66
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:29.191
but there's just no room to incorporate her wartime reporting into this class.

67
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.910
But I just want to draw your attention to the fact that she was actually a very,

68
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.630
um,
significant companion to Hemingway,
um,

69
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.460
in more ways than one.

70
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.700
So today we'll be talking about,
um,

71
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.900
basically the narrative form of Hemingway and you guys will be getting people

72
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:52.600
topics,
um,
very soon from your,
uh,

73
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.640
teaching fellows and one of the topics,
um,

74
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.170
we'll have to do with forms of narration.
Then they're just structured.

75
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.360
So I want to start talking about that and to get you guys thinking,
um,
about,

76
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.930
um,

77
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.760
various experimental or a well rehearsed,

78
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:12.660
but nonetheless,
um,
still,
um,

79
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.110
reinvigorated forms in this novel.
Um,
so we'll,

80
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:22.111
we'll be looking at questions with symmetry and the mirror effect that already

81
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:24.910
we're seeing a little bit off.
Right.
Um,

82
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.770
last time we talked about the kind of negative mirroring the earth moving for

83
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:31.930
Robert Jordan and um,

84
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.960
Maria when they made love and that being mirrored negatively with the bombing

85
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.160
when the earth move under the feet of the people who were bombed.
Um,

86
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.660
so that's one instance of a kind of negative symmetry.
Um,

87
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.070
something being iron eyes.
Uh,

88
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.500
retroactively today we'll be looking at more instances of those kinds of

89
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:55.060
symmetries.
Um,

90
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.480
so obviously possession and have and have not a longstanding,

91
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.520
uh,
paradigm that we've been looking at.
Ironic and not ironic.
Um,

92
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.820
and then also ending the beginning,
very important and this novel.

93
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.850
But I want to begin by looking at one particular assymetry,
uh,

94
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.450
which is the symmetry of brutality,
of brutal conduct.
Um,

95
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.310
execution that we saw,

96
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:24.120
the execution of the fascist that we saw last time in chapter 10.
Um,

97
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.680
and then in chapter 31,
um,
is similar,

98
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.690
maybe a more horrendous episode of fashions,

99
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.100
violence,
the rape that inflicted on Maria.

100
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.210
Um,

101
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.740
so it really goes back also to the importance of women in the Spanish civil war

102
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:47.360
as well.
Um,
and because rape is such a,
um,
um,

103
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.650
kind of explosive subject,
there's been lost done on rape.

104
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:55.200
This is Susan Brown Miller's again.
So it,

105
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.850
one of the classic considerations of rape.
Um,

106
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.880
they also has been lost in lots of representation of rape in painting,

107
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.600
um,

108
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.460
and especially rape consider as a matter for,
for,

109
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.280
uh,
the brutalities,
uh,

110
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.540
perpetrated on the defeated by the victories.
So,
you know,

111
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:21.080
even though it's the women who are getting raped,
um,

112
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.610
it really is a kind of a mother for,
for,
uh,

113
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.460
what happens to the loser in war.
Um,

114
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.060
so Pusan actually had a number of paintings.
I don't even,

115
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.040
I can't even keep count as the significant number.
Um,
this is one,
and this is,

116
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.810
um,
and the other one at Duluth,
um,
very well known painting.

117
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.490
Um,
it can get monotonous after awhile.
Um,
I mean they,
they are different,

118
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:51.140
but they also quite difficult like,
um,
so when,
um,

119
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.040
Picasso,
um,
came to redoing this theme,

120
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:58.610
you can see that this is real,
um,
new departure.

121
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:02.600
It looks nothing like the prison paintings.
Um,

122
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.540
and so that is the sort of the 20th century take,
um,
um,

123
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.460
uh,
ferry a time honored theme.

124
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.300
And I would argue that Hemingway is in his own way doing a novelistic rendition

125
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:24.310
of the rape of this have been women in the rape of just one particular woman,

126
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:25.890
Maria.
Um,

127
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.800
and I would argue that it is every bit as innovative as to Picasso painting

128
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:36.050
coming out at the same time,
a complete departure from tradition.
Um,

129
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:40.100
so it was innovative about Hemingway and it actually goes back to his lungs,

130
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:43.490
standing interest in the mirror,
um,
at,

131
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.470
and looking at yourself in the mirror.

132
00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:50.010
We last time you saw that when Robert was dropping the gun,
uh,

133
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.290
the Pisco that was misused by his father,
he was looking at himself,

134
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:57.420
his mirror image in the water,
looking at himself,

135
00:08:57.421 --> 00:08:59.020
holding the gun and then dropping the gun.

136
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:04.050
So we've really seen one instance of the mirror and for about host,

137
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.350
and this is a much more traumatic instance of that.

138
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.610
I saw my face in the mirror of the barbershop and the faces of three others who

139
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:18.480
were leaning over me.
And I knew none of the phases,

140
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.630
but in the glass I saw myself and them,

141
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.470
but they saw only me and it was as though one,

142
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:30.240
we're in the dentist chair and there were many dentists and they were all in

143
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:32.190
saying my own face.

144
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.810
I could hardly recognize because my grief had changed it.

145
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.080
But I looked at it and knew that it was me,

146
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.700
but my grief was so great that I had no fear,
no any feeling.

147
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.530
But my grief.
So this is the beginning.

148
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:51.420
This is not actually the ripe is just cutting off her hair.
Um,
in many ways,

149
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:56.250
uh,
innocuous exercise.
But the rate would come after that.

150
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.680
Mra doesn't talk about the actual rape.

151
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.920
So this is all as close as we can get is the looking at herself in the mirror.

152
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.480
Um,
and I think that it is,
um,
uh,

153
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.040
kind of a belated,
um,

154
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.640
rejoinder to the earlier episodes of Robert Looking at his own face in the

155
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.540
water,
um,
in the sense that this is,
um,

156
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.000
associated with trauma for,
for some reason,
um,

157
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.860
to look at oneself in the mirror is,

158
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:31.910
is it's kind of a traumatic tableau for Hemingway is the precondition for some

159
00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:35.040
kind of trauma.
Um,

160
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.070
in the case of the earlier episode with Robert Looking at himself in mirrored in

161
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:44.520
a water,
it's actually the beginning of a cleansing process.

162
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:49.521
He is ridding himself of that pistol that he would want to have nothing to do

163
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:53.460
with.
Um,
in this case,
Maria,

164
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:58.461
looking at herself in the mirror as the rape is about to happen is the beginning

165
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.200
of the trauma.

166
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.260
So let's look at the visual tableau that Hemingway is creating for us because of

167
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:10.460
the optics,
this particular optics of their scene.
Um,

168
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.850
Maria can see herself.
Um,
and then the three of them,

169
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.450
and they can look at the mirror and they see only Maria.

170
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:23.451
So this is a great example of how self consciousness is.

171
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.680
Um,
in many ways,
uh,
the burden of the person who is tortured on the,

172
00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:30.870
put the people who are doing latoya torturing,
um,

173
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.630
see only the object of the torture.

174
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.890
So they get all the pleasure from being able to inflict maximum damage,
um,

175
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.190
gone on the person that they are during.
They don't see themselves doing it.

176
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.420
That's what enables them to do it is that they don't see themselves.
Um,

177
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:50.450
Maria sees herself and she sees the street people who are able to do this,

178
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.380
um,
for her.
Um,

179
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.390
and what we're beginning to see is in many ways the beginning of the process of

180
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:01.210
this procession,
Maria looks at herself,

181
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.980
but because of those three looming figures behind her already,

182
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.700
she's not quite herself.

183
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.090
She is herself plus those three other people.

184
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.370
And she's also not quite herself because,
um,
they're cutting off her hair.

185
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.630
So she's losing very important part of her identity.

186
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:23.530
So it was just beginning not to recognize herself.
And,
um,

187
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.030
this process of wrecking not recognizing herself would get dramatize.
Um,

188
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.360
in a way that goes back actually to the image.

189
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.040
We have two lines that we had talked about in that Robert Motherwell also,
uh,
uh,

190
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.550
um,
represented in numerous paintings,
um,

191
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.420
the to all the late lines that,
um,
would be the Utopian ideal,

192
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.270
uh,
of,
um,
of political ritual in the execution of the fascist.

193
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.900
In this case.
Um,

194
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.980
it is once again a retroactive RNI station of that earlier utopian moment.

195
00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:03.871
We get the same two lines except that those two lines have now have a completely

196
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:08.110
different meaning.
At that time.

197
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:13.120
I wore my hair in two braids and I watch it in the mirror.

198
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:18.210
One of them lifted one of the brace and pulled on it so it hurts me suddenly

199
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.220
through my grief and then cut it off close to my head with eraser.

200
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:30.210
And I saw myself with one grade and a slash where the other had been that he cut

201
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:33.760
off the other gray.

202
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.120
But without pulling on it and the razor and made a small cut on my ear and I saw

203
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.480
blood come from it can start a few.

204
00:13:42.481 --> 00:13:45.550
The scar for life with Dai Finger.
Yes,

205
00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:48.340
but will they be bad enough to talk about this?
This is nothing.

206
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.070
I will not talk of that,
which is bad.

207
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:57.310
So he had cut both brace close to my head with a razor and the others laugh and

208
00:13:57.311 --> 00:13:59.410
I did not even feel the cuddle my ear.

209
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.800
And then he stood in front of me and striped one across the phase and struck me

210
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.190
across the face with a brace while the other two held me.
And he said,

211
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.720
this is how we make red nuns.
This will show the,

212
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.850
how do you night with that approach?
Hereon brothers,
Bri of the red Christ.

213
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.680
And he struck me again and again across the face with a brace which had been

214
00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:24.514
mined.

215
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.440
And then he put the two of them in my mouth and tie them tight around my neck,

216
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:34.540
nodding them in the back to make a gag.
And the two holding me laugh.

217
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.380
So this is the new use to which lines could be put the tube raise,

218
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:44.890
belonging to oneself,
um,

219
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.860
can be used as weapons against oneself.

220
00:14:47.861 --> 00:14:52.861
So this is very much the same logic as the earth rising up and hitting the man

221
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.670
that,
uh,
that has been our coaching up to this point and uh,
that is,

222
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.080
um,
so is,
is,

223
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:05.081
is really the complete reversal of the meaning of something,

224
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:10.190
um,
that really is supportive of you and the radical alienation,

225
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.450
um,
of that thing.
Um,

226
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:17.590
and the instrument instruments to elevation of that thing into a weapon.

227
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.660
Um,
but even then,

228
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:25.661
I think it's less traumatic than the effect of looking at the mirror and

229
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:31.730
watching yourself losing first one braid and then the other,

230
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.550
and then watching the transformation,
um,

231
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.690
of your face when that is happening.
Um,

232
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.080
it is not only inflicting that on Maria,

233
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.320
but also making her watch herself undergo this transformation that's just

234
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:53.240
becoming an alien being even two eyes.
Um,

235
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:58.130
so this is the final,
this is the conclusion of that act of dispossession.

236
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.540
Then the one who had gag Mary ran a clipper over my head.
First of all,

237
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:03.021
the foreign,

238
00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:07.070
all the way to the back of the neck and then across the top and then over my

239
00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:09.890
head and close behind my ears and they help me.

240
00:16:09.891 --> 00:16:14.830
So I could see into the glass with a Bob was mirror all the time that they did

241
00:16:14.831 --> 00:16:19.460
is,
and I could not believe it as I saw it done and I cried and cried.

242
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.500
But I could not look away from the horror than my face made with the mouth open

243
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.810
and the braised tied in it and my head coming naked under the clippers.

244
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.540
Um,
so this is the closest that hemming we'll,

245
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.120
we'll get to,
um,

246
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:43.030
giving us an image of Maria being rendered completely defenseless because all

247
00:16:44.991 --> 00:16:49.950
the things,
the shelter ourselves are being taken away from her.
Um,

248
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:54.800
hair might not be the most powerful form of shelter,
um,

249
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.400
but it is,
um,

250
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.560
a form of shelter in the sense that without it,
we really look very negative.

251
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.880
They get in a kind of psychological sense.
Um,
and Maria will be,

252
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:12.530
will become naked and more than that sense.
Um,

253
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:17.300
but it has also has to do with,
uh,

254
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:22.630
what kinds of an object Maria would be in the world before this happens.

255
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.280
She would never be an object to herself,

256
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:32.810
should always be a subject to himself in the sense that she would never actually

257
00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:37.220
see herself as she's seeing herself right now.

258
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:42.250
So it is really taking away her relation to herself that is being taken away

259
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:48.050
from her.
It's not even just the hair,
you know,

260
00:17:48.051 --> 00:17:50.340
which is nothing and then will grow back.

261
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:54.030
Although we can also see the Hemingways quite obsessed with hair and the cutting

262
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:56.730
off of hair,
um,
just as,
uh,

263
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.390
Fitzgerald is in Bernie's cuts her hair.
Um,

264
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:05.200
but the physical removal of the hair is really nothing,
um,

265
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:10.310
compare with the destruction of a longstanding relationship that one has to

266
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:17.060
oneself.
And I think that we see a similar operation,
um,

267
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.380
when it is w w when someone within [inaudible],
uh,

268
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:27.360
to a point where you don't actually recognize the person who has been in Saudi.

269
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.610
It might not ever have happened to you.

270
00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:33.300
And very rarely it happens to anyone.
Um,

271
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.830
but certain new hurst and talks about that in an essay called how I became the

272
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:41.330
college me,
uh,
was that when she was growing up,
um,

273
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.980
in the black community in Florida,
um,
the,

274
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:48.981
she never saw herself as black until she was made to feel herself as

275
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.100
Blackstone's losing one kind of identity to oneself.

276
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:58.460
And what is happening here is a similar kind of situation that suddenly she sees

277
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:02.820
herself as something that she's never seen herself as before.

278
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.490
So it is both that operation,

279
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:10.850
but also the additional horror that she cannot take her eyes away from the Mira.

280
00:19:13.271 --> 00:19:16.290
She could easily have shut her eyes.
Right.

281
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:21.590
So the psychological atrocity of this thing is that the dynamics of the scene is

282
00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:28.461
such that she cannot take her ways to take the eyes away from this thing that

283
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:31.860
she cannot bear to watch.
Um,
it is,

284
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:37.250
they're gluing of her eyes to something that she would want to do,

285
00:19:37.951 --> 00:19:41.930
everything to remove the eyes drowned.
It is that gluing,
um,

286
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.950
that is also plugged in.
[inaudible] um,
so it is,
it is,

287
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.640
it is the way the Hemingway chooses.
Talk about rape,
not,
um,

288
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:55.670
they're very completely recognizable and scenario that Pusan has made classic,

289
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.560
you know,
in his classic compositions.
Um,

290
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:05.700
and not even the Picasso Representation,
um,

291
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:10.730
which still has to do much more with someone crying out in protest.

292
00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:16.491
We can almost hear the song in the Picasso representation in the Murray you

293
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.653
episodes.

294
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.670
There is absolutely no song because her mouth has been gap.

295
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.180
So is the absolute silencing of Maria.

296
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.660
And the complete reduction of that scenario into a visual scenario without sung

297
00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:39.120
in both the Pusan and in the Picasso Painting,

298
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:44.570
what makes it slightly bearable is that we can imagine those women as crying

299
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.610
out.
Um,

300
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.070
and it is that crying out that makes them human and registers the resistance to

301
00:20:50.071 --> 00:20:52.660
whether it's being done to them.
In the case of Maria,

302
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:54.900
because is strictly a mirror if I,

303
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.610
and because it is strictly visual tableau and he goes a mile,
this gap,

304
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.710
it is completely songs.
So it is the deprivation of voice,
um,

305
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.710
along with the cutting of the hair.
Um,

306
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.940
is those two things that work to create the maximum effect of victimization in

307
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:19.370
the rape scenes.
So we can see that from Maria.
This possession,

308
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.140
um,

309
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:25.140
is a central narrative fat and it is register with food.

310
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.030
Matter of fact,
um,

311
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.350
as unforgettable an instance of rape has any,
um,

312
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.680
in American literature with actually representing the APP itself.
Um,

313
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.760
so that is part of the innovation as well as that you don't actually go anywhere

314
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.310
near the actual deed.
Um,

315
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.540
given the fact that this possession is so important from a rear,

316
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.200
I think that we have to ask a related question is to what extent is this

317
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:57.570
procession central for Robert?
Um,
I think it is an open question.

318
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.200
I hope that you guys would talk about it in section is whether or not Maria

319
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.880
Ashley gets to recover from that act of,
uh,
of,
of this possession.

320
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:07.420
Um,

321
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.420
has she recovered fully from that rape or is she still living in the shadow of

322
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:18.820
that rape?
How long does it take for that shadow to go away?

323
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:19.630
Uh,

324
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:24.630
is she's still within the narrative of dispossession all the way through for

325
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:30.530
whom the bell tolls?
So there's an open question for Maria for Robert.

326
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.650
Um,
it's a slightly different question and it has to do with two possible

327
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.560
trajectories for Robert.
Um,

328
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:43.650
and so what I would like to do here is to give you a demonstration of one way to

329
00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:51.460
write your final paper,
um,

330
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.700
which is to write half of the paper as dedicated to one argument and the other

331
00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:05.200
half as dedicated to the opposite argument.
So this is,
uh,

332
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:09.130
would be an interesting experiment to do.
Basically you're trying to be a lawyer,

333
00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:12.010
right?
Lawyers are supposed to argue either side of the case.
Um,
you know,

334
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:16.210
is an intellectual exercise.
Um,
usually it takes,
for most of us,

335
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.510
it takes a loan from Wellington at that we actually have,

336
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:23.260
they have some kind of emotional investment in something,
uh,
to,
uh,

337
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.450
argue to make it very convincing case.

338
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:30.451
But supposedly someone who's trained as a lawyer should be able to argue either

339
00:23:31.721 --> 00:23:36.170
side.
So when I'm asked,
offering you as one possibility,
um,

340
00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:41.120
in the final paper is to,
um,
make an argument,
um,

341
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.950
one way and then in exactly the opposite way.
Um,

342
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:49.970
and in this case is not even a stretch for me to argue both sides of the case

343
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:53.150
because actually on completely torn in my mind.

344
00:23:53.151 --> 00:23:57.890
So actually there is emotional investment on my iPod in both sides of the

345
00:23:57.891 --> 00:23:59.720
argument.
So,
um,

346
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.520
the two opposing arguments,
um,

347
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.250
obviously would be,
one would be,
uh,
that to happen,
uh,

348
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.140
for whom the bell tolls,
uh,

349
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:15.280
is a narrative about this procession that what work Robert ends up with at the

350
00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:20.990
end of the novel is as a half,

351
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:24.140
not that he starts out with something,
um,

352
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.770
and then ballet and the novel where everything is taken away from him,

353
00:24:27.771 --> 00:24:31.910
that he is completely empty handed at the ends enough.
Um,

354
00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:36.530
the very hush reading after novel.
The other,

355
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:41.630
um,
and I like to end with that is to argue that it actually is a narrative of

356
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:46.130
repossession.
Ah,
yes,
that a lot has been taken away from him,

357
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:51.820
but that may be we could still make a case that he's not totally empty handed at

358
00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:56.000
the end of the novel.
So I like to,

359
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.890
I hope I'll be able to make a compelling case for both.
Uh,

360
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.070
but let's start with a trajectory one.
And,

361
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:05.420
um,

362
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:10.420
obviously in order to make a case for Robert as a half,

363
00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:11.300
not,

364
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.300
I think that we have to put an ironic spin on the word to have,

365
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.430
um,
especially on a memorable line.
Roberto,

366
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.210
what has now,
um,

367
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.560
and I want to bring back Ashley to a similar use.

368
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:32.210
Ironic use of the word half in as I lay dying.
Um,

369
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.680
and following from that,

370
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.920
we can look at a narrative structure of for him about hoes and look at it as a

371
00:25:39.311 --> 00:25:43.640
kind of a narrative and that when in terms of the formal structure of the novel

372
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.210
as the narrative and Admin of the APP of dispossession,

373
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.480
that Robert is losing control of the narrative that an arm and the lake has been

374
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.120
cut off from him and taken over by someone else.

375
00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.310
And comparing that with maybe a kind of a similar situation into half and half,

376
00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:02.630
not,
um,

377
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:06.590
so first to have as an ironic word,

378
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.800
this is at the very end of the novel,

379
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:16.160
Maria was kneeling by him and saying,
Roberto,
what has,

380
00:26:16.161 --> 00:26:19.670
now he says,
wedding heavily.

381
00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.800
The left leg is broken.
Guava,

382
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.090
the swears street priestly phase bend down by him.

383
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:30.980
And Robert Jordan smelled the full smell of Pablo.

384
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:36.200
Let us speak his head too polite in Maria.
I have to speak to them.
How the,

385
00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:41.230
there's a hope much but doesn't hurt much problems as he was banned in clothes

386
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:46.080
over Robert Jordan.
No,
I think the nerve is crash.
Listen,

387
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.650
get along and to say I would talk to the girl for a moment.

388
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.120
Clearly there's not much time.
Clearly I think you would do better in the rebel.

389
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:58.650
They'd probably chosen said they unseal graders.
Use your head,

390
00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.100
talk to the now policies that there is little time.

391
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:07.550
I'm sorry Dow has this English since I have it.

392
00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.530
Proper choice that does not speak of it but used,

393
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.940
I had dow has too much had um,

394
00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.990
it is very hard to not to know this,

395
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:26.450
the way that the key player in this passage is the verb to have.

396
00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:33.010
Um,
it begins with Maria asking Robert Innocence mate,

397
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:38.370
what has now,
because in class she doesn't know whether the legacy really broken.

398
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.500
Um,
but he knows.
Um,
so,
um,

399
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:48.830
and is at this point is the switching of Pablo for Maria.

400
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:53.010
Um,
Beth for me is,

401
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:57.390
represents one of the cruel decisions on Hemingway's pot,

402
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.730
um,
that instead of having Maria still bending over him,
um,

403
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.760
the person who is now banned over Robert is Pablo and what he smells is to full

404
00:28:07.871 --> 00:28:12.780
smell of Pablo.
This a very,
very significant sees hell.
Um,

405
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:18.030
in the sense that rob is still doesn't really know Pablo,

406
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:22.470
he remained remains a mysterious figure.
Um,
all the way through.

407
00:28:22.471 --> 00:28:27.360
I mentioned last time that a lot of things happen.
Um,
Pablo does a lot of things.

408
00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:28.021
He things,

409
00:28:28.021 --> 00:28:32.760
lots of things when we're not privy to what is going on in the narrative.

410
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.070
Um,
and likewise for Robert,

411
00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:39.240
he simply doesn't know what's going on inside problems head or what public is

412
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:43.050
doing is executing other people when Robert isn't looking.
So all of this,

413
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:47.820
because it's bad might be happening,
but we just never know.
Um,
so Pablo is,

414
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.840
is,
is from beginning to end.
His always,
and they'll pay character,

415
00:28:51.841 --> 00:28:53.190
both Robert and to us.

416
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.880
But all that Robert can get at this moment is to first smell of Pablo.

417
00:29:00.361 --> 00:29:03.450
That that is,
is the overwhelming older,

418
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.780
almost like the smell of honeysuckle that is coming to Robin at the end of his

419
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:12.000
life.
Um,

420
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.240
that is about the most that he can,

421
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.650
that he will ever get is not as cerebral understanding.
Uh,
uh,

422
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.660
Pablo is just an animal apprehension of how powerful a man this is,

423
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.030
smells and animal says,

424
00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.620
I think it's the animals fear and apprehension but also recognition.

425
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.770
What kind of a Pablo is.
Um,

426
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.360
so Pablo asked innocently enough question,
how does it hurt much?

427
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:40.290
Um,

428
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:45.290
but he knows that there's no way Robert can travel this no way he can go with

429
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:48.970
the rest of the people.
So,
um,
that's,

430
00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:53.980
he knows politically well how much time really is left to rob it.

431
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:58.160
Um,
and there is,
um,
been

432
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.290
upfront,
cruelly I think,
um,

433
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.640
in the last thing that Pablo says to,
uh,
Robert,

434
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:07.541
I'm sorry,

435
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:12.541
doubt has this English from beginning to end,

436
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.030
the refusal recognition,
the robber this American and not English,

437
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:24.130
that he has a name even,
um,
you know,
he for Pablo,

438
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.570
Robert is just like Haskins.
Some of the ranting who comes in,

439
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:33.940
who destroys the bridge,
destroy something works the explosive is killed his,

440
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:34.960
another of those,

441
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:40.030
a whole string of foreigners coming through with totally forgettable names and

442
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:44.280
not even getting the nationality right.
So this is the ultimate in,
um,

443
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.280
inflicted by Pablo on Robert at the very end of his life.

444
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:52.960
And Rob is absolutely defenseless.
You know,
he is defenseless,

445
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:57.550
physically is defenseless psychologically and emotionally.
Um,

446
00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.470
all he can say,
um,

447
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:04.230
is in fact this the mission of defeat really,
um,

448
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.530
giving the last bit of advice,
telling Pablo to go back,

449
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.930
they have behind the enemy lines,
right?

450
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:14.680
So they are internationally and fashions and nationalist territory and he

451
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:19.180
advises probably to go back to the Spanish republic.
But Pablo says,
no,

452
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.360
I'm actually go to go further away from the Spanish republic.
Um,

453
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.660
I'm four graders.

454
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:31.010
And actually that turns out to be really smart decision because if they had gone

455
00:31:31.901 --> 00:31:35.590
back to the Spanish republic,
they would actually all had been killed.

456
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.680
So Robert is actually right to end with the last line.

457
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.260
Dow has much had,
um,

458
00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:49.290
the cemetery here is betraying Robert having a broken leg and Harborough having

459
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.740
much head.
He's the brainy one.

460
00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:02.100
This is the ultimate rewriting of the power dynamics and for whom the bell

461
00:32:03.681 --> 00:32:04.031
tolls.

462
00:32:04.031 --> 00:32:08.560
We've been going along the assumption that is the person with the knowledge or

463
00:32:08.561 --> 00:32:11.500
the technology,
the person with the knowledge of the world,

464
00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:13.090
the person who can speak several languages.

465
00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:18.450
We've been going on the assumption that that person is going to be on top,

466
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.020
that you know,
he's the future belongs to him.
The irony,

467
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.740
ultimate irony of this novel is in fact,

468
00:32:26.741 --> 00:32:30.880
this is the person who's going to lose out,
who will have no future at all.

469
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:36.300
So in many ways we can either say it is a very brutal undoing of everything

470
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:42.230
that,
uh,
Robert is believed in.
All we can say.
You know,

471
00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:46.610
it actually is a kind of inverted Utopian Vision,

472
00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.120
um,
that there is still a future for the Spanish hasn't,

473
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.270
even though they seem so disadvantage in the modern world,
um,

474
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.880
even though they seem completely incapable of functioning outside of the very

475
00:32:58.881 --> 00:33:00.430
limited environment,
um,

476
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.310
because they are capable of functioning within that very limited environment,

477
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:08.420
actually they have a chance to survive at least as to narrative that,
uh,

478
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.940
that the Hemingway is giving us.
Um,
so,
uh,

479
00:33:10.941 --> 00:33:15.890
kind of negative utopia for Robert and positive utopia for Pablo.

480
00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.830
Um,
and it is ironic but I don't think that it actually is,

481
00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:24.831
it's fully ironic that Pablo should be the embodiment of some kind of utopian

482
00:33:25.131 --> 00:33:27.770
hope at the end of the novel.
Um,

483
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:32.830
and just to give you a kind of a comparison point of comparison for similar use

484
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:37.260
of the verb to be in SLA dying almost exactly the same.
Um,

485
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.850
cash has a broken leg.
He has had two broken legs.

486
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:44.830
He lies on the box with a quilt road onto his head and the piece of wood under

487
00:33:44.831 --> 00:33:48.530
his knee,
I reckon we ought to left him at arms days past that.

488
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.430
I haven't gotten a broken leg and power hasn't,

489
00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:55.940
and Dow has an and it's just the bums caches.

490
00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:00.410
It's kind of grinds to get a little on the bone.
It don't bother.
So exactly.

491
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:05.300
Hemingway and Fitzgerald had the same intuition about the extent to which the

492
00:34:05.301 --> 00:34:08.240
work to have can be Aaronow's.
Um,

493
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:13.040
so given the fact that Robert is well on his way,
well,

494
00:34:13.041 --> 00:34:16.540
I mean now they fit well on his way.
He's arrived at his definition destination,

495
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.280
uh,
which is the state of this possession at the end of the novel.
Uh,

496
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.800
we should not be surprised that,
um,

497
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.770
that destination is well prepared for,
um,

498
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.890
some ways before that.
Um,

499
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:35.980
so I just want to call your attention to a narrative innovation and for whom and

500
00:34:37.221 --> 00:34:38.340
about hose,
uh,

501
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:43.450
which is the removal of the narrative from Robert Jordan.

502
00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:48.710
He doesn't get to tell the story right there.
Four chapters,
um,

503
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.200
told by someone else.
Um,

504
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:56.230
quite literally cutting off the narrative from Robert and those four chapters

505
00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:03.510
are the chapters when Andres who is charged with a mission to go and deliver

506
00:35:03.681 --> 00:35:05.840
this very important message,
um,

507
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:10.500
to the central command that um,
the,
the,

508
00:35:10.501 --> 00:35:11.950
the um,
that,

509
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:15.200
that they're actually the enemy knew what they were going to launch this attack.

510
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:20.570
That very important information that was going to be conveyed by Andres is toe

511
00:35:20.571 --> 00:35:24.950
in full chapters that have nothing.

512
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.250
Absolutely nothing to do with Robert.

513
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:33.490
So let me just give you one instance of that removal of the narrative from

514
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.960
Robert Chapter fully.

515
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.350
He's a non protagonists is a non participant.

516
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:45.351
He doesn't show up at all in that chapter during the time that Robert Jordan has

517
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:50.610
labs through the time he has spent planning the destruction of the bridge and

518
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:55.611
the time that he had been with Maria Andres had made slow progress until he

519
00:35:56.861 --> 00:35:58.370
reached the Republican minds.

520
00:35:58.371 --> 00:36:02.280
He had traveled across country and through the fascist lines as fast as a

521
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.770
countryman in good physical condition.

522
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.650
Who knew the country well could travel in the dark,

523
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:11.880
but what is the insides Republican lines,
it,
whatever it is,
slowly.
Um,

524
00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:16.700
so this are the right here that we detect,
um,
that uh,

525
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:20.730
for Andres,
I mean this is very dramatic because actually it takes so much,

526
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.380
much more time to try to get through supposedly your own side because he's

527
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.140
questioned detained by everyone.
Uh,

528
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.070
whereas it's much faster to go through enemy terrain because it's just traveling

529
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:36.660
as someone who is physically fit can travel,
which is very fast.
Um,

530
00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:41.160
so those four chapters,
um,
34,
36,

531
00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:42.180
40 and 42,

532
00:36:42.181 --> 00:36:47.181
those four chapters are devoted to the irony of how slow it is for and how

533
00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:49.200
impossible it is,
uh,

534
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:54.240
for Andres to deliver that crucial message.
Um,

535
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:59.270
but the other additional RNA is that Robert is fast becoming a non protagonists

536
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:06.300
in his own narrative,

537
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:11.430
which is framed much a prelude to the end at the end of whom the bell hose,

538
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:16.050
he will be a non player in the future of the Spanish republic.

539
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:21.330
He will be a non player in Maria's life in Pablo was laughing,
everyone's loved.

540
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.590
Um,

541
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:27.590
and Hemingway has ran a pays to way for Robert being a non player much earlier.

542
00:37:29.941 --> 00:37:34.941
So we can think back to many other instances of someone being a non player in

543
00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:40.170
soldiers home in,
in our time.
Uh,
crabs being a non play,
his sister pay,

544
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.170
playing basketball,
um,

545
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:45.780
and he crafts being on the Cylon it being a non plane that went.

546
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:51.020
So Hemingway's has given a lot of thought for what it means for a man who once

547
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:56.330
used to be a important player to be relegated to the silence and to suffer the

548
00:37:57.181 --> 00:38:01.740
fate of being a non player.
And he is enacting that one more time.

549
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:06.090
Um,
in foamed about hose.
So,
um,

550
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.820
I just want to um,

551
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:12.030
highlight the interconnections about Hemingway's works.

552
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:17.060
This is not the first time where he has removed the narrative from the

553
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:22.870
supposedly protagonism that narrative and to have and have not a similar fate

554
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:28.650
has been visited upon herring Morgan.
Right?

555
00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:33.651
So in chapters one to five toe from Harry Morgan's point of view chapters,

556
00:38:33.751 --> 00:38:37.300
things all of a sudden his refer to you as a man,

557
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.490
you ain't going to fix me out.

558
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.520
And they go say the man whose name was Harry Morgan,

559
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.910
send nothing then because he liked the nigger and there was nothing to do now.

560
00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:49.420
But here then what,
you know,
when we were talking about this passage,

561
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:53.770
we said that suddenly Harry becomes Harry Morgan.
Um,

562
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.160
some are looked at completely from the outside and who is in fact put in the

563
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:03.550
same position as the black person did have both lost something.

564
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:08.680
Um,
and in a more abstract way we can say that what Robert,

565
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.753
um,

566
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.760
and we can also just go back to that moment at the very end of,

567
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:20.050
for him and about those,
Robert is still Robert Jordan.

568
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:25.500
He never gets to the stage where you can simply be a Robert.

569
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:30.260
He is still referred to in that alienating form.
Um,

570
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:35.310
so that too is a similar structure with very much similar to the alienating

571
00:39:35.951 --> 00:39:38.380
device in to have and have nots.

572
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:43.510
I think that I've done,
um,
you know,

573
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:48.490
my power,
everything that I can,
um,
to make a case for,
um,

574
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:52.860
to have and have not as a novel of this procession,
um,

575
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:57.980
that basically,
uh,
Robert Emerges as completely empty handed,
uh,

576
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.880
at the end of the [inaudible] that he's lost his leg,

577
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:06.180
his lost Maria is loss of life is about to lose his life is lost.

578
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.710
Even a novel that is supposedly is.

579
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:14.010
So it is a loss almost completely equal to the laws of Dow at the end of as I

580
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:18.970
lay dying.
Um,

581
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.710
and it really is possible to read both Hemingway and partner,

582
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:24.580
um,

583
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:29.580
as others who are dedicated to about the bleeders vision possible of human

584
00:40:30.671 --> 00:40:35.360
possibilities.
Um,
but I want to,
um,

585
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.090
now make the opposite case,
uh,
which is then,
it's not quite as bleak as that.

586
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.260
There may be this one way in which we can think about before we have to have as

587
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.910
a somewhat non ironic,
uh,
word.
So,

588
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:53.470
um,
and,
and also that there's a way to read the narrative,
um,

589
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:58.200
not as one that highlights or maybe passes the,

590
00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:02.890
the absolute Danning worthy that there really is nothing at the end for Robert.

591
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.180
Um,
so trying to recover something for Robert at the end,
the narrative.

592
00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.490
Um,
so,
um,

593
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:13.900
it turns out that Hemingway is also a kind of self conscious about using the

594
00:41:13.901 --> 00:41:17.800
verb to have as unknown.
Ironic for,

595
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.370
uh,
this is a little earlier so you know,

596
00:41:21.371 --> 00:41:25.720
it has the disadvantage of coming before that final,
very ironic moment and,

597
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:29.910
but still is a moment that we should look at.
And another thing,

598
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:35.090
don't have a kid yourself about loving someone is just the most people are not

599
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:37.160
lucky enough ever to have it.

600
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:42.820
You never had it before and now you haven't or you have with Maria,

601
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:48.020
whether it lasts just through today and the positive tomorrow or whether it

602
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:52.790
lasts for a long time is the most important thing that can happen to a human

603
00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:53.624
being.

604
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.400
There will always be people who say it does not exist because they cannot have

605
00:41:58.401 --> 00:42:00.080
it.
But I tell you,

606
00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:05.081
it is true that you have it and that you are lucky even if you die tomorrow.

607
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.840
Um,
so you know,
this is,
uh,

608
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.820
this is relatively speaking,
uh,

609
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:18.970
an instance where we have to verb to have in an IRA an ironic non erotic mold,

610
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.710
um,
that is affirming,
um,

611
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:27.760
the primacy and the durability of what he had or has or continue to have with

612
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.730
Maria.
Um,

613
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.560
but we also know that even in this non ironic moment,

614
00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.980
the verb to have is very precarious.
Um,

615
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:46.060
it is precarious because there's so much dependent on being able to refute other

616
00:42:47.421 --> 00:42:51.500
people who would not credit you with having that thing.
Right.

617
00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:56.720
So there's this consciousness that there will always be people who say that does

618
00:42:56.721 --> 00:43:00.170
not exist because they cannot have it.

619
00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:02.450
Because what you have here,

620
00:43:02.451 --> 00:43:07.451
what Robin has here is so intangible because there's really no material way to

621
00:43:10.491 --> 00:43:14.510
demonstrate it.
It is,
there is simply is not an object.

622
00:43:14.511 --> 00:43:18.890
It's not a physical object in the world.
Um,
there's no evidence really.

623
00:43:18.891 --> 00:43:23.120
There's no material evidence,
um,
that it is a thing in the world.

624
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.373
Um,

625
00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:29.870
all you have is your subjective intuition that you did have it,

626
00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:34.430
that you continue to have it.
Um,
and then having it makes all the difference.

627
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.250
It is only a subjective conviction.

628
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:42.670
It doesn't carry the weight of objective demonstrate ability.

629
00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:45.820
Um,
and so that is one strike against it.

630
00:43:45.821 --> 00:43:49.860
That other people will not be persuaded by the fact that you did have it.
They,

631
00:43:49.861 --> 00:43:52.160
we continue to tell you that you didn't.
Um,

632
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:57.190
the other thing which I thing is it actually plays out in a kind of formal level

633
00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.250
has to do with a switch of pronouns in this passage,
right?

634
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.500
So it begins with,
um,

635
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.810
but actually all the way through this passage,
the pronoun has array of switch.

636
00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:09.470
Um,

637
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:12.980
even though Robert has been referring to it has been just talking in the first

638
00:44:12.981 --> 00:44:15.740
person singular.
I,
um,

639
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:20.860
in this critical moment he's actually referring to himself as you,

640
00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:27.410
you never had it before and now you have it.

641
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:32.500
And even more powerfully in the last line where you see both the Pronoun I and

642
00:44:33.361 --> 00:44:36.060
approved now you.
But I tell you,

643
00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.110
it is true that you have it and that you are lucky.

644
00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:41.640
Even if you died tomorrow,

645
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:47.270
the coal presence of the Pronoun I and the Pronoun you suggest that it is an

646
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:52.790
effort it takes them will power to convince himself that he did have it.

647
00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:55.020
I am telling you that you did have it.

648
00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.050
It's not just the other people are not persuaded,

649
00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:02.660
but Robert himself has to be convinced is to be beaten over the head about his

650
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:06.600
other eye.
Um,
to believe that yes,

651
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:11.630
that what he did have with Maria does make a difference and that's make him

652
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:16.650
half.
So because of those two considerations,
I would say that this is um,
the non,

653
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:21.620
I use of the word to have but heavily slogans,
right?
Uh,

654
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:26.640
with other policies is really looming heavily on the horizon.
Um,

655
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.750
and um,

656
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.710
the is flow replayed in the very last moment,

657
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:36.210
often novel.
He looked down the hill slope again and he thought,

658
00:45:36.211 --> 00:45:40.740
I hate to leave it as all I hate who live in very much and I hope that I have

659
00:45:40.741 --> 00:45:41.820
done some good in it.

660
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.350
I would try to with what talent I had half you mean?

661
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:51.090
All right,
have I have fourth of what I believe in for a year.

662
00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:53.970
Now if we win here,
we will win everywhere.

663
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:58.830
The world's a fine place and worth fighting for and I hate very much to leave
it.

664
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.570
And you have a lot of luck.
He told himself to have had such a good life.

665
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:07.710
You've had just as good as alive.
His grandfather don't,
not as long.

666
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:12.060
You've had just as good a life as anyone because of these last days.

667
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:12.894
So once again,

668
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:18.470
non ironic use of those love to have but ticking an effort of the will to

669
00:46:20.101 --> 00:46:25.101
convince himself he has to be toe youth had a good life as your grandfather.

670
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.730
You've had as good alive as anyone.
Um,

671
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:34.590
it has to be a command issue by father himself.
Um,

672
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:39.240
and so it takes that form that it is not,
um,

673
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:44.280
is not,
is not a a natural or unselfconscious.

674
00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:47.160
A conviction is a conviction,

675
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:51.690
arrive at through some struggle and we've put a good effort.
Um,

676
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:56.330
so,
um,
Robert,
that thing is,
is it's actually a fairy,

677
00:46:56.830 --> 00:47:01.350
um,
um,
the fragile vehicle,
um,
as,

678
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:06.440
as a representative of a kind of narrative of repossession just because he's so

679
00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:10.050
vulnerable at the end of the novel.
Um,

680
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:15.170
but I think that that Hemingway actually has stepped in and provided one form of

681
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:20.800
authorial intervention that allows us,
um,

682
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:25.850
possibly to read the novel as affirming something about Robert so that he's not

683
00:47:26.161 --> 00:47:29.770
totally a loser at the end of novel.
Um,

684
00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:33.700
and that has to do with a very stylized ferry,

685
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:38.680
a deliberate narrative structure for whom the bell tolls.
Uh,

686
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:42.310
you know,
there's the,
the first line of the novel reads,

687
00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:47.140
he lay flat on the bra pine needle floor,

688
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.033
the forest,

689
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.160
his chin on his throat and arms and high overhead to win two in the top of the

690
00:47:54.431 --> 00:47:58.230
pine trees.
And the very last line of the novel,

691
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.380
he could feel his heart beating against the pine needle store,

692
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.650
the forests.
So Robert totally alone,

693
00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.790
but in the end is the beginning.
Um,

694
00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.940
and so it is that impersonal narrative structure.

695
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:21.100
Um,
the,
he's not that,
it's almost as if he were beginning all over again,

696
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:24.880
that the story is going to begin the new,
um,

697
00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:28.240
it is that formal structure,

698
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.250
the former mirror,

699
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:35.400
the fact that allows us to entertain the illusion that not ours over here and

700
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:40.510
the Hoe in Ho,
you know,
the physical it is over,
um,

701
00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:44.410
that no way it could have a different ending or that things could go on.

702
00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.650
But nonetheless,
the form of the narrative is such,

703
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:51.270
if feels like the beginning rather than the ad.
Um,

704
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:55.990
and maybe this is really the best that Hemingway can do for Robin,

705
00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:01.240
is for the reader to want this to be a new beginning and for the reader to feel

706
00:49:01.241 --> 00:49:04.950
that this isn't the ad yet.
This is the best that we can do.
The robbery.
