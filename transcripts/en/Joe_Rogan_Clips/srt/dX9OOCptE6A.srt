1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,410
Like we were talking about before,

2
00:00:01,411 --> 00:00:06,411
when you meet someone who can give you
a lesson and express something in a way

3
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:11,010
that makes you reconsider your own
ideas that you hold sacred. I mean,

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,270
I'll give you an example.
When I,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,680
when I met my wife 30 years ago,
I,

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,440
I wasn't pro death penalty,
but I was,

7
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,890
I would say I would say neutral to the
death penalty. I would be like, you know,

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,340
ted Bundy, the state can
put him to death. Uh,

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,610
and I had all the kind of conventional
reasons or I didn't really care.

10
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:32,010
He's a vile person. He killed all
these people. He tortured them.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,940
If the families will get any
relief, whatever, that's fine.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,220
I had some concerns because I was this
statistician about a conviction of the

13
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:43,290
innocent and I support
the innocence project.

14
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,230
And I am very concerned
with police brutality.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,060
I have for years been
advocating the racializing a
police brutality is vile and,

16
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,370
and uh, uh, porridge and must be
firmly resisted. Uh, I think that,

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,690
um, I think the, the,

18
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:02,640
the prosecutorial misconduct to people
are prosecutors lie and put people in

19
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:04,890
prison. Uh, you know, there've been many,

20
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:08,250
many cases of people on death row who
are innocent that should offend our

21
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:09,084
conscience.

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,100
So even back then I had some concerns
about the death penalty because I, um,

23
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,520
because I, I recognize that,
you know, we can't be perfect.

24
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:20,880
We're going to convict some innocent
people and also let some guilty people go

25
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,360
free. That's not as bad as killing
the, putting to death, the innocent,

26
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:27,840
but they're both bad. So I had that
concern about the death penalty,

27
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,950
but otherwise I was like, it's okay.
My opinions have totally changed.

28
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:34,470
I'm completely opposed to the
death penalty now for many reasons.

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,250
Not just the statistical reason,
but also I think it's immoral.

30
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:39,590
I don't think the state
should put it down.

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,430
I think we can deprive you of liberty.

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,100
I think we can make sure
you're not a threat to society.

33
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,940
We can lock you up for the rest
of your life. But I think we, uh,

34
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,550
the state should not be taking
people's lives in that way.

35
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,570
There's something extraordinarily
strange about locking someone up.

36
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,800
It's very strange. Well, we have a
carceral state. I mean, you know,

37
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,330
we lock up a higher we have is,

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,200
we are fraction of people incarcerated
I think is the same as Stalinist Russia.

39
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,230
And we have very long prison sentences,
which are nuts.

40
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,800
You don't need them for deterrence
actually for nonviolent drug,

41
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:13,890
especially for non all nonviolent
offenses should have much shorter prison

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,120
doesn't, we should have more, we should
have higher certainty of punishment.

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,670
Higher fraction of people
who have actually committed
crimes should be punished.

44
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,890
But I think we should,
we could cut in half or less the,

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,260
the duration of the senses.

46
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:29,830
I think you'll be able to deter criminals
from doing things with a three month

47
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:33,050
sentence if they are very confident
that they will be convicted if they're

48
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,893
caught.

49
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,250
Whereas now we have a system where
most are not convicted like this Jesse

50
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,260
Smollett thing, which is just
ridiculous in the news and uh, uh,

51
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,530
and which therefore, and only a
tiny fraction are convicted and,

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,970
but they're giving huge long sentences.

53
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:50,630
It's like they're paying the sense
for everyone that didn't. Yes.

54
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,670
It doesn't make any
sense and it's expensive.

55
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:55,840
It ties up our prison
system actually. Um, can I,

56
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:57,340
can I go to tell you another story?
True.

57
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,140
So it was a situation a few years
ago when there's a fairly famous, um,

58
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,090
uh, director and writer by the name of
David Simon, who I consider a friend.

59
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,840
He did the wire, he was a show runner
for a bunch of other very famous, uh,

60
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,780
wonderful, uh, TD programs.

61
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,770
And he started his career actually
as a reporter in a, in Baltimore.

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,010
He was a beat reporter and then
went on to become a writer,

63
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:24,670
did the wire and so forth.
And he told the story, uh,

64
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,760
actually at Yale to students about how
he had just come back from a summit.

65
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,980
President Obama was still president where,
um,

66
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,000
he was trying to help the students to
see that you can find common ground with

67
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:40,570
your political opponents and that you
need to listen to them and talk to them in

68
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:45,520
order to find that ground. Uh, if, and
so he told the following story, he said,

69
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,560
I had, I just came back
from Camp David where, uh,

70
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,170
there was a meeting about how to
reduce incarceration in our society.

71
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,740
And he said, the Koch brothers were
there and the students all hissed,

72
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,210
and Newt Gingrich was there,

73
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:01,180
and the students all hissed and a
bunch of liberal people were there.

74
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:03,550
And the students were really happy
about that. And then they said, well,

75
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:07,120
why did you go, how could you associate
yourself with those evil people?

76
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
And he said, look, he said, the,

77
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,030
the conservatives want to reduce
incarceration because it's expensive.

78
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,960
The liberals want to reduce
incarceration because it's unjust.

79
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,680
And the libertarians want to
reduce incarceration because
the state shouldn't be

80
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:21,850
depriving people of Liberty.

81
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,990
And I can find common ground with
these people and reduce incarceration.

82
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,370
Why would I not talk to them? And the
students didn't seem to understand that.

83
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,800
They were like,
they couldn't get it.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,790
That's why they shouldn't
be able to vote it to be 30.

85
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,970
There should be 25. I mean, and so the, I
don't know how we got onto this, you know,

86
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:45,760
like talking to you is so much fun because
it's like we're all over the place.

87
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,220
But, um, how did I get a
come up with this example?

88
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,860
We were talking about talking
to a political enemies,
was it or something else?

89
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:55,210
Yes. We're talking about people telling
you that you shouldn't associate yes.

90
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,630
People that have varying opinions.
Yes, yes. And you know, Oh, I know.

91
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,570
We were talking about incarceration
and prison sentences and so forth.

92
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,290
So we have a horrible problem in our
society with, with incarceration,

93
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,810
a larger fraction of our
populace as incarcerated.

94
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,890
We deprive after you paid your debt to
society, we often have these, these, uh,

95
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,170
we deprive you of your right to vote,
which I think is wrong.

96
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,890
You've paid your debt to society.
You should be able to reenter society.

97
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:22,810
That's appliances. Exactly. Yes.
Exactly. You were in prison for 10 years.

98
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,430
That's enough. You know, now you,

99
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,030
we want you to feel a part of society and
we want to welcome you back if we have

100
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:30,850
that vision of justice.
How about the registered sex offender?

101
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,140
That's a serious problem, especially
for, uh, crimes. You know,

102
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,780
these crazy cases which
offend my conscience.

103
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:42,550
I know a guy who got
charged as a registered sex
offender because he urinated

104
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:47,500
outside. Yeah. That's not caught in the
south. Urinating outside. That's nuts.

105
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:50,050
That's just a prosecutorial abuse.
Or you know,

106
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:52,990
you have these Romeo and Juliet laws,
which are not in every state now.

107
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:57,290
Thank God the alas, they are not
in every state. Uh, you know,

108
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,050
you have a 16 year old boy
and a 14 year old girl.

109
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,340
There have to be exceptions for that
kind of sexual practice. You know,

110
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,320
they're exchanging a
sexually explicit images.

111
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,710
They should not be considered sex
offenders for the rest of their lives.

112
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:14,390
That's nuts. So, um, so
yes, so all of those things,

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,900
but the problem is not only do we have
a huge fraction of people in prison,

114
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,650
we have extremely long prison sentences
compared to any many European countries

115
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:26,540
for the same crime. And it's costly.
It's unjust, it's ineffective.

116
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,890
I think. I think we should change the
policies on this and maybe we will. Yeah.

117
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,250
There's also the idea of
reforming them. It's, it's,

118
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,100
they're not using all the
tools within their disposal.

119
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,290
They're not really doing
a good attempted it.

120
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,490
And I just don't think it does anything
other than make their life hell for a

121
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:46,450
short period of time,

122
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:50,560
which we're hoping we hope deters
them from doing future crime.

123
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,950
Well, they're different. There's the
justice, there's deterrence, their safety,

124
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:58,120
right? Like so violent criminals that
we put in jail. Uh, we need to do that.

125
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:00,870
I mean to, I'm not interested in being
killed by somebody who, you know,

126
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,420
could it killed someone else? She should
have been you in jail for a while,

127
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,670
20 years. So I'm not at a
time. People, yeah, for murder.
I think 20 years is enough.

128
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,400
Well a European,

129
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,440
a European standards are
about 20 years actually.

130
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,350
And that there are different things,
like if you wanted to pry them, if your,

131
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:22,990
if your vision is they're being
punished for the killing of a life,

132
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:24,460
therefore they've surrendered their life.

133
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:27,640
It's sort of eye for an eye
kind of justice. You would,

134
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,530
they would be the rest of their
lives in jail. And you know, I,

135
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,010
we can debate whether that's
reasonable or not. If you,

136
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,540
if you want to provide a public safety,
we is.

137
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:39,820
And people often age out of their
violence. So a lot of men, typically,

138
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:42,850
these were talking mostly about men
who do these things. Uh, you know,

139
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,370
by the time they're in their forties
or 50s, they're much less violent.

140
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:49,380
Testosterone declines. They get older
and wiser. Uh, they're not interested in,

141
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,260
in criminal, in that kind of criminal
behavior. Many of them are not. So that,

142
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:55,990
does that suggest you don't
need life sentences for murder?

143
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,470
And I think it also depends on we have
for gradations of murder, you know,

144
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:03,070
we have like the impulsive stuff that
intent matters of planfulness matters,

145
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,620
that depravity matters.
All of these things are,

146
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,850
are factors and I don't think we should
have a one size fits all incarceration

147
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:11,830
for murder. Yes. That's my
opinion. What do you think?

148
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,660
I think it depends entirely
on the circumstances.

149
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,890
If two men are engaged in some sort of
a dispute and one winds up killing the

150
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,200
other one,

151
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,990
that's a big difference between that
and someone breaking into your house and

152
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:24,860
killing your daughter.

153
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,020
Yes. A correct. And I also
think even in that, like I,

154
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,770
I really am opposed to these stand
your ground laws. I think those are,

155
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,980
if you have the opportunity to avoid
conflict and to avoid you or not,

156
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,370
uh, it, I would prefer as a state
to require that you walk away.

157
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,320
Uh, even if it makes you
feel embarrassed, uh,

158
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,920
then give you the right to kill
someone for offending you in those,

159
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,010
those videos of the, of the guys in
that shot, the guy on his knees in the,

160
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,780
in the parking lot in the,
I forgot what state it was like a,

161
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:58,650
not a year or two ago, they got into
an altercation in the parking lot.

162
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,340
Like if I have words with someone at
a party shot a guy on his knee. Yes.

163
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,560
There was no threat to him and he was,

164
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:07,590
he was not prosecuted on the stand
your ground argument, which is nuts.

165
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,920
Why was the guy on his knees?
He was, I forgot. I see.
Don't shoot me or something.

166
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,090
Oh, Jesus. So it was, it was crazy. He
didn't get prosecuted. I don't think so.

167
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,190
We can look up the facts
that were several cases.

168
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,410
There were several cases like this,
but you know,

169
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,870
like I remember when I
was doing shotokan karate,

170
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,550
my Sensei Kazumi Tabata,
this was years ago, uh,

171
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,600
30 years ago now. And he told
us the following story. He,

172
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:35,430
he said there was a Sensei in this village
in Japan and the students were coming

173
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:39,660
to the Dojo. And, uh, there was
the, the, the best student that,

174
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,670
you know,
and then all the other students,

175
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:45,480
and they were walking through the village
and they passed the approach to horse

176
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:49,530
that was on the street from the rear.
And it startled the horse.

177
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,890
And as the horse reared up and
kicked his leg, the, the, uh,

178
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,700
the best student instantly did a,
a kind of a avoidance,

179
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,920
kind of a twisted his body and avoided
the kick. And the, and the, and the, uh,

180
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,230
the horse's leg went right in front
of him and all the other students were

181
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:08,070
amazed at his ability and they get
to the Dojo and they tell the Sensei,

182
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:12,540
this is my sensei telling me this story,
telling all of us this story. And they,

183
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,800
those students get to this,

184
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,250
the Dojo and they tell the Sensei
the story marveling at the,

185
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:21,120
at the ability of this master student
to definitely avoid the strike.

186
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,860
And the Sensei is very angry and they
don't understand why, why is he so angry?

187
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:28,290
He said if he were a really
good student of mine,

188
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,360
he would have walked on the
other side of the street.

189
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,320
He would have avoided
the horse all together.

190
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,490
So the real wisdom is to avoid avoidance
of conflict in the first place.

191
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:43,080
There's no reason to seek out conflict.
And so on the stand your ground laws,

192
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:47,580
you know, if the choices ether you just
avoid the conflict, you know, someone,

193
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,810
someone swore at you or called you an
asshole or was an unreasonable jerk,

194
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,270
that doesn't give you the right to
kill them. Right. Um, so anyway,

195
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,800
I don't know how we got onto this as well.

196
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,050
How are we going to the penalty for
Kaiser murder. Exactly. Exactly.

197
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,420
So, so, so different
gradations. Yeah. Yeah.

198
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:11,421
I just don't know how much of a
deterrent it is locking people up.

199
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,740
I just, I, I'm not sure.

200
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,010
I'm not really sure if that actually
stops people from doing things.

201
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,310
I think it stops some people. I think
there've been academic research on this.

202
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,370
I just don't think there's any real
rehabilitation other than personal choice.

203
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:26,761
I mean,

204
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:30,960
I think the real rehabilitation comes
from someone making a personal choice to

205
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:34,650
never be that person that way. Again.
Yes. For most of them you're, you're,

206
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,260
you're being locked up with a bunch
of hardened criminals and you, your,

207
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,920
that's your,
your company.

208
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,410
But you're not suggesting we have a
society in which when you commit violent

209
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,130
acts, we do nothing. No, I'm
not. No, I'm not. No. I'm,

210
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:48,990
I'm suggesting struggling with this is
what you're saying. Yeah. The, yeah,

211
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:53,890
the concept of nuances. Yes. This is,
this is applied here than anywhere else.

212
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:56,830
I think I got the impression looking at
your face a moment ago when I told my

213
00:11:56,831 --> 00:12:01,350
sort of sweet Sensei, Japanese
karate story that you didn't
agree necessarily. No.

214
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,550
That's a very wise way of
looking at it. Yeah. Don't,

215
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:07,300
don't be near a fucking horse that
wants to kick you. Very smart. Yeah.

216
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:11,670
Get out of there. I'm a big believer
in avoiding conflict. Yeah. I'm, I'm,

217
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,560
I'm the first guy we use. It'll conflict
on intellectual conflict. Exactly.

218
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,710
Physical words and violence are different.
Extremely different.

219
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:21,131
Yeah.
I mean,

220
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:25,960
intellectual conflict at that is actually
important and you learn from it. Yes.

221
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,710
Very rarely do you learn too much from
you. You learn, don't do that again,

222
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:31,150
that's what you learned
from physical conflict.
