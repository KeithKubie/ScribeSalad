00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.420
So in quick summary, in this lesson I covered the basic concepts of how we

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.580
can take point processes, how computations at the pixel values, and

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.320
use that to add images, subtract images.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.526
I showed you how to use this to be able to do simple processes on images.

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:19.560
Showed an example that by just doing this we actually can

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.620
learn more about transparency the alpha blending,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.830
which is used commonly in image processing types of techniques.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.130
Alpha blending is also widely used to be able to represent the transparency

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.110
layer which is actually another processing thing that can be used for

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.959
masking images.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.150
And again, I showed an example of how we would use an image histogram and

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.280
all of the statistics that come with it to help but

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.860
look at images a little bit more carefully.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.030
In next class, what we will do is now we will look at not just pixels.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.670
So, you know, we were so far concentrating on images where each index is known.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.629
We had an image.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.700
And I looked at a pixel.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.690
Of course, so far in this case we took another image that had a pixel.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.840
But now we want to also start looking at is what happens in

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.700
the neighborhood around the pixels.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.410
And that will let us introduce us to the concept of convolution and correlation.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.030
Look forward to it.
