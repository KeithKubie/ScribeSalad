time just kind of close that box driven
to<00:04:35.980><c> go</c><00:04:37.860><c> here</c><00:04:38.860><c> we</c><00:04:38.950><c> go</c><00:04:38.980><c> so</c><00:04:39.970><c> animations</c><00:04:40.660><c> who</c><00:04:41.470><c> wants</c>

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 align:start position:0%

to go here we go so animations who wants
to<00:04:41.710><c> talk</c><00:04:41.860><c> about</c><00:04:41.890><c> yes</c><00:04:42.490><c> animations</c><00:04:43.030><c> are</c><00:04:43.150><c> also</c><00:04:43.300><c> I</c>

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 align:start position:0%
to talk about yes animations are also I
 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
to talk about yes animations are also I
think<00:04:43.750><c> something</c><00:04:44.470><c> that</c><00:04:44.590><c> we're</c><00:04:44.770><c> very</c><00:04:44.800><c> proud</c><00:04:45.310><c> of</c>

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 align:start position:0%
think something that we're very proud of
 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.610 align:start position:0%
think something that we're very proud of
it's<00:04:46.060><c> a</c><00:04:46.120><c> very</c><00:04:46.360><c> unique</c><00:04:46.600><c> take</c><00:04:46.840><c> on</c><00:04:46.870><c> animations</c>

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 align:start position:0%
it's a very unique take on animations
 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.590 align:start position:0%
it's a very unique take on animations
yeah<00:04:47.740><c> I</c><00:04:47.770><c> think</c><00:04:47.890><c> most</c><00:04:48.270><c> frameworks</c><00:04:49.270><c> just</c><00:04:49.480><c> give</c>

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I think most frameworks just give
 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.690 align:start position:0%
yeah I think most frameworks just give
you<00:04:49.660><c> a</c><00:04:49.690><c> bunch</c><00:04:49.870><c> of</c><00:04:49.960><c> api's</c><00:04:50.320><c> to</c><00:04:50.560><c> use</c><00:04:50.770><c> and</c><00:04:51.100><c> we</c><00:04:51.520><c> kind</c>

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 align:start position:0%
you a bunch of api's to use and we kind
 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.490 align:start position:0%
you a bunch of api's to use and we kind
of<00:04:51.760><c> stood</c><00:04:51.970><c> back</c><00:04:52.240><c> and</c><00:04:52.270><c> said</c><00:04:52.510><c> you</c><00:04:52.720><c> know</c><00:04:52.840><c> how</c>

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 align:start position:0%
of stood back and said you know how

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
think you will influence the future of
 

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
think you will influence the future of
angular<00:09:49.660><c> um</c><00:09:50.880><c> so</c><00:09:51.880><c> one</c><00:09:52.270><c> of</c><00:09:52.300><c> the</c><00:09:52.510><c> things</c><00:09:52.570><c> that</c><00:09:52.779><c> we</c>

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:52.990 align:start position:0%
angular um so one of the things that we
 

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.650 align:start position:0%
angular um so one of the things that we
would<00:09:53.110><c> like</c><00:09:53.260><c> to</c><00:09:53.440><c> do</c><00:09:53.560><c> more</c><00:09:53.890><c> is</c><00:09:54.550><c> is</c><00:09:54.940><c> get</c><00:09:55.390><c> more</c><00:09:55.570><c> of</c>

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:55.660 align:start position:0%
would like to do more is is get more of
 

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
would like to do more is is get more of
the<00:09:55.839><c> community</c><00:09:56.350><c> feedback</c><00:09:56.529><c> on</c><00:09:56.950><c> things</c><00:09:57.130><c> we</c><00:09:57.339><c> are</c>

00:10:37.309 --> 00:10:37.319 align:start position:0%
coolant to JavaScript so you can just
 

00:10:37.319 --> 00:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
coolant to JavaScript so you can just
use<00:10:37.529><c> them</c><00:10:37.829><c> angularjs</c><00:10:38.490><c> out</c><00:10:38.910><c> of</c><00:10:39.000><c> the</c><00:10:39.060><c> box</c><00:10:39.240><c> with</c>

00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:39.449 align:start position:0%
use them angularjs out of the box with

use them angularjs out of the box with

them but don't lisa is semantically a
 

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:43.699 align:start position:0%
them but don't lisa is semantically a

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:43.709 align:start position:0%
little different and so we actually made
 

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.559 align:start position:0%
little different and so we actually made
a<00:10:43.740><c> port</c><00:10:44.040><c> of</c><00:10:44.130><c> angular</c><00:10:44.519><c> on</c><00:10:44.850><c> top</c><00:10:45.000><c> of</c><00:10:45.149><c> dart</c><00:10:45.360><c> and</c>

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:45.569 align:start position:0%
a port of angular on top of dart and
 

00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:47.300 align:start position:0%
a port of angular on top of dart and
it's<00:10:45.660><c> actually</c><00:10:45.839><c> used</c><00:10:46.290><c> internally</c><00:10:47.069><c> at</c><00:10:47.279><c> Google</c>

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.310 align:start position:0%
it's actually used internally at Google
 

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.790 align:start position:0%
it's actually used internally at Google
so<00:10:47.850><c> it's</c><00:10:48.000><c> there's</c><00:10:48.750><c> real</c><00:10:48.930><c> apps</c><00:10:49.199><c> running</c><00:10:49.440><c> on</c><00:10:49.620><c> it</c>

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
so it's there's real apps running on it
 

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
so it's there's real apps running on it
I<00:10:49.980><c> supposed</c><00:10:50.370><c> to</c><00:10:50.430><c> just</c><00:10:50.660><c> hypothetical</c><00:10:51.660><c> right</c>
