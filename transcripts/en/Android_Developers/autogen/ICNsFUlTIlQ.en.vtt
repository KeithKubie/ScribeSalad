not the duplicates are not eliminated

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880
not the duplicates are not eliminated

to you how to deal with that situation

to you how to deal with that situation
and get the sort of data that you

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730
and get the sort of data that you
 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.059
and get the sort of data that you
maybe looking for and that's probably

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069
maybe looking for and that's probably
 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.860
maybe looking for and that's probably
why you're getting duplicates if you

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870
why you're getting duplicates if you
 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.960
why you're getting duplicates if you
were to look at all the information in

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970
were to look at all the information in
 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.180
were to look at all the information in
the records that are being returned to

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190
the records that are being returned to
 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.470
the records that are being returned to
you you can see that some of it was

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480
you you can see that some of it was
 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.070
you you can see that some of it was
different yeah so I guess this is clip

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080
different yeah so I guess this is clip
 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.580
different yeah so I guess this is clip
stay away from the vault contacts table

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590
stay away from the vault contacts table

stay away from the vault contacts table
also the David maple is gonna have

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269
also the David maple is gonna have
 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.820
also the David maple is gonna have
duplicate data as well but I believe the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830
duplicate data as well but I believe the
 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.640
duplicate data as well but I believe the
high-level contacts table should have a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650
high-level contacts table should have a
 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.819
high-level contacts table should have a
single representation of appropriate of

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829
single representation of appropriate of
 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.039
single representation of appropriate of
each person and that that would be a

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049
each person and that that would be a
 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.420
each person and that that would be a
good starting point if you're trying to

cool Drive excuse me they do a really
 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.990
cool Drive excuse me they do a really
awesome ListView for displaying files

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000
awesome ListView for displaying files

awesome ListView for displaying files
and because they don't have a file hug

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030
and because they don't have a file hug
 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.700
and because they don't have a file hug
or a folder hierarchy but by default

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710
or a folder hierarchy but by default
 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.620
or a folder hierarchy but by default
they have to go and do that really well

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630
they have to go and do that really well
 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.750
they have to go and do that really well
of course you still can't create folders

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760
of course you still can't create folders
 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.540
of course you still can't create folders
and they handle that too but that I

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550
and they handle that too but that I
 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.010
and they handle that too but that I
guess that's my advice it's really more

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020
guess that's my advice it's really more
 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.600
guess that's my advice it's really more
of a UI question and without seeing your

one-size-fits-all recommendations here
but I think that should be some good

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060
but I think that should be some good
 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.970
but I think that should be some good
general guidance any other comments

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980
general guidance any other comments
 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.500
general guidance any other comments
yeah one thing to think about when

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510
yeah one thing to think about when
 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.060
yeah one thing to think about when
you're building a file browser like that

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070
you're building a file browser like that
 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.380
you're building a file browser like that
you're gonna have the different UI on

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390
you're gonna have the different UI on
 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.510
you're gonna have the different UI on
phones versus tablets so on a phone you

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520
phones versus tablets so on a phone you
 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.830
phones versus tablets so on a phone you
might end up with that single list view

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840
might end up with that single list view
 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.060
might end up with that single list view
where the navigate the user navigates

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070
where the navigate the user navigates
 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.250
where the navigate the user navigates
deeper into a file hierarchy you might

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260
deeper into a file hierarchy you might
 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.140
deeper into a file hierarchy you might
be able to present the the tree or the

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150
be able to present the the tree or the
 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.150
be able to present the the tree or the
file system tree on like a left-hand

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160
file system tree on like a left-hand
 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.130
file system tree on like a left-hand
side pane using something like fragments

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140
side pane using something like fragments
 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.340
side pane using something like fragments
on a tablet sized app so it definitely

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350
on a tablet sized app so it definitely
 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.710
on a tablet sized app so it definitely
depends on which size of device you're

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720
depends on which size of device you're
 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.060
depends on which size of device you're
targeting you might be able to fit more

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070
targeting you might be able to fit more
 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.370
targeting you might be able to fit more
or less less details yeah I think

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380
or less less details yeah I think
 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.540
or less less details yeah I think
generally you know I just want to

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550
generally you know I just want to
 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.190
generally you know I just want to
reiterate what what Trevor and Joe have

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.200
reiterate what what Trevor and Joe have
 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.020
reiterate what what Trevor and Joe have
already said and that is generally

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030
already said and that is generally
 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.710
already said and that is generally
speaking the move has been away from

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720
speaking the move has been away from
 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.380
speaking the move has been away from
having sort of hierarchical file

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390
having sort of hierarchical file
 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.080

structures for to support your app I

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090
structures for to support your app I
 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.420
structures for to support your app I
mean it kind of made sense back in sort

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430
mean it kind of made sense back in sort
 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.790
mean it kind of made sense back in sort
of the pre GUI days we had to figure out

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800
of the pre GUI days we had to figure out
 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.520
of the pre GUI days we had to figure out
a way to be able to put things in a

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530
a way to be able to put things in a
 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.690
a way to be able to put things in a
place you'd be able to find them again

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700
place you'd be able to find them again
 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.210
place you'd be able to find them again
if all you've got is the ability to list

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220
if all you've got is the ability to list
 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.860
if all you've got is the ability to list
the files in a in a folder and what the

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870
the files in a in a folder and what the
 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.230
the files in a in a folder and what the
current folder is these days that the

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240
current folder is these days that the
 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.670
current folder is these days that the
move is very much away from that it's

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680
move is very much away from that it's
 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.320
move is very much away from that it's
really more about tagging things making

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330
really more about tagging things making
 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.060
really more about tagging things making
them more easily searchable and you can

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070
them more easily searchable and you can
 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.740
them more easily searchable and you can
see the way that Google Drive does that

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750
see the way that Google Drive does that
 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.450
see the way that Google Drive does that
in it your things just sort of sit there

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460
in it your things just sort of sit there
 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.100
in it your things just sort of sit there
and you can tag them and you can search

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110
and you can tag them and you can search
 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.990
and you can tag them and you can search
for them and same with Gmail which was

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000
for them and same with Gmail which was
 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.120
for them and same with Gmail which was
sort of the forerunner for that so in

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.130
sort of the forerunner for that so in
 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.760
sort of the forerunner for that so in
most cases if what you're building is

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770
most cases if what you're building is
 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.310
most cases if what you're building is
just a file manager then you know I

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.320
just a file manager then you know I
 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.200
just a file manager then you know I
think it's it does have some value if

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210
think it's it does have some value if
 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.550
think it's it does have some value if
you're figuring out how to put the file

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560
you're figuring out how to put the file
 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.830
you're figuring out how to put the file
manager into your app to make it easy if

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840
manager into your app to make it easy if
 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.330
manager into your app to make it easy if
you use this to save files and load

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.340
you use this to save files and load
 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.370
you use this to save files and load
files I'd say that you're probably going

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380
files I'd say that you're probably going
 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.960
files I'd say that you're probably going
in slightly the wrong direction she'd be

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970
in slightly the wrong direction she'd be
 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.700
in slightly the wrong direction she'd be
thinking more about how can you make it

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:29.710
thinking more about how can you make it
 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.490
thinking more about how can you make it
easy for people to find the content that

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500
easy for people to find the content that
 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.779
easy for people to find the content that
they're looking for without having to

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:33.789
they're looking for without having to
 

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:34.180
they're looking for without having to
know

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.190
know
 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.970
know
a hierarchy in order to do so okay yeah

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:39.980
a hierarchy in order to do so okay yeah
 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.770
a hierarchy in order to do so okay yeah
I would add that the difference is that

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780
I would add that the difference is that
 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.170
I would add that the difference is that
if you use some sort of file hierarchy

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:44.180
if you use some sort of file hierarchy
 

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.660
if you use some sort of file hierarchy
like old-fashioned directories then

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:46.670
like old-fashioned directories then
 

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.700
like old-fashioned directories then
you've just kind of stuck with putting

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:48.710
you've just kind of stuck with putting
 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.070
you've just kind of stuck with putting
one thing in one place whereas if you

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080
one thing in one place whereas if you
 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.170
one thing in one place whereas if you
tagged it or give it some metadata that

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:53.180
tagged it or give it some metadata that
 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.110
tagged it or give it some metadata that
you can then search on that for you can

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.120
you can then search on that for you can
 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.710

it's exactly a half way so that's I

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800
it's exactly a half way so that's I
 

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.800
it's exactly a half way so that's I
presume that that's the functionality

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:14.810

easy to do and our recommendation
 

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.500
easy to do and our recommendation
actually right now is really it's an

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:56.510
actually right now is really it's an
 

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.910
actually right now is really it's an
awesome model I love it

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920
awesome model I love it

now you're sort of on your own over time
 

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.850
now you're sort of on your own over time
once we actually figure out what the you

assuming that we actually said we liked
it right this always possible will

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800
it right this always possible will
 

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.640
it right this always possible will
change our minds later on so yeah pretty

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:33.650
change our minds later on so yeah pretty
 

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.870
change our minds later on so yeah pretty
much you're on your own unfortunately

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880
much you're on your own unfortunately
 

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.060
much you're on your own unfortunately
and there's really and from the

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:37.070
and there's really and from the
 

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.370
and there's really and from the
technical perspective if you want a good

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:39.380
technical perspective if you want a good
 

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.810
technical perspective if you want a good
place to start I'd start with viewpager

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:40.820
place to start I'd start with viewpager
 

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.730
place to start I'd start with viewpager
and start modifying that but it's not

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:42.740
and start modifying that but it's not
 

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.190
and start modifying that but it's not
going to be as simple as just having a

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200
going to be as simple as just having a
 

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.130
going to be as simple as just having a
at property so it looks so if we try and

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:48.140
at property so it looks so if we try and
 

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.090
at property so it looks so if we try and
think it through so it looks like what

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.100
think it through so it looks like what
 

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.830
think it through so it looks like what
it's doing is it's a because all of the

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:50.840
it's doing is it's a because all of the
 

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.300
it's doing is it's a because all of the
other interaction works exactly the same

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:52.310
other interaction works exactly the same
 

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.730
other interaction works exactly the same
as view pager so if you started with

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:54.740
as view pager so if you started with
 

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.750
as view pager so if you started with
that and it looks like all

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760
that and it looks like all
 

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.870
that and it looks like all
doing a saying if if you're at n plus

00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880
doing a saying if if you're at n plus
 

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.470
doing a saying if if you're at n plus
one well I guess at one then this is you

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480
one well I guess at one then this is you
 

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.510
one well I guess at one then this is you
know limit the size of the of the

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:04.520
know limit the size of the of the
 

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.820
know limit the size of the of the
fragment for the zeroth fragment right

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:06.830
fragment for the zeroth fragment right
 

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.160
fragment for the zeroth fragment right
that would seem to be a place to start

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.170
that would seem to be a place to start
 

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.140
that would seem to be a place to start
so have a look at the viewpager and what

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:11.150
so have a look at the viewpager and what
 

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.730
so have a look at the viewpager and what
you want to do is modify the behavior if

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:12.740
you want to do is modify the behavior if
 

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.880
you want to do is modify the behavior if
the first fragment is visible so that it

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:15.890
the first fragment is visible so that it
 

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.920
the first fragment is visible so that it
doesn't fully extend to the full width

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:17.930
doesn't fully extend to the full width
 

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.520
doesn't fully extend to the full width
of the of the screen I think we have any

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:21.530
of the of the screen I think we have any
 

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.040
of the of the screen I think we have any
sample code sir nope I'm not a weapon

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.050
sample code sir nope I'm not a weapon
 

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.310
sample code sir nope I'm not a weapon
either yeah the person that hang out

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320
either yeah the person that hang out
 

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.020
either yeah the person that hang out
says they looked into that using a view

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.030
says they looked into that using a view
 

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.150
says they looked into that using a view
flipper in combination with animations

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160
flipper in combination with animations
 

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.040
flipper in combination with animations
but they cannot figure out how to limit

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.050
but they cannot figure out how to limit
 

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:40.720
but they cannot figure out how to limit
the size yeah never another beautiful

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:40.730
the size yeah never another beautiful
 

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.000
the size yeah never another beautiful
bird great a suggestion

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.010
bird great a suggestion
 

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.650
bird great a suggestion
they tried what you it so they tried

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:44.660
they tried what you it so they tried
 

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.150
they tried what you it so they tried
what I suggested to the viewpager and

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160
what I suggested to the viewpager and
 

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.200
what I suggested to the viewpager and
they're gonna find out how to limit the

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.210
they're gonna find out how to limit the
 

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.520
they're gonna find out how to limit the
size yeah I think that's going to be the

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:48.530
size yeah I think that's going to be the
 

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.380
size yeah I think that's going to be the
struggle because the the way that the

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:50.390
struggle because the the way that the
 

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.840
struggle because the the way that the

just do the animations between to set

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:55.820
just do the animations between to set
 

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.350
just do the animations between to set
frames and so instead of having those

00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360
frames and so instead of having those
 

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.620
frames and so instead of having those
two fragments on screen I mean the other

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:02.630
two fragments on screen I mean the other
 

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.320
two fragments on screen I mean the other
possibility that you may want to try is

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:05.330
possibility that you may want to try is
 

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:10.840
possibility that you may want to try is
to have the zeroth fragment contain so

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:10.850
to have the zeroth fragment contain so
 

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.160
to have the zeroth fragment contain so
that what you're actually looking at on

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.170
that what you're actually looking at on
 

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.320
that what you're actually looking at on
that view pager isn't actually the last

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:14.330
that view pager isn't actually the last
 

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.300
that view pager isn't actually the last
fragment being half-width it's just that

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:16.310
fragment being half-width it's just that
 

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.150
fragment being half-width it's just that
the last fragment looks like the

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.160
the last fragment looks like the
 

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.770
the last fragment looks like the
previous fragment and the first fragment

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:20.780
previous fragment and the first fragment
 

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.200
previous fragment and the first fragment
joined together if that makes sense so I

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.210
joined together if that makes sense so I
 

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.010
joined together if that makes sense so I
don't know how you would do the

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:24.020
don't know how you would do the
 

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.720
don't know how you would do the
animation but maybe once you get halfway

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:25.730
animation but maybe once you get halfway
 

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.090
animation but maybe once you get halfway
across and then it switches it oh no

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:28.100
across and then it switches it oh no
 

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.850
across and then it switches it oh no
it's getting a little bit Airy even in

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:30.860
it's getting a little bit Airy even in
 

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.790
it's getting a little bit Airy even in
my own mind but yeah we we'd be

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800
my own mind but yeah we we'd be
 

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.260
my own mind but yeah we we'd be
interested to see how you get on but I

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:35.270
interested to see how you get on but I
 

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.550
interested to see how you get on but I
don't think that there's an easy

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560
don't think that there's an easy
 

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.800
don't think that there's an easy
solution for that at this point

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:38.810
solution for that at this point
 

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.570
solution for that at this point
unfortunately like Trevor says there's

this stuff I don't think it can do

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:08.840
this stuff I don't think it can do
 

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.090
this stuff I don't think it can do
everything on your list but it's worth

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:10.100
everything on your list but it's worth
 

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.220
everything on your list but it's worth
looking into that's by a company called

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:12.230
looking into that's by a company called
 

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.620
looking into that's by a company called
bit bar and so that they offer as a

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:14.630
bit bar and so that they offer as a
 

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.030
bit bar and so that they offer as a
subscription service where you upload

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040
subscription service where you upload
 

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.890
subscription service where you upload
your apk to their servers and they run a

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:17.900
your apk to their servers and they run a
 

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.690
your apk to their servers and they run a
series of tests on devices you've

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:19.700
series of tests on devices you've
 

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.730
series of tests on devices you've
supplied to them sorry on devices

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:21.740
supplied to them sorry on devices
 

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.670
supplied to them sorry on devices
they've supplied for you yeah you'd have

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.680
they've supplied for you yeah you'd have
 

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.290
they've supplied for you yeah you'd have
to mail them any devices and that's

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:26.300
to mail them any devices and that's
 

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.120
to mail them any devices and that's
probably your best but if you're looking

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:28.130
probably your best but if you're looking
 

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.860
probably your best but if you're looking
to try and do a lot of this sort of

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:29.870
to try and do a lot of this sort of
 

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.780
to try and do a lot of this sort of
trying to go and automate a bunch of it

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:31.790
trying to go and automate a bunch of it
 

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.230
trying to go and automate a bunch of it
yourself using things like ADB to go and

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240
yourself using things like ADB to go and
 

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.910
yourself using things like ADB to go and
actually ADB only gets you so far even

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920
actually ADB only gets you so far even
 

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.990
actually ADB only gets you so far even
like if you're trying to test their

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000
like if you're trying to test their
 

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.100
like if you're trying to test their
battery you'd have to hook up some

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:39.110
battery you'd have to hook up some
 

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.560
battery you'd have to hook up some
hardware and you know start modifying

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:41.570
hardware and you know start modifying
 

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.200
hardware and you know start modifying
the voltage that's a tough one so really

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:44.210
the voltage that's a tough one so really
 

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.750
the voltage that's a tough one so really
really no easy way there other than what

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:46.760
really no easy way there other than what
 

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.100
really no easy way there other than what
the emulator already provides and it

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:48.110
the emulator already provides and it
 

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.360
the emulator already provides and it
does supply some of it so definitely

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:49.370
does supply some of it so definitely
 

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.580
does supply some of it so definitely
look at that first one of the tool that

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:51.590
look at that first one of the tool that
 

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.230
look at that first one of the tool that
can potentially be really powerful is

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240
can potentially be really powerful is
 

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.930
can potentially be really powerful is
the monkey which will which generates a

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:55.940
the monkey which will which generates a
 

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.570
the monkey which will which generates a
bunch of random events I so touches on

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:58.580
bunch of random events I so touches on
 

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.750
bunch of random events I so touches on
the screen keyboard event inputs and

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:01.760
the screen keyboard event inputs and
 

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.430
the screen keyboard event inputs and
it'll push them push your app in all

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440
it'll push them push your app in all
 

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.960
it'll push them push your app in all
different directions and we use that a

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:04.970
different directions and we use that a
 

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:05.910
different directions and we use that a
lot on the team to help

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920
lot on the team to help
 

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.550
lot on the team to help
cover bugs and all verbs across the

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560
cover bugs and all verbs across the
 

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.530
cover bugs and all verbs across the
platform so to generate a lot of that

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:10.540
platform so to generate a lot of that
 

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.210
platform so to generate a lot of that
noise I mean it'll uncover race

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:12.220
noise I mean it'll uncover race
 

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.949
noise I mean it'll uncover race
conditions a lot of times I in code so

00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:13.959
conditions a lot of times I in code so
 

00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:15.449
conditions a lot of times I in code so
the monkey tool is great you can find

00:16:15.449 --> 00:16:15.459
the monkey tool is great you can find
 

00:16:15.459 --> 00:16:17.579
the monkey tool is great you can find
that it's just a using a to be on the

00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:17.589
that it's just a using a to be on the
 

00:16:17.589 --> 00:16:20.340
that it's just a using a to be on the
command line similarly I think that if

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:20.350
command line similarly I think that if
 

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.889
command line similarly I think that if
you're trying to simulate these sort of

00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:22.899
you're trying to simulate these sort of
 

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:25.019
you're trying to simulate these sort of
extreme conditions based on what other

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:25.029
extreme conditions based on what other
 

00:16:25.029 --> 00:16:27.509
extreme conditions based on what other
apps are doing the easiest solution in a

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519
apps are doing the easiest solution in a
 

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.220
apps are doing the easiest solution in a
lot of cases is going to be to create

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:29.230
lot of cases is going to be to create
 

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.860
lot of cases is going to be to create
your own version of those other apps and

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:31.870
your own version of those other apps and
 

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:32.970
your own version of those other apps and
the extreme conditions are going to be

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:32.980
the extreme conditions are going to be
 

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.560
the extreme conditions are going to be
when other apps are misbehaving so you

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:34.570
when other apps are misbehaving so you
 

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.180
when other apps are misbehaving so you
get to have fun and create an app which

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:36.190
get to have fun and create an app which
 

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.310
get to have fun and create an app which
is really poorly behaved it does

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320
is really poorly behaved it does
 

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.990
is really poorly behaved it does
everything that we tell you not to do it

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000
everything that we tell you not to do it
 

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.629
everything that we tell you not to do it
which chews up memory and causes other

00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639
which chews up memory and causes other
 

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.759
which chews up memory and causes other
apps to effectively swap out and get

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:44.769
apps to effectively swap out and get
 

00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:47.850
apps to effectively swap out and get
killed yeah I think we actually I think

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:47.860
killed yeah I think we actually I think
 

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.290
killed yeah I think we actually I think
was it Dan hack born would actually

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:49.300
was it Dan hack born would actually
 

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.180
was it Dan hack born would actually
something very similar to that thrown in

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:51.190
something very similar to that thrown in
 

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.460
something very similar to that thrown in
to analyse for a while my own our own

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:53.470
to analyse for a while my own our own
 

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.550
to analyse for a while my own our own
builds had a very very badly misbehaving

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560
builds had a very very badly misbehaving
 

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.110
builds had a very very badly misbehaving
app installed on them for a bit to go

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.120
app installed on them for a bit to go
 

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.150

and try and test what happens when when

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160
and try and test what happens when when
 

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.090
and try and test what happens when when
apps misbehave thankfully that doesn't

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.100
apps misbehave thankfully that doesn't
 

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.210
apps misbehave thankfully that doesn't
ship but yeah I think that's probably a

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:06.220
ship but yeah I think that's probably a
 

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.559
ship but yeah I think that's probably a
good approach is you know just write

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:07.569
good approach is you know just write
 

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.780
good approach is you know just write
your really bad app and that's you know

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:09.790
your really bad app and that's you know
 

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.150
your really bad app and that's you know
gonna go and cover a list from the

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160
gonna go and cover a list from the
 

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.799
gonna go and cover a list from the
performance side of things what happens

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:13.809
performance side of things what happens
 

00:17:13.809 --> 00:17:15.929
performance side of things what happens
when things go wrong it's usually the

00:17:15.929 --> 00:17:15.939
when things go wrong it's usually the
 

00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:17.370
when things go wrong it's usually the
easiest way to do it you can you can do

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:17.380
easiest way to do it you can you can do
 

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.840
easiest way to do it you can you can do
a lot through simulating things but

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:18.850
a lot through simulating things but
 

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:20.610
a lot through simulating things but
ultimately it's gonna be you know how

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:20.620
ultimately it's gonna be you know how
 

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.169
ultimately it's gonna be you know how
does my app behave when another app is

00:17:22.169 --> 00:17:22.179
does my app behave when another app is
 

00:17:22.179 --> 00:17:23.880
does my app behave when another app is
using all my bandwidth using all my

using all my bandwidth using all my
 

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.650
using all my bandwidth using all my
processor using all my storage is to

processor using all my storage is to
 

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.449
processor using all my storage is to
build that other app and it gives you

00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:27.459
build that other app and it gives you
 

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:28.919
build that other app and it gives you
the control as well because then you can

00:17:28.919 --> 00:17:28.929
the control as well because then you can
 

00:17:28.929 --> 00:17:31.470
the control as well because then you can
decide how far you want it to go so at

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480
decide how far you want it to go so at
 

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.030
decide how far you want it to go so at
what point does my app stop being

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:33.040
what point does my app stop being
 

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.039
what point does my app stop being
unresponsive and what steps should I

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:35.049
unresponsive and what steps should I
 

00:17:35.049 --> 00:17:39.600
unresponsive and what steps should I
take to try and help the system Oh any

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:39.610
take to try and help the system Oh any

now let's move on oops I think I skipped

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:48.040
now let's move on oops I think I skipped
 

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.669
now let's move on oops I think I skipped
one here I have a fragment which uses a

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679
one here I have a fragment which uses a
 

00:17:50.679 --> 00:17:52.680
one here I have a fragment which uses a
loader it implements the loader

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:52.690
loader it implements the loader
 

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.720
loader it implements the loader

destroy across orientation changes

00:17:58.890 --> 00:17:58.900
destroy across orientation changes
 

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.289
destroy across orientation changes
however the loader it creates in the

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:01.299
however the loader it creates in the
 

00:18:01.299 --> 00:18:06.789
however the loader it creates in the
oncreate loader gets reset why

00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799
 

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:10.729
that's a good question yeah actually I

00:18:10.729 --> 00:18:10.739
that's a good question yeah actually I
 

00:18:10.739 --> 00:18:12.559
that's a good question yeah actually I
have never seen this behavior before so

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:12.569
have never seen this behavior before so
 

00:18:12.569 --> 00:18:13.729
have never seen this behavior before so
I'm not sure what the answer is off the

00:18:13.729 --> 00:18:13.739
I'm not sure what the answer is off the
 

00:18:13.739 --> 00:18:16.189
I'm not sure what the answer is off the
top of my head this also I think was

00:18:16.189 --> 00:18:16.199
top of my head this also I think was
 

00:18:16.199 --> 00:18:17.539
top of my head this also I think was
when a later question to come into the

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:17.549
when a later question to come into the
 

00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:18.979
when a later question to come into the
Q's I think a chance to research it

00:18:18.979 --> 00:18:18.989
Q's I think a chance to research it

alright I have a performance question

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:37.979
alright I have a performance question
 

00:19:37.979 --> 00:19:39.859
alright I have a performance question
related of databases what are the

00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:39.869

overhead implications with sequel light
and increasing the number of tables hmm

00:19:45.849 --> 00:19:45.859
and increasing the number of tables hmm
 

00:19:45.859 --> 00:19:49.159
and increasing the number of tables hmm
that's a good question I'd say yeah

00:19:49.159 --> 00:19:49.169
that's a good question I'd say yeah
 

00:19:49.169 --> 00:19:50.839
that's a good question I'd say yeah
adding more tables properly it's not

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:50.849
adding more tables properly it's not
 

00:19:50.849 --> 00:19:53.869
adding more tables properly it's not
going to hurt you too much what is going

00:19:53.869 --> 00:19:53.879
going to hurt you too much what is going
 

00:19:53.879 --> 00:19:58.129
going to hurt you too much what is going
to hurt you is joins and at some point

00:19:58.129 --> 00:19:58.139
to hurt you is joins and at some point
 

00:19:58.139 --> 00:19:59.779
to hurt you is joins and at some point
just having so many records that takes a

setting indexes wisely is definitely

00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:03.689
setting indexes wisely is definitely
 

00:20:03.689 --> 00:20:05.869
setting indexes wisely is definitely
going to help indexes do increase the

00:20:05.869 --> 00:20:05.879
going to help indexes do increase the
 

00:20:05.879 --> 00:20:08.749
going to help indexes do increase the
cost when you perform a light and it's a

00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:08.759

trade off next gene you get faster read
times I'd say yeah that's pretty much

00:20:14.389 --> 00:20:14.399
times I'd say yeah that's pretty much
 

00:20:14.399 --> 00:20:17.260

service be used okay so I think this

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:56.750
service be used okay so I think this
 

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.180

one's a bit of confusion about the way

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.190
one's a bit of confusion about the way

web service doesn't actually sound a
 

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.780
web service doesn't actually sound a
very good idea to me and we actually

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:07.790
very good idea to me and we actually
 

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.580
very good idea to me and we actually
don't do that in the Google i/o app what

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:09.590
don't do that in the Google i/o app what
 

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.180
don't do that in the Google i/o app what
we do do is we have a background service

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:12.190
we do do is we have a background service
 

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.610
we do do is we have a background service
in conjunction with a sync adapter which

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:15.620

service stores is in a local database
and then that loader is used to go and

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:21.860
and then that loader is used to go and
 

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.620
and then that loader is used to go and
fetch the data out of the local database

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:23.630
fetch the data out of the local database
 

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.490
fetch the data out of the local database
and that's the model we're using it's

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:27.500
and that's the model we're using it's
 

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.840
and that's the model we're using it's
nice because we don't have to worry

nice because we don't have to worry
 

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.520
nice because we don't have to worry
about trying to fetch data well the apps

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:30.530

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:39.230
phone ask informing if the schedules
 

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.230
phone ask informing if the schedules
changed and then it can go and update or

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240
changed and then it can go and update or
 

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.460

open the app you have to wait for a

open the app you have to wait for a
 

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:46.840
open the app you have to wait for a
couple minutes well that's just the

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:46.850
couple minutes well that's just the
 

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.120
couple minutes well that's just the
latest schedule data you know you always

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.130

they're already stashed so as far as the

they're already stashed so as far as the
 

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.340
they're already stashed so as far as the
other half of the question which is

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:56.350
other half of the question which is
 

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:00.190
other half of the question which is
should or when shouldn't end service be

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200
should or when shouldn't end service be
 

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.180
should or when shouldn't end service be
used and I think in that case say it

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:04.190
used and I think in that case say it
 

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.650
used and I think in that case say it
really quickly it's a matter of

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:05.660
really quickly it's a matter of

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.360
service were still running as a service
it's justa nearly intense services more

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:15.370
it's justa nearly intense services more
 

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.350
it's justa nearly intense services more
my family look quickly because I've

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360
my family look quickly because I've
 

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.700
my family look quickly because I've
actually never used that one myself but

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:18.710
actually never used that one myself but
 

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.890

I think that's more for one-off jobs you

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:20.900
I think that's more for one-off jobs you
 

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.780
I think that's more for one-off jobs you
specify a bunch of the you specify your

this case since we're always going and

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480
this case since we're always going and
 

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.670
this case since we're always going and
doing the same thing over and over again

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:27.680
doing the same thing over and over again
 

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.190
doing the same thing over and over again
we're always fetching these you know

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200
we're always fetching these you know
 

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:30.530
we're always fetching these you know
these

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:30.540
these
 

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.680
these
schedule changes there's really you know

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:33.690
schedule changes there's really you know
 

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.660

I think it looks better as just a

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:35.670
I think it looks better as just a
 

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:39.080
I think it looks better as just a
self-contained background service they

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:39.090
self-contained background service they
 

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.640
self-contained background service they
don't if you have any comments on when

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:40.650
don't if you have any comments on when
 

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.140
don't if you have any comments on when
intent service is a better choice

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:42.150
intent service is a better choice
 

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.790
intent service is a better choice
yeah actually mean we enjoyed I've

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:43.800
yeah actually mean we enjoyed I've
 

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.960
yeah actually mean we enjoyed I've
actually been out talking about this a

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:44.970
actually been out talking about this a
 

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.340
actually been out talking about this a
little bit over the last couple of weeks

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:46.350
little bit over the last couple of weeks
 

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.010
little bit over the last couple of weeks
I think if you're looking specifically

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.020
I think if you're looking specifically
 

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.650
I think if you're looking specifically
between intent service and async task I

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:51.660
between intent service and async task I
 

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.210
between intent service and async task I
think that's generally the sort of

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220
think that's generally the sort of
 

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.040
think that's generally the sort of
question people have is often will come

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:55.050
question people have is often will come
 

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.710
question people have is often will come
across the async task class first and

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720
across the async task class first and
 

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.510
across the async task class first and
see it is a really convenient way of

00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520
see it is a really convenient way of
 

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.270
see it is a really convenient way of
being able to do background stuff you

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280
being able to do background stuff you
 

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.980
being able to do background stuff you
want to get off the UI thread to work in

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:03.990
want to get off the UI thread to work in
 

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.980
want to get off the UI thread to work in
Android and it's great and it does all

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:06.990
Android and it's great and it does all
 

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.450
Android and it's great and it does all
of the marshaling to the UI thread for

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460
of the marshaling to the UI thread for
 

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.340
of the marshaling to the UI thread for
you which is really really handy but

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:10.350
you which is really really handy but
 

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.930
you which is really really handy but
that's kind of a clue as to when it's

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940
that's kind of a clue as to when it's
 

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.610
that's kind of a clue as to when it's
most appropriate as well so there is

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620
most appropriate as well so there is
 

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.230
most appropriate as well so there is
some overhead associated with it

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240
some overhead associated with it
 

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.300
some overhead associated with it
and what it's really designed for is

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:17.310
and what it's really designed for is
 

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.980
and what it's really designed for is
doing something within your activity

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:18.990
doing something within your activity
 

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.480
doing something within your activity
which is going to have a direct impact

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:20.490
which is going to have a direct impact
 

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.510
which is going to have a direct impact
on your UI so if it's something which is

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520
on your UI so if it's something which is
 

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.370
on your UI so if it's something which is
allowed to get destroyed as soon as your

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380
allowed to get destroyed as soon as your
 

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.530
allowed to get destroyed as soon as your
activity gets closed because remember of

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:27.540
activity gets closed because remember of
 

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.110
activity gets closed because remember of
course that your async tasks within an

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120
course that your async tasks within an
 

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.850
course that your async tasks within an
activity as soon as you rotate the

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860
activity as soon as you rotate the
 

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.250
activity as soon as you rotate the
device they're all going to get killed

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260
device they're all going to get killed
 

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.020
device they're all going to get killed
so it's really stuff which should not be

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.030
so it's really stuff which should not be
 

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.880
so it's really stuff which should not be
long-lived it's just too time consuming

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:37.890
long-lived it's just too time consuming
 

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.090
long-lived it's just too time consuming
to do on the UI thread in sensors is

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100
to do on the UI thread in sensors is
 

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.010
to do on the UI thread in sensors is
just a really neat way of being able to

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.020
just a really neat way of being able to
 

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.660
just a really neat way of being able to
encapsulate one of the most common

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:44.670
encapsulate one of the most common
 

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.570
encapsulate one of the most common
service implementations implementation

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580
service implementations implementation
 

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.700
service implementations implementation
patterns so service is basically

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:49.710
patterns so service is basically
 

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.290
patterns so service is basically
designed there for anything within your

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:51.300
designed there for anything within your
 

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.060
designed there for anything within your
app which needs to live longer than the

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.070
app which needs to live longer than the
 

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.350
app which needs to live longer than the
average lifespan of a particular

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360
average lifespan of a particular
 

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.540
average lifespan of a particular
activity instance so anything which

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:56.550
activity instance so anything which
 

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.370
activity instance so anything which
needs to live across multiple activities

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.380
needs to live across multiple activities
 

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.190
needs to live across multiple activities
anything which should stay continued to

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200
anything which should stay continued to
 

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.990
anything which should stay continued to
be active when you're rotating the

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000
be active when you're rotating the
 

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
be active when you're rotating the
screen all that sort of stuff should

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.010
screen all that sort of stuff should
 

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.350
screen all that sort of stuff should
live in a service so anything which

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360
live in a service so anything which
 

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.060
live in a service so anything which
you're downloading which is more than

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:08.070
you're downloading which is more than
 

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.430
you're downloading which is more than
you know anything non-trivial which of

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440
you know anything non-trivial which of
 

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.020
you know anything non-trivial which of
downloading probably wants to be in a

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:12.030
downloading probably wants to be in a
 

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.150
downloading probably wants to be in a
service and the intent service is really

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:14.160
service and the intent service is really
 

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.890
service and the intent service is really
handy because it creates this queue for

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900
handy because it creates this queue for
 

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.050
handy because it creates this queue for
you so it'll just basically create a

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:18.060
you so it'll just basically create a
 

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.690
you so it'll just basically create a
serial queue where you keep sending it

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:20.700
serial queue where you keep sending it
 

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.340
serial queue where you keep sending it
commands to do and it will just keep

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:22.350
commands to do and it will just keep
 

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.170
commands to do and it will just keep
going through them until all the tasks

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:24.180
going through them until all the tasks
 

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.700
going through them until all the tasks
have been done and then neatly kill the

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:25.710
have been done and then neatly kill the
 

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:27.560
have been done and then neatly kill the
service for you so if you're doing

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:27.570
service for you so if you're doing
 

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.130
service for you so if you're doing
things like intermittent download so as

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:30.140
things like intermittent download so as
 

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.270
things like intermittent download so as
as Trevor says anything which is going

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:32.280
as Trevor says anything which is going
 

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.620
as Trevor says anything which is going
to be on a regular schedule anything

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:33.630
to be on a regular schedule anything
 

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:34.159
to be on a regular schedule anything
which has to

00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:34.169
which has to
 

00:24:34.169 --> 00:24:36.049
which has to
happen you know on an ongoing basis

00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059
happen you know on an ongoing basis
 

00:24:36.059 --> 00:24:37.879
happen you know on an ongoing basis
she'd probably lose you know you

00:24:37.879 --> 00:24:37.889
she'd probably lose you know you
 

00:24:37.889 --> 00:24:39.950
she'd probably lose you know you
something like a sync adapter but if

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960
something like a sync adapter but if
 

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.119
something like a sync adapter but if
you're just going to be downloading

00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:41.129
you're just going to be downloading
 

00:24:41.129 --> 00:24:43.009
you're just going to be downloading
things when a user click something so

00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:43.019
things when a user click something so
 

00:24:43.019 --> 00:24:43.999
things when a user click something so
you don't really know when it's going to

00:24:43.999 --> 00:24:44.009
you don't really know when it's going to
 

00:24:44.009 --> 00:24:46.399
you don't really know when it's going to
happen then intent so this is perfect

00:24:46.399 --> 00:24:46.409
happen then intent so this is perfect
 

00:24:46.409 --> 00:24:48.560
happen then intent so this is perfect
because you just send it the send it the

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:48.570
because you just send it the send it the
 

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.419
because you just send it the send it the
thing say oh I want you to download this

00:24:50.419 --> 00:24:50.429
thing say oh I want you to download this
 

00:24:50.429 --> 00:24:52.340
thing say oh I want you to download this
you will download it when it's finished

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:52.350
you will download it when it's finished
 

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.960
you will download it when it's finished
it updates your content provider and

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:53.970
it updates your content provider and
 

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.489
it updates your content provider and
then your UI automatically gets updated

00:24:55.489 --> 00:24:55.499
then your UI automatically gets updated
 

00:24:55.499 --> 00:24:57.769
then your UI automatically gets updated
via its loader when the content provider

00:24:57.769 --> 00:24:57.779
via its loader when the content provider
 

00:24:57.779 --> 00:24:59.989
via its loader when the content provider
associated with it has been updated so

00:24:59.989 --> 00:24:59.999
associated with it has been updated so
 

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:01.759
associated with it has been updated so
it just helps to create that nice sort

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:01.769
it just helps to create that nice sort
 

00:25:01.769 --> 00:25:04.729
it just helps to create that nice sort
of you know pattern for you and often

00:25:04.729 --> 00:25:04.739
of you know pattern for you and often
 

00:25:04.739 --> 00:25:05.930
of you know pattern for you and often
that's kind of the way it works as well

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:05.940
that's kind of the way it works as well
 

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.479
that's kind of the way it works as well
as like you intuitively like you when

00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:08.489
as like you intuitively like you when
 

00:25:08.489 --> 00:25:10.249
as like you intuitively like you when
you first get started with something you

00:25:10.249 --> 00:25:10.259
you first get started with something you
 

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:11.960
you first get started with something you
have an activity you have your UI so

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:11.970
have an activity you have your UI so
 

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.129
have an activity you have your UI so
there's a temptation to just do

00:25:13.129 --> 00:25:13.139
there's a temptation to just do
 

00:25:13.139 --> 00:25:15.379
there's a temptation to just do
everything within that class and it's

00:25:15.379 --> 00:25:15.389
everything within that class and it's
 

00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:16.940
everything within that class and it's
kind of the trick behind Android is that

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:16.950
kind of the trick behind Android is that
 

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.340
kind of the trick behind Android is that
you're your sort of main form he's

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:19.350
you're your sort of main form he's
 

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.289
you're your sort of main form he's
actually made up of your activity plus

00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:21.299
actually made up of your activity plus
 

00:25:21.299 --> 00:25:23.509
actually made up of your activity plus
the services that support a plus but

00:25:23.509 --> 00:25:23.519
the services that support a plus but
 

00:25:23.519 --> 00:25:24.950
the services that support a plus but
potentially a content provider as well

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960
potentially a content provider as well
 

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.720
potentially a content provider as well
so you really need to think of all of

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:26.730
so you really need to think of all of
 

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.430
so you really need to think of all of
those modules and how they fit together

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440
those modules and how they fit together
 

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.690
those modules and how they fit together
in order to create something that works

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700
in order to create something that works
 

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.090
in order to create something that works
in the best one thank you good answer

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:34.100
in the best one thank you good answer
 

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.129
in the best one thank you good answer
make all you need to take it beverage to

00:25:37.129 --> 00:25:37.139
make all you need to take it beverage to
 

00:25:37.139 --> 00:25:42.139
make all you need to take it beverage to
voice in my mouth any other comments so

00:25:42.139 --> 00:25:42.149
voice in my mouth any other comments so
 

00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:43.369
voice in my mouth any other comments so
then one of their value of intent

00:25:43.369 --> 00:25:43.379
then one of their value of intent
 

00:25:43.379 --> 00:25:45.409
then one of their value of intent
service is really I if you're in your UI

00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:45.419
service is really I if you're in your UI
 

00:25:45.419 --> 00:25:46.729
service is really I if you're in your UI
and you want to persist something if you

00:25:46.729 --> 00:25:46.739
and you want to persist something if you
 

00:25:46.739 --> 00:25:48.049
and you want to persist something if you
really want to make sure that it gets

00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059
really want to make sure that it gets
 

00:25:48.059 --> 00:25:48.680
really want to make sure that it gets
saved

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:48.690
saved
 

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.090
saved
that's what intent service is there for

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.100
that's what intent service is there for
 

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.529
that's what intent service is there for
because even if the user hits the HOME

00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539
because even if the user hits the HOME
 

00:25:51.539 --> 00:25:53.629
because even if the user hits the HOME
key or gets an incoming phone call um if

00:25:53.629 --> 00:25:53.639
key or gets an incoming phone call um if
 

00:25:53.639 --> 00:25:55.039
key or gets an incoming phone call um if
you've kicked that off in an async task

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:55.049
you've kicked that off in an async task
 

00:25:55.049 --> 00:25:56.659
you've kicked that off in an async task
there's the potential that your process

00:25:56.659 --> 00:25:56.669
there's the potential that your process
 

00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:58.999
there's the potential that your process
gets killed and that data may not be

00:25:58.999 --> 00:25:59.009
gets killed and that data may not be
 

00:25:59.009 --> 00:26:01.009
gets killed and that data may not be
saved so if the data is important send

00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:01.019
saved so if the data is important send
 

00:26:01.019 --> 00:26:02.629
saved so if the data is important send
it off to that intent service it's

00:26:02.629 --> 00:26:02.639
it off to that intent service it's
 

00:26:02.639 --> 00:26:03.950
it off to that intent service it's
something that's important to persist

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960
something that's important to persist
 

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.229
something that's important to persist
yeah that's a very good point I would

00:26:06.229 --> 00:26:06.239
yeah that's a very good point I would
 

00:26:06.239 --> 00:26:09.049
yeah that's a very good point I would
add that it's really great for being

00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059
add that it's really great for being
 

00:26:09.059 --> 00:26:11.659
add that it's really great for being
able to go send off some work to be done

00:26:11.659 --> 00:26:11.669
able to go send off some work to be done
 

00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:14.479
able to go send off some work to be done
allowing the user then to go off and do

00:26:14.479 --> 00:26:14.489
allowing the user then to go off and do
 

00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:17.180
allowing the user then to go off and do
any other tasks that may come up so that

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:17.190
any other tasks that may come up so that
 

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.940
any other tasks that may come up so that
if a phone call comes in or the user

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:19.950
if a phone call comes in or the user
 

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.739
if a phone call comes in or the user
wants to go off and do some work and

00:26:21.739 --> 00:26:21.749
wants to go off and do some work and
 

00:26:21.749 --> 00:26:24.499
wants to go off and do some work and
wait for this thing to finish they can

00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:24.509
wait for this thing to finish they can
 

00:26:24.509 --> 00:26:25.870
wait for this thing to finish they can
go do that and then get

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:25.880
go do that and then get
 

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.230
go do that and then get
notification or some other indication on

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240
notification or some other indication on
 

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.120
notification or some other indication on
when the work is done and then go back

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.130
when the work is done and then go back
 

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:36.220
when the work is done and then go back
to the activity okay let's move another

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:36.230
to the activity okay let's move another
 

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.580
to the activity okay let's move another
live question shoot is there a way to

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:39.590
live question shoot is there a way to
 

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:41.620
live question shoot is there a way to
use a different class loader at

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:41.630
use a different class loader at
 

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:43.750
use a different class loader at
development time not necessary for

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760
development time not necessary for
 

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.280
development time not necessary for
production for services

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:45.290
production for services
 

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.440
production for services
it looks like it's possible to do this

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:47.450
it looks like it's possible to do this
 

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.720
it looks like it's possible to do this
for activities using instrumentations a

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:49.730
for activities using instrumentations a
 

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:52.180
for activities using instrumentations a
new activity method but I'd like to do

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:52.190
new activity method but I'd like to do
 

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:57.040
new activity method but I'd like to do
this for all parts of an app a different

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:57.050
this for all parts of an app a different
 

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:01.960
this for all parts of an app a different
class order okay the only thing that

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:01.970
class order okay the only thing that
 

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.300
class order okay the only thing that
instrumentation does really in terms of

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:04.310
instrumentation does really in terms of
 

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.550
instrumentation does really in terms of
loading classes is that it allows you a

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:06.560
loading classes is that it allows you a
 

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.730
loading classes is that it allows you a
little bit of extra control or injection

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:09.740
little bit of extra control or injection
 

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.390
little bit of extra control or injection
into activities and there's

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:13.400
into activities and there's
 

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.530
into activities and there's
instrumentation available for services

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:17.540
instrumentation available for services
 

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.990
instrumentation available for services
and for content providers as well as for

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000
and for content providers as well as for
 

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.120
and for content providers as well as for
activities that's the only answer that I

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.130
activities that's the only answer that I
 

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:26.290
activities that's the only answer that I
can give myself so that I'd be curious

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:26.300
can give myself so that I'd be curious
 

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.080
can give myself so that I'd be curious
to see what the use case is to know what

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:29.090
to see what the use case is to know what
 

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:30.940
to see what the use case is to know what
the answer would be yeah I mean I know

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:30.950
the answer would be yeah I mean I know
 

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:33.130
the answer would be yeah I mean I know
it definitely is possible to specify a

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:33.140
it definitely is possible to specify a
 

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.510
it definitely is possible to specify a
different class loader within your

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:34.520
different class loader within your
 

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.330
different class loader within your
activity when you're circling and firing

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:37.340
activity when you're circling and firing
 

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.620
activity when you're circling and firing
off other things like creating a new

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:38.630
off other things like creating a new
 

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.390
off other things like creating a new
service creating other activities I

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:40.400
service creating other activities I
 

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.360
service creating other activities I
think you have limited control there but

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:43.370
think you have limited control there but
 

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:44.830
think you have limited control there but
I know that definitely is a way to go

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840
I know that definitely is a way to go
 

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.740
I know that definitely is a way to go
and control things once your activity

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:47.750
and control things once your activity
 

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.220
and control things once your activity
has gotten started so unfortunately it's

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:51.230
has gotten started so unfortunately it's
 

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.620
has gotten started so unfortunately it's
not a very common task so I can't

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:53.630
not a very common task so I can't
 

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:54.790
not a very common task so I can't
remember the way to do it off the top of

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:54.800
remember the way to do it off the top of
 

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.770
remember the way to do it off the top of
my head but I know it definitely can be

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:56.780
my head but I know it definitely can be
 

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.160
my head but I know it definitely can be
done for example I know there was some

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:00.170
done for example I know there was some
 

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.380
done for example I know there was some
talk a while back of trying to use this

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:02.390
talk a while back of trying to use this
 

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.970
talk a while back of trying to use this
as an investigation mechanism and in

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:03.980
as an investigation mechanism and in
 

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.490
as an investigation mechanism and in
classes and do all sorts of other fun

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:06.500
classes and do all sorts of other fun
 

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.760
classes and do all sorts of other fun
things like that again not something I

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:09.770
things like that again not something I
 

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.880
things like that again not something I
do you recommend most developers try and

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:12.890
do you recommend most developers try and
 

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.730
do you recommend most developers try and
concern themselves with is lots of

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:15.740
concern themselves with is lots of
 

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.480
concern themselves with is lots of
pitfalls lie-down that where I would but

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:18.490
pitfalls lie-down that where I would but
 

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:29.170
pitfalls lie-down that where I would but
definitely as possible right yeah that's

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:29.180
definitely as possible right yeah that's
 

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.310
definitely as possible right yeah that's
that's the question

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320
that's the question
 

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.530
that's the question
oh the activity itself I don't think

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:32.540
oh the activity itself I don't think
 

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.510
oh the activity itself I don't think
that's possible I think it's a very the

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:34.520
that's possible I think it's a very the
 

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.430
that's possible I think it's a very the
best you can use load classes within the

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.440
best you can use load classes within the
 

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.150
best you can use load classes within the
activity

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:37.160
activity
 

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.810
activity
because activity startup ISM it is not

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:40.820
because activity startup ISM it is not
 

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.600
because activity startup ISM it is not
something that you can control like by

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:43.610
something that you can control like by
 

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.070
something that you can control like by
the time you have control your activity

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080
the time you have control your activity
 

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:53.040
the time you have control your activity
has already been loaded well except

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:53.050
has already been loaded well except
 

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.060
has already been loaded well except
where you get a chance will they need

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:55.070
where you get a chance will they need
 

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.410
where you get a chance will they need
that one before you activities actually

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:56.420
that one before you activities actually
 

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.320
that one before you activities actually
created and it will get it maybe

so far the consensus so each of these

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.380
so far the consensus so each of these
 

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.200
so far the consensus so each of these
different different implementations you

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:48.210
different different implementations you
 

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.060
different different implementations you
mentioned are slightly different in the

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:50.070
mentioned are slightly different in the
 

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.009
mentioned are slightly different in the
way that they work and that's part of

00:30:52.009 --> 00:30:52.019
way that they work and that's part of
 

00:30:52.019 --> 00:30:53.149
way that they work and that's part of
what Trevor is talking about is that

00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159

heading towards the YouTube model being

heading towards the YouTube model being
sort of the the right way of doing that

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240
sort of the the right way of doing that
 

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.549
sort of the the right way of doing that
so if you do want to implement something

00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559
so if you do want to implement something
 

00:31:07.559 --> 00:31:09.440
so if you do want to implement something
similar look at the way the YouTube app

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:09.450
similar look at the way the YouTube app
 

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.269
similar look at the way the YouTube app
has implemented it and head in that

00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279
has implemented it and head in that
 

00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:13.279
has implemented it and head in that
direction but for now it's definitely

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:13.289
direction but for now it's definitely
 

00:31:13.289 --> 00:31:15.620
direction but for now it's definitely
not for beginners I think it's gonna be

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:15.630
not for beginners I think it's gonna be
 

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:20.600
not for beginners I think it's gonna be
a little tricky to do ok has a live

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:20.610
a little tricky to do ok has a live
 

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:27.279
a little tricky to do ok has a live
video question go for it yeah fire away

00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:27.289
 

00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:31.879
vodka layup where we have an ad with a

00:31:31.879 --> 00:31:31.889
vodka layup where we have an ad with a
 

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:34.070
vodka layup where we have an ad with a
button next to it to like launched an

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080
button next to it to like launched an
 

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.919
button next to it to like launched an
in-app purchase but every time we don't

00:31:36.919 --> 00:31:36.929
in-app purchase but every time we don't
 

00:31:36.929 --> 00:31:39.110
in-app purchase but every time we don't
give that view the full width of the

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120
give that view the full width of the
 

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.110
give that view the full width of the
layout it freaks out and says that it

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120
layout it freaks out and says that it
 

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.000
layout it freaks out and says that it
can't display the ad but even if we

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.010
can't display the ad but even if we
 

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:47.810
can't display the ad but even if we
create a VM that has a you know really

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820
create a VM that has a you know really
 

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.940
create a VM that has a you know really
tiny screen that is equivalent to what

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:49.950
tiny screen that is equivalent to what
 

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.909
tiny screen that is equivalent to what
space it has it will display the ad as

00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919
space it has it will display the ad as
 

00:31:52.919 --> 00:31:54.620
space it has it will display the ad as
long as we give it you know like match

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:54.630
long as we give it you know like match
 

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:58.669
long as we give it you know like match
parent or fill parent and so we're

00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679
parent or fill parent and so we're
 

00:31:58.679 --> 00:32:00.649
parent or fill parent and so we're
trying to figure out how we can solve

00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:00.659
trying to figure out how we can solve
 

00:32:00.659 --> 00:32:02.090
trying to figure out how we can solve
this right now what we were thinking

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100
this right now what we were thinking
 

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.730
this right now what we were thinking
about is making a fragment that it was

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740
about is making a fragment that it was
 

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.730
about is making a fragment that it was
allowed to take the full width up but

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:06.740
allowed to take the full width up but
 

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.230
allowed to take the full width up but
I'd like to not complicate the layouts

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240
I'd like to not complicate the layouts
 

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.260
I'd like to not complicate the layouts
too much if possible

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:13.270
 

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.170
okay so repeat this and repeat this you

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:16.180
okay so repeat this and repeat this you
 

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.180
okay so repeat this and repeat this you
you've done an ad that you want to

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:18.190
you've done an ad that you want to
 

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.240
you've done an ad that you want to
display with a button next to it to do

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:21.250
display with a button next to it to do
 

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.270
display with a button next to it to do
something like in that purchasing

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:23.280
something like in that purchasing
 

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.580
something like in that purchasing
correct okay and every time you try to

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:26.590
correct okay and every time you try to
 

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.660
correct okay and every time you try to
set that up on it complains because it

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:30.670
set that up on it complains because it
 

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.070
set that up on it complains because it
says you don't have enough room to

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080
says you don't have enough room to
 

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.640
says you don't have enough room to
display the ad correct interesting so

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:35.650
display the ad correct interesting so
 

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.590
display the ad correct interesting so
the ads are coming from a good party

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600
the ads are coming from a good party
 

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.210
the ads are coming from a good party
provider like AdMob or something like

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:39.220
provider like AdMob or something like
 

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.600
provider like AdMob or something like
that yes

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:42.610
 

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.450
okay interesting so this is only going

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:45.460
okay interesting so this is only going
 

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.640
okay interesting so this is only going
to be an issue on certain size displays

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:47.650
to be an issue on certain size displays
 

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.520
to be an issue on certain size displays
right so if it's if it's a a phone where

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:50.530

the right size to fit basically the full
 

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.090
the right size to fit basically the full
width of the phone then then you're

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:57.100
width of the phone then then you're
 

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.230
width of the phone then then you're
gonna have that issue when you try to

00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240
gonna have that issue when you try to
 

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.610
gonna have that issue when you try to
put something next to it is that it's

00:32:59.610 --> 00:32:59.620
put something next to it is that it's
 

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.180
put something next to it is that it's
alright yeah except for if we create a

alright yeah except for if we create a
 

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:07.650
alright yeah except for if we create a
like a virtual machine that has a width

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:07.660
like a virtual machine that has a width
 

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.490
like a virtual machine that has a width

a place ads buttons close to the ads so
 

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.339
a place ads buttons close to the ads so
is that possibly the API is seeing that

00:34:40.339 --> 00:34:40.349
is that possibly the API is seeing that
 

00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:43.159
is that possibly the API is seeing that
in causing a problem or that's actually

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:43.169
in causing a problem or that's actually
 

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:45.379
in causing a problem or that's actually
possible I haven't considered that but

00:34:45.379 --> 00:34:45.389
possible I haven't considered that but
 

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:48.169
possible I haven't considered that but
it is possible that the actual AdMob API

00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179
it is possible that the actual AdMob API
 

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.849
it is possible that the actual AdMob API
is looking and seeing oh you've got a

00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859

so yeah in it does seem a little strange

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520
so yeah in it does seem a little strange
 

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.370
so yeah in it does seem a little strange
I'd be a little bit surprised if it was

00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:58.380
I'd be a little bit surprised if it was
 

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.020
I'd be a little bit surprised if it was
smart enough to do that on your behalf

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:00.030
smart enough to do that on your behalf
 

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:02.870
smart enough to do that on your behalf
but just from a from UX perspective if

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880
but just from a from UX perspective if
 

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.579
but just from a from UX perspective if
nothing else I think it's really not

00:35:04.579 --> 00:35:04.589
nothing else I think it's really not
 

00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:06.859
nothing else I think it's really not
best practice to have your interactive

best practice to have your interactive
 

00:35:06.869 --> 00:35:08.900
best practice to have your interactive
elements is that close to your banner

right so yeah the overflow menu is

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780
right so yeah the overflow menu is
 

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.230
right so yeah the overflow menu is
certainly one option the downside there

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240
certainly one option the downside there
 

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.450
certainly one option the downside there
is discoverability right people do the

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460
is discoverability right people do the
 

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.130
is discoverability right people do the
idea behind that workflow menu is you

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.000
never see it unless you really want to
go looking through it a better idea is

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:41.010
go looking through it a better idea is
 

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.030
go looking through it a better idea is
just to go and put a just so you know

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040
just to go and put a just so you know

you're describing yeah
also I'll add that I did a code lab at

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:48.840
also I'll add that I did a code lab at
 

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.120
also I'll add that I did a code lab at
Google i/o that did something very

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:50.130
Google i/o that did something very
 

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:51.500
Google i/o that did something very
similar to the behavior you're

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:51.510
similar to the behavior you're
 

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:55.520
similar to the behavior you're
describing and specifically we I created

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:55.530
describing and specifically we I created
 

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.770
describing and specifically we I created
a grid view that loads a bunch of really

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780
a grid view that loads a bunch of really
 

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.480
a grid view that loads a bunch of really
high resolution images over and over

00:37:59.480 --> 00:37:59.490
high resolution images over and over
 

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.940
high resolution images over and over
again and we sort of walk people through

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:01.950
again and we sort of walk people through
 

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:05.360
again and we sort of walk people through
going and finding all the the hotspots

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:05.370
going and finding all the the hotspots
 

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:06.350
going and finding all the the hotspots
in the code all the things that would

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:06.360
in the code all the things that would
 

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.070
in the code all the things that would
cause a garbage collection cause you're

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:10.080
cause a garbage collection cause you're
 

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.960
cause a garbage collection cause you're
just general jank everything that was

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:11.970
just general jank everything that was
 

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.790
just general jank everything that was
bad and we'd go and take get rid of them

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800
bad and we'd go and take get rid of them
 

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.840
bad and we'd go and take get rid of them
one after the other and I think that you

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:17.850
one after the other and I think that you
 

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.220
one after the other and I think that you
can get a link to it from the Google i/o

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:19.230
can get a link to it from the Google i/o
 

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:22.100
can get a link to it from the Google i/o

your images in the background thread use

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:32.580
your images in the background thread use
 

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.510
your images in the background thread use
async task or something similar also

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520
async task or something similar also
 

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.820
async task or something similar also
make sure that you're reusing all of

make sure that you're reusing all of

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:48.739
the word
make sure you will use those they do get

make sure you will use those they do get
 

00:38:48.749 --> 00:38:51.739
make sure you will use those they do get
recycled and just make sure that you

00:38:51.739 --> 00:38:51.749
recycled and just make sure that you
 

00:38:51.749 --> 00:38:54.259
recycled and just make sure that you
reuse object whenever possible

00:38:54.259 --> 00:38:54.269
reuse object whenever possible
 

00:38:54.269 --> 00:38:55.549
reuse object whenever possible
on that note make sure that your

with bitmaps apply there because there

00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:02.579
with bitmaps apply there because there
 

00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:04.729
with bitmaps apply there because there
they do take up a lot of memory and it's

00:39:04.729 --> 00:39:04.739
they do take up a lot of memory and it's
 

00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:07.430
they do take up a lot of memory and it's
very easy to mess up and cause calls

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440
very easy to mess up and cause calls
 

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.930
very easy to mess up and cause calls

objects we created when they don't need
 

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.099
objects we created when they don't need
to be and we've added a lot of hooks

00:39:10.099 --> 00:39:10.109
to be and we've added a lot of hooks
 

00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:12.349
to be and we've added a lot of hooks
there especially like I said that you

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359
there especially like I said that you
 

00:39:12.359 --> 00:39:15.319
there especially like I said that you
can recycle bitmaps and you know hang on

00:39:15.319 --> 00:39:15.329
can recycle bitmaps and you know hang on
 

00:39:15.329 --> 00:39:17.380
can recycle bitmaps and you know hang on
to things that way actually

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:17.390
to things that way actually
 

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.029
to things that way actually
recycling a bitmap actually gets rid of

00:39:20.029 --> 00:39:20.039
recycling a bitmap actually gets rid of
 

00:39:20.039 --> 00:39:22.969
recycling a bitmap actually gets rid of
it right Turner what the right way to do

00:39:22.969 --> 00:39:22.979
it right Turner what the right way to do
 

00:39:22.979 --> 00:39:25.940
it right Turner what the right way to do
it is by the view and what the right way

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:25.950
it is by the view and what the right way
 

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.249
it is by the view and what the right way
to handle bitmaps like we use the the

00:39:28.249 --> 00:39:28.259
to handle bitmaps like we use the the
 

00:39:28.259 --> 00:39:30.709
to handle bitmaps like we use the the
address space there for it I'm trying to

00:39:30.709 --> 00:39:30.719
address space there for it I'm trying to
 

00:39:30.719 --> 00:39:32.900
address space there for it I'm trying to
remember it I because there is like a

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:32.910
remember it I because there is like a
 

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.779
remember it I because there is like a
release method or a recycle right but I

00:39:35.779 --> 00:39:35.789
release method or a recycle right but I
 

00:39:35.789 --> 00:39:38.690
release method or a recycle right but I
don't think that's what recycling

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:38.700
don't think that's what recycling
 

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:44.749
don't think that's what recycling
actually completely gets rid of it but

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:44.759
actually completely gets rid of it but
 

00:39:44.759 --> 00:39:46.549
actually completely gets rid of it but
there is a method where you can pass it

00:39:46.549 --> 00:39:46.559
there is a method where you can pass it
 

00:39:46.559 --> 00:39:48.620
there is a method where you can pass it
in an existing instance into a bitmap

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:48.630
in an existing instance into a bitmap
 

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.420
in an existing instance into a bitmap
options as part of the inflate and

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:50.430
options as part of the inflate and
 

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:51.680
options as part of the inflate and
that's one of the that's the mechanism

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:51.690
that's one of the that's the mechanism
 

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:53.089
that's one of the that's the mechanism
that you're describing that would allow

00:39:53.089 --> 00:39:53.099
that you're describing that would allow
 

00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:55.729
that you're describing that would allow
you to recycle those existing

00:39:55.729 --> 00:39:55.739
you to recycle those existing
 

00:39:55.739 --> 00:39:58.279
you to recycle those existing
allocations right via the the biggest

00:39:58.279 --> 00:39:58.289
allocations right via the the biggest
 

00:39:58.289 --> 00:40:00.499
allocations right via the the biggest
takeaway though is avoid allocations

00:40:00.499 --> 00:40:00.509
takeaway though is avoid allocations
 

00:40:00.509 --> 00:40:02.599

and you can take a look in DDMS there is

00:40:09.259 --> 00:40:09.269
and you can take a look in DDMS there is
 

00:40:09.269 --> 00:40:10.579
and you can take a look in DDMS there is
an allocation track that will show you

should give you a pretty strong clue as
 

00:40:14.759 --> 00:40:20.769
should give you a pretty strong clue as

this well the answer is actually like

00:41:50.579 --> 00:41:50.589
this well the answer is actually like
 

00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:51.750
this well the answer is actually like
that in front of your face it was

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760
that in front of your face it was

review apps and if we notice that an app

00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720
review apps and if we notice that an app
 

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.170
review apps and if we notice that an app
has an incorrect lating its lated lower

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:01.180
has an incorrect lating its lated lower
 

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.760

than it should be we'll go and make a

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:02.770
than it should be we'll go and make a
 

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:04.170
than it should be we'll go and make a
manual adjustment and that's what you're

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:04.180
manual adjustment and that's what you're
 

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.150
manual adjustment and that's what you're
seeing there so basically they're saying

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160
seeing there so basically they're saying
 

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.700
seeing there so basically they're saying
your app contains some sort of content

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:08.710
your app contains some sort of content
 

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:10.710
your app contains some sort of content
that it makes it unsuitable for everyone

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720
that it makes it unsuitable for everyone
 

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.520
that it makes it unsuitable for everyone
and yeah in my experience the most

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:14.530
and yeah in my experience the most
 

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.470
and yeah in my experience the most
common cause for that is typically if

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480
common cause for that is typically if
 

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.150
common cause for that is typically if
you're using some sort of dual

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160
you're using some sort of dual
 

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.339
you're using some sort of dual

requesting file location in your app as
a permission then there is a minimum

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:22.930
a permission then there is a minimum
 

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:26.250
a permission then there is a minimum
level maturity level which it has to be

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:26.260
level maturity level which it has to be
 

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.380
level maturity level which it has to be
I think it's not the lowest possibly the

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:28.390
I think it's not the lowest possibly the
 

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.900
I think it's not the lowest possibly the
next up from that at least so that tends

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:30.910
next up from that at least so that tends
 

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:32.789
next up from that at least so that tends
to be the most common case it can also

00:42:32.789 --> 00:42:32.799
to be the most common case it can also
 

00:42:32.799 --> 00:42:34.470
to be the most common case it can also
be if there is you know if your apps

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480
be if there is you know if your apps
 

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.170

00:46:50.559 --> 00:46:50.569
 

00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:54.440
okay I think the simple answer for me is

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:54.450
okay I think the simple answer for me is
 

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.690
okay I think the simple answer for me is
to try and use an action bar where

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700
to try and use an action bar where
 

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.250
to try and use an action bar where
possible because that's gonna already

00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:58.260
possible because that's gonna already
 

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.010
possible because that's gonna already
have that sort of toggle between you

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020
have that sort of toggle between you
 

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.200
have that sort of toggle between you
know a navigation in so it's gonna be a

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:03.210
know a navigation in so it's gonna be a
 

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:04.700
know a navigation in so it's gonna be a
drop down navigation in portrait mode

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:04.710
drop down navigation in portrait mode
 

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.940
drop down navigation in portrait mode
and sort of in action bar tabs

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:06.950
and sort of in action bar tabs
 

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.589
and sort of in action bar tabs
potentially in in landscape mode so you

00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599
potentially in in landscape mode so you
 

00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:12.819
potentially in in landscape mode so you
can sort of do that variation yourself

00:47:12.819 --> 00:47:12.829
can sort of do that variation yourself
 

00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:15.349
can sort of do that variation yourself
it doesn't necessarily help you for if

00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359
it doesn't necessarily help you for if
 

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:16.910
it doesn't necessarily help you for if
you want to have apps which work prior

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920
you want to have apps which work prior
 

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:20.420
you want to have apps which work prior
to honeycomb mind you but you can

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:20.430
to honeycomb mind you but you can
 

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:21.920
to honeycomb mind you but you can
certainly try and use that same sort of

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:21.930
certainly try and use that same sort of
 

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.190
certainly try and use that same sort of
model in general my feeling is that your

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200
model in general my feeling is that your
 

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.390
model in general my feeling is that your
your tab host control isn't great but I

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400
your tab host control isn't great but I
 

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.190
your tab host control isn't great but I
mean this is talking about action bar

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200
mean this is talking about action bar
 

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.559
mean this is talking about action bar
tabs in general so yeah okay so it's

00:47:33.559 --> 00:47:33.569
tabs in general so yeah okay so it's
 

00:47:33.569 --> 00:47:35.059
tabs in general so yeah okay so it's
specific to action bar tab so that would

00:47:35.059 --> 00:47:35.069
specific to action bar tab so that would
 

00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:36.589
specific to action bar tab so that would

detail the the other thing he was

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:43.770
detail the the other thing he was
 

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:45.589
detail the the other thing he was
mentioning is that it's designed to be

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599
mentioning is that it's designed to be
 

00:48:45.599 --> 00:48:48.349
mentioning is that it's designed to be
generated once so he's pre generating a

00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359

okay it was in the on Crete in the open

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:58.050
okay it was in the on Crete in the open
 

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:02.150
okay it was in the on Crete in the open
helper okay you should be able to i/o so

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160
helper okay you should be able to i/o so
 

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.800
helper okay you should be able to i/o so
if it's in the oncreate you yeah you're

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:03.810
if it's in the oncreate you yeah you're
 

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:05.000
if it's in the oncreate you yeah you're
right you may already be in a

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:05.010
right you may already be in a
 

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:07.280
right you may already be in a
transaction at that point on so if

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:07.290
transaction at that point on so if
 

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:09.470

you're looking to test performance it

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480
you're looking to test performance it
 

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.540
you're looking to test performance it
should be as as good as it's going to

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:11.550
should be as as good as it's going to
 

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:13.520
should be as as good as it's going to
get on the one of the thing to

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:13.530
get on the one of the thing to
 

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.620
get on the one of the thing to
potentially look at is when you're doing

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:15.630
potentially look at is when you're doing
 

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:17.390
potentially look at is when you're doing
that initial database setup I mean

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400
that initial database setup I mean
 

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.339
that initial database setup I mean
you're inserting a lot of data in a bulk

00:49:19.339 --> 00:49:19.349
you're inserting a lot of data in a bulk
 

00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:21.650
you're inserting a lot of data in a bulk
way you may look at I creating your

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660
way you may look at I creating your
 

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.990
way you may look at I creating your
indexes after you've inserted all of the

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000
indexes after you've inserted all of the
 

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.089
indexes after you've inserted all of the
data if you create the indexes and then

00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099
data if you create the indexes and then
 

00:49:26.099 --> 00:49:27.829
data if you create the indexes and then
do a whole bunch of inserts on the

00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839
do a whole bunch of inserts on the
 

00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:29.390
do a whole bunch of inserts on the
database is going to may try updating

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400
database is going to may try updating
 

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.640
database is going to may try updating
those indexes as you're inserting all of

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:31.650
those indexes as you're inserting all of
 

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:33.020
those indexes as you're inserting all of
your data but if you insert the data

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:33.030
your data but if you insert the data
 

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:35.690
your data but if you insert the data
first and then create the indexes you

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:35.700
first and then create the indexes you
 

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.849
first and then create the indexes you
may end up with less work on the

00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:37.859
may end up with less work on the
 

00:49:37.859 --> 00:49:39.349
may end up with less work on the
database engine side of things so it may

00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359
database engine side of things so it may
 

00:49:39.359 --> 00:49:46.400
database engine side of things so it may
be faster okay any response from them he

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:46.410
be faster okay any response from them he
 

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:49.040
be faster okay any response from them he
said thanks okay well I don't got any

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:49.050
said thanks okay well I don't got any
 

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.560
said thanks okay well I don't got any
more questions yeah just holler out

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:51.570
more questions yeah just holler out
 

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:53.210
more questions yeah just holler out
otherwise we'll move on to the next

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220
otherwise we'll move on to the next
 

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.470
otherwise we'll move on to the next
question and moderator

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480
question and moderator
 

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.020
question and moderator
um I have to load an image with certain

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:57.030
um I have to load an image with certain
 

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.450
um I have to load an image with certain
restrictions for example I have an 8

00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460
restrictions for example I have an 8
 

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.940
restrictions for example I have an 8
megapixel picture that I want to send a

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:01.950
megapixel picture that I want to send a
 

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:04.910
megapixel picture that I want to send a
crop as a square rotate and maybe scale

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920
crop as a square rotate and maybe scale
 

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.950
crop as a square rotate and maybe scale
it what's the most efficient way to do

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960
it what's the most efficient way to do
 

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.900
it what's the most efficient way to do
this without creating new bitmaps and

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:08.910
this without creating new bitmaps and
 

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:15.290
this without creating new bitmaps and
recycling the old one all right that's

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:15.300
recycling the old one all right that's
 

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.000
recycling the old one all right that's
so that's actually a pretty good

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:17.010
so that's actually a pretty good
 

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.040
so that's actually a pretty good
question yeah Jeff you don't have an

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:19.050
question yeah Jeff you don't have an
 

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.120
question yeah Jeff you don't have an
answer off the top of your head for that

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:20.130
answer off the top of your head for that
 

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:23.390
answer off the top of your head for that
um so I think it depends on your zoom

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400
um so I think it depends on your zoom
 

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.370
um so I think it depends on your zoom
mean if the user can zoom in on the the

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380
mean if the user can zoom in on the the
 

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.559
mean if the user can zoom in on the the
photo and while they're actually working

00:50:27.559 --> 00:50:27.569
photo and while they're actually working
 

00:50:27.569 --> 00:50:29.420
photo and while they're actually working
on it because there are some eyes so the

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:29.430
on it because there are some eyes so the
 

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:30.980
on it because there are some eyes so the
8 megapixel that's a lot of data behind

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:30.990
8 megapixel that's a lot of data behind
 

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:32.240
8 megapixel that's a lot of data behind
the scenes so there's a handful of

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:32.250
the scenes so there's a handful of
 

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:35.120
the scenes so there's a handful of
bitmapfactory the bitmap options you can

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:35.130
bitmapfactory the bitmap options you can
 

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:38.089
bitmapfactory the bitmap options you can
actually request to have it down sampled

00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:38.099
actually request to have it down sampled
 

00:50:38.099 --> 00:50:40.370
actually request to have it down sampled
so you can request it to maybe only load

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380
so you can request it to maybe only load
 

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.200
so you can request it to maybe only load
every other pixel so instead of a an 8

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:42.210
every other pixel so instead of a an 8
 

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:43.790
every other pixel so instead of a an 8
megapixel photo now you're working with

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800
megapixel photo now you're working with
 

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.220
megapixel photo now you're working with
a 4 megapixel so there's some options

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:46.230
a 4 megapixel so there's some options
 

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:47.569
a 4 megapixel so there's some options
there that you can load a lower

00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579
there that you can load a lower
 

00:50:47.579 --> 00:50:49.579
there that you can load a lower
resolution version of the photo for the

00:50:49.579 --> 00:50:49.589
resolution version of the photo for the
 

00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:51.470
resolution version of the photo for the
user to edit it may not be the full

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480
user to edit it may not be the full
 

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.839
user to edit it may not be the full
quality that they're expecting on the VB

00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:53.849
quality that they're expecting on the VB
 

00:50:53.849 --> 00:50:56.059
quality that they're expecting on the VB
lower resolution once you've decided the

00:50:56.059 --> 00:50:56.069
lower resolution once you've decided the
 

00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:57.470
lower resolution once you've decided the
mutation operations that the user wants

00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480
mutation operations that the user wants
 

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.910
mutation operations that the user wants
to perform once they've chosen like the

00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920
to perform once they've chosen like the
 

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.710
to perform once they've chosen like the
exact rotation you can go back and

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720
exact rotation you can go back and
 

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.190
exact rotation you can go back and
perform a high-quality pass

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200
perform a high-quality pass
 

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.600
perform a high-quality pass
of those operations on the full

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:03.610
of those operations on the full
 

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:05.430
of those operations on the full
resolution photo so that may allow you

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440
resolution photo so that may allow you
 

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.870
resolution photo so that may allow you
to make your UI nice and fast you're

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880
to make your UI nice and fast you're
 

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.940
to make your UI nice and fast you're
maybe rotating and manipulating

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:08.950
maybe rotating and manipulating
 

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:11.190
maybe rotating and manipulating
something lower quality but then

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200
something lower quality but then
 

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.490
something lower quality but then
applying it as a planet later against

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:14.500
applying it as a planet later against
 

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.170
applying it as a planet later against
the full resolution image that seems

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:16.180
the full resolution image that seems
 

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:17.340
the full resolution image that seems
like it will be a fairly good approach

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:17.350
like it will be a fairly good approach
 

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:18.630
like it will be a fairly good approach
for what they're describing here because

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640
for what they're describing here because
 

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.940
for what they're describing here because
it's it's fairly coarse grained stuff so

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:20.950
it's it's fairly coarse grained stuff so
 

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:22.680
it's it's fairly coarse grained stuff so
sent to crops where it rotate so it

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:22.690
sent to crops where it rotate so it
 

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:24.570
sent to crops where it rotate so it
sounds like they just basically want to

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:24.580
sounds like they just basically want to
 

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.070
sounds like they just basically want to
be able to load up any picture and in

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:26.080
be able to load up any picture and in
 

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.830
be able to load up any picture and in
the same way that you choose like a

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:27.840
the same way that you choose like a
 

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.180
the same way that you choose like a
profile pic or something in a social

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:30.190
profile pic or something in a social
 

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:31.770
profile pic or something in a social
network you just needed to be square so

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:31.780
network you just needed to be square so
 

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.510
network you just needed to be square so
you just pick it I think in that

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520
you just pick it I think in that
 

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.100
you just pick it I think in that

you know even if you are zooming in as

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:37.450
you know even if you are zooming in as
 

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:38.970
you know even if you are zooming in as
long as it's sort of good enough to see

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:38.980
long as it's sort of good enough to see
 

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.770
long as it's sort of good enough to see
what the what the edges are you can do

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:40.780
what the what the edges are you can do
 

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.450
what the what the edges are you can do
that and then do like a live preview of

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:42.460
that and then do like a live preview of
 

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.150
that and then do like a live preview of
the crop data at a higher res maybe yeah

00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:45.160
the crop data at a higher res maybe yeah
 

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.280
the crop data at a higher res maybe yeah
and yeah bitmap factory has methods to

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:47.290
and yeah bitmap factory has methods to
 

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:49.080
and yeah bitmap factory has methods to
do most of that stuff the only one I'm

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:49.090
do most of that stuff the only one I'm
 

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:50.970
do most of that stuff the only one I'm
not clear about is rotation I'm not sure

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:50.980
not clear about is rotation I'm not sure
 

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.700
not clear about is rotation I'm not sure
if you can have it rotate for you if

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:53.710
if you can have it rotate for you if
 

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:55.260
if you can have it rotate for you if
that's the case you might even want to

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:55.270
that's the case you might even want to
 

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:56.880
that's the case you might even want to
consider sub-classing but not factory

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:56.890
consider sub-classing but not factory
 

00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:58.890
consider sub-classing but not factory
and adding rotation in there so that way

00:51:58.890 --> 00:51:58.900
and adding rotation in there so that way
 

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.660
and adding rotation in there so that way
all these operations are performed as

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:00.670
all these operations are performed as
 

00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:03.000
all these operations are performed as
you're loading the bitmap and that that

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:03.010
you're loading the bitmap and that that
 

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:05.430
you're loading the bitmap and that that
would help reduce than that yeah if you

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440
would help reduce than that yeah if you
 

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.570
would help reduce than that yeah if you
can do before you create your bitmap

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:06.580
can do before you create your bitmap
 

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.190
can do before you create your bitmap
then you only have to click one bitmap

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:08.200
then you only have to click one bitmap
 

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.500
then you only have to click one bitmap
yeah the benefit of using those those

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:10.510
yeah the benefit of using those those
 

00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:13.170
yeah the benefit of using those those
options is that skia down deep in the

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:13.180
options is that skia down deep in the
 

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:14.460
options is that skia down deep in the
native code is the one that's doing this

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:14.470
native code is the one that's doing this
 

00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:16.590
native code is the one that's doing this
down sampling so your your application

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:16.600
down sampling so your your application
 

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.510
down sampling so your your application
doesn't have to allocate 8 megapixels

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520
doesn't have to allocate 8 megapixels
 

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.430
doesn't have to allocate 8 megapixels

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:17.910
 

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:19.859
it's gonna be a bit of a tough sell

00:53:19.859 --> 00:53:19.869
it's gonna be a bit of a tough sell
 

00:53:19.869 --> 00:53:21.780

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.140
like to see us do a hangout or something
like this specifically so you guys can

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:37.150
like this specifically so you guys can
 

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:39.300
like this specifically so you guys can
talk to them let us know and we will

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:39.310
talk to them let us know and we will
 

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:42.089
talk to them let us know and we will
schedule something up so yeah that is a

00:53:42.089 --> 00:53:42.099
schedule something up so yeah that is a
 

00:53:42.099 --> 00:53:44.339
schedule something up so yeah that is a
resource available we're not part of

00:53:44.339 --> 00:53:44.349
resource available we're not part of
 

00:53:44.349 --> 00:53:45.900
resource available we're not part of
that team so we aren't necessarily but

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:45.910
that team so we aren't necessarily but
 

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:47.370
that team so we aren't necessarily but
yeah the best position to answer those

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:47.380
yeah the best position to answer those
 

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:52.380
yeah the best position to answer those
sorts of questions all right we're

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:52.390
sorts of questions all right we're
 

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:54.359
sorts of questions all right we're
getting towards the end so let's move on

00:53:54.359 --> 00:53:54.369
getting towards the end so let's move on
 

00:53:54.369 --> 00:53:56.099
getting towards the end so let's move on
through as quickly as we can did the

00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:56.109
through as quickly as we can did the
 

00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:58.440
through as quickly as we can did the
Nexus S have it's offline voice

00:53:58.440 --> 00:53:58.450
Nexus S have it's offline voice
 

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:00.410
Nexus S have it's offline voice
dictation and hot work detection

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:00.420

audio hardware if so what are your

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:05.890
audio hardware if so what are your
 

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:07.950
audio hardware if so what are your
guidelines for testing if device is for

00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:07.960
guidelines for testing if device is for
 

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.390
guidelines for testing if device is for
running for that one to meet the

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400
running for that one to meet the
 

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.390
running for that one to meet the
baseline for using the relevant new

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400
baseline for using the relevant new
 

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.960
baseline for using the relevant new
multimedia ap is I don't think anybody

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:15.970
multimedia ap is I don't think anybody
 

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:17.670
multimedia ap is I don't think anybody
knows the answer to that given that none

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680
knows the answer to that given that none
 

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.520
knows the answer to that given that none
of us work on the voiced V for the voice

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:20.530
of us work on the voiced V for the voice
 

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:24.030
of us work on the voiced V for the voice
team so this is probably a question

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.040
team so this is probably a question
 

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.130
team so this is probably a question
better suited for another office hours

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:26.140
better suited for another office hours
 

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.109
better suited for another office hours
we might have somebody from the worst

00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:28.119
we might have somebody from the worst
 

00:54:28.119 --> 00:54:30.900
we might have somebody from the worst
team on but like now we have no expert

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:30.910
team on but like now we have no expert
 

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:31.920
team on but like now we have no expert
to can actually give you a definitive

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:31.930
to can actually give you a definitive
 

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:36.660
to can actually give you a definitive
answer there yeah go for it

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:36.670
answer there yeah go for it
 

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:39.560
answer there yeah go for it
it's about location updates in a service

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:39.570
it's about location updates in a service
 

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:42.839
it's about location updates in a service
is it better battery wise to sample

00:54:42.839 --> 00:54:42.849
is it better battery wise to sample
 

00:54:42.849 --> 00:54:45.510
is it better battery wise to sample
updates from network or passive

00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520
updates from network or passive
 

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.900
updates from network or passive
providers on an interval or register on

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:48.910
providers on an interval or register on
 

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:51.839
providers on an interval or register on
start a listener or pending intent and

00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:51.849
start a listener or pending intent and
 

00:54:51.849 --> 00:54:54.150
start a listener or pending intent and
depend on the request updates parameters

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160
depend on the request updates parameters
 

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:58.890
depend on the request updates parameters
for a min time and man distance okay so

00:54:58.890 --> 00:54:58.900
for a min time and man distance okay so
 

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.660
for a min time and man distance okay so
let me see if I understand this so the

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:00.670
let me see if I understand this so the
 

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:02.970
let me see if I understand this so the
question is are they better off polling

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:02.980
question is are they better off polling
 

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:05.040
question is are they better off polling
so basically getting a lot get

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:05.050
so basically getting a lot get
 

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:10.260
so basically getting a lot get
last-known location or using a we're

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:10.270
last-known location or using a we're
 

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:12.240
last-known location or using a we're
basically asking for location-based

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:12.250
basically asking for location-based
 

00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.770
basically asking for location-based
updates at a minimum time and distance

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:13.780
updates at a minimum time and distance
 

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:19.050
updates at a minimum time and distance
is that the gist yeah so when I remember

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:19.060
is that the gist yeah so when I remember
 

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.599
is that the gist yeah so when I remember
guest la get last position is literally

00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:21.609
guest la get last position is literally
 

00:55:21.609 --> 00:55:23.220
guest la get last position is literally
returning the last known position which

00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:23.230
returning the last known position which
 

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:24.920
returning the last known position which
is not gonna be where the user is that

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:24.930
is not gonna be where the user is that
 

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:27.420
is not gonna be where the user is that
necessarily at that given moment so that

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:27.430
necessarily at that given moment so that
 

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:28.680
necessarily at that given moment so that
is one issue you have to deal with

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:28.690
is one issue you have to deal with
 

00:55:28.690 --> 00:55:30.950
is one issue you have to deal with
but I would say Jen I mean in terms of

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960
but I would say Jen I mean in terms of
 

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:36.030
but I would say Jen I mean in terms of
terms of efficiency hmm so in terms of

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:36.040
terms of efficiency hmm so in terms of
 

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.559
terms of efficiency hmm so in terms of
efficiency I would almost never

00:55:37.559 --> 00:55:37.569
efficiency I would almost never
 

00:55:37.569 --> 00:55:41.220
efficiency I would almost never
recommend a poling approach they just it

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:41.230
recommend a poling approach they just it
 

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:42.930
recommend a poling approach they just it
as soon as you're polling for anything

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:42.940
as soon as you're polling for anything
 

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.910
as soon as you're polling for anything
then you'll be creating a minimum amount

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:44.920
then you'll be creating a minimum amount
 

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.230
then you'll be creating a minimum amount
of time where the device is going to be

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240
of time where the device is going to be
 

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.180
of time where the device is going to be
on responding to whatever it is that

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:48.190
on responding to whatever it is that
 

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:50.849
on responding to whatever it is that
you're doing at that wake up so if you

00:55:50.849 --> 00:55:50.859
you're doing at that wake up so if you
 

00:55:50.859 --> 00:55:52.050
you're doing at that wake up so if you
can have anything which is more

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:52.060
can have anything which is more
 

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.579
can have anything which is more
on-demand that tends to be a better

00:55:53.579 --> 00:55:53.589
on-demand that tends to be a better
 

00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:56.819
on-demand that tends to be a better
solution so I I would yeah I would

00:55:56.819 --> 00:55:56.829
solution so I I would yeah I would
 

00:55:56.829 --> 00:55:58.470
solution so I I would yeah I would
definitely go with actually creating a

00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480
definitely go with actually creating a
 

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.630
definitely go with actually creating a
location listener particularly for

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640
location listener particularly for
 

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.329
location listener particularly for
passive provider that way if there are

00:56:03.329 --> 00:56:03.339
passive provider that way if there are
 

00:56:03.339 --> 00:56:07.109
passive provider that way if there are
no apps requesting location updates then

00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119
no apps requesting location updates then
 

00:56:07.119 --> 00:56:09.210
no apps requesting location updates then
your app will never get triggered so it

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:09.220
your app will never get triggered so it
 

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.710
your app will never get triggered so it
will go to sleep and so this is really

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720
will go to sleep and so this is really
 

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.109
will go to sleep and so this is really
important when the device is on standby

00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119
important when the device is on standby
 

00:56:13.119 --> 00:56:14.910
important when the device is on standby
so if you are doing a polling solution

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:14.920
so if you are doing a polling solution
 

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:15.750
so if you are doing a polling solution
then you're still going to wake the

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760
then you're still going to wake the
 

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.040
then you're still going to wake the
device and you're still going to check

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:17.050
device and you're still going to check
 

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:18.930
device and you're still going to check
to see when what that last location

00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:18.940
to see when what that last location
 

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.089
to see when what that last location
update was even if it hasn't changed for

00:56:21.089 --> 00:56:21.099
update was even if it hasn't changed for
 

00:56:21.099 --> 00:56:22.950
update was even if it hasn't changed for
an hour whereas you actually got a

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960
an hour whereas you actually got a
 

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.359
an hour whereas you actually got a
listener registered it's no less

00:56:24.359 --> 00:56:24.369
listener registered it's no less
 

00:56:24.369 --> 00:56:26.550
listener registered it's no less
efficient than polling in terms of the

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:26.560
efficient than polling in terms of the
 

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.170
efficient than polling in terms of the
work it's doing and you had the

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:28.180
work it's doing and you had the
 

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.120
work it's doing and you had the
advantage of being on demand so that you

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:30.130
advantage of being on demand so that you
 

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:31.140
advantage of being on demand so that you
know it's only gonna happen as

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:31.150
know it's only gonna happen as
 

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:33.089
know it's only gonna happen as
frequently as any other app is actually

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:33.099
frequently as any other app is actually
 

00:56:33.099 --> 00:56:37.640
frequently as any other app is actually
making those location requests okay

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:37.650
making those location requests okay
 

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:41.609
making those location requests okay
thank you um this is an interesting one

00:56:41.609 --> 00:56:41.619
thank you um this is an interesting one
 

00:56:41.619 --> 00:56:43.290
thank you um this is an interesting one
can you take another look at my question

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:43.300
can you take another look at my question
 

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.240
can you take another look at my question
from last week ran out of time at the

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:45.250
from last week ran out of time at the
 

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:47.339
from last week ran out of time at the
end question is how to iterate through

00:56:47.339 --> 00:56:47.349
end question is how to iterate through
 

00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:49.410
end question is how to iterate through
fragments in a tabbed view pager to tell

00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:49.420
fragments in a tabbed view pager to tell
 

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.150
fragments in a tabbed view pager to tell
each fragment the paint data which has

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:51.160
each fragment the paint data which has
 

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.890
each fragment the paint data which has
been updated by a loader in the main

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:52.900
been updated by a loader in the main
 

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:57.720
been updated by a loader in the main
activity I might be hearing that

00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:57.730
activity I might be hearing that
 

00:56:57.730 --> 00:56:59.700
activity I might be hearing that
question last week following their

00:56:59.700 --> 00:56:59.710
question last week following their
 

00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:01.650
question last week following their
production I don't I don't think we had

00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:01.660
production I don't I don't think we had
 

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:03.510
production I don't I don't think we had
a great answer then and I'm not sure

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520
a great answer then and I'm not sure
 

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.609
a great answer then and I'm not sure
that there really is one yeah I I still

00:57:05.609 --> 00:57:05.619
that there really is one yeah I I still
 

00:57:05.619 --> 00:57:07.770
that there really is one yeah I I still
my question is why are you trying to do

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:07.780
my question is why are you trying to do
 

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.200
my question is why are you trying to do
this given that you're only gonna have

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:10.210
this given that you're only gonna have
 

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:14.190
this given that you're only gonna have
one one page on your view pager visible

five minutes I don't think if you I
don't think viewpager really has

anything to do with it it's really a
 

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:40.559
anything to do with it it's really a

kind of so data set observer is one way

00:57:59.580 --> 00:57:59.590
kind of so data set observer is one way

kind of so data set observer is one way
that list views for example connect up

that list views for example connect up
 

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.720
that list views for example connect up
to cursors so when you assign a cursor

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:03.730
to cursors so when you assign a cursor
 

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:05.250
to cursors so when you assign a cursor
to a cursor loader and it's bound to a

person has quite a big database of

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:33.550
person has quite a big database of
 

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:37.830
person has quite a big database of
assets and dumps it into an SD card is

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:37.840
assets and dumps it into an SD card is
 

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.530
assets and dumps it into an SD card is
there a way to access this database

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540
there a way to access this database
 

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:42.690
there a way to access this database
directly to assets so I don't have to

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:42.700
directly to assets so I don't have to
 

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:44.700
directly to assets so I don't have to
duplicate it since it's like six

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:44.710
duplicate it since it's like six
 

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:48.690
duplicate it since it's like six
megabytes does that make sense yes I

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:48.700
megabytes does that make sense yes I
 

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.220
megabytes does that make sense yes I
think what he wants to do here is

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:50.230
think what he wants to do here is
 

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:53.010
think what he wants to do here is
basically similar to the question which

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:53.020
basically similar to the question which
 

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:55.500
basically similar to the question which
one of the earlier question is had which

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:55.510
one of the earlier question is had which
 

00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:57.990
one of the earlier question is had which
is I want a pre-populated database but I

00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000
is I want a pre-populated database but I
 

00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.550
is I want a pre-populated database but I
don't you know I don't want to download

00:58:59.550 --> 00:58:59.560
don't you know I don't want to download
 

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.830
don't you know I don't want to download
it you know piecemeal I just want to be

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:01.840
it you know piecemeal I just want to be
 

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.660
it you know piecemeal I just want to be
able to dump it on an SD card possibly

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:03.670
able to dump it on an SD card possibly
 

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:05.280
able to dump it on an SD card possibly
as part of the installation process or

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:05.290
as part of the installation process or
 

00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:07.470
as part of the installation process or
as a one-off and right now you would

00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480
as a one-off and right now you would
 

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:10.020
as a one-off and right now you would
have to do all the usual ways that you

00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:10.030
have to do all the usual ways that you
 

00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:11.370
have to do all the usual ways that you
would then have to open that database

00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:11.380
would then have to open that database
 

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.920
would then have to open that database
move everything into an SQLite database

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:13.930
move everything into an SQLite database
 

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:15.660
move everything into an SQLite database
and have the content provider on top of

00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:15.670
and have the content provider on top of
 

00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:17.580
and have the content provider on top of
that to do most operations so I think

00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:17.590
that to do most operations so I think
 

00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:19.680
that to do most operations so I think
the question here is is there a way you

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:19.690
the question here is is there a way you
 

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:22.080
the question here is is there a way you
can just point to that database and say

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:22.090
can just point to that database and say
 

00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:24.240
can just point to that database and say
this is my database treated the same way

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:24.250
this is my database treated the same way
 

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:25.920
this is my database treated the same way
you would an SQLite database that you

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:25.930
you would an SQLite database that you
 

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:30.270
you would an SQLite database that you
had opened so I'm not sure I'm not sure

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280
had opened so I'm not sure I'm not sure
 

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.290
had opened so I'm not sure I'm not sure
that I have an answer I think if it is

00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:31.300
that I have an answer I think if it is
 

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:33.510
that I have an answer I think if it is
an SQLite database then you probably can

00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520
an SQLite database then you probably can
 

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:37.350
an SQLite database then you probably can
if it's not and I'm not sure that that's

00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:37.360
if it's not and I'm not sure that that's
 

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.450
if it's not and I'm not sure that that's
I think do you guys have any so single

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:39.460
I think do you guys have any so single
 

00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.680
I think do you guys have any so single
life databases I think you can open

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:40.690
life databases I think you can open
 

00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:42.600
life databases I think you can open
based on an explicit file system path we

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:42.610
based on an explicit file system path we
 

00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:44.520
based on an explicit file system path we
could tell it opens file but what thing

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:44.530
could tell it opens file but what thing
 

00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:47.010
could tell it opens file but what thing
one thing to note is that I if it's

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:47.020
one thing to note is that I if it's
 

00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:48.780
one thing to note is that I if it's
living out on the SD card on anyone

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:48.790
living out on the SD card on anyone
 

00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:51.030
living out on the SD card on anyone
could come along open it right a bowl

00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.040
could come along open it right a bowl
 

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:53.790
could come along open it right a bowl
and write all any sort of data in there

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:53.800
and write all any sort of data in there
 

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.230

so anything on the SD card is is

00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:56.680
so anything on the SD card is is

want to emphasize that that first point

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:26.770
want to emphasize that that first point
 

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:29.040
want to emphasize that that first point
