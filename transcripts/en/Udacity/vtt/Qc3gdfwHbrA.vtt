00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.880
Alright, so how are we going to figure this out?

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.750
&gt;&gt; By you letting them figure it out while I figure it out.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.860
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.810
I think you should figure this out.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.220
&gt;&gt; Okay let's figure it out.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.450
&gt;&gt; It might not be obvious just looking at it blankly so why don't

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.129
we just throw in some values here. So, for example we can do this.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.535
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:18.930
&gt;&gt; Which is, it gets filled in

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.390
in both places. So the probability that thunder

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.670
is true given that lightning is false and storm is true, what is that number?

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.550
&gt;&gt; Well,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.350
so we just have to find the place in our

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.150
little eight-row table where lightning is false and storm is true.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.460
&gt;&gt; Lightning is false and storm is true, uh-huh.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.540
&gt;&gt; Which is there.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.601
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:41.410
&gt;&gt; And the probability that thunder is true is 0.04 divided by

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.760
0.4. Oh cause we're asking about thunder right. Was what's the probability that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.650
thunder is true given that the other two things lightning is false and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.410
storm is true so that's going to be divided by the point 4.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.520
That's the setting that we're in.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.460
&gt;&gt; Right and Point 04 divided by point 4 is point 1

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.830
&gt;&gt; Right so maybe we'll get lucky and it will work out the same

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.790
with the other one. So where do we have to look for that one?

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.230
&gt;&gt; Well now we have to look in the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.860
row where lightning has false and storm is false.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.090
&gt;&gt; Okay. Down here.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.990
&gt;&gt; And look at the case where thunder is true,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.003
and that's .03. .03 divided by .3 which is also .1.

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:16.820
&gt;&gt; Woo hoo! So that works as an answer. It turns out that, in fact,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.300
no matter what you type into these two boxes, it

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.860
does, in fact, work. And what does that tell us?

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.750
&gt;&gt; Well, it tells us that it doesn't

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.710
matter what the value of storm is. We can

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.630
figure out the value of thunder by only looking

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.380
at the value of lightening. So, that is to

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.000
say, that the probability of thunder given lightning

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.160
and storm is equal to the probability of thunder

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.660
given lightening or that we have conditionally independent variables.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.090
Yes, that's right. Storm is conditionally independent of thunder,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.630
given lightning.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.375
&gt;&gt; Right. So, the probability of thunder giving

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:47.130
li-, given lightning and storm, is equal to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.760
the probability of thunder, given lightning. That means

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.930
that thunder and storm are conditionally independent, given lightning.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.150
&gt;&gt; Or thunders conditionally independent of storm, given lightning.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.720
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.590
&gt;&gt; Very good. Alright. So now what we're going to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.500
do next is say, Okay well given that we

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.630
have this nice property. And yeah, I, I worked

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.780
a little bit to make sure that the numbers,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.530
worked out. It doesn't always happen this way,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.560
but here we had some nice conditional independence and

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.000
what, we're going to do next is look

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.560
at a nice representation of that, kind of information.
