you can just get the get the demo

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920
you can just get the get the demo
 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.100
you can just get the get the demo
project from the SDK and just look at

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110
project from the SDK and just look at
 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.330
project from the SDK and just look at
the code from them okay and I think with

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340
the code from them okay and I think with
 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.200
the code from them okay and I think with
that we can dive into our first topic so

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210
that we can dive into our first topic so
 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.720
that we can dive into our first topic so
info windows I'm sure most of you have

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730
info windows I'm sure most of you have
 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.820
info windows I'm sure most of you have
have seen this before so an info window

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830
have seen this before so an info window
 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.190
have seen this before so an info window
it is basically a pop-up that's attached

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
it is basically a pop-up that's attached
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.010
it is basically a pop-up that's attached
to a marker so and when you click on a

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020
to a marker so and when you click on a
 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.230
to a marker so and when you click on a
marker that's when the info window pops

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240
marker that's when the info window pops
 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.050
marker that's when the info window pops
up and one thing he'd remember I said

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060
up and one thing he'd remember I said
 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.550
up and one thing he'd remember I said
you can only have one info window at a

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560
you can only have one info window at a
 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.440
you can only have one info window at a
time you tap on a marker and you get one

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450
time you tap on a marker and you get one
 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.650
time you tap on a marker and you get one
of these pop-ups um so let's have a

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660
of these pop-ups um so let's have a
 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.080
of these pop-ups um so let's have a
little this we look at the demo there

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090
little this we look at the demo there
 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.450
little this we look at the demo there
are different types of info witness you

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460
are different types of info witness you
 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.820
are different types of info witness you
can set up so you tap on it and you get

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830
can set up so you tap on it and you get
 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.190
can set up so you tap on it and you get
that was it afford implement you can get

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200
that was it afford implement you can get
 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.770
that was it afford implement you can get
is a custom infowindow contents and you

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780
is a custom infowindow contents and you
 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.330
is a custom infowindow contents and you
can also have a complete custom

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340
can also have a complete custom
 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.030
can also have a complete custom
infowindow and we're going to talk about

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040
infowindow and we're going to talk about
 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.620
infowindow and we're going to talk about
them in a bit more difficult now to show

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630
them in a bit more difficult now to show
 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.640
them in a bit more difficult now to show
you how you can actually go about

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650
you how you can actually go about
 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.520
you how you can actually go about
creating them and and setting them up so

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530

I might do is just play that one more

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860
I might do is just play that one more
 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.590
I might do is just play that one more
time because they go a little quickly

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600
time because they go a little quickly
 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.810
time because they go a little quickly
yeah well sure it's just rockness

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820
yeah well sure it's just rockness
 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.880
yeah well sure it's just rockness
through that video again could you yes

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890
through that video again could you yes
 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.220
through that video again could you yes
I'm sure so um so the first thing we

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230
I'm sure so um so the first thing we
 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.080
I'm sure so um so the first thing we
have a default info when we have a title

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090
have a default info when we have a title
 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.540
have a default info when we have a title
on the snippet then we have a custom for

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550
on the snippet then we have a custom for
 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.340
on the snippet then we have a custom for
content maybe have the it looks like a

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350
content maybe have the it looks like a
 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.870
content maybe have the it looks like a
normal infant window like the Ford one

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880
normal infant window like the Ford one
 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.270
normal infant window like the Ford one
but the other own content layout and

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280
but the other own content layout and
 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.910
but the other own content layout and
this is the custom interview where we

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920
this is the custom interview where we
 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.290
this is the custom interview where we
have our own layout of our own

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300
have our own layout of our own
 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.940
have our own layout of our own
background it's completely done done by

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950
background it's completely done done by
 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.830
background it's completely done done by
us but we have some more examples later

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840
us but we have some more examples later
 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.150
us but we have some more examples later
on in the presentation you can see

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160
on in the presentation you can see
 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.350
on in the presentation you can see
exactly what looks like and what the

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360
exactly what looks like and what the
 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.710
exactly what looks like and what the
differences are

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720
differences are
 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.240
differences are
so let's let's look at the let's look at

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250
so let's let's look at the let's look at
 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.460
so let's let's look at the let's look at
infinince in modulus as I said there

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470
infinince in modulus as I said there
 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.680
infinince in modulus as I said there
three different types default and the

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690
three different types default and the
 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.450
three different types default and the
default one is basically where you have

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460
default one is basically where you have
 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.460
default one is basically where you have
a title its snippet just basically this

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470
a title its snippet just basically this
 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.080
a title its snippet just basically this
plain text and you can't be the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090
plain text and you can't be the
 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.490
plain text and you can't be the
customers at any other way you can

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500
customers at any other way you can
 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.110
customers at any other way you can
specify tart you can specify snippet

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120
specify tart you can specify snippet
 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.680
specify tart you can specify snippet
when you tap on a marker that pops up

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690
when you tap on a marker that pops up
 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.030
when you tap on a marker that pops up
custom contents that's where you can

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040
custom contents that's where you can
 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.830
custom contents that's where you can
actually replace the content that goes

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840
actually replace the content that goes
 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.680
actually replace the content that goes
inside an info window so you keep the

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690
inside an info window so you keep the
 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.570
inside an info window so you keep the
bubble that's the default inframan oh

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580
bubble that's the default inframan oh
 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.280
bubble that's the default inframan oh
but you can actually put your layout in

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290
but you can actually put your layout in
 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.650
but you can actually put your layout in
there so you can arrange the text in any

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660
there so you can arrange the text in any
 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.090
there so you can arrange the text in any
way you want you put your views in there

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100
way you want you put your views in there
 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.430
way you want you put your views in there
and so on and a custom infowindow is

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440
and so on and a custom infowindow is
 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.050
and so on and a custom infowindow is
will be completely replaced the entire

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060
will be completely replaced the entire
 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.260
will be completely replaced the entire
info window since you can you know Kathy

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270
info window since you can you know Kathy
 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.520
info window since you can you know Kathy
on info bubble use your own background

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530
on info bubble use your own background
 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.440
on info bubble use your own background
and make it look and style how you want

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450
and make it look and style how you want
 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.840
and make it look and style how you want
it to look like so let's let's look at

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850
it to look like so let's let's look at
 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.370
it to look like so let's let's look at
let's start at the beginning that's

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380
let's start at the beginning that's
 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.710
let's start at the beginning that's
let's look at an example for one of

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720
let's look at an example for one of
 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.040
let's look at an example for one of
those default info windows on the next

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050
those default info windows on the next
 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.620
those default info windows on the next
slide and slide here basically all you

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630
slide and slide here basically all you
 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.240
slide and slide here basically all you
have to do is you have to add a marker

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250
have to do is you have to add a marker
 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.970
have to do is you have to add a marker
obviously I eif to set the position and

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980
obviously I eif to set the position and
 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.800
obviously I eif to set the position and
you just set a tight end of the snippet

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810
you just set a tight end of the snippet
 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.830
you just set a tight end of the snippet
and as soon as you set the title the the

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840
and as soon as you set the title the the
 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.540
and as soon as you set the title the the
map you knows that that you want to use

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550
map you knows that that you want to use
 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.210
map you knows that that you want to use
the default implementation of the info

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220
the default implementation of the info
 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.670
the default implementation of the info
window so in this case it automatically

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680
window so in this case it automatically
 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.620
window so in this case it automatically
notice that you have a title in bold and

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630
notice that you have a title in bold and
 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.200
notice that you have a title in bold and
you have a snippet there in the larger

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210
you have a snippet there in the larger
 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.790
you have a snippet there in the larger
gray color and that's that's all you

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800
gray color and that's that's all you
 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.260
gray color and that's that's all you
have to do and that's your default

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270
have to do and that's your default
 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.550
have to do and that's your default
implementation so it's really easy to

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560
implementation so it's really easy to
 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.050
implementation so it's really easy to
really easy to get started with that but

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060
really easy to get started with that but
 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.240
really easy to get started with that but
what if you want to do something a bit

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250
what if you want to do something a bit
 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.890
what if you want to do something a bit
more advanced and you want to put an

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900
more advanced and you want to put an
 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.900
more advanced and you want to put an
image in there you want to style text of

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910
image in there you want to style text of
 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.310
image in there you want to style text of
a different layer you also have

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320
a different layer you also have
 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.080
a different layer you also have
different text views in there you want

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090
different text views in there you want
 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.360
different text views in there you want
you want to update that's where the

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370
you want to update that's where the
 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.640
you want to update that's where the
custom content comes in and the basic

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650
custom content comes in and the basic
 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.010
custom content comes in and the basic
idea is that you keep the default in

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020
idea is that you keep the default in
 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.480
idea is that you keep the default in
favilla bubble so you have to worry

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490
favilla bubble so you have to worry
 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.670
favilla bubble so you have to worry
about adding you know adding the outline

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680
about adding you know adding the outline
 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.020
about adding you know adding the outline
toward making sure it's sent an all the

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030
toward making sure it's sent an all the
 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.969
toward making sure it's sent an all the
kind of stuff you just supply a view

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979
kind of stuff you just supply a view
 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.310
kind of stuff you just supply a view
layout that that's basically what's

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320
layout that that's basically what's
 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.219
layout that that's basically what's
thrown inside inside that info window so

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:46.229
thrown inside inside that info window so
 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:49.340
thrown inside inside that info window so
if you look at some code um let's let's

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350
if you look at some code um let's let's
 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.320
if you look at some code um let's let's
look at the layout so so basically what

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330
look at the layout so so basically what
 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.080
look at the layout so so basically what
what we're doing here is we are using

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090
what we're doing here is we are using
 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.230
what we're doing here is we are using
normal layouts xml file that you've used

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240
normal layouts xml file that you've used
 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.360
normal layouts xml file that you've used
before in this case you have a linear

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370
before in this case you have a linear
 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.100
before in this case you have a linear
layout and we haven't we have an image

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110
layout and we haven't we have an image
 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.480
layout and we haven't we have an image
view in there and then you have another

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490
view in there and then you have another
 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.060
view in there and then you have another
image sorry another linear layout of the

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070
image sorry another linear layout of the
 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.380
image sorry another linear layout of the
text for you and no text

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.390
text for you and no text
 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.690
text for you and no text
unit and basically all we're doing if

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700
unit and basically all we're doing if
 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.940
unit and basically all we're doing if
you go to the next slide is your basic

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:10.950
you go to the next slide is your basic
 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.460
you go to the next slide is your basic
isn't fair inflating that and returning

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470
isn't fair inflating that and returning
 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.890
isn't fair inflating that and returning
that and the way you go about this is by

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900
that and the way you go about this is by
 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.970
that and the way you go about this is by
using a an infowindow editor and then

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980
using a an infowindow editor and then
 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.010
using a an infowindow editor and then
you basically have to register this info

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020
you basically have to register this info
 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.780
you basically have to register this info
window at a democratic movement of them

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.790
window at a democratic movement of them
 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.600
window at a democratic movement of them
and basically there there are two

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610
and basically there there are two
 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.120
and basically there there are two
methods there is the get info contents

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.130
methods there is the get info contents
 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.760
methods there is the get info contents
and get info window when you just want

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:31.770
and get info window when you just want
 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.470
and get info window when you just want
to avoid the content office of it all

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.480
to avoid the content office of it all
 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.420
to avoid the content office of it all
you have to do is return the view you

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430
you have to do is return the view you
 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.250
you have to do is return the view you
want to go you want you want to have in

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.260
want to go you want you want to have in
 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.100
want to go you want you want to have in
in your info window and from the get

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110
in your info window and from the get
 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.680
in your info window and from the get
info contents method so whatever you

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:42.690
info contents method so whatever you
 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.150
info contents method so whatever you
want to put into the info window you

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160
want to put into the info window you
 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.740
want to put into the info window you
just have to return from get in for

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:45.750
just have to return from get in for
 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.990
just have to return from get in for
contents and in our case here the render

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000
contents and in our case here the render
 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.270
contents and in our case here the render
method that is not showing here all

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280
method that is not showing here all
 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.980
method that is not showing here all
you're doing this just inflating a

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:51.990
you're doing this just inflating a
 

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.470
you're doing this just inflating a
layout just just as usual you're setting

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:54.480
layout just just as usual you're setting
 

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.270
layout just just as usual you're setting
our text view we are updating the

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280
our text view we are updating the
 

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.220
our text view we are updating the
imageview setting the image and it's all

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:58.230
imageview setting the image and it's all
 

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.990
imageview setting the image and it's all
video then get us returning the view at

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000
video then get us returning the view at
 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.780
video then get us returning the view at
the end and that's how you can have a

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:02.790
the end and that's how you can have a
 

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.780
the end and that's how you can have a
custom custom content in the info window

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:05.790
custom custom content in the info window
 

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.330
custom custom content in the info window
um if you go to the next slide you can

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.340
um if you go to the next slide you can
 

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.760
um if you go to the next slide you can
see this a custom window and you can see

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:10.770
see this a custom window and you can see
 

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.410
see this a custom window and you can see
the fruit of a gradient in the

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:12.420
the fruit of a gradient in the
 

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.940
the fruit of a gradient in the
background so the included gradient

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:13.950
background so the included gradient
 

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.670
background so the included gradient
infinitely the corners around as well

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680
infinitely the corners around as well
 

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.620
infinitely the corners around as well
and basically it's the same idea you

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:18.630
and basically it's the same idea you
 

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.690
and basically it's the same idea you
just supply view and that you gets

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:20.700
just supply view and that you gets
 

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.460
just supply view and that you gets
thrown s the info window so you don't

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:22.470
thrown s the info window so you don't
 

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.260
thrown s the info window so you don't
get the default bubble around it you

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:24.270
get the default bubble around it you
 

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.950
get the default bubble around it you
just get you view that you've returned

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960
just get you view that you've returned
 

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.480
just get you view that you've returned
so if you look at the code the only

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:29.490
so if you look at the code the only
 

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.970
so if you look at the code the only
difference you know the only thing we

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:31.980
difference you know the only thing we
 

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.200
difference you know the only thing we
have changed is basically add a

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:33.210
have changed is basically add a
 

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.410
have changed is basically add a
background to it and the trick is to you

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:36.420
background to it and the trick is to you
 

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.240
background to it and the trick is to you
use a nine patch for that so nine patch

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:38.250
use a nine patch for that so nine patch
 

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.820
use a nine patch for that so nine patch
means that the the image gets scaled up

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:40.830
means that the the image gets scaled up
 

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.920
means that the the image gets scaled up
automatically and stretch in a way that

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:42.930
automatically and stretch in a way that
 

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.530
automatically and stretch in a way that
makes sense in our case here you're

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540
makes sense in our case here you're
 

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.700
makes sense in our case here you're
stretching and so that you always have

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:46.710
stretching and so that you always have
 

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.260
stretching and so that you always have
to grade at the bottom and you're not

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:48.270
to grade at the bottom and you're not
 

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.130
to grade at the bottom and you're not
stretching it past the past a little

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.140
stretching it past the past a little
 

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.150
stretching it past the past a little
Paterno's at the bottom there that sits

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160
Paterno's at the bottom there that sits
 

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.580
Paterno's at the bottom there that sits
on top of the marker and that's that's

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:55.590
on top of the marker and that's that's
 

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.500
on top of the marker and that's that's
trick to it and and that's your that

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:57.510
trick to it and and that's your that
 

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.510
trick to it and and that's your that
sense your custom to custom infowindow

00:08:59.510 --> 00:08:59.520
sense your custom to custom infowindow
 

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.120
sense your custom to custom infowindow
if you look at the code for this again

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.130
if you look at the code for this again
 

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.000
if you look at the code for this again
we're using an intrapreneur editor but

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.010
we're using an intrapreneur editor but
 

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.160
we're using an intrapreneur editor but
this time we have to return the view

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:07.170
this time we have to return the view
 

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.070
this time we have to return the view
from the gift get info window method

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080
from the gift get info window method
 

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.410
from the gift get info window method
instead so you have to return now from

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:12.420
instead so you have to return now from
 

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.150
instead so you have to return now from
getting for window contents otherwise

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160
getting for window contents otherwise
 

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.670
getting for window contents otherwise
that's the one is going to be used so if

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680
that's the one is going to be used so if
 

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.470
that's the one is going to be used so if
you return now there and you return the

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480
you return now there and you return the
 

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.190
you return now there and you return the
view and get info window

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200
view and get info window
 

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.870
view and get info window
that's all you have to do and thats gets

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880
that's all you have to do and thats gets
 

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.510
that's all you have to do and thats gets
think that's what gets drawn instead

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:26.520
think that's what gets drawn instead
 

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.670
think that's what gets drawn instead
yeah so that's really really quite

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680
yeah so that's really really quite
 

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.320
yeah so that's really really quite
simple right so though so you know you

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.330
simple right so though so you know you
 

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.790
simple right so though so you know you
know how to inflate the layout you've

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800
know how to inflate the layout you've
 

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.450
know how to inflate the layout you've
used layouts and views before if but

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:36.460
used layouts and views before if but
 

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.460
used layouts and views before if but
there are a few issues with info but if

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:38.470
there are a few issues with info but if
 

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.280
there are a few issues with info but if
you thinks you have to be aware of and

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:40.290
you thinks you have to be aware of and
 

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.810
you thinks you have to be aware of and
one really big thing is that intervenors

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:42.820
one really big thing is that intervenors
 

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.330
one really big thing is that intervenors
are not life so it's not like any other

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:45.340
are not life so it's not like any other
 

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.700
are not life so it's not like any other
view or you know it's not like other

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:47.710
view or you know it's not like other
 

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.770
view or you know it's not like other
views you've used before so basically

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:49.780
views you've used before so basically
 

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.350
views you've used before so basically
the info window gets rendered to a

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360
the info window gets rendered to a
 

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.810
the info window gets rendered to a
canvas beforehand so you can't change

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:54.820
canvas beforehand so you can't change
 

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.850
canvas beforehand so you can't change
the text on it life you can't change the

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:56.860
the text on it life you can't change the
 

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.620
the text on it life you can't change the
image of cons you can't have custom

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:58.630
image of cons you can't have custom
 

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.150
image of cons you can't have custom
controls unlike other buttons or

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160
controls unlike other buttons or
 

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.610
controls unlike other buttons or
something so you have to be aware of

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:02.620
something so you have to be aware of
 

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.740
something so you have to be aware of
that so you can't change the text on it

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:04.750
that so you can't change the text on it
 

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.270
that so you can't change the text on it
unless you recreate the into a bit of

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:06.280
unless you recreate the into a bit of
 

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.030
unless you recreate the into a bit of
your hide and display it again and

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040
your hide and display it again and
 

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.730
your hide and display it again and
because it's it's it's rented in such a

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:11.740
because it's it's it's rented in such a
 

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.920
because it's it's it's rented in such a
way you also can't have other listeners

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:13.930
way you also can't have other listeners
 

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.840
way you also can't have other listeners
on it so all you can do is you can get a

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:15.850
on it so all you can do is you can get a
 

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.270
on it so all you can do is you can get a
you can register on info window click

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:18.280
you can register on info window click
 

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.370
you can register on info window click
listener and basically you get an event

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:20.380
listener and basically you get an event
 

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.330
listener and basically you get an event
back when somebody taps on the tips of

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:24.340
back when somebody taps on the tips of
 

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.700
back when somebody taps on the tips of
the info window so by default just high

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:26.710
the info window so by default just high
 

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.130
the info window so by default just high
staying for window but but that's that's

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.140
staying for window but but that's that's
 

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.640
staying for window but but that's that's
how you would hook into that yeah that's

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:32.650
how you would hook into that yeah that's
 

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.710
how you would hook into that yeah that's
that's it all about info Venus and I

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720
that's it all about info Venus and I
 

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.570
that's it all about info Venus and I
think now we have Tony telling us how to

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:36.580
think now we have Tony telling us how to
 

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.080
think now we have Tony telling us how to
draw an Android in sunny actually I'm

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.090
draw an Android in sunny actually I'm
 

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.000
draw an Android in sunny actually I'm
Felix before we just go ahead I'm just

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.010
Felix before we just go ahead I'm just
 

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.150
Felix before we just go ahead I'm just
going to go back a couple of slides just

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160
going to go back a couple of slides just
 

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.300
going to go back a couple of slides just
point out a couple of things here the

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:48.310
point out a couple of things here the
 

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.720
point out a couple of things here the
the interesting thing is on this custom

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:51.730
the interesting thing is on this custom
 

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.000
the interesting thing is on this custom
window you showed you mentioned that we

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.010
window you showed you mentioned that we
 

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.500
window you showed you mentioned that we
have a gradient and we can we can

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:55.510
have a gradient and we can we can
 

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.890
have a gradient and we can we can
provide our own you know border for this

00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:58.900
provide our own you know border for this
 

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.400
provide our own you know border for this
and you showed us a nine-page here the

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:01.410
and you showed us a nine-page here the
 

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.480
and you showed us a nine-page here the
important thing to realize here is

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:03.490
important thing to realize here is
 

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.910
important thing to realize here is
things like the shadow for the for the

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920
things like the shadow for the for the
 

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.340
things like the shadow for the for the
window is something that we've added in

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:08.350
window is something that we've added in
 

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.130
window is something that we've added in
a nine patch itself it's something the

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:11.140
a nine patch itself it's something the
 

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.560
a nine patch itself it's something the
library won't add for you right yeah

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:13.570
library won't add for you right yeah
 

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.930
library won't add for you right yeah
yeah that's right so so if you order for

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:15.940
yeah that's right so so if you order for
 

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.580
yeah that's right so so if you order for
shadow behind do anything else you want

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:17.590
shadow behind do anything else you want
 

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.750
shadow behind do anything else you want
to take the back one color you have to

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760
to take the back one color you have to
 

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.190
to take the back one color you have to
leave it yourself we basically have to

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200
leave it yourself we basically have to
 

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.660
leave it yourself we basically have to
provide a different different image

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:21.670
provide a different different image
 

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.390
provide a different different image
there yeah yeah so it takes your your

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:24.400
there yeah yeah so it takes your your
 

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.740
there yeah yeah so it takes your your
image verbatim including the little

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:27.750
image verbatim including the little
 

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.850
image verbatim including the little
triangle that you see at the bottom that

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:29.860
triangle that you see at the bottom that
 

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.980
triangle that you see at the bottom that
shows that this is the marker that is

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:31.990
shows that this is the marker that is
 

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.280
shows that this is the marker that is
coming from

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:33.290
coming from
 

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.470
coming from
so just keep that in mind as you use

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480
so just keep that in mind as you use
 

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.810
so just keep that in mind as you use
these more advanced in info windows that

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:37.820
these more advanced in info windows that
 

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.569
these more advanced in info windows that
you provide everything the more custom

an anchor um so for polylines and
 

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:57.730
an anchor um so for polylines and
polygons we do have some samples in our

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:57.740
polygons we do have some samples in our
 

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.769
polygons we do have some samples in our
in our sample project but there's kind

00:11:59.769 --> 00:11:59.779
in our sample project but there's kind
 

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:02.829

that's called a thing a look at quick

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:21.230
that's called a thing a look at quick
 

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:25.389
that's called a thing a look at quick
demo so so this is an Android centering

00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399
demo so so this is an Android centering
 

00:12:25.399 --> 00:12:29.009
demo so so this is an Android centering
on Sydney so we can just plain wrong and

00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:29.019
on Sydney so we can just plain wrong and
 

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:34.809
on Sydney so we can just plain wrong and
move it and also we can treat the color

00:12:34.809 --> 00:12:34.819
move it and also we can treat the color
 

00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:37.829
move it and also we can treat the color
the transparency the Alpha a little bit

00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839
the transparency the Alpha a little bit
 

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:42.160
the transparency the Alpha a little bit
right now changing the color and then we

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.170
right now changing the color and then we
 

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:46.059
right now changing the color and then we
can adjust the width of the folder with

00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:46.069
can adjust the width of the folder with
 

00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:49.480
can adjust the width of the folder with
the bottom line as well so it's just a

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:49.490
the bottom line as well so it's just a
 

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.240
the bottom line as well so it's just a
quick demo showing of what you can do

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:52.250
quick demo showing of what you can do
 

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:57.069
quick demo showing of what you can do
with polylines and polygons this slice

00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079
with polylines and polygons this slice
 

00:12:57.079 --> 00:13:01.720
with polylines and polygons this slice
piece so basically what polylines and

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:01.730
piece so basically what polylines and
 

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.900
piece so basically what polylines and
polygons do is allow develop you guys to

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:04.910
polygons do is allow develop you guys to
 

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.420
polygons do is allow develop you guys to
developer to your shapes on on the map

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:07.430
developer to your shapes on on the map
 

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.269
developer to your shapes on on the map
one thing is very important is the

00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:10.279
one thing is very important is the
 

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:13.750
one thing is very important is the
location of points you specify is in the

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760
location of points you specify is in the
 

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.689
location of points you specify is in the
particular order so we will talk about a

00:13:16.689 --> 00:13:16.699
particular order so we will talk about a
 

00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:18.689
particular order so we will talk about a
little bit more about that later

00:13:18.689 --> 00:13:18.699
little bit more about that later
 

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:21.250
little bit more about that later
basically all these location coordinates

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:21.260
basically all these location coordinates
 

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.429
basically all these location coordinates
are left latitude and longitude

00:13:26.429 --> 00:13:26.439
are left latitude and longitude
 

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:29.079
are left latitude and longitude
polylines will display as a line

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:29.089
polylines will display as a line
 

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:32.980
polylines will display as a line
segments and for polygons it will gather

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:32.990
segments and for polygons it will gather
 

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:37.150
segments and for polygons it will gather
on just four more lines and closing an

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.160
on just four more lines and closing an
 

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.199
on just four more lines and closing an
area and create a shape but pretty much

00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:41.209
area and create a shape but pretty much
 

00:13:41.209 --> 00:13:44.189
area and create a shape but pretty much
both of them are built up from

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:44.199
both of them are built up from
 

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:46.540
both of them are built up from
coordinates for

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:46.550
coordinates for
 

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:52.930
coordinates for
point on it's like yeah both polylines

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:52.940
point on it's like yeah both polylines
 

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.730
point on it's like yeah both polylines
and polygons they share some common

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:54.740
and polygons they share some common
 

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.310
and polygons they share some common
properties for example you can change

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320
properties for example you can change
 

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.449
properties for example you can change
colours the width and the visibility of

00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:01.459
colours the width and the visibility of
 

00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:06.280
colours the width and the visibility of
those are objects and for polygons

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:06.290
those are objects and for polygons
 

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.800
those are objects and for polygons
because it's a it's a shape so you can

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:08.810
because it's a it's a shape so you can
 

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.130
because it's a it's a shape so you can
also change the fill color as well looks

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:12.140
also change the fill color as well looks
 

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:17.380
also change the fill color as well looks
like so um here's a quick post inflate

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:17.390
like so um here's a quick post inflate
 

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.800
like so um here's a quick post inflate
to show you how to add a polyline on the

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:20.810
to show you how to add a polyline on the
 

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.280
to show you how to add a polyline on the
map quickly and follow the same pattern

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:24.290
map quickly and follow the same pattern
 

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:29.259
map quickly and follow the same pattern
like just like adding markers and so you

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:29.269
like just like adding markers and so you
 

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:32.230
like just like adding markers and so you
have a google map object and then you

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240
have a google map object and then you
 

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.930
have a google map object and then you
just do Aunt Polly line and and you

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:34.940
just do Aunt Polly line and and you
 

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.600
just do Aunt Polly line and and you
specify a polyline options in this case

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:37.610
specify a polyline options in this case
 

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.210
specify a polyline options in this case
here you are you you have to coordinate

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:40.220
here you are you you have to coordinate
 

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.449
here you are you you have to coordinate
and then you will draw the line for you

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:42.459
and then you will draw the line for you
 

00:14:42.459 --> 00:14:47.769
and then you will draw the line for you
looks like um here is an example how you

00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:47.779
looks like um here is an example how you
 

00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:51.430
looks like um here is an example how you
change color and live one thing you

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440
change color and live one thing you
 

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.019
change color and live one thing you
notice is the polyline options our

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:55.029
notice is the polyline options our
 

00:14:55.029 --> 00:15:00.880
notice is the polyline options our
object is we turn itself after you set

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:00.890
object is we turn itself after you set
 

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.810
object is we turn itself after you set
up a third parameter so that allows you

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:04.820
up a third parameter so that allows you
 

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.920
up a third parameter so that allows you
actually to change all these methods so

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:07.930
actually to change all these methods so
 

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:11.380
actually to change all these methods so
convicted in this example here I can

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:11.390
convicted in this example here I can
 

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.260
convicted in this example here I can
change the color and the width at the

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:14.270
change the color and the width at the
 

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:18.880
change the color and the width at the
same time in 1 divided of code it's like

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:18.890
same time in 1 divided of code it's like
 

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.300
same time in 1 divided of code it's like
yeah here in and that example to how to

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:22.310
yeah here in and that example to how to
 

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:27.040
yeah here in and that example to how to
add a polygon so for polygons is also

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.050
add a polygon so for polygons is also
 

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.290
add a polygon so for polygons is also
follow the same patterns you specify a

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:29.300
follow the same patterns you specify a
 

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.040
follow the same patterns you specify a
public on options you just need to

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:33.050
public on options you just need to
 

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:37.630
public on options you just need to
provide a list of lat long so here you

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:37.640
provide a list of lat long so here you
 

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.370
provide a list of lat long so here you
can provide more than 20 points and it

can provide more than 20 points and it
 

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.210
can provide more than 20 points and it
will draw the polygon for you so we'll

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:46.220
will draw the polygon for you so we'll
 

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.790

spicy foods so tony i have a question

00:15:53.889 --> 00:15:53.899
spicy foods so tony i have a question
 

00:15:53.899 --> 00:15:57.460
spicy foods so tony i have a question
here yeah i'm as you can see the labels

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:57.470
here yeah i'm as you can see the labels
 

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.170
here yeah i'm as you can see the labels
show up on top of the polylines

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180
show up on top of the polylines
 

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.990
show up on top of the polylines
we I believe markers are the same right

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000
we I believe markers are the same right
 

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.570
we I believe markers are the same right
markers will always show on top of a

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:05.580
markers will always show on top of a
 

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.450
markers will always show on top of a
polyline rather than the poly or polygon

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:08.460
polyline rather than the poly or polygon
 

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.389
polyline rather than the poly or polygon
rather than the other way around yeah I

00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399
rather than the other way around yeah I
 

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:14.690
rather than the other way around yeah I
believe so and also I also there is in

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:14.700
believe so and also I also there is in
 

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.960
believe so and also I also there is in
in the API there is a scene that concept

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:17.970
in the API there is a scene that concept
 

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.079
in the API there is a scene that concept
so if you have multiple polygons of

00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:21.089
so if you have multiple polygons of
 

00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:22.670
so if you have multiple polygons of
things like them and you can actually

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680
things like them and you can actually
 

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.160
things like them and you can actually
arrange these polygons you can either

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:25.170
arrange these polygons you can either
 

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.500
arrange these polygons you can either
particular order using the T index

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:27.510
particular order using the T index
 

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.530
particular order using the T index
that's really useful to none thank you

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540
that's really useful to none thank you
 

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:35.090
that's really useful to none thank you
um so one thing I want to point out for

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:35.100
um so one thing I want to point out for
 

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:39.760
um so one thing I want to point out for
polygon is the point you specified must

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:39.770
polygon is the point you specified must
 

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.050
polygon is the point you specified must
must be enough in a counter clockwise

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.060
must be enough in a counter clockwise
 

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.530
must be enough in a counter clockwise
order of you know the folder for the

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540
order of you know the folder for the
 

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.889
order of you know the folder for the
fill color to work correctly so let me

00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899
fill color to work correctly so let me
 

00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:51.920
fill color to work correctly so let me
use the diagram here to explain a little

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:51.930
use the diagram here to explain a little
 

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.519
use the diagram here to explain a little
bit or so if you draw a lesson let's say

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:55.529
bit or so if you draw a lesson let's say
 

00:16:55.529 --> 00:16:58.760
bit or so if you draw a lesson let's say
you have a sphere a circle and if you

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:58.770
you have a sphere a circle and if you
 

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:04.370
you have a sphere a circle and if you
draw us a line a circle within the area

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:04.380
draw us a line a circle within the area
 

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.809
draw us a line a circle within the area
um if you draw a counter clockwise on

00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:07.819
um if you draw a counter clockwise on
 

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.270
um if you draw a counter clockwise on
the thing actually end closing in that

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280
the thing actually end closing in that
 

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.900
the thing actually end closing in that
counterclockwise circle is is is the is

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:14.910
counterclockwise circle is is is the is
 

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.329
counterclockwise circle is is is the is
the area actually the car is going to be

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:17.339
the area actually the car is going to be
 

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:21.350
the area actually the car is going to be
filled so in in the in the case here on

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360
filled so in in the in the case here on
 

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.520
filled so in in the in the case here on
the right you can see the circle is in

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:25.530
the right you can see the circle is in
 

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.850
the right you can see the circle is in
the clockwise order so if you if you try

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860
the clockwise order so if you if you try
 

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.450
the clockwise order so if you if you try
to imagine you're looking from of it

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460
to imagine you're looking from of it
 

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:37.970
to imagine you're looking from of it
from inside arm from from the back so is

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:37.980
from inside arm from from the back so is
 

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.030
from inside arm from from the back so is
actually the outside area is actually

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:41.040
actually the outside area is actually
 

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.760
actually the outside area is actually
enclosing uh if you give you if you try

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:43.770
enclosing uh if you give you if you try
 

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.010
enclosing uh if you give you if you try
to imagine by watch it's actually and

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.020
to imagine by watch it's actually and
 

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.580
to imagine by watch it's actually and
closing within the giving if you draw a

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:49.590
closing within the giving if you draw a
 

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.950
closing within the giving if you draw a
circle of anti anti rights so

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960
circle of anti anti rights so
 

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.500
circle of anti anti rights so
so so that's why when you draw try to

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:57.510
so so that's why when you draw try to
 

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.340
so so that's why when you draw try to
talk but um a polygon you always have to

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:01.350
talk but um a polygon you always have to
 

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.430
talk but um a polygon you always have to
think about drawing it from from a cop

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440
think about drawing it from from a cop
 

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.400
think about drawing it from from a cop
and a contact a counterclockwise order

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:07.410
and a contact a counterclockwise order
 

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.880
and a contact a counterclockwise order
so that the right area is going to feel

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:10.890
so that the right area is going to feel
 

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.610
so that the right area is going to feel
the the color you want so

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620
the the color you want so
 

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.730
the the color you want so
it takes up a little bit of thinking to

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740
it takes up a little bit of thinking to
 

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.730
it takes up a little bit of thinking to
try to imagine the right-hand side but

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:19.740
try to imagine the right-hand side but
 

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.960
try to imagine the right-hand side but
so but this is a key something you want

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:23.970
so but this is a key something you want
 

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:31.490
so but this is a key something you want
to keep in mind next alike for polygons

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:31.500
to keep in mind next alike for polygons
 

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.310
to keep in mind next alike for polygons
are you can also change the color and

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320
are you can also change the color and
 

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.400
are you can also change the color and
width and the method signature is a

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:37.410
width and the method signature is a
 

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.530
width and the method signature is a
livid the name is a little bit different

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:39.540
livid the name is a little bit different
 

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.110
livid the name is a little bit different
so for polygons it's a few color and

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120
so for polygons it's a few color and
 

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:49.130
so for polygons it's a few color and
then stroke stroke with next slide one

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140
then stroke stroke with next slide one
 

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.590
then stroke stroke with next slide one
thing interesting about polygon is it

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600
thing interesting about polygon is it
 

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.790
thing interesting about polygon is it
allows you to create some holes though

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:55.800
allows you to create some holes though
 

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.990
allows you to create some holes though
in here we call hollow polygons are

00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000
in here we call hollow polygons are
 

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.250
in here we call hollow polygons are
within a polygon so so one thing I use

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260
within a polygon so so one thing I use
 

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.150
within a polygon so so one thing I use
this concept to to actually chew all the

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160
this concept to to actually chew all the
 

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.410
this concept to to actually chew all the
eyes of the Android so for the for the

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:12.420
eyes of the Android so for the for the
 

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.680
eyes of the Android so for the for the
eyes you just need to specify some

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:15.690
eyes you just need to specify some
 

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.490
eyes you just need to specify some
points so that the API will draw the

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500
points so that the API will draw the
 

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.669
points so that the API will draw the
circle for you and after that after you

00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679
circle for you and after that after you
 

00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:26.030
circle for you and after that after you
create those two circle polygons you add

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.040
create those two circle polygons you add
 

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:31.250
create those two circle polygons you add
it to the original polygon using using

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.260
it to the original polygon using using
 

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.740
it to the original polygon using using
the method at home and that's how I

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:33.750
the method at home and that's how I
 

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.940
the method at home and that's how I
achieved the you kept having a

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:36.950
achieved the you kept having a
 

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.480
achieved the you kept having a
transparent I both for the end or looks

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:41.490
transparent I both for the end or looks
 

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.650
transparent I both for the end or looks
like so here is a live as I mentioned

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660
like so here is a live as I mentioned
 

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.180
like so here is a live as I mentioned
before we're going to talk a little bit

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:47.190
before we're going to talk a little bit
 

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:51.490
before we're going to talk a little bit
more detail how to draw the android body

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:51.500
more detail how to draw the android body
 

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.220
more detail how to draw the android body
so the diagram here show like what kind

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:55.230
so the diagram here show like what kind
 

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.760
so the diagram here show like what kind
of points are you need to specify in

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:58.770
of points are you need to specify in
 

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:02.810
of points are you need to specify in
order to achieve the effect of having a

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820
order to achieve the effect of having a
 

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.919
order to achieve the effect of having a
enjoy figure body so the first point is

00:20:06.919 --> 00:20:06.929
enjoy figure body so the first point is
 

00:20:06.929 --> 00:20:11.180
enjoy figure body so the first point is
actually on the right top right and then

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:11.190
actually on the right top right and then
 

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.870
actually on the right top right and then
you try to draw the semicircle shape

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880
you try to draw the semicircle shape
 

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.440
you try to draw the semicircle shape
using a whole bunch of points we will

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:18.450
using a whole bunch of points we will
 

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.600
using a whole bunch of points we will
talk about how to generate these points

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:20.610
talk about how to generate these points
 

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.110
talk about how to generate these points
are using using the equation later and

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120
are using using the equation later and
 

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.529
are using using the equation later and
then after you draw the same

00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539
then after you draw the same
 

00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:30.499
then after you draw the same
semi circle you need to create a

00:20:30.499 --> 00:20:30.509
semi circle you need to create a
 

00:20:30.509 --> 00:20:33.169
semi circle you need to create a
straight line on the left so that's why

00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179
straight line on the left so that's why
 

00:20:33.179 --> 00:20:35.090
straight line on the left so that's why
you need to specify another coordinate

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.100
you need to specify another coordinate
 

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.669
you need to specify another coordinate
on the lower left corner and then the

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679
on the lower left corner and then the
 

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:39.859
on the lower left corner and then the
last point is the look of the lower

00:20:39.859 --> 00:20:39.869
last point is the look of the lower
 

00:20:39.869 --> 00:20:42.409
last point is the look of the lower
right corner and after you specify all

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:42.419
right corner and after you specify all
 

00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:46.119
right corner and after you specify all
these point are the API will just

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:46.129
these point are the API will just
 

00:20:46.129 --> 00:20:49.009
these point are the API will just
connect these the thoughts together and

00:20:49.009 --> 00:20:49.019
connect these the thoughts together and
 

00:20:49.019 --> 00:20:53.269
connect these the thoughts together and
then fill the shape with the ecology

00:20:53.269 --> 00:20:53.279
then fill the shape with the ecology
 

00:20:53.279 --> 00:20:56.779
then fill the shape with the ecology
specified because remember we're using

00:20:56.779 --> 00:20:56.789
specified because remember we're using
 

00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:59.659
specified because remember we're using
the counterclockwise principle and

00:20:59.659 --> 00:20:59.669
the counterclockwise principle and
 

00:20:59.669 --> 00:21:03.259
the counterclockwise principle and
that's why the enclosing area is in

00:21:03.259 --> 00:21:03.269
that's why the enclosing area is in
 

00:21:03.269 --> 00:21:09.049
that's why the enclosing area is in
Crete in this case looks like so now

00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059
Crete in this case looks like so now
 

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:13.039
Crete in this case looks like so now
gets to the equation part so how to draw

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:13.049
gets to the equation part so how to draw
 

00:21:13.049 --> 00:21:16.099
gets to the equation part so how to draw
that so much semi circle so it turns out

00:21:16.099 --> 00:21:16.109
that so much semi circle so it turns out
 

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:19.159
that so much semi circle so it turns out
like if you go to the kinky here and try

00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:19.169
like if you go to the kinky here and try
 

00:21:19.169 --> 00:21:22.039
like if you go to the kinky here and try
to figure out a way to draw a circle or

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:22.049
to figure out a way to draw a circle or
 

00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:25.879
to figure out a way to draw a circle or
semi circle you will find an equation

00:21:25.879 --> 00:21:25.889
semi circle you will find an equation
 

00:21:25.889 --> 00:21:28.820
semi circle you will find an equation
like the one showing here it looks

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:28.830
like the one showing here it looks
 

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.089
like the one showing here it looks
pretty complicated but the but it will

00:21:32.089 --> 00:21:32.099
pretty complicated but the but it will
 

00:21:32.099 --> 00:21:35.659
pretty complicated but the but it will
help give you when you look at the

00:21:35.659 --> 00:21:35.669
help give you when you look at the
 

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:38.239
help give you when you look at the
apogee like this so so this is a general

00:21:38.239 --> 00:21:38.249
apogee like this so so this is a general
 

00:21:38.249 --> 00:21:43.369
apogee like this so so this is a general
ellipse equation and the thigh angle is

00:21:43.369 --> 00:21:43.379
ellipse equation and the thigh angle is
 

00:21:43.379 --> 00:21:46.369
ellipse equation and the thigh angle is
if you try to actually shift the you

00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:46.379
if you try to actually shift the you
 

00:21:46.379 --> 00:21:50.930
if you try to actually shift the you
lift saw from the x-axis so in this case

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940
lift saw from the x-axis so in this case
 

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.710
lift saw from the x-axis so in this case

the a lot of the sine cosine parameter

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:43.670
the a lot of the sine cosine parameter
 

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:47.380
the a lot of the sine cosine parameter
would become zero and cancel out so this

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:47.390
would become zero and cancel out so this
 

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:50.080
would become zero and cancel out so this
so we have a much simpler equation here

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:50.090
so we have a much simpler equation here
 

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:54.640
so we have a much simpler equation here
which is just the center point plus a

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:54.650
which is just the center point plus a
 

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.000
which is just the center point plus a
cosine theta theta and B sine theta so

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.010
cosine theta theta and B sine theta so
 

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:02.140
cosine theta theta and B sine theta so
that the fatal part is to allow you to

case I just want to draw a semi-circle

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:46.280
case I just want to draw a semi-circle
 

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.350
case I just want to draw a semi-circle
so instead of 2 pi I use PI developed by

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360
so instead of 2 pi I use PI developed by
 

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.080
so instead of 2 pi I use PI developed by
number of points and and then you have a

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:53.090
number of points and and then you have a
 

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.350
number of points and and then you have a

we you can go back and forth between

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:19.220
we you can go back and forth between
 

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.630
we you can go back and forth between
Sydney Bondi and the camera animate so

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640
Sydney Bondi and the camera animate so
 

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.370
Sydney Bondi and the camera animate so
we change the orientation change the

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:24.380
we change the orientation change the
 

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.710
we change the orientation change the
rotation we change the the tilt you can

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720
rotation we change the the tilt you can
 

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.120
rotation we change the the tilt you can
zoom in and zoom out and everything is

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.130
zoom in and zoom out and everything is
 

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.190
zoom in and zoom out and everything is
animated but if you don't want

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:30.200
animated but if you don't want
 

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.600
animated but if you don't want
animations you couldn't turn them off as

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:31.610
animations you couldn't turn them off as
 

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.220
animations you couldn't turn them off as
well so you can jump straight to a

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:33.230
well so you can jump straight to a
 

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.140
well so you can jump straight to a
particular location and that's what

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:35.150
particular location and that's what
 

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.600
particular location and that's what
they're going to talk about next so if

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:37.610
they're going to talk about next so if
 

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:41.080
they're going to talk about next so if
you go to the next slide um so moving

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.090
you go to the next slide um so moving
 

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.940
you go to the next slide um so moving
the camera so they're kind of two ways

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:42.950
the camera so they're kind of two ways
 

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.430
the camera so they're kind of two ways
of doing it so so either you can animate

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440
of doing it so so either you can animate
 

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.200
of doing it so so either you can animate
the camera or you can move the camera an

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:47.210
the camera or you can move the camera an
 

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.060
the camera or you can move the camera an
animating means the camera actually

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:49.070
animating means the camera actually
 

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.160
animating means the camera actually
moves from point A to point B so it's

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:51.170
moves from point A to point B so it's
 

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.400
moves from point A to point B so it's
animated and to do that you have to use

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:54.410
animated and to do that you have to use
 

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:57.490
animated and to do that you have to use
on the animate camera method on a google

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:57.500
on the animate camera method on a google
 

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.919
on the animate camera method on a google
map object and basically you supply

00:25:59.919 --> 00:25:59.929
map object and basically you supply
 

00:25:59.929 --> 00:26:02.799
map object and basically you supply
camera update that's mandatory and the

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:02.809
camera update that's mandatory and the
 

00:26:02.809 --> 00:26:04.480
camera update that's mandatory and the
camera update basically says this is

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:04.490
camera update basically says this is
 

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:05.890
camera update basically says this is
where the camera should point it next

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:05.900
where the camera should point it next
 

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.020
where the camera should point it next
and if you'll talk about that in a

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:08.030
and if you'll talk about that in a
 

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:11.770
and if you'll talk about that in a
second the next the next thing if you

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:11.780
second the next the next thing if you
 

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.110
second the next the next thing if you
can't apply separation so you can say

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.120
can't apply separation so you can say
 

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.090
can't apply separation so you can say
okay how long should the animation last

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:16.100
okay how long should the animation last
 

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.070
okay how long should the animation last
four and you can also register call back

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080
four and you can also register call back
 

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.840
four and you can also register call back
so you know 25 and animations cancer

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:19.850
so you know 25 and animations cancer
 

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.600
so you know 25 and animations cancer
doors finished but if you don't want

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:22.610
doors finished but if you don't want
 

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.400
doors finished but if you don't want
animations you can also move the camera

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:24.410
animations you can also move the camera
 

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.500
animations you can also move the camera
that's in the next slide so we can

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:26.510
that's in the next slide so we can
 

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.020
that's in the next slide so we can
basically say on my google maps object

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:29.030
basically say on my google maps object
 

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.640
basically say on my google maps object
move the camera and all you have to

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:30.650
move the camera and all you have to
 

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.470
move the camera and all you have to
supply there is is just the camera

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480
supply there is is just the camera
 

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.850
supply there is is just the camera
update which tells you where the camera

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:33.860
update which tells you where the camera
 

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.250
update which tells you where the camera
is going on dad so if you go the next

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:36.260
is going on dad so if you go the next
 

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.770
is going on dad so if you go the next
slide that's let's talk about these

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:38.780
slide that's let's talk about these
 

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.169
slide that's let's talk about these
camera update objects a bit more so

00:26:41.169 --> 00:26:41.179
camera update objects a bit more so
 

00:26:41.179 --> 00:26:44.220
camera update objects a bit more so
basically a camera update object tells a

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:44.230
basically a camera update object tells a
 

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.530
basically a camera update object tells a
Google map how the camera should move

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:47.540
Google map how the camera should move
 

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.990
Google map how the camera should move
and enviable Turkish pointed and to

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000
and enviable Turkish pointed and to
 

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.910
and enviable Turkish pointed and to
create one of these you just use a

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:51.920
create one of these you just use a
 

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.580
create one of these you just use a
camera update factory and basically

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:54.590
camera update factory and basically
 

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.960
camera update factory and basically
there are a couple of methods you can

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:55.970
there are a couple of methods you can
 

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.419
there are a couple of methods you can
use to create one of these objects so

00:26:58.419 --> 00:26:58.429
use to create one of these objects so
 

00:26:58.429 --> 00:27:00.040
use to create one of these objects so
for example if you just want to change

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:00.050
for example if you just want to change
 

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.990
for example if you just want to change
the target so what the what the map is

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000
the target so what the what the map is
 

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.940
the target so what the what the map is
putting important what's what the center

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:03.950
putting important what's what the center
 

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.010
putting important what's what the center
of the matters you can use the new lead

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:06.020
of the matters you can use the new lead
 

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.960
of the matters you can use the new lead
long method you just say

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:07.970
long method you just say
 

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.660
long method you just say
a point to this led bong if you have a

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:10.670
a point to this led bong if you have a
 

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.430
a point to this led bong if you have a
couple of points you want to have fun on

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440
couple of points you want to have fun on
 

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.350
couple of points you want to have fun on
the map you can use the net long bounce

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360
the map you can use the net long bounce
 

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.360
the map you can use the net long bounce
method and basically just supply lists

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:16.370
method and basically just supply lists
 

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.880
method and basically just supply lists
list of let long positions and the

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:18.890
list of let long positions and the
 

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.530
list of let long positions and the
camera update makes sure that all these

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:20.540
camera update makes sure that all these
 

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.810
camera update makes sure that all these
points are a part of the part of the

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:22.820
points are a part of the part of the
 

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.480
points are a part of the part of the
camera you can also specify at that long

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:25.490
camera you can also specify at that long
 

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.640
camera you can also specify at that long
and the zoom level you can also scroll

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:27.650
and the zoom level you can also scroll
 

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.860
and the zoom level you can also scroll
the map so here here you specify the

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:29.870
the map so here here you specify the
 

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.810
the map so here here you specify the
number of pixels you want to scroll over

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:31.820
number of pixels you want to scroll over
 

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.940
number of pixels you want to scroll over
map and it's animated than this well if

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:33.950
map and it's animated than this well if
 

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.520
map and it's animated than this well if
you see an image camera method you can

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:36.530
you see an image camera method you can
 

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.410
you see an image camera method you can
zoom in or zoom out and that basically

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:38.420
zoom in or zoom out and that basically
 

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.570
zoom in or zoom out and that basically
means zoom in one zoom level so you

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:40.580
means zoom in one zoom level so you
 

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.950
means zoom in one zoom level so you
don't specify how much you want to zoom

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960
don't specify how much you want to zoom
 

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.810
don't specify how much you want to zoom
in by or zoom out are you just say zoom

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:43.820
in by or zoom out are you just say zoom
 

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.150
in by or zoom out are you just say zoom
in or zoom out just like you would do

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:46.160
in or zoom out just like you would do
 

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.770
in or zoom out just like you would do
when you press that one of the plus or

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:47.780
when you press that one of the plus or
 

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.740
when you press that one of the plus or
minus buttons if you've seen before you

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:50.750
minus buttons if you've seen before you
 

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.350
minus buttons if you've seen before you
can also use zoom by and zoom to and

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360
can also use zoom by and zoom to and
 

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.920
can also use zoom by and zoom to and
basically zoom by means ok zoom by this

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:56.930
basically zoom by means ok zoom by this
 

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.140
basically zoom by means ok zoom by this
mini zoom level so you know assume by

00:27:59.140 --> 00:27:59.150
mini zoom level so you know assume by
 

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:02.230
mini zoom level so you know assume by
3.5 zoom levels or 10 or something like

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240
3.5 zoom levels or 10 or something like
 

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.780
3.5 zoom levels or 10 or something like
that or you can also specify just a zoom

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:04.790
that or you can also specify just a zoom
 

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.490
that or you can also specify just a zoom
level rather than specifying anything

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:06.500
level rather than specifying anything
 

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.860
level rather than specifying anything
else and that's that's how you create

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:08.870
else and that's that's how you create
 

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.380
else and that's that's how you create
one of these camera update objects that

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:11.390
one of these camera update objects that
 

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.660
one of these camera update objects that
you then use for the animate or the move

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:13.670
you then use for the animate or the move
 

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:16.300
you then use for the animate or the move
camera methods and here's on the next

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:16.310
camera methods and here's on the next
 

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:17.470
camera methods and here's on the next
slide we have to get a few simple

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480
slide we have to get a few simple
 

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.420
slide we have to get a few simple
examples so if you want to move the

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:19.430
examples so if you want to move the
 

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.850
examples so if you want to move the
camera to Sydney so we want to keep its

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:21.860
camera to Sydney so we want to keep its
 

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.830
camera to Sydney so we want to keep its
current orientation then it's tilden

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840
current orientation then it's tilden
 

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.290
current orientation then it's tilden
zoom level and and also in this case we

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:26.300
zoom level and and also in this case we
 

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.360
zoom level and and also in this case we
change mobile as well so if you want to

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:28.370
change mobile as well so if you want to
 

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:31.450
change mobile as well so if you want to
move the camera we basically called the

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:31.460
move the camera we basically called the
 

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.020
move the camera we basically called the
new dead long zoom method on the only on

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:35.030
new dead long zoom method on the only on
 

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.030
new dead long zoom method on the only on
the camera update factory and you have

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:37.040
the camera update factory and you have
 

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.010
the camera update factory and you have
to specify a deadline objects in this

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:39.020
to specify a deadline objects in this
 

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.500
to specify a deadline objects in this
case that's the center of Sydney and we

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:41.510
case that's the center of Sydney and we
 

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.480
case that's the center of Sydney and we
can also specify zoom level because we

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:43.490
can also specify zoom level because we
 

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.490
can also specify zoom level because we
are using the lead long zoom method and

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:45.500
are using the lead long zoom method and
 

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.130
are using the lead long zoom method and
all we're doing is we basically go to a

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:48.140
all we're doing is we basically go to a
 

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.320
all we're doing is we basically go to a
Maps object and say move camera and

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:50.330
Maps object and say move camera and
 

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.470
Maps object and say move camera and
tears or camera update and and then the

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480
tears or camera update and and then the
 

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.090
tears or camera update and and then the
cameras move there straight away this

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:55.100
cameras move there straight away this
 

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.340
cameras move there straight away this
list animation or anything if you want

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:57.350
list animation or anything if you want
 

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.860
list animation or anything if you want
to animate it so here's an example we're

00:28:59.860 --> 00:28:59.870
to animate it so here's an example we're
 

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.720
to animate it so here's an example we're
using this time we're using the zoom in

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:01.730
using this time we're using the zoom in
 

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.940
using this time we're using the zoom in
as we mean camera updates so we are

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:03.950
as we mean camera updates so we are
 

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.610
as we mean camera updates so we are
basically zooming in one to level it all

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:06.620
basically zooming in one to level it all
 

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.530
basically zooming in one to level it all
you have to do is again on the Google

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:08.540
you have to do is again on the Google
 

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.020
you have to do is again on the Google
Maps object call the enemy camera method

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:11.030
Maps object call the enemy camera method
 

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.750
Maps object call the enemy camera method
and just supply a camera update in this

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760
and just supply a camera update in this
 

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.200
and just supply a camera update in this
case we're using a zoom in camera update

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:17.210
case we're using a zoom in camera update
 

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.000
case we're using a zoom in camera update
object if you're getting from the camera

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.010
object if you're getting from the camera
 

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.400
object if you're getting from the camera
update factory so

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:21.410
update factory so
 

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.900
update factory so
case we're not supplying a length or

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:22.910
case we're not supplying a length or
 

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.830
case we're not supplying a length or
anything else so that's cool but we

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840
anything else so that's cool but we
 

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.080
anything else so that's cool but we
actually have full control over the

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:29.090
actually have full control over the
 

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.300
actually have full control over the
entire camera so you can specify the

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:31.310
entire camera so you can specify the
 

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.250
entire camera so you can specify the
target you can specify the bearings of

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:33.260
target you can specify the bearings of
 

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.080
target you can specify the bearings of
the orientation of the camera gets

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:35.090
the orientation of the camera gets
 

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:38.080
the orientation of the camera gets
better fighter tilt so what what angle

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:38.090
better fighter tilt so what what angle
 

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.910
better fighter tilt so what what angle
should the camera be pointing it and you

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:39.920
should the camera be pointing it and you
 

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.770
should the camera be pointing it and you
can also specify zoom level so if you

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:41.780
can also specify zoom level so if you
 

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.990
can also specify zoom level so if you
want to specify all of these things with

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000
want to specify all of these things with
 

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.850
want to specify all of these things with
few of these things you have to use a

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:45.860
few of these things you have to use a
 

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.120
few of these things you have to use a
camera position builder and the idea is

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:49.130
camera position builder and the idea is
 

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.280
camera position builder and the idea is
you use a camera position builder to

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:51.290
you use a camera position builder to
 

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.920
you use a camera position builder to
build a camera position and then you use

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:53.930
build a camera position and then you use
 

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:56.410
build a camera position and then you use
the camera update factory to create a

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:56.420
the camera update factory to create a
 

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.480
the camera update factory to create a
camera update so on the next slide you

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:58.490
camera update so on the next slide you
 

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.040
camera update so on the next slide you
will see an example that makes a bit

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.050
will see an example that makes a bit
 

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:03.700
will see an example that makes a bit
more obvious so the basic idea is first

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:03.710
more obvious so the basic idea is first
 

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.560
more obvious so the basic idea is first
we create a camera position so we say

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:05.570
we create a camera position so we say
 

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.620
we create a camera position so we say
okay using a camera position builder and

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:08.630
okay using a camera position builder and
 

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.150
okay using a camera position builder and
they can chain all of these statements

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:10.160
they can chain all of these statements
 

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.370
they can chain all of these statements
together that's quite nice so first you

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:12.380
together that's quite nice so first you
 

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.020
together that's quite nice so first you
have to specify tag so what should the

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:14.030
have to specify tag so what should the
 

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.360
have to specify tag so what should the
camera reporting it you can specify zoom

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:16.370
camera reporting it you can specify zoom
 

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.160
camera reporting it you can specify zoom
level you can specify the bearing you

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:18.170
level you can specify the bearing you
 

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.020
level you can specify the bearing you
know the orientation we specify the tilt

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.030
know the orientation we specify the tilt
 

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.660
know the orientation we specify the tilt
you know the the the angle and then we

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:22.670
you know the the the angle and then we
 

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.150
you know the the the angle and then we
just build the object and so there they

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:25.160
just build the object and so there they
 

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.560
just build the object and so there they
actually are they're not all mandatory

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:26.570
actually are they're not all mandatory
 

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.750
actually are they're not all mandatory
so you can specify just a few of them so

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760
so you can specify just a few of them so
 

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.910
so you can specify just a few of them so
if you want to specify just a zoom level

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:30.920
if you want to specify just a zoom level
 

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.650
if you want to specify just a zoom level
or just just bearing or tilt or

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:32.660
or just just bearing or tilt or
 

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.110
or just just bearing or tilt or
something you can do that as well so we

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120
something you can do that as well so we
 

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.510
something you can do that as well so we
create our camera position using the

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520
create our camera position using the
 

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.090
create our camera position using the
build method and then we basically just

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:40.100
build method and then we basically just
 

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.420
build method and then we basically just
passed that camera position object to a

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:43.430
passed that camera position object to a
 

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:46.030
passed that camera position object to a
camera update factory method so in this

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:46.040
camera update factory method so in this
 

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.920
camera update factory method so in this
case the method is called new camera

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:47.930
case the method is called new camera
 

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.200
case the method is called new camera
position at all you have to do is supply

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:50.210
position at all you have to do is supply
 

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.360
position at all you have to do is supply
that object into the new camera position

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:52.370
that object into the new camera position
 

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.160
that object into the new camera position
message you get a camera up date back

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:54.170
message you get a camera up date back
 

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.590
message you get a camera up date back
that you can just use in your animate

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600
that you can just use in your animate
 

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.840
that you can just use in your animate
camera or your move camera method it

00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:58.850
camera or your move camera method it
 

00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:59.950
camera or your move camera method it
sounds really confusing but it's

00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960
sounds really confusing but it's
 

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.690
sounds really confusing but it's
actually not too bad me think about it

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:01.700
actually not too bad me think about it
 

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.600
actually not too bad me think about it
gives you credit camera position and

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:03.610
gives you credit camera position and
 

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:05.770
gives you credit camera position and
create a camera update from the position

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:05.780
create a camera update from the position
 

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.780
create a camera update from the position
and then you can use it to animate your

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:07.790
and then you can use it to animate your
 

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:12.070
and then you can use it to animate your
move the camera um so so now the

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080
move the camera um so so now the
 

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.040
move the camera um so so now the
animating the camera but we also

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:15.050
animating the camera but we also
 

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.870
animating the camera but we also
sometimes you also interested to know

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880
sometimes you also interested to know
 

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.000
sometimes you also interested to know
when the animation is finished or when

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:19.010
when the animation is finished or when
 

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.740
when the animation is finished or when
somebody elvin the animation has been

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:20.750
somebody elvin the animation has been
 

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.290
somebody elvin the animation has been
interrupted and if you want to if you

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:23.300
interrupted and if you want to if you
 

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.000
interrupted and if you want to if you
want to use those features you have to

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.010
want to use those features you have to
 

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.030
want to use those features you have to
register a concert cancel call back and

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:28.040
register a concert cancel call back and
 

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.820
register a concert cancel call back and
and the basic idea is you create one of

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:30.830
and the basic idea is you create one of
 

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.770
and the basic idea is you create one of
these callbacks you have an unfinished

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:32.780
these callbacks you have an unfinished
 

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.139
these callbacks you have an unfinished
and on canceled method method so

00:31:35.139 --> 00:31:35.149
and on canceled method method so
 

00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:37.329
and on canceled method method so
finish and on canceled and they're cold

00:31:37.329 --> 00:31:37.339
finish and on canceled and they're cold
 

00:31:37.339 --> 00:31:39.039
finish and on canceled and they're cold
when the animation is interrupted or

00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:39.049
when the animation is interrupted or
 

00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:40.959
when the animation is interrupted or
when the animation is finished and you

00:31:40.959 --> 00:31:40.969
when the animation is finished and you
 

00:31:40.969 --> 00:31:43.299
when the animation is finished and you
just have to supply dead call back when

00:31:43.299 --> 00:31:43.309
just have to supply dead call back when
 

00:31:43.309 --> 00:31:45.369
just have to supply dead call back when
you actually fire off the animation so

00:31:45.369 --> 00:31:45.379
you actually fire off the animation so
 

00:31:45.379 --> 00:31:47.259
you actually fire off the animation so
when you use the animate camera method

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:47.269
when you use the animate camera method
 

00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:48.639
when you use the animate camera method
you have to supply a camera update and

00:31:48.639 --> 00:31:48.649
you have to supply a camera update and
 

00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:50.619
you have to supply a camera update and
you can also supply the call back there

00:31:50.619 --> 00:31:50.629
you can also supply the call back there
 

00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:52.029
you can also supply the call back there
and that there could you get notified

00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039
and that there could you get notified
 

00:31:52.039 --> 00:31:54.639
and that there could you get notified
when the animation is finished or

00:31:54.639 --> 00:31:54.649
when the animation is finished or
 

00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:59.039
when the animation is finished or
interrupted yeah that's that's it about

00:31:59.039 --> 00:31:59.049
interrupted yeah that's that's it about
 

00:31:59.049 --> 00:32:03.190
interrupted yeah that's that's it about
camera camera animations and that we may

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200
camera camera animations and that we may
 

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.200
camera camera animations and that we may
try to have a use of that for the center

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:05.210
try to have a use of that for the center
 

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.169
try to have a use of that for the center
tracker application so if you find want

00:32:08.169 --> 00:32:08.179
tracker application so if you find want
 

00:32:08.179 --> 00:32:09.459
tracker application so if you find want
to find out a bit more about how we use

00:32:09.459 --> 00:32:09.469
to find out a bit more about how we use
 

00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:10.899
to find out a bit more about how we use
some of these features have a look at

00:32:10.899 --> 00:32:10.909
some of these features have a look at
 

00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:13.869
some of these features have a look at
the GDL a cemetery Android session so

00:32:13.869 --> 00:32:13.879
the GDL a cemetery Android session so
 

00:32:13.879 --> 00:32:16.359
the GDL a cemetery Android session so
there's quite interesting so um let's

00:32:16.359 --> 00:32:16.369
there's quite interesting so um let's
 

00:32:16.369 --> 00:32:20.229
there's quite interesting so um let's
talk about Marcus a bit more so a marker

00:32:20.229 --> 00:32:20.239
talk about Marcus a bit more so a marker
 

00:32:20.239 --> 00:32:22.899
talk about Marcus a bit more so a marker
is a marker space it basically specifies

00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:22.909
is a marker space it basically specifies
 

00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:25.599
is a marker space it basically specifies
a single point on a map so think about

00:32:25.599 --> 00:32:25.609
a single point on a map so think about
 

00:32:25.609 --> 00:32:27.519
a single point on a map so think about
it like a pin you put a pin on a map

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:27.529
it like a pin you put a pin on a map
 

00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:29.829
it like a pin you put a pin on a map
somewhere if on the next slide you can

00:32:29.829 --> 00:32:29.839
somewhere if on the next slide you can
 

00:32:29.839 --> 00:32:31.810
somewhere if on the next slide you can
see some of the properties you can you

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:31.820
see some of the properties you can you
 

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.109
see some of the properties you can you
can define so we've see we've seen the

00:32:35.109 --> 00:32:35.119
can define so we've see we've seen the
 

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:36.909
can define so we've see we've seen the
position before so if to say where they

00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919
position before so if to say where they
 

00:32:36.919 --> 00:32:39.070
position before so if to say where they
the market should be obviously you can

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080
the market should be obviously you can
 

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.659
the market should be obviously you can
specify your ties and snippet that's

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:40.669
specify your ties and snippet that's
 

00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:42.700
specify your ties and snippet that's
what's used for the default info window

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:42.710
what's used for the default info window
 

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.759
what's used for the default info window
implementation you can also specify with

00:32:45.759 --> 00:32:45.769
implementation you can also specify with
 

00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:47.799
implementation you can also specify with
it draggable or not so that means you

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:47.809
it draggable or not so that means you
 

00:32:47.809 --> 00:32:49.989
it draggable or not so that means you
can pick up the marker from the map and

00:32:49.989 --> 00:32:49.999
can pick up the marker from the map and
 

00:32:49.999 --> 00:32:51.759
can pick up the marker from the map and
move it around and you have an example

00:32:51.759 --> 00:32:51.769
move it around and you have an example
 

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:54.039
move it around and you have an example
of that a bit later on you can also make

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:54.049
of that a bit later on you can also make
 

00:32:54.049 --> 00:32:57.159
of that a bit later on you can also make
a market visible or invisible and then

00:32:57.159 --> 00:32:57.169
a market visible or invisible and then
 

00:32:57.169 --> 00:33:00.159
a market visible or invisible and then
we have the icon so you can actually

00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:00.169
we have the icon so you can actually
 

00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:03.279
we have the icon so you can actually
change the icon that the market has so

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:03.289
change the icon that the market has so
 

00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:05.709
change the icon that the market has so
basic in the image so you can specify

00:33:05.709 --> 00:33:05.719
basic in the image so you can specify
 

00:33:05.719 --> 00:33:07.539
basic in the image so you can specify
and you can specify different image you

00:33:07.539 --> 00:33:07.549
and you can specify different image you
 

00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:09.099
and you can specify different image you
want you want to use photo/marco instead

00:33:09.099 --> 00:33:09.109
want you want to use photo/marco instead
 

00:33:09.109 --> 00:33:13.539
want you want to use photo/marco instead
and if you use different different icon

00:33:13.539 --> 00:33:13.549
and if you use different different icon
 

00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:15.759
and if you use different different icon
you also probably want to look at the

00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:15.769
you also probably want to look at the
 

00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:18.519
you also probably want to look at the
anchor and the anchor basically says how

00:33:18.519 --> 00:33:18.529
anchor and the anchor basically says how
 

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:22.509
anchor and the anchor basically says how
is the image placed in relation to the

00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519
is the image placed in relation to the
 

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:24.369
is the image placed in relation to the
position we've specified because it's

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:24.379
position we've specified because it's
 

00:33:24.379 --> 00:33:25.690
position we've specified because it's
right on top is a bit to the left or to

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:25.700
right on top is a bit to the left or to
 

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.399
right on top is a bit to the left or to
the right and we haven't we have an

00:33:27.399 --> 00:33:27.409
the right and we haven't we have an
 

00:33:27.409 --> 00:33:30.430
the right and we haven't we have an
example of that as well so let's talk

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440
example of that as well so let's talk
 

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.180
example of that as well so let's talk
about custom marker icons first because

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:34.190
about custom marker icons first because
 

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:36.459
about custom marker icons first because
I think that says quite interesting so

00:33:36.459 --> 00:33:36.469
I think that says quite interesting so
 

00:33:36.469 --> 00:33:38.739
I think that says quite interesting so
when I can actually comes from a bitmap

00:33:38.739 --> 00:33:38.749
when I can actually comes from a bitmap
 

00:33:38.749 --> 00:33:40.629
when I can actually comes from a bitmap
descriptor so it's not just a bitmap

00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639
descriptor so it's not just a bitmap
 

00:33:40.639 --> 00:33:42.759
descriptor so it's not just a bitmap
it's a bitmap descriptor and and you get

00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:42.769
it's a bitmap descriptor and and you get
 

00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:45.039
it's a bitmap descriptor and and you get
one of these you have to use a bitmap

00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:45.049
one of these you have to use a bitmap
 

00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:47.319
one of these you have to use a bitmap
descriptive factory so another another

00:33:47.319 --> 00:33:47.329
descriptive factory so another another
 

00:33:47.329 --> 00:33:49.080
descriptive factory so another another
Factory and the few factory methods

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.090
Factory and the few factory methods
 

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:51.120
Factory and the few factory methods
you can use so you can use a default

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:51.130
you can use so you can use a default
 

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.000
you can use so you can use a default
marker solely for Marcus basically the

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.010
marker solely for Marcus basically the
 

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.040
marker solely for Marcus basically the
the standard marker you've seen map we

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:56.050
the standard marker you've seen map we
 

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.920
the standard marker you've seen map we
have an example of the next slide you

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:58.930
have an example of the next slide you
 

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:00.900
have an example of the next slide you
can we can load it in from an asset you

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:00.910
can we can load it in from an asset you
 

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.090
can we can load it in from an asset you
can load it in from a direct admit if

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:03.100
can load it in from a direct admit if
 

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.890
can load it in from a direct admit if
you've generated it you can get it from

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:04.900
you've generated it you can get it from
 

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.690
you've generated it you can get it from
a file or you can exclusive music from

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:06.700
a file or you can exclusive music from
 

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.910
a file or you can exclusive music from
the resource using the standard Android

00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:08.920
the resource using the standard Android
 

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.400
the resource using the standard Android
and resource resource folders that you

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:11.410
and resource resource folders that you
 

00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:15.200
and resource resource folders that you
can use so on the next slide you can see

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:15.210
can use so on the next slide you can see
 

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:18.300
can use so on the next slide you can see
there is ample implementation using the

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:18.310
there is ample implementation using the
 

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.520
there is ample implementation using the
default marker so if you just use a

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:20.530
default marker so if you just use a
 

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:22.590
default marker so if you just use a
default market I can you just say okay

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:22.600
default market I can you just say okay
 

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.480
default market I can you just say okay
here's a new market objects here the

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:24.490
here's a new market objects here the
 

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:26.850
here's a new market objects here the
marker options and here's a position and

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:26.860
marker options and here's a position and
 

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.440
marker options and here's a position and
you don't specify anything else you're

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:28.450
you don't specify anything else you're
 

00:34:28.450 --> 00:34:30.360
you don't specify anything else you're
going to get a red marker there on the

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:30.370
going to get a red marker there on the
 

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:34.620
going to get a red marker there on the
on the map um but the default marker

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:34.630
on the map um but the default marker
 

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.450

factory method from the bitmap

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:36.460
factory method from the bitmap
 

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.220
factory method from the bitmap
descriptive factories actually five cuts

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:38.230
descriptive factories actually five cuts
 

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.320
descriptive factories actually five cuts
MA so you can actually specify the color

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:40.330
MA so you can actually specify the color
 

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:43.260
MA so you can actually specify the color
you want for your default matter so you

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:43.270
you want for your default matter so you
 

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.060
you want for your default matter so you
don't necessarily have to always

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:45.070
don't necessarily have to always
 

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.880
don't necessarily have to always
implement your own bitmaps or your own

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:47.890
implement your own bitmaps or your own
 

00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:49.500
implement your own bitmaps or your own
icons you can you might even this be

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:49.510
icons you can you might even this be
 

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.360
icons you can you might even this be
able to take advantage of this in this

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:51.370
able to take advantage of this in this
 

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:54.690
able to take advantage of this in this
case here we've specified if I did blue

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:54.700
case here we've specified if I did blue
 

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.150
case here we've specified if I did blue
matter so you just say okay what which

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160
matter so you just say okay what which
 

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.070
matter so you just say okay what which
you mellow well you do you want you want

00:34:59.070 --> 00:34:59.080
you mellow well you do you want you want
 

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.950
you mellow well you do you want you want
to use so if you want to specify a value

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960
to use so if you want to specify a value
 

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.480
to use so if you want to specify a value
a color value we just use the bitmap

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:06.490
a color value we just use the bitmap
 

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.670
a color value we just use the bitmap
descriptor factory default marker method

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.680
descriptor factory default marker method
 

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.740
descriptor factory default marker method
and there you can you can specify color

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:10.750
and there you can you can specify color
 

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:14.130
and there you can you can specify color
between 0 and 360 and that's what what's

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:14.140
between 0 and 360 and that's what what's
 

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:20.160
between 0 and 360 and that's what what's
then used for the for the argon um but a

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:20.170
then used for the for the argon um but a
 

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.660
then used for the for the argon um but a
bit more interesting is even you can

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:21.670
bit more interesting is even you can
 

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:24.960
bit more interesting is even you can
even you add your own image so as I said

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:24.970
even you add your own image so as I said
 

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:26.280
even you add your own image so as I said
before you can get it from a resource

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:26.290
before you can get it from a resource
 

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.780
before you can get it from a resource
you can load it from the assets you can

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:27.790
you can load it from the assets you can
 

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:29.670
you can load it from the assets you can
get it from a fire near from a bitmap

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680
get it from a fire near from a bitmap
 

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.200
get it from a fire near from a bitmap
and here's an example where we load an

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:34.210
and here's an example where we load an
 

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:38.250
and here's an example where we load an
image in from from the resources so we

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:38.260
image in from from the resources so we
 

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.110
image in from from the resources so we
basically have a drawable this for

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:40.120
basically have a drawable this for
 

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.150
basically have a drawable this for
justice just an arrow here every you see

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160
justice just an arrow here every you see
 

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.890
justice just an arrow here every you see
picked up the script a factory dot from

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:43.900
picked up the script a factory dot from
 

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.730
picked up the script a factory dot from
resource method to load it in and that's

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:47.740
resource method to load it in and that's
 

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.950
resource method to load it in and that's
that's that's that's quite easy but

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:49.960
that's that's that's quite easy but
 

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.640
that's that's that's quite easy but
there's an issue with that um because

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:52.650
there's an issue with that um because
 

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:57.390
there's an issue with that um because
custom these images look and behave Matt

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400
custom these images look and behave Matt
 

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.610
custom these images look and behave Matt
look and behave differently from the

00:35:59.610 --> 00:35:59.620
look and behave differently from the
 

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.560
look and behave differently from the
ephod matter so you might have to

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:01.570
ephod matter so you might have to
 

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:02.609
ephod matter so you might have to
specify an anchor

00:36:02.609 --> 00:36:02.619
specify an anchor
 

00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:05.009
specify an anchor
so since an anchor basically says okay

00:36:05.009 --> 00:36:05.019
so since an anchor basically says okay
 

00:36:05.019 --> 00:36:08.039
so since an anchor basically says okay
and in relation to the position of the

00:36:08.039 --> 00:36:08.049
and in relation to the position of the
 

00:36:08.049 --> 00:36:10.140
and in relation to the position of the
market so that long position we've

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:10.150
market so that long position we've
 

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:12.509
market so that long position we've
specified where should we place the

00:36:12.509 --> 00:36:12.519
specified where should we place the
 

00:36:12.519 --> 00:36:15.450
specified where should we place the
image so by default if you think back to

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:15.460
image so by default if you think back to
 

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.099
image so by default if you think back to
the default marker you have a pin that

00:36:17.099 --> 00:36:17.109
the default marker you have a pin that
 

00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:18.859
the default marker you have a pin that
kind of points to a positional map and

00:36:18.859 --> 00:36:18.869
kind of points to a positional map and
 

00:36:18.869 --> 00:36:21.450
kind of points to a positional map and
when the marker actually touches the map

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:21.460
when the marker actually touches the map
 

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.390
when the marker actually touches the map
is at the bottom center right so so at

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400
is at the bottom center right so so at
 

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.160
is at the bottom center right so so at
the bottom and fifty percent on the left

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:26.170
the bottom and fifty percent on the left
 

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:29.190
the bottom and fifty percent on the left
in the center and if you want to specify

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200
in the center and if you want to specify
 

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.529
in the center and if you want to specify
your own anger what you have to do is

00:36:31.529 --> 00:36:31.539
your own anger what you have to do is
 

00:36:31.539 --> 00:36:34.349
your own anger what you have to do is
you have to specify the ratio of where

00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:34.359
you have to specify the ratio of where
 

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:36.630
you have to specify the ratio of where
we're should be placed so we have you

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640
we're should be placed so we have you
 

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.799
we're should be placed so we have you
and me various leaders to specify um and

00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:40.809
and me various leaders to specify um and
 

00:36:40.809 --> 00:36:42.029
and me various leaders to specify um and
this is coming from the ratio of the

00:36:42.029 --> 00:36:42.039
this is coming from the ratio of the
 

00:36:42.039 --> 00:36:46.980
this is coming from the ratio of the
image 200 is the top left and then 11 is

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:46.990
image 200 is the top left and then 11 is
 

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:48.690
image 200 is the top left and then 11 is
the bottom right and here's an example

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:48.700
the bottom right and here's an example
 

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.700
the bottom right and here's an example
that shows you how you can use these

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:50.710
that shows you how you can use these
 

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.950
that shows you how you can use these
values so the top right for example is

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960
values so the top right for example is
 

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.249
values so the top right for example is
is 10 and he's an example that i put

00:36:56.249 --> 00:36:56.259
is 10 and he's an example that i put
 

00:36:56.259 --> 00:36:58.769
is 10 and he's an example that i put
together that shows you the impact of

00:36:58.769 --> 00:36:58.779
together that shows you the impact of
 

00:36:58.779 --> 00:37:01.589
together that shows you the impact of
these of these anchor values and what

00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599
these of these anchor values and what
 

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:03.930
these of these anchor values and what
they do so we are using the default

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:03.940
they do so we are using the default
 

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.720
they do so we are using the default
marker here just a stock sandyford

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:06.730
marker here just a stock sandyford
 

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:08.819
marker here just a stock sandyford
marker but we are changing with anchored

00:37:08.819 --> 00:37:08.829
marker but we are changing with anchored
 

00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:11.549
marker but we are changing with anchored
to the to the to the to the lead long

00:37:11.549 --> 00:37:11.559
to the to the to the to the lead long
 

00:37:11.559 --> 00:37:13.920
to the to the to the to the lead long
position so the default is point five

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:13.930
position so the default is point five
 

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.920
position so the default is point five
and and one so that's the bottom bottom

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:16.930
and and one so that's the bottom bottom
 

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:19.259
and and one so that's the bottom bottom
center and as you can see that's exactly

00:37:19.259 --> 00:37:19.269
center and as you can see that's exactly
 

00:37:19.269 --> 00:37:22.319
center and as you can see that's exactly
where it's touching the map and on the

00:37:22.319 --> 00:37:22.329
where it's touching the map and on the
 

00:37:22.329 --> 00:37:24.479
where it's touching the map and on the
images here you can see the actual

00:37:24.479 --> 00:37:24.489
images here you can see the actual
 

00:37:24.489 --> 00:37:26.279
images here you can see the actual
latitude longitude roofs that we've

00:37:26.279 --> 00:37:26.289
latitude longitude roofs that we've
 

00:37:26.289 --> 00:37:29.130
latitude longitude roofs that we've
specified that's that's the that's blue

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:29.140
specified that's that's the that's blue
 

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:33.029
specified that's that's the that's blue
circle where so if you make human people

00:37:33.029 --> 00:37:33.039
circle where so if you make human people
 

00:37:33.039 --> 00:37:36.839

0 which means we're entering the icon on

00:37:36.839 --> 00:37:36.849
0 which means we're entering the icon on
 

00:37:36.849 --> 00:37:39.870
0 which means we're entering the icon on
the top left you can see exactly what's

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880
the top left you can see exactly what's
 

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.759
the top left you can see exactly what's
happened here right so the image the

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:41.769
happened here right so the image the
 

00:37:41.769 --> 00:37:43.890
happened here right so the image the
icon is actually anchored to the

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:43.900
icon is actually anchored to the
 

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.079
icon is actually anchored to the
position from the top left and if you

00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:46.089
position from the top left and if you
 

00:37:46.089 --> 00:37:48.299
position from the top left and if you
put a smack bang in the middle so point

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:48.309
put a smack bang in the middle so point
 

00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:50.400
put a smack bang in the middle so point
5 in point 5 it's drawn right on top

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:50.410
5 in point 5 it's drawn right on top
 

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:52.440
5 in point 5 it's drawn right on top
right on top of the lettering magnitude

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:52.450
right on top of the lettering magnitude
 

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:54.599
right on top of the lettering magnitude
and then here's here's a bit offset of

00:37:54.599 --> 00:37:54.609
and then here's here's a bit offset of
 

00:37:54.609 --> 00:37:57.599
and then here's here's a bit offset of
the rod and the point 1 point 7 so you

00:37:57.599 --> 00:37:57.609
the rod and the point 1 point 7 so you
 

00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:59.880
the rod and the point 1 point 7 so you
can see when so if you take advantage of

00:37:59.880 --> 00:37:59.890
can see when so if you take advantage of
 

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.229
can see when so if you take advantage of
this feature of having your own images

00:38:01.229 --> 00:38:01.239
this feature of having your own images
 

00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:03.420
this feature of having your own images
it should be cut careful to make sure

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:03.430
it should be cut careful to make sure
 

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:06.450
it should be cut careful to make sure
that the marker is actually drawn at the

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:06.460
that the marker is actually drawn at the
 

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.400
that the marker is actually drawn at the
correct spot and especially when you

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:08.410
correct spot and especially when you
 

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:14.609
correct spot and especially when you
move around um so let's let's talk about

00:38:14.609 --> 00:38:14.619
move around um so let's let's talk about
 

00:38:14.619 --> 00:38:16.049
move around um so let's let's talk about
Dracula markers so you can

00:38:16.049 --> 00:38:16.059
Dracula markers so you can
 

00:38:16.059 --> 00:38:17.699
Dracula markers so you can
actually pick up a marker and you can

00:38:17.699 --> 00:38:17.709
actually pick up a marker and you can
 

00:38:17.709 --> 00:38:20.910
actually pick up a marker and you can
actually move it around so when you set

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920
actually move it around so when you set
 

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.150
actually move it around so when you set
a marker as being draggable you get a

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160
a marker as being draggable you get a
 

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.890
a marker as being draggable you get a
few events back that tell you if the

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:25.900
few events back that tell you if the
 

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.269
few events back that tell you if the
markets been picked up if the market has

00:38:27.269 --> 00:38:27.279
markets been picked up if the market has
 

00:38:27.279 --> 00:38:29.039
markets been picked up if the market has
been moved and that's what we're doing

00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:29.049
been moved and that's what we're doing
 

00:38:29.049 --> 00:38:30.900
been moved and that's what we're doing
here so again this is coming from the

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:30.910
here so again this is coming from the
 

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:33.209
here so again this is coming from the
Maps API demo if you want to have a look

00:38:33.209 --> 00:38:33.219
Maps API demo if you want to have a look
 

00:38:33.219 --> 00:38:36.089
Maps API demo if you want to have a look
at this so it is actually really easy to

00:38:36.089 --> 00:38:36.099
at this so it is actually really easy to
 

00:38:36.099 --> 00:38:38.640
at this so it is actually really easy to
do so the next slide you can see some

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:38.650
do so the next slide you can see some
 

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.789
do so the next slide you can see some
code so the basic idea is you have to

00:38:41.789 --> 00:38:41.799
code so the basic idea is you have to
 

00:38:41.799 --> 00:38:44.130
code so the basic idea is you have to
make the mark a draggable so there's a

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:44.140
make the mark a draggable so there's a
 

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.140
make the mark a draggable so there's a
set regular method that you have to set

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:46.150
set regular method that you have to set
 

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:48.719
set regular method that you have to set
it true or you can specify it when you

00:38:48.719 --> 00:38:48.729
it true or you can specify it when you
 

00:38:48.729 --> 00:38:51.420
it true or you can specify it when you
create the marker and then all you have

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:51.430
create the marker and then all you have
 

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.870
create the marker and then all you have
to do is you have to implement the oil

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880
to do is you have to implement the oil
 

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.880
to do is you have to implement the oil
market react listener which as a name

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:56.890

suggests suggests egg gets callbacks

00:38:59.189 --> 00:38:59.199
suggests suggests egg gets callbacks
 

00:38:59.199 --> 00:39:01.890
suggests suggests egg gets callbacks
when you move the marker you have to

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:01.900
when you move the marker you have to
 

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.829
when you move the marker you have to
actually give to register the drag

00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839
actually give to register the drag
 

00:39:04.839 --> 00:39:07.049
actually give to register the drag
listener so on your Google Maps object

00:39:07.049 --> 00:39:07.059
listener so on your Google Maps object
 

00:39:07.059 --> 00:39:09.630

you just say set on drag mark allison on

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640
you just say set on drag mark allison on
 

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.209
you just say set on drag mark allison on
you to specify the object and then use

00:39:12.209 --> 00:39:12.219
you to specify the object and then use
 

00:39:12.219 --> 00:39:14.130
you to specify the object and then use
listen for events so there are three

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:14.140
listen for events so there are three
 

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.769
listen for events so there are three
events you get back so you get a call

00:39:16.769 --> 00:39:16.779
events you get back so you get a call
 

00:39:16.779 --> 00:39:19.170
events you get back so you get a call
back when the when the user has started

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:19.180
back when the when the user has started
 

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.120
back when the when the user has started
moving moving the markers with back in

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:21.130
moving moving the markers with back in
 

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.669
moving moving the markers with back in
the market across the map you get a call

00:39:23.669 --> 00:39:23.679
the market across the map you get a call
 

00:39:23.679 --> 00:39:26.039
the market across the map you get a call
back when the users finished when he

00:39:26.039 --> 00:39:26.049
back when the users finished when he
 

00:39:26.049 --> 00:39:29.069
back when the users finished when he
when he's taken the finger of the of the

00:39:29.069 --> 00:39:29.079
when he's taken the finger of the of the
 

00:39:29.079 --> 00:39:30.569
when he's taken the finger of the of the
screen and the market has been placed

00:39:30.569 --> 00:39:30.579
screen and the market has been placed
 

00:39:30.579 --> 00:39:32.219
screen and the market has been placed
somewhere and you also get dragged

00:39:32.219 --> 00:39:32.229
somewhere and you also get dragged
 

00:39:32.229 --> 00:39:33.779
somewhere and you also get dragged
events so you know exactly where the

00:39:33.779 --> 00:39:33.789
events so you know exactly where the
 

00:39:33.789 --> 00:39:36.209
events so you know exactly where the
market is ms the market moves moves over

00:39:36.209 --> 00:39:36.219
market is ms the market moves moves over
 

00:39:36.219 --> 00:39:37.859
market is ms the market moves moves over
the map so if you want to find out where

00:39:37.859 --> 00:39:37.869
the map so if you want to find out where
 

00:39:37.869 --> 00:39:40.349
the map so if you want to find out where
the marker actually is when s is moving

00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359
the marker actually is when s is moving
 

00:39:40.359 --> 00:39:42.299
the marker actually is when s is moving
around all you have to do is just get

00:39:42.299 --> 00:39:42.309
around all you have to do is just get
 

00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:43.949
around all you have to do is just get
call they get position method on your

00:39:43.949 --> 00:39:43.959
call they get position method on your
 

00:39:43.959 --> 00:39:45.839
call they get position method on your
marker and and that way you know you

00:39:45.839 --> 00:39:45.849
marker and and that way you know you
 

00:39:45.849 --> 00:39:49.650
marker and and that way you know you
know where it is on a map and yeah that

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:49.660
know where it is on a map and yeah that
 

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.719
know where it is on a map and yeah that
should give you enough information to

00:39:51.719 --> 00:39:51.729
should give you enough information to
 

00:39:51.729 --> 00:39:54.809
should give you enough information to
get start with regular markers and yeah

00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:54.819
get start with regular markers and yeah
 

00:39:54.819 --> 00:39:57.329
get start with regular markers and yeah
that's that that's all we had for only

00:39:57.329 --> 00:39:57.339
that's that that's all we had for only
 

00:39:57.339 --> 00:39:59.130
that's that that's all we had for only
half for work for this week so if you

00:39:59.130 --> 00:39:59.140
half for work for this week so if you
 

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.839
half for work for this week so if you
want a bit about info windows you feel

00:40:00.839 --> 00:40:00.849
want a bit about info windows you feel

about proly lines and motive on android
in on a map you've talked about Marcus

00:40:07.979 --> 00:40:07.989
in on a map you've talked about Marcus
 

00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:09.449

believe you looked into this one yeah

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:26.950
believe you looked into this one yeah
 

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:32.489

we are trying to achieve I think that

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:34.420
we are trying to achieve I think that
 

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.589

our provider is probably not the right

00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599
our provider is probably not the right
 

00:41:37.599 --> 00:41:40.079
our provider is probably not the right
class you should look at I think are we

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:40.089
class you should look at I think are we
 

00:41:40.089 --> 00:41:42.089
class you should look at I think are we
I suggest you to take a look at the

00:41:42.089 --> 00:41:42.099
I suggest you to take a look at the
 

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:48.089
I suggest you to take a look at the
grand overlay class and so usually

00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:48.099
grand overlay class and so usually
 

00:41:48.099 --> 00:41:53.190
grand overlay class and so usually
that's how people use this class that I

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200
that's how people use this class that I
 

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.660

achieved the heat the effect you are

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:54.670

achieved the heat the effect you are
talking about arm so you can draw into a

00:41:57.989 --> 00:41:57.999
talking about arm so you can draw into a
 

00:41:57.999 --> 00:42:01.319
talking about arm so you can draw into a
bitmap and then at the bit to the to the

00:42:01.319 --> 00:42:01.329
bitmap and then at the bit to the to the
 

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:05.370
bitmap and then at the bit to the to the
overlay position the overlay and then

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:05.380
overlay position the overlay and then
 

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.940
overlay position the overlay and then
overlay that on the map um so with the

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:08.950
overlay that on the map um so with the
 

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:11.849
overlay that on the map um so with the
grand overlay doesn't need to worry

00:42:11.849 --> 00:42:11.859
grand overlay doesn't need to worry
 

00:42:11.859 --> 00:42:15.539
grand overlay doesn't need to worry
about all the projection coordinate so

00:42:15.539 --> 00:42:15.549
about all the projection coordinate so
 

00:42:15.549 --> 00:42:18.329
about all the projection coordinate so
so in the ground overlay class there are

00:42:18.329 --> 00:42:18.339
so in the ground overlay class there are
 

00:42:18.339 --> 00:42:21.180
so in the ground overlay class there are
they are lat long parameter you can

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:21.190
they are lat long parameter you can
 

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:25.640
they are lat long parameter you can
specify to uh to specify the position

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:25.650
specify to uh to specify the position
 

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:30.719

look into this so i'll raise it with the
 

00:45:34.989 --> 00:45:37.349
look into this so i'll raise it with the
engineering team as with these sorts of

00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359
engineering team as with these sorts of
 

00:45:37.359 --> 00:45:39.180
engineering team as with these sorts of
feature requests what we can do is we

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:39.190
feature requests what we can do is we
 

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.390
feature requests what we can do is we
can we can let the engineers know that

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400
can we can let the engineers know that
 

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.890

just a matter of its how to do it and
 

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:58.529
just a matter of its how to do it and
when to do it so yeah free cookies gonna

00:45:58.529 --> 00:45:58.539
when to do it so yeah free cookies gonna
 

00:45:58.539 --> 00:46:01.140
when to do it so yeah free cookies gonna
pop on down sometime and we'll see what

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:01.150

question in the is it possible to create
 

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:15.539

a shadow of the marker and it's info

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:15.549
a shadow of the marker and it's info
 

00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:19.370
a shadow of the marker and it's info
window on the map so actually this is uh

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380
window on the map so actually this is uh
 

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.719
window on the map so actually this is uh
we sort of alluded to the answer to this

00:46:21.719 --> 00:46:21.729
we sort of alluded to the answer to this
 

00:46:21.729 --> 00:46:23.519
we sort of alluded to the answer to this
question in the presentation itself in

00:46:23.519 --> 00:46:23.529
question in the presentation itself in
 

00:46:23.529 --> 00:46:26.459
question in the presentation itself in
that if you have a custom infowindow you

00:46:26.459 --> 00:46:26.469
that if you have a custom infowindow you
 

00:46:26.469 --> 00:46:28.109
that if you have a custom infowindow you
have to draw the shadow yourself and you

00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119
have to draw the shadow yourself and you
 

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:30.959
have to draw the shadow yourself and you
can do that as part of the image or as

00:46:30.959 --> 00:46:30.969
can do that as part of the image or as
 

00:46:30.969 --> 00:46:33.120
can do that as part of the image or as
part of the view rather that you provide

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:33.130
part of the view rather that you provide
 

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:35.999
part of the view rather that you provide
in when you set up a custom infowindow

00:46:35.999 --> 00:46:36.009
in when you set up a custom infowindow
 

00:46:36.009 --> 00:46:38.549
in when you set up a custom infowindow
and the same thing actually applies to

00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559
and the same thing actually applies to
 

00:46:38.559 --> 00:46:41.759
and the same thing actually applies to
custom markers when you specify the

00:46:41.759 --> 00:46:41.769
custom markers when you specify the
 

00:46:41.769 --> 00:46:43.920
custom markers when you specify the
image for the marker you can go ahead

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:43.930
image for the marker you can go ahead
 

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.410
image for the marker you can go ahead
and actually put a drop shadow or

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:46.420
and actually put a drop shadow or
 

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:50.309
and actually put a drop shadow or
whatever in there and the library won't

00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319
whatever in there and the library won't
 

00:46:50.319 --> 00:46:53.309
whatever in there and the library won't
do that for you so yeah just a

00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319
do that for you so yeah just a
 

00:46:53.319 --> 00:46:56.939
do that for you so yeah just a
transparent image and put the shadow

00:46:56.939 --> 00:46:56.949
transparent image and put the shadow
 

00:46:56.949 --> 00:46:59.849
transparent image and put the shadow
where you need to yung felix attorney

00:46:59.849 --> 00:46:59.859
where you need to yung felix attorney
 

00:46:59.859 --> 00:47:02.189
where you need to yung felix attorney
did you want to add anything to that now

00:47:02.189 --> 00:47:02.199
did you want to add anything to that now
 

00:47:02.199 --> 00:47:03.569
did you want to add anything to that now
that's the only thing you should keep in

00:47:03.569 --> 00:47:03.579
that's the only thing you should keep in
 

00:47:03.579 --> 00:47:06.599
that's the only thing you should keep in
mind is the that if you add a shadow to

00:47:06.599 --> 00:47:06.609
mind is the that if you add a shadow to
 

00:47:06.609 --> 00:47:07.810
mind is the that if you add a shadow to
a marker you

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:07.820
a marker you
 

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.190
a marker you
obviously to make the image a lot bigger

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200
obviously to make the image a lot bigger
 

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.990
obviously to make the image a lot bigger
than s along with your fault marker so

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.000
than s along with your fault marker so
 

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.010
than s along with your fault marker so
you definitely have to have to make sure

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:12.020
you definitely have to have to make sure
 

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.690
you definitely have to have to make sure
that still centered at the right spot

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:13.700
that still centered at the right spot
 

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.370
that still centered at the right spot
using some of the tricks i was i was

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:15.380
using some of the tricks i was i was
 

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.990
using some of the tricks i was i was
talking about at the presentation so

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000
talking about at the presentation so
 

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.760

position Roger thanks now I Linden has
 

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:27.370
position Roger thanks now I Linden has
also asked another question so given

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:27.380
also asked another question so given
 

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.590
also asked another question so given
holding a reference to a marker as a bad

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:29.600
holding a reference to a marker as a bad
 

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.270
holding a reference to a marker as a bad
idea is keeping tabs of hash code of

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280
idea is keeping tabs of hash code of
 

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.560
idea is keeping tabs of hash code of
markers the best way to keep track of

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:35.570
markers the best way to keep track of
 

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:37.930
markers the best way to keep track of
them so you know which marker got

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:37.940
them so you know which marker got
 

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:43.690
them so you know which marker got
pressed sorry infowindow not markers so

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:43.700
pressed sorry infowindow not markers so
 

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.930
pressed sorry infowindow not markers so
I mean Linden the way I would probably

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:46.940
I mean Linden the way I would probably
 

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:51.040
I mean Linden the way I would probably
do this is a use different listeners or

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:51.050
do this is a use different listeners or
 

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:53.320
do this is a use different listeners or
some sort of identified to track within

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:53.330
some sort of identified to track within
 

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:58.330
some sort of identified to track within
your your info window listener to to

00:47:58.330 --> 00:47:58.340
your your info window listener to to
 

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:01.540
your your info window listener to to
work out which one got pressed having

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:01.550
work out which one got pressed having
 

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.400
work out which one got pressed having
said that yeah I'm Felix any anything

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:03.410
said that yeah I'm Felix any anything
 

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:05.320
said that yeah I'm Felix any anything
else you want to add on top of that yeah

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:05.330
else you want to add on top of that yeah
 

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.360
else you want to add on top of that yeah
so we actually had to had to do that for

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:07.370
so we actually had to had to do that for
 

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:09.190
so we actually had to had to do that for
the Santa tracker app as well and

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200
the Santa tracker app as well and
 

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.950
the Santa tracker app as well and
basically via meters keeping track of it

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:11.960
basically via meters keeping track of it
 

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.660
basically via meters keeping track of it
the same way so we have registered a few

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:13.670
the same way so we have registered a few
 

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:17.830
the same way so we have registered a few
listeners and he basically just have a

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:17.840
listeners and he basically just have a
 

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.020
listeners and he basically just have a
tag for each of the markers so we know

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:20.030
tag for each of the markers so we know
 

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:23.500
tag for each of the markers so we know
which which mark has been pressed so

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:23.510
which which mark has been pressed so
 

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:24.940
which which mark has been pressed so
yeah because you can only register one

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:24.950
yeah because you can only register one
 

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:26.020
yeah because you can only register one
listeners your kind of multiple

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:26.030
listeners your kind of multiple
 

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:28.750
listeners your kind of multiple
listeners but but if you if you listen

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760
listeners but but if you if you listen
 

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.480
listeners but but if you if you listen
for market clicks so you know when you

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:31.490
for market clicks so you know when you
 

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.790
for market clicks so you know when you
want to display the info window and when

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800
want to display the info window and when
 

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.070
want to display the info window and when
you dismiss the the intravenous or on on

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:36.080
you dismiss the the intravenous or on on
 

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.960
you dismiss the the intravenous or on on
