[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.780
ABDUR-RAHMAN EL-SAYED: We
established the company back

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.100
in 2012.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.990
Back then, if you wanted to
read Arabic news on mobile,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.340
it was very, very hectic.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.580
We decided to solve this problem
by building a personalized

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.620
Arabic news reader that is
able to aggregate all the news

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.560
and deliver it to the
right person based

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.909
on their preference and
based on their location.

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:24.700
ABDULLAH EL-SAYED:
Android has the majority

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.120
of the smartphone market
share in the Middle East.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.560
So we knew that
publishing Nabd on Android

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.930
was key to our success.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.070
Since we launched
Nabd on Google Play,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.480
we have seen the app growing
massively in a very short time.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.350
Currently, 60% of our users
are on the Android platform.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.540
The number of daily
installs we get on Android

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.230
is two times higher
than other platforms.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.730
User engagement is
extremely high on Nabd.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.720
Users can share
stories, favorite them,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.050
or comment on them within
the Nabd community.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.440
Every quarter, there is
over 7 million stories

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.980
that are being shared on social
networks by Android users.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.610
And we found that
the average number

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.290
of shared stories per user
is 20% higher on Android

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.569
than other platforms.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.450
One of the reasons why
engagement on Android is higher

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.120
is the fact that we
implemented material design.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.830
When material design
was announced,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.120
we were impressed with
the new visual style

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.400
and the functionalities.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.230
It took us three months to
redesign the app completely

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.020
and make the transition
to material design.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.270
One of the major changes
we've done in the new version

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.580
was adding a Material
Design tab layout.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.820
We shifted one of the
sections from the side menu

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.980
to the tab layout, and we found
that the users who discovered

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.470
the section increased by 400%.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.740
Once we redesigned the app, we
used store-listing experiments

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.680
to find the optimal
screenshots and the best

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.940
order of screenshots
that lead to the highest

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.270
number of installs.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.090
We also found that having a
video in your store listing

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.420
increases conversions by 8%.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.540
Material Design had
a significant impact

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.970
on user behavior.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.680
For us, the most
exciting part was

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.940
to see that the number
of five-star ratings

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.910
actually tripled
after the new version.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.540
We constantly use
Google Analytics

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.290
to understand the
behavior of users

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.070
and how they interact
with the app.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.389
And based on our analysis, we
optimized the design of the app

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.525
in order to get
the best results.

00:02:10.525 --> 00:02:12.400
ABDUR-RAHMAN EL-SAYED:
Three years ago, there

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.890
was no such thing as Nabd.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.750
Today we're over 25
people across four offices

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.700
in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Dubai,
Egypt, and very soon in Turkey.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.200
And that feels amazing.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.340
It's a joy and a passion
that I can't really explain.
