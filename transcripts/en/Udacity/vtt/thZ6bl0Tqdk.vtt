00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.280
Here are a handful of methods that can
help you during the understand stage.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.720
I'll give you a quick overview
of each of these methods.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.810
The first is 360 degree lightning talks.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.885
As Nadia mentioned, 360 degree
lightning talks are incredibly useful.

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:21.256
The deliverable of the design sprint
should meet the business goals,

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:25.860
satisfy user needs and be possible
with current or emerging technology.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.920
Here are the questions that
should be addressed by anyone who

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.946
gives these talks.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:33.551
For the business side, that person
should be able to address what's

00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:36.797
profitable and sustainable for
the business in the long run?

00:00:36.797 --> 00:00:39.582
And what are the current business needs?

00:00:39.582 --> 00:00:43.241
Anyone speaking to the user
experience should be able to answer,

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:44.447
what do people need?

00:00:44.447 --> 00:00:47.883
And what's delightful or
useful to the user?

00:00:47.883 --> 00:00:48.671
And finally,

00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:52.620
someone should be able to speak
knowledgeably to technical concerns.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.895
What's possible with today's technology?

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:58.563
Or what features can be built now or
over time?

00:00:58.563 --> 00:01:02.667
Lightning talks are meant to be a quick
way to address those major concerns.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:05.245
Now of any of these
activities that you do,

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:07.763
you should be sure to
do user interviews.

00:01:07.763 --> 00:01:11.268
You want to talk to users at
the beginning of the design sprint and

00:01:11.268 --> 00:01:14.787
at the end of the design sprint,
so you can validate your work.

00:01:14.787 --> 00:01:18.979
User interviews allow you to understand
the goals and the motivations of users,

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.798
you might also try exploring some of
their emotions and how they feel about

00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:26.827
existing products or about particular
features that you want to implement.

00:01:26.827 --> 00:01:30.599
If you have existing designs, you can
definitely ask a user about them.

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.582
If not, you could always ask a user
about a competitor's design.

00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:37.785
The interview should follow
a sort of arc like this.

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:39.871
You want to get to know
the interviewee at first,

00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:43.500
so make them feel comfortable and
keep a conversational tone.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.270
You also want to be genuinely
interested in the person, so

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.810
you can ask them starter
questions just to build rapport.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.960
Then you can plan your
questions accordingly, so

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.630
you can get out their own stories and
the general moments in this diagram.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.540
Be sure to thank the user and
wrap-up with any followup steps.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.920
If you don't have any
current user research,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.640
then you should definitely consider
going to visit actual users.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.470
This would be a field visit.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.430
A field visit or

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.720
field study will let you observe how
consumers use similar products or

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.400
you can take note of the context in
which users use that product or service.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.948
You can also ask questions about
their behaviors, they're likes and

00:02:21.948 --> 00:02:24.304
interests and
their pain points or problems.

00:02:24.304 --> 00:02:27.902
You might do usability testing with
them, if you have current designs.

00:02:27.902 --> 00:02:31.740
Or you might competitor designs,
if you don't have current ones.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.560
Or finally, you might gather feedback on
early ideas, copy for your webpage or

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.190
app and
particular features that users may want.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.220
This would just be concept testing.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.840
A stakeholder map is another necessity
that can help you think about

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.440
all the players related to your
business or your industry.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.350
For example, the stakeholder map for

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.390
the SuperDuper shopping
app would look like this.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.493
Notice that this map includes internal
stakeholders, such as the user and

00:02:59.493 --> 00:03:03.869
external stakeholders,
like the suppliers and specialists.

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:07.995
You could imagine building up particular
features from recommendations of

00:03:07.995 --> 00:03:09.674
a nutritionist or allergist.

00:03:09.674 --> 00:03:13.789
These specialists might play a role in
recommending foods to particular users

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.032
based on their dietary restrictions,
their dietary goals or

00:03:17.032 --> 00:03:19.270
their cooking habits.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.010
This last activity is another great way
to get perspective on the industry.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.110
You can check out competitor's apps or
websites to get a sense for

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.130
what they're doing.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.274
This can help you figure out what's
happening in your current space or

00:03:31.274 --> 00:03:31.815
industry.

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:36.354
And you can also analyze, how's your
approach different from these others?

00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:39.838
Is it a subset of features or
is it marketing efforts?

00:03:39.838 --> 00:03:44.128
You can also see particular UI
elements or design elements and flows,

00:03:44.128 --> 00:03:47.628
that appeal to you and
others that you might want to avoid.

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:49.048
Whatever methods you choose,

00:03:49.048 --> 00:03:53.200
you should make sure that you summarize
your findings from the activities.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.180
These findings should be on your mind
and on the minds of anyone on your team,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.480
as you go into the next
stage of the design sprint.
