00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.690
- [Narrator] My English instructor

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.640
teaches Richard Wright's Black Boy

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.770
as a masterful example of how an author

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.870
writes to reveal the emotions
of the story's protagonist.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.880
Alright, that seems like a
reasonable way to write it,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.550
but let's look at the other choices.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.310
My English instructor
talks about Black Boy

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.010
like it's the best book ever,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.580
because the author writes to reveal

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.110
the emotions of the story's protagonist.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.970
Well the tone here just
seems too informal.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.310
It might be how some folks talk,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.860
but it isn't how you would
necessarily wanna write,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.050
especially the rest of the sentence

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.540
doesn't have that informal tone.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.040
Writes to reveal the emotions
of the story's protagonist.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.590
This right over here, this part over here,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.020
isn't an informal tone, so it feels weird

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.830
that the underlined
part would be informal.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.990
So I would rule this one out.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.140
My English instructor can't get enough

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.830
of Richard Wright's Black Boy

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.100
because she thinks it's a sweet example

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.490
of how an author writes to reveal

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.220
the emotions of the story's protagonist.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.300
So this one feels even more informal.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.790
So this one's even more informal.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.240
More

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.073
informal.

00:01:06.073 --> 00:01:08.760
You're saying because she
thinks it's a sweet example.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.660
She can't get enough of
Richard Wright's book.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.630
So this one I would definitely rule out.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.190
That's going even a more extreme.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.530
My English instructor revels in

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.150
the exploration of race relations

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.880
that Richard Wright employs in Black Boy,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.720
because she luxuriates
in an author who writes

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.980
to reveal the emotions of
the story's protagonist.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.280
So this choice over
here actually just feels

00:01:35.544 --> 00:01:37.790
too official, too formal.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.910
It's going in the
complete other direction,

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.530
and they're unnecessarily
using fancy words here.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.070
Revels in the exploration
of race relations

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.790
that Richard Wright employs in Black Boy

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.250
because she luxuriates in an author.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.050
So that just seems a
little bit over the top,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.460
a little bit too formal.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.210
So I would rule this out.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.030
The best tone is actually what they have.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.160
My English teacher teaches
Richard Wright's Black Boy

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.810
as a masterful example
of how an author writes

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.330
to reveal the emotions of
the story's protagonist.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.470
And I wanna be clear.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.100
Any of these choices, the
grammar is not correct.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.150
Sorry, the grammar isn't incorrect,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.400
but it's more about tone here.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.220
That we really just wanna hit the tone

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.740
that we're not too informal
like these two choices

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.360
right over here, like these two choices,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.540
and not too formal or kinda of

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.290
using too complex language or words

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.930
or more complex than we need to.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.933
So I actually like it the
way that it's written.
