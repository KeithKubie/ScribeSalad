00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.260
You are listening to radiolab radio from

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.130
W. N. Y. S. E. N. N. P. R. They got it. Okay. They got it. What up ladies?

3
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.780
Hey, how's it going at Jad? It is. Yeah,

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.670
it is indeed. Hey. Hi. Yay. This is Jad Abumrad, this is the radio lab today.

5
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.050
Robert and I invited two folks into the studio. Our former producer,

6
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:32.460
Lulu Miller basically started the show with us. She's even in the Sonic Id.

7
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.680
You can hear it right there. Say Okay. Okay. And we brought,

8
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:42.570
we invited her in and also Elise Spiegel reporter at NPR because Lulu and Elise

9
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:47.550
together are starting new radio show and a podcast and everyone's very excited

10
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:51.060
about it. It's called Invisibilia. So like a Latin word. What does that,

11
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.290
it is a Latin word. It's a name that my mother came up with.

12
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.120
This is the least talking. Um,

13
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.630
cause she's a French video blister and so they just like no stuff like that.

14
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.100
Under what circumstances did this come up? We were just, you know,

15
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.810
hang in the way that the Spiegels hang in like her bedroom. And I was like,

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.370
but this is what the show is about.

17
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.430
It's about all these invisible things to and physical,

18
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:18.780
but they're affecting you. And what's the name? And she was just like,

19
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:23.610
why don't you just call it Invisibilia did a little, oh, I was like,

20
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.450
and I'm glad for what invisible things.

21
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.990
So the show promises to be sort of an investigation of all the invisible things

22
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:36.810
that, uh, guide our behavior that we generally don't see now.

23
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.070
They've been sharing some stories that they've been working on as they're going.

24
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.080
And a lot of it is kind of amazing. So we, uh,

25
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.040
we asked them if we could preview, uh, one of their stories for you guys. Uh,

26
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.270
this one that you're going to hear comes from an hour that they're producing,

27
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.830
uh, on the topic of categories like, uh, the different, uh,

28
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.770
boxes that we put things in our world into.

29
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.210
And the first piece in the show looks at one of the most basic categories that

30
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:11.160
there is the first question that any buddy asks a parent who has a new baby.

31
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.090
Is it a boy or girl? I have to say in my career,

32
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:20.091
I have done a number of stories about blurring between boy and girl,

33
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.080
but the story I'm about to tell you is about a kind of blurring that I had never

34
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:26.330
heard of before.

35
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.930
This is a person I met who calls herself Paige Abendroth.

36
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.970
Evan Roth means the color of the sky when it's that deep red.

37
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:42.660
Right before the sunsets, Paige had bright blue eyes,

38
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.760
long black hair and a ponytail. Go ahead and make yourself think.

39
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.500
We were in San Diego by the way, setting ourselves up to talk.

40
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.850
I'm going to make you skip, skip, skip, skip, skip it. Let's get together.

41
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.780
So after we sat down,

42
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.470
I asked page to show me some pictures of herself from about a decade before.

43
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.670
So there aren't many in the pictures. Was a man,

44
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.820
a man in a naval uniform. He was very buff. Strapping,

45
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.050
yeah, very military.

46
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.030
I had a high and tight haircut and there they were.

47
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.010
Those bright blue eyes. You look very, you look pretty conservative here too.

48
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.873
Yes I do.

49
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.813
<v 1>Right</v>

50
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.820
<v 0>page. Spent the first three decades of her life as a man,</v>

51
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.240
but let me be clear from the top pages.

52
00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:37.170
Story is not the transgender story that you typically hear.

53
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.170
Typically people who are transgender,

54
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:44.370
I feel like they are one gender trapped in the body of the other gender.

55
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.980
Their internal gender identity is misaligned with their biological sex,

56
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.490
but it's static. It stays the same.

57
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.570
But when I was talking to Paige that didn't capture her experience at all

58
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.190
because when I met her page was flipping,

59
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.410
flipping between the category male and the category female.

60
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.230
I flipped back and forth multiple times a day.

61
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.740
I'll say maybe you spend 20% of my time in guy mode and the rest of it and

62
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:21.444
female mode.

63
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.830
One morning Paige would wake up feeling strongly that the gender at the core of

64
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:27.240
her being was female,

65
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.810
but then suddenly it's just kind of like there was a change and page was in guy

66
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:35.940
mode. When that happened,

67
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.240
all kinds of things about page changed,

68
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.980
her posture changed and my weight kind of moves up to my shoulders.

69
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.790
Like my center of gravity is kind of up here more significantly.

70
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.960
She told me there was a real psychological shift.

71
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.230
The way I see the world and the way I interpret the world is different.

72
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.730
When Paige was in male mode,

73
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.330
Paige was less interested in people in talking to them,

74
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.760
in making eye contact with them.

75
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.890
I'm a lot more introverted. I'm a lot more, I'm quieter,

76
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.010
but in female mode she was much more expansive and sights,

77
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.480
sounds, smells, likes, dislikes. They were all different. When I'm female,

78
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.510
all my emotions are like just really vivid, like colors.

79
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.583
Basically.

80
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.890
Paige was constantly and very abruptly bounced between two starkly different

81
00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:37.101
ways of being in and filtering the world page wasn't able to dictate when or

82
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:41.010
where this happened. I really have no control over it.

83
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.060
She'd be sitting in her office talking to her boss and Bam.

84
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.120
She'd be walking down the street, Bam.

85
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.880
Now when this happened,

86
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.780
it wasn't like page was an entirely different person.

87
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.520
I'm always the same person. I the world differently,

88
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.640
<v 2>but I'm still me. I still am in control of myself.</v>

89
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:04.430
I still have my same wants and desires.

90
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.960
<v 0>There was just this profound difference beneath everything.</v>

91
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.540
<v 2>It's just a sense of knowing,</v>

92
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:15.290
like the way that you know you're a female right now without having to be told.

93
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.040
It's the same way that I know that I'm a female and when I'm a guy,

94
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:20.630
it's the same way. I know I'm a guy.

95
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:24.430
It's just this instinctual knowing of what I am. Yeah.

96
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.170
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

97
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.430
<v 0>by the way, right now, are you male or female?</v>

98
00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:35.820
Definitely in girl mind. Yeah. And how long have you been in girl mode?

99
00:06:35.821 --> 00:06:38.340
Right now? I'm bout an hour, I'd say.

100
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.760
So maybe you're thinking that page seems nuts.

101
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.760
[inaudible] Paige herself has had that thought.

102
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.090
I thought that I was going crazy. Yeah. I mean, um,

103
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.120
some people first hear about this, um, you know,

104
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.850
they may wonder if it's dissociative identity disorder,

105
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.880
which is formerly known as multiple personality disorder or a form of psychosis.

106
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.540
This is Laura Case,

107
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.340
a researcher who has worked in the lab of a very famous neurologist amend named

108
00:07:08.341 --> 00:07:10.440
V s Rama Shondra and [inaudible].

109
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.120
And a couple of years ago they got an email from a woman describing exactly the

110
00:07:15.121 --> 00:07:16.380
same kind of experience.

111
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.440
That page describes someone who experiences this switching back and forth.

112
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.870
And while on the one hand they were dubious,

113
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.710
we get a lot of interesting emails in our lab emails from people claiming all

114
00:07:28.711 --> 00:07:33.330
kinds of wild sounding experiences. On the other hand,

115
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.050
they study the brain and they have seen brains do all kinds of things.

116
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.450
They've seen brains that suddenly stop recognizing faces,

117
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.640
brains that think their owner has a mysterious limb. So they were curious,

118
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.480
here's a person who goes back and forth in terms of what their brain seems to be

119
00:07:51.481 --> 00:07:53.220
telling them about whether they're male or female.

120
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.270
How fascinating would that be to look and see what could be changing in the

121
00:07:57.271 --> 00:08:02.100
brain, um, or in their environment to be causing that shift in identity.

122
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.910
So they decided to look into it over the past couple of years,

123
00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:10.911
case has found dozens of people with this experience and case has started

124
00:08:11.041 --> 00:08:15.300
testing them in different ways, including giving them psychological screenings.

125
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.840
And what she found was that as a group,

126
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.200
these people are not mentally unstable.

127
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.720
They simply don't have dissociative identity disorder.

128
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.320
None of them had any form of psychosis or anything like that.

129
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:33.480
They ruled out bipolar, schizophrenia and saw some other interesting things.

130
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.850
They were actually a little bit more ambidextrous,

131
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.380
more than the general population.

132
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.550
Basically they found enough to suggest that there might be something

133
00:08:41.551 --> 00:08:46.530
neurological going on. So they published a very, very small study,

134
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.670
a preliminary sort of report in a journal called medical hypotheses and then

135
00:08:50.671 --> 00:08:54.590
started on another study. But we're not, not ready to, um,

136
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.870
talk the data from that study. I did though,

137
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.820
get one tidbit about this from case, and again,

138
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.370
this is very, very, very, very preliminary,

139
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.820
but she found that the same person will perform differently on certain tests

140
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.760
depending on whether they are in male or female mode. For example,

141
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.180
she gave the same person these mental puzzles that test spacial and language

142
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.170
abilities. And Lulu, you know how men are really good at, um,

143
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:30.230
supposedly men are really good at kind of spatial directions and they're like

144
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.330
spatial manipulation. What does that mean?

145
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.550
I don't know how to explain it exactly,

146
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:39.780
but like you're a woman so you wouldn't understand and so I wouldn't understand

147
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:43.200
it very well. Right. I'm like,

148
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:47.310
take a geometric shape rotated in your mind, stuff like that. Okay.

149
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.290
They found when they gave these tests to these people when they were in their

150
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:55.470
different states, they had different abilities. Oh Wow.

151
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.150
So like when they were men,

152
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.690
they performed more as men and when they were women they performed more as

153
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:03.330
women. Whoa. Yeah.

154
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:08.450
We did see some differences between gender six that were intriguing.

155
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.940
Um, but not conclusive. Anyway, here's the point.

156
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.410
There is some evidence that the shifts these people say that they are

157
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:19.770
experiencing could be real,

158
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.290
which brings us back to page. You know, I wake up in the morning, I'm like,

159
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.940
am I male and a female?

160
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.970
I wanted to talk to her about what it was like to move in this way between

161
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:33.450
categories.

162
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.570
So let's just start with like your childhood now.

163
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.160
Page didn't start off this way. She started off as a hey,

164
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:49.670
who really didn't even have that experience that you sometimes hear about where

165
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:52.320
people described feeling from a very early age,

166
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.200
like they're trapped in the wrong body. I mean,

167
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:57.990
I love playing with Jay Jos and as a teen to,

168
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:02.220
he was a boy obsessed with the things that most boys are obsessed with.

169
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.560
I always thought about women, you never thought you were good.

170
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.220
Still Page says there were these strange momentary flashes that were disturbing.

171
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.090
I remember looking at girls and um,

172
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.540
<v 3>not just being attracted to them but thinking that I was supposed to be them and</v>

173
00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:23.510
wishing that I could kind of go over to the girl group and be accepted because

174
00:11:23.511 --> 00:11:27.620
that's where I felt I should be. But these thoughts were really inconsistent.

175
00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:32.510
It's not, I didn't always feel that way. So Paige grows up,

176
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.340
graduated from high school,

177
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:39.620
goes to college and then really starts to struggle.

178
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.100
The flashes are still there, college is hard,

179
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.780
page drops out and begins to feel really, really lost.

180
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.880
And then in a somewhat odd place, page finds relief

181
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.080
in the navy. I love the discipline of it. The structure of it. First of all,

182
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:03.610
for some reason those flashes go way down. Why?

183
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:10.000
I don't know. I saw myself as being more of a guy than I ever did before,

184
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.590
but really it was while stationed at a naval base in Japan.

185
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.150
The page found relief in a way that will be familiar to many of you.

186
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.210
I walked around the corner and I saw her and she was just kind of bouncing

187
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:26.320
around and she was very energetic and it was love at first sight.

188
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.830
Immediately I knew that there was something like special about her and even

189
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:34.831
though page had never been a very aggressive person page completely went after

190
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:37.090
this girl. I was smitten.

191
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.100
I was immediately smitten and it worked.

192
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.350
<v 2>We were just like this, we so in tune with one another.</v>

193
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.480
I mean we knew each other so good.

194
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:49.570
We can communicate like with a series of clicks, like what do you mean?

195
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.820
<v 3>And like the other person would answer back and we know what we were like</v>

196
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.640
getting it in. Sometimes it would mean like,

197
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.420
<v 2>do you mean like how are you? Or it could just be acknowledging that you know,</v>

198
00:13:02.421 --> 00:13:03.350
you're there.

199
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.250
<v 3>So began the best chapter in pages. Like,</v>

200
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:18.100
I can't wait, you're recording this. They get married, they moved to California,

201
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.890
got a home, a car, had a steady job.

202
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.300
I had everything that I ever wanted. Okay,

203
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:28.180
what does that mean? It depends on the context.

204
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.930
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

205
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:46.930
<v 3>and then page turns 30 and all of a sudden starts feeling really,</v>

206
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.710
really tired. I mean just coming up the steps I would run out of breath.

207
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.200
So page goes to see the doctor

208
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.270
<v 2>and eventually what they finally figured out was that my body thought it'd be a</v>

209
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:01.900
really fun joke on me to stop producing testosterone.

210
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.880
Basically at 30 years old, I had the testosterone level of an 80 plus year old

211
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.620
<v 3>man.</v>

212
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.620
So the doctors put page on testosterone replacement therapy and very quickly the

213
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:17.380
exhaustion went away. Physically, I felt like I had before,

214
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.860
but the flashes there back with a vengeance,

215
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.650
I would have those

216
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.940
<v 2>feelings again where I thought I was supposed to be female, except it wasn't.</v>

217
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:29.560
There wasn't anything subtle about it.

218
00:14:29.561 --> 00:14:34.561
It was a very strong feeling that something had gone terribly wrong

219
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.770
<v 3>in that I was not supposed to be male</v>

220
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.940
in these moments. Page would look down at her body,

221
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.790
this hard torso covered in hair

222
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.210
and feel utter disgust.

223
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.320
Imagine you woke up and your body was a cockroach.

224
00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.460
It was really unsettling. Did you,

225
00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:05.840
so did you start talking to your wife about it? No, I was terrified.

226
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.800
Um, I thought I was going crazy. Um,

227
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.620
I didn't want her to think less of me and uh,

228
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.340
it was something that I kept inside.

229
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.430
[inaudible] Paige started telling me that occasionally during this period to

230
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.720
ease this feeling of disgust that came over her when she flipped into female

231
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:31.790
mode but had a male body,

232
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.180
she would secretly put on women's clothing.

233
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:40.570
She felt a need to cover this body that felt so wrong with clothes from the

234
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:43.890
right sack. It's just, I was just trying to do anything I could to,

235
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.220
to make myself feel more female.

236
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.700
So I started asking questions about this.

237
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.370
Do you remember the first time you decided to do that?

238
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.770
[inaudible] but suddenly the whole tone of the conversation changed.

239
00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:58.790
I don't want to talk about it.

240
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.310
<v 4>Okay.</v>

241
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:05.040
<v 3>All right. So when was so after that, what happened? So we like you,</v>

242
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.890
<v 4>um, do you need to take a break?</v>

243
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.310
<v 3>Um, yeah, I'm cool. Yes, you're cool. You want to take a break or yes.</v>

244
00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.550
You're not cool. Yeah. Okay. Sure.

245
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.690
Paige got up and disappeared around the corner.

246
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:28.400
I could hear the faucet running in the bathroom and when she came back she

247
00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:32.150
wanted me to know something. Um, if it matters, I flipped back into game mode.

248
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.250
Okay. So the, is that why you don't want to talk? It's just kind of like,

249
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.710
it's just different now you flipped into guy mode.

250
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.090
Was it when your eyes closed that you flipped into guy mode? I don't know.

251
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.410
So are you in guy mode right this second?

252
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.760
[inaudible] so is it hard to answer questions? [inaudible]

253
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.310
okay. Okay. I can, I'll be okay. I just need like a little bit,

254
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:08.770
we sat awkwardly for a while. Neither of us quite sure what to do.

255
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.640
It did feel like there was a difference in page even in the way that she talked

256
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.940
about. So how are you doing? I'm good. Are you male or female? No.

257
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.460
Okay. Is that okay? Yeah.

258
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:26.320
Let's do this next year.

285
00:19:06.551 --> 00:19:11.480
Invisibilia and we'll continue with our story about page. Evan drouth gears,

286
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.380
elite Spiegel to pick up the tail

287
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.511
<v 3>page,</v>

288
00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:19.830
explained that the next chapter of her life involved finding a name for what was

289
00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:22.110
going on with her by gender,

290
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.970
people who consider themselves both female and male at the same time,

291
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:32.130
she found it on a bigender website and though only a small portion of the people

292
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:35.220
on the website described flipping like page,

293
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.910
it felt like this could be an explanation.

294
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.650
The way I felt was other people felt that way and it was, it was real.

295
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.830
It wasn't, you know, just some weird psychological construct.

296
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.970
But with this validation came a horrible realization.

297
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:57.440
Paige had to tell her why I told her that we needed to talk and so sat down in

298
00:19:58.411 --> 00:20:01.500
separate chairs. I think I was on a couch and she was on a,

299
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.320
her recliner page was terrified.

300
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.880
She was certain that her marriage would be over and she was very visibly upset.

301
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.583
<v 8>Sorry.</v>

302
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.143
<v 3>I was just</v>

303
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:15.483
<v 8>God.</v>

304
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.830
<v 3>Oh. It was just begging her to,</v>

305
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.970
to not leave and to accept me for who I was.

306
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.870
I couldn't, I lived for her for so long.

307
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.120
I didn't know I could live with that.

308
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:38.963
<v 9>Uh Huh.</v>

309
00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.380
<v 3>To page a surprise. Her wife said it's okay.</v>

310
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.800
She told me that everything was going to be okay and that, you know,

311
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.100
we're gonna make this work and, and she wasn't gonna give up on me.

312
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.553
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

313
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.440
<v 3>page couldn't believe how lucky she was</v>

314
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.200
together. They walked into this space between categories.

315
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.260
Some mornings. Paige would wake up male, the husband,

316
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:19.120
her wife had married that men would put on male clothes, go to work,

317
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.170
other mornings paid would wake up female,

318
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:28.180
a woman trapped in this strange body and they were doing it,

319
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.300
helping each other through life in this odd space.

320
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.913
<v 8>Okay,</v>

321
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.960
<v 0>but one problem remain as much as the two of them could get used to the idea of</v>

322
00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:42.234
flipping

323
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.190
page couldn't get used to the physical experience of it.

324
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.410
I came out of the shower one day and I had gone in and guy mode.

325
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.690
I came out and female Moan.

326
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.900
She was standing there beginning to dry off and I saw myself in the mirror and I

327
00:21:57.871 --> 00:22:02.871
was so disgusted that I threw up these kinds of feelings happened all of the

328
00:22:03.331 --> 00:22:08.130
time. Now Paige had come across a potential cure for this,

329
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.660
a sort of homespun remedy that some of the bigender folks had written about

330
00:22:12.661 --> 00:22:15.270
online. It involved hormones.

331
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.280
Page would go on estrogen to make her body more androgynous.

332
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.110
Bring my body too.

333
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:23.560
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

334
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.320
<v 0>an androgynous point where I could present both as either male or female.</v>

335
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:32.940
Apparently it would reduce the shock of being thrown between categories so

336
00:22:32.941 --> 00:22:37.380
violently if her body was in a permanent state of inbetween.

337
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.680
So Paige decided to try it.

338
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.070
She began estrogen treatments and it worked.

339
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.120
The first time I got my first injection,

340
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.680
I just felt this immense relief like I was finally on the right track.

341
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.890
There was no longer the same physical discomfort,

342
00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:01.130
but as Paige finally was becoming comfortable in her own body,

343
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.280
page's wife started to turn away. They began sleeping in different bedrooms.

344
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.400
It was almost like we were becoming strangers and one there just came a point

345
00:23:14.191 --> 00:23:18.040
where I realized that, you know, she wasn't suddenly gonna.

346
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.120
<v 6>I don't know except you.</v>

347
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.290
<v 0>She tried really hard</v>

348
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:29.890
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

349
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.840
<v 3>but it's really difficult</v>

350
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:34.403
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

351
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:39.510
<v 3>when things don't have a clear category that's scary for us all there are sheep</v>

352
00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:42.340
we don't recognize.

353
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.190
I felt like a monster.

354
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.120
<v 2>I felt like</v>

355
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:57.040
this terrible like alien creature that had come down and taken over her

356
00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:01.460
husband's life and

357
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.910
taking him away from her.

358
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.430
One night I heard her crying in the bathroom and I asked her if everything was

359
00:24:16.431 --> 00:24:20.720
okay and she said no, and she said, it's over, isn't it?

360
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.630
And I think the next day she told me to move out.

361
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:30.260
I mourned for my marriage the same way I would mourn for like, you know,

362
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:35.060
the death of, you know, my mother or someone who I was really,

363
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:35.930
really close with.

364
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.070
<v 0>See, right now I just,</v>

365
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:46.410
it's really hard to talk about still sitting there in page's apartment,

366
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.290
the afternoon light fading in the window behind her.

367
00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:54.180
I was just struck by how hard her situation was.

368
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:59.490
It's not just the fact that page wasn't in one clear gender category.

369
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.390
She was stuck between categories in other ways as well.

370
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.450
In the weeks before and after our visit,

371
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.350
I had called around trying to get a handle on how to make sense of this

372
00:25:10.351 --> 00:25:13.500
experience that people like page describe.

373
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.360
I had spoken to all kinds of people, therapists, historians,

374
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:19.620
gender researchers,

375
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:25.550
but it seemed like a lot of the people that I spoke to were convinced that the

376
00:25:26.551 --> 00:25:31.530
experience I was describing didn't really exist.

377
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.880
There's no way they're actually flipping between genders.

378
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:40.560
I was told by two different gender researchers into different European

379
00:25:40.561 --> 00:25:43.230
countries. These people are just psychotic.

380
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.110
Both of the men who told me this had worked in gender research for their entire

381
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.770
professional careers and they sounded extremely confident.

382
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.090
A gender therapist in San Francisco was also skeptical,

383
00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.980
but she had a different reason.

384
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:04.050
These people are actually just normal transgendered people.

385
00:26:04.051 --> 00:26:08.100
She explained in the sense that they are experiencing the same things that any

386
00:26:08.101 --> 00:26:10.050
transgender person experiences,

387
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.520
they've just developed a different way of describing it. Same experience.

388
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.540
Different labels seem to be her argument. In other words,

389
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:24.090
it's not just that page was existing between genders.

390
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.940
The problem was even more profound.

391
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.960
Most of the people that I talked to didn't seem to believe that the experience

392
00:26:33.181 --> 00:26:37.590
that Paige was saying that she had was real

393
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.910
like, why do you think this happened to you?

394
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:50.810
<v 2>Like where does this come from in you? I don't know.</v>

395
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.630
I've stopped asking myself that because it doesn't matter anymore where it came

396
00:26:56.631 --> 00:26:59.330
from. I just kind of am what I am.

397
00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.420
<v 0>When we talked page seemed as mystified by what was happening to her as anyone</v>

398
00:27:04.421 --> 00:27:05.254
else,

399
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.430
but her experience she concluded was her experience.

400
00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.200
There wasn't that much she could do about it.

401
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:16.490
<v 2>Like my biggest worry is that I'm never going to really fit in to like female</v>

402
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:18.930
spaces or male spaces.

403
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:23.040
I am afraid that I'm going to be living the rest of my life in some kind of

404
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:25.260
weird gender twilight zone.

405
00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.150
<v 0>And what will you do then?</v>

406
00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:32.773
<v 10>I don't know.</v>

407
00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.920
<v 2>I'll keep on doing my best</v>

408
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:41.100
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

409
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.400
<v 0>more than a year after we first met, I called Paige up on the phone.</v>

410
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:49.410
I wanted to check in and see how she was doing and it was clear from the very

411
00:27:49.411 --> 00:27:52.530
first moment she answered that something was different.

412
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:57.090
Her voice sounded different. Higher. Hello? Hi. Can you hear me?

413
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:58.523
<v 11>Yeah. I can.</v>

414
00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.540
<v 0>Turns out about six months after I went to San Diego,</v>

415
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:06.460
the flippings started to fade and eventually Paige had settled full time into

416
00:28:06.461 --> 00:28:07.294
being a woman.

417
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:12.130
The last time page had flipped into being psychologically male was in the fast

418
00:28:12.131 --> 00:28:16.630
food restaurant, five guys, and she said it took her completely by surprise.

419
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:21.500
<v 11>I've gotten so used to constantly spaying like I am, you know,</v>

420
00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:26.300
now as a woman that I've thought it had stopped and I remember I flipped her

421
00:28:26.301 --> 00:28:28.680
really hard. It was, it was really bizarre.

422
00:28:28.681 --> 00:28:32.720
I felt like I was wearing a a really uncomfortable sweater or something like

423
00:28:32.721 --> 00:28:33.554
that.

424
00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:34.300
<v 0>No page.</v>

425
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.990
Couldn't really explain why the flipping had stopped any better than she could

426
00:28:37.991 --> 00:28:39.850
explain why it had started.

427
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.900
She said she thought the estrogen hormones she'd taken to make her body more

428
00:28:43.901 --> 00:28:48.250
androgynous probably had affected her and Laura Case,

429
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:52.480
the researcher who's been studying people like page agrees that hormones do

430
00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.890
affect the brain, but still there was no way to be absolutely certain,

431
00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.050
but there was one thing,

432
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:04.090
the page seemed absolutely clear about living in one category.

433
00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.420
Even if it's a category that's often discriminated against,

434
00:29:07.421 --> 00:29:12.421
like transgendered women is way better than having no category.

435
00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:17.180
<v 11>Oh my goodness. Yes. It's so much easier.</v>

436
00:29:17.181 --> 00:29:21.780
It's so much more manageable in the world to me. Just,

437
00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.240
it makes so much more sense

438
00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:28.120
<v 0>now. Paige knew what she was supposed to do where she could place her foot.</v>

439
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.900
She didn't have a wife, but she did have that

440
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.733
<v 10>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

441
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.510
<v 6>what I really want to know since I have never heard of anybody like this,</v>

442
00:29:58.511 --> 00:30:01.900
I didn't know this was this was in the inhuman experience.

443
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:07.120
Are there a lot of these people, I mean is there like a teeny,

444
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:08.470
teeny handful or is this so,

445
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:14.120
<v 0>so I have spoken to maybe six people who have alternating gender Incan crudity</v>

446
00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:15.361
who flipped,

447
00:30:15.361 --> 00:30:19.440
who are there by gender and they kind of moved between their genders in this way

448
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.750
because there are lots of different ways of being by gender. Right. Um,

449
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:27.570
and click thing, never surprising the other people you spoke with,

450
00:30:27.571 --> 00:30:32.070
was it also suddenly like that? Yes. So they, they had that too, Huh? Yes.

451
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.170
Any idea what causes those sudden flips and exactly what Laura Case is trying to

452
00:30:37.171 --> 00:30:38.004
understand?

453
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.420
I think she has about 26 if these people that she has been talking to. And, um,

454
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:46.860
so she has been talking to these people, but I don't know that it's clear yet.

455
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:51.890
It could be biological or it could be a different kind of disorder.

456
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:56.990
It could simply be a different way of conceptualizing and experience that a lot

457
00:30:58.291 --> 00:30:59.460
of different people have.

458
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:04.490
We can't even say this is a condition with a strong in sharpie marker

459
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:11.040
declaration of now there's a name and now this exists.

460
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:16.070
Like there could be hundreds or thousands of people privately sitting with this,

461
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:20.640
and if, if that name came out, maybe they'd suddenly have a place.

462
00:31:20.641 --> 00:31:25.641
But the name right now itself is like in gray translucence.

463
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:28.980
What is the name again? Alternating gender in congruity.

464
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:32.160
What you're saying is this is really a mystery.

465
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.660
You don't really know what happened in the story. I mean,

466
00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:40.170
that's the, that's is in no category.
