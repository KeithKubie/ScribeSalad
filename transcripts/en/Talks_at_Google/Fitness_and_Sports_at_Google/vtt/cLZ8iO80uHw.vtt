[TITLE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.260
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: So
joining us today,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.260
we've got-- in the middle
here, Rosie Spaulding,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.900
the general manager of this
year's Rugby World Cup Sevens.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.120
Rosie has spent her
career executing

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.520
many high-profile
sporting events, including

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.370
Super Bowl 50 here
in California,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.520
and the 34th America's
Cup, which for those

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.920
of you not familiar is sailing.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.970
I don't know if we talk too much
about that one in New Zealand

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.750
anymore--

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.040
among others.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.960
Originally hailing
from the UK, Rosie

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.850
was previously the
events and marketing lead

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.760
for the Weymouth and Portland
National Sailing Academy,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.130
where she helped develop that
center into a world class

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.860
venue that would later host
the London 2012 Olympic sailing

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.360
events.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.762
So welcome, Rosie.

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:50.220
On the end of our
panel here, we've

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.430
got Ross Young, the
CEO of USA Rugby,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.920
and Ross comes to USA
Rugby with over 20 years

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.840
of experience in
international rugby,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.020
notably as the former general
manager to Rugby World Cup

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.130
Limited.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.550
Ross is also from the UK, and
was previously a police officer

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.660
for the metropolitan services--

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.270
police service in Twickenham.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.771
He moved to the US in 2013
when he joined "Ad-vaht-iss,"

00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:15.270
is that--

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.061
ROSS YOUNG: Atavus.

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:18.390
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Atavus,
in Seattle as the CEO,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.260
and is transitioning to being
the permanent CEO of USA Rugby.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.660
Has that come through?

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.010
When is that official?

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.700
ROSS YOUNG: It's near enough.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.130
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Near enough.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.130
ROSS YOUNG: So I'm
currently the CEO

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.300
of USA Rugby and
the interim CEO.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.770
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Got it.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.060
ROSS YOUNG: The Atavus
folks, all of the experience

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.630
was great for the
last five years.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.810
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Excellent.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.500
And last but not least,
we've got Blaine Scully who's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.950
captain of the USA men's
team, and is a local

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.090
born in Sacramento, California,
didn't begin playing rugby

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.380
until college, but took over
the game pretty quickly.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.540
At Berkeley-- obviously just
over the bridge --earned

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.850
the titles of
four-time All-American,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.360
captain of 2011 USA Rugby
Collegiate All-Americans

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.380
Touring Squad--

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.080
quite a mouthful --and
two national titles

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.900
with UC Berkeley.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.152
Formerly a member of the
Lester Tigers, is it?

00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:12.610
BLAINE SCULLY:
Lester Tigers, yeah.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.470
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Lester Tigers.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.410
Now the captain of the US men's
national team, and the Cardiff

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.250
Blues, the chair of the US
Rugby Players Association,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.590
which is an important role
that we'll probably get into.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.923
So please give a round of
applause to all of our guests.

00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:29.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.360
For all the panelists--

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.330
rugby has been gaining
popularity here in the US.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.820
How did you get your
start in the game,

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.530
and what do you love about it?

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.560
So maybe starting
here with Blaine.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.090
BLAINE SCULLY: I'm Blaine.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.782
I started rugby when I was 18.

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:46.990
I was introduced to a friend.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.300
But prior to that, I went
to Jesuit High School,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.660
and Jesuit is one of the
perennial high schools

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.090
in the country, won numerous
national championships,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.330
and a lot of my buddies played
on national championships

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.320
with Jesuit.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.665
And I went to UCLA first
before I went to Cal.

00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:09.250
I was introduced to
rugby by a friend there,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.010
and it was what I was supposed
to be playing all along.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.718
I was kind of an
athlete without a sport.

00:03:13.718 --> 00:03:16.270
My dad and brother
played college football,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.112
uncles played baseball, and
I was supposed play rugby.

00:03:19.112 --> 00:03:23.020
And the thing I love
most about the game is it

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.870
challenges you in so many
different athletic ways.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.400
Everyone's got to be able to
pass, catch, tackle, jump,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.400
a multitude of skills, so that
challenges all different types

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.530
of athletic abilities.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.250
And then at the same time,
it's very much a players' game.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.700
Players are tasked
with decision-making,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.360
connecting with teammates, and
it's quite different than NFL,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.750
for instance, where a coach
can very much direct the game.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.120
After Friday, and as you
get into the competition,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.210
it's very much team-oriented.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.040
And so it's all about the
team, and making decisions

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.590
on the game.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.432
So I find it really one of
the best there is out there.

00:04:02.432 --> 00:04:03.640
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: That's great.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.800
And we're going to jump
into your role as captain,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.990
and what that really
means, a little bit later

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.260
in the discussion.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.810
Rosie, how did you get involved?

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.080
ROSIE SPAULDING: Yeah, so
my introduction to rugby

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.570
is a fan, basically.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.820
So I grew up in the
UK, and following

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.600
a small but noisy
and very enthusiastic

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.380
team called the Cornish Pirates.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.880
And just following
rugby with my family,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.040
and going to games a number of
times, for those [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.600
And just really
enjoying the sport.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.305
And then when I transitioned
into sports event production

00:04:36.305 --> 00:04:39.610
eighteen years ago, planned
an produced a number of events

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.160
around the globe, but this is
the first rugby tournament I've

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.826
been involved in
planning and producing.

00:04:43.826 --> 00:04:46.375
And very excited to be doing
that, and to have this role,

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:50.830
and to be hopefully
creating a platform--

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.265
continued platform for growth
of the game here in the US.

00:04:53.265 --> 00:04:56.200
So very excited
about the tournament

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.280
that's around the corner.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.620
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: That's awesome.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.452
Ross.

00:04:59.452 --> 00:05:00.910
ROSS YOUNG: Yeah,
similar to Rosie,

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.710
being from the UK, involved
literally from school.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.280
Then decided to join the
Metro Police in London.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.400
At that stage, prior to the
game being professional,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.070
you couldn't earn
money playing rugby.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.320
So the Armed Forces,
police services

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.130
were good ways to actually
play at the highest level

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.530
and have time
facilitated to play.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.510
And at that stage,
the team I played

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.180
for had multiple England
internationals playing

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.000
for it as well.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.870
But so, certainly never a
regular first team player.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.516
Usually the one that
filled the back of the bus

00:05:34.516 --> 00:05:35.890
when the prima
donnas didn't want

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.514
to take the trip to
the Cornish Pirates

00:05:37.514 --> 00:05:41.246
or up to North Yorkshire after
a night duty on a Saturday.

00:05:41.246 --> 00:05:44.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.227
But just loved the camaraderie,
as you say, and then, you know,

00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:48.560
the transition really happened--

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.110
I had a couple of
very bad knee injuries

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.880
when I was relatively
young, and decided

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.574
I was going to break into
the world of coaching,

00:05:54.574 --> 00:05:56.240
and dominate that
way, and then realized

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.910
I was terrible at that.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.590
So I gave up.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.320
You know, I think coaching you
have to have a certain mindset,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.280
and unfortunately
for a player that

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.950
was criticized for not being
angry and aggressive enough,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.870
I was far too aggressive
and angry as a coach.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.470
So I got involved
in administrations,

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.260
and then just built
up connectivity

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.450
through the rugby network
from a policing perspective,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.760
and policing at Twickenham,
and then was lucky enough

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.640
to get involved with
Harlequins in the early stage

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.010
of professionalism as
their stadium manager,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.080
and eventually general
manager, before moving on

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.542
to World Rugby.

00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:34.750
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: That's great.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.560
And I noticed some kind
of common uncommon theme

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.280
maybe here.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.340
You know, Blaine, you
said you didn't really

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.715
get into rugby
until you were 18,

00:06:42.715 --> 00:06:45.900
whereas Rosie and
Ross grew up with it.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.780
So we do think the
kind of turning point

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.300
for rugby in the US
is, and how can we

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.660
get more kids involved in a way
that in New Zealand, Australia,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.680
the UK, or South Africa,
they are just naturally

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.065
from the beginning.

00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:02.940
BLAINE SCULLY: I mean,
I think you're already

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.696
seeing it starting.

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:06.070
Obviously, the
Olympic movement's

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.860
been really big for us.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.357
I think it's validated rugby
in this country in a way

00:07:10.357 --> 00:07:11.815
it hadn't been
probably previously.

00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:12.700
FLEUR KNOWSLEY:
And can you explain

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.400
to the folks who might not
know what that looks like.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.830
BLAINE SCULLY: So rugby was
included in the 2016 Olympic

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.160
Games, and will be for the next
two Olympic Games, I believe,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.740
as well.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.347
So obviously, as
a young athlete,

00:07:24.347 --> 00:07:25.930
there's a couple
things you aspire to,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.580
and being an Olympian
is one of them.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.450
And in sevens format
being what it is,

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:37.450
I think it lends itself really
well to introducing the game.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.900
It's high-energy, high-pace,
which we'll see this weekend,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.040
and really kind of a
pure athletic version

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.690
of rugby, which I think is
really suited for Americans

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.320
in general.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.540
And obviously,
hopefully we can build

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.000
from the ground up introducing
meaningful competition

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.290
for young athletes
at a young level,

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.830
making sure they get
adequate coaching,

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.249
and building enthusiasm,
exposure for the sport.

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:06.790
So I mean, an event
like we're having

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.090
this weekend is
massive in the sense

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.770
that it gives a young athlete
an aspiration they can actually

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.649
see, and touch, and feel,
which is hugely important.

00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:19.690
It's not just about going
to an NFL game, or even

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:20.689
a college football game.

00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:23.220
It's being able to see
world class athletes play

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.300
a game at its highest
level, and that's

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.202
something that's truly
powerful for a young athlete.

00:08:29.202 --> 00:08:30.910
ROSIE SPAULDING: And
just to add to that,

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.890
the Olympics was huge,
for sure, and then

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.900
also rugby is currently
the fastest-growing team

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.900
sport on college campuses,
so there's definitely

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.691
a change happening.

00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:42.169
And I think for my
part, how do we never

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.980
sees your World Cup-class
competitions to really grow

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.750
the game in our way.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.540
And for sure, you're
exactly right,

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.445
being able to see world class
athletes, men and women, which

00:08:52.445 --> 00:08:54.820
is, again, quite unique about
rugby and one of the things

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.250
I love about it, to have those
two men's and women's World

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.770
Cups running
alongside each other

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.280
is a great inspiration
for the kids

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.220
out there just getting into
the game, but also making sure

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.160
that we implement
a legacy program,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.410
and we've be working on
the Impact Beyond program

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.600
here in the Bay Area
through this tournament.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.057
So just the exposure is
one of the key pieces

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:19.390
from my side in the US, because
we are growing the game.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.420
It is an emerging sport.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.110
But by exposing kids--

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.200
we've exposed 22,000 kids to
rugby, given them the chance

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.660
to participate through
our Impact Beyond program

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.030
through this event.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.340
And so those kind of programs,
I think, can only help.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.650
And hopefully the awareness is
grown through this tournament,

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.400
and then the participation
is also growing

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.030
through this tournament.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.550
ROSS YOUNG: And from a national
governing body perspective

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.810
it's a balancing
act, as Blaine said--

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.180
having an aspirational
team, raising the profile,

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.654
having more rugby on TV.

00:09:51.654 --> 00:09:54.070
In the five years I've been
here it's been a huge learning

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.170
curve, and I think
that everyone that's

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.297
got interest in rugby out there
will realize, instead of--

00:09:59.297 --> 00:10:00.380
I think it was mentioned--

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.770
Josh, earlier-- instead of
hooking into something dodgy

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.040
VPN connection five years
ago to find rugby content,

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.240
and it's now on--

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.865
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: I
have never done that.

00:10:08.865 --> 00:10:11.220
ROSS YOUNG: No, nobody's
ever done that, have they?

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.822
You know, now that
ESPN has basically

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.280
got most of the
southern hemisphere

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.710
and the French NBC have got
the northern hemisphere--

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:23.150
the English Premiership and the
Six Nations, moving forward.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.830
And then with the advent of
MLR in the US, which I think

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.520
is going to be a great
springboard for us

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.460
to build off, being on
CBS and the ESPN platform,

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.440
as well as local cable networks.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.920
There's a lot more
there, and so it's really

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.530
harnessing the
aspirational qualities,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.120
and then building
from the base up.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.590
And it's easier said than done.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.220
I mean, Rosie
mentioned the SFIA--

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.200
Sports Fitness and
Industry Association

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.440
of the US, rugby for
the last three years

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.930
has been the biggest
incremental sport.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.730
It's still small in
comparison numbers,

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.670
but it's sort of
jumped above lacrosse,

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.810
and they take playing all
forms of the game in interest

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.440
rather than just
pure registration.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.904
So we need to keep
building on that.

00:11:07.904 --> 00:11:09.820
But like everything, you
need to have outlets,

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.540
and you need to have clubs
built for players to play.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.090
I think the-- in
my previous job,

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:22.690
we were very much youth-focused,
with running camps and player

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.770
development programs.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.385
And the amount of
times we'd go to areas,

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:28.260
and people would get
hooked, but then they've

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.280
got no club or
association to play with.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.627
So the younger the
kids are playing,

00:11:32.627 --> 00:11:34.960
then the more you care, and
then I think as Blaine said,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.080
the Jesuit High School
here in the Bay Area

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.762
has a long history, but there
weren't very many high schools.

00:11:41.762 --> 00:11:42.720
Now there's a lot more.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.530
There's a lot more
college scholarships

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.630
available for high school kids.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.200
So we just keep on pushing
away at all levels,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.859
really, and making sure that
we get the balance right.

00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:54.400
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: And
one of the things

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.570
you touched on
about the TV rights.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:00.280
And I think that is an important
source of income for the game.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.220
There's only so much that
each individual subscription

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.770
can kind of get you.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.810
So maybe sticking
with you, Ross,

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.050
can you talk a little
bit about how rugby

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.980
has to compete with the other
sports for sponsorship dollars,

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.670
and particularly in a game
where it's free-flowing,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.140
in the 15s at least.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.230
It's slightly less
so in the sevens.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.800
Whereas in baseball,
basketball, football,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.510
there are lots of
breaks for advertising.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.060
ROSS YOUNG: I think revenue
generation is important,

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.010
and also access
to terrestrial TV,

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.940
and NBC has historically
been a great partner,

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.960
and just entered into
a long-term partnership

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.402
with World Rugby that really
allows some of that leverage.

00:12:44.402 --> 00:12:46.610
Because as you say, when
you are selling sponsorship,

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.109
it needs to be on
the right platform

00:12:48.109 --> 00:12:51.020
with the most eyes on it.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.830
But you also need be
creative with sponsorship.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:58.400
I mean, rugby just doesn't
hit the same criteria.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.910
So when we're doing pitching
to sponsors and partners,

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.920
they tend to have
media agencies that

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.660
have algorithms that
work through, well, you

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.630
need x number of
people, x eyes on it,

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.840
and that equates a value.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.060
So I think we've got
to turn that, instead

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.940
of it being the financial
value, we've got

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.680
some great new partners that--

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.450
get them to embrace
the values of rugby,

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.500
get them to understand where
we are in the growth path,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.730
and be part of that
journey with us,

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.290
and really align what we're
doing as an organization

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.370
through to a lot of their
strategic goals as a company,

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.870
and help build that value.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.120
And then hopefully
the dollars will come,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.940
but it's always been a
struggle for rugby, through--

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.390
even through the established
nations competing

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.860
with the big numbers in Europe.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.710
But we'll get there.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.720
We've just got to keep on--

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.530
make a proper plan,
stick with it,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.840
and hopefully it will
come to fruition.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.040
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Rosie,
coming back down this way,

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.539
down the panel,
you've been involved

00:13:54.539 --> 00:13:57.579
in a number of high-profile
sporting events in the US,

00:13:57.579 --> 00:13:59.120
as we mentioned in
the introductions,

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.180
including the Super Bowl and
the America's Cup sailing.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.304
What is different about the
sevens from your perspective?

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.720
ROSIE SPAULDING: A couple of
key differences, I would say.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.510
I think one of the exciting
pieces for me personally,

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.150
but also a challenging
component is the way

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.460
that it is an emerging sport.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.760
So while we've been promoting
and marketing the tournament

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.830
for the past 18 months, it's--

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.750
and in parallel with
doing that, we're

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:27.282
actually having to explain what
rugby is, and explain the game,

00:14:27.282 --> 00:14:29.240
and there's this whole
education component that

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.130
comes alongside that,
until right now,

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:37.170
actually, where we're
very much an awareness--

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.119
I guess awareness generating
as well as the planning piece,

00:14:40.119 --> 00:14:41.910
which we haven't had
to worry about so much

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.430
with the Super Bowl--

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.230
America's Cup to some extent.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.580
I think there's some
similarities with the America's

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.140
Cup in that we're trying
to grow the audience.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.931
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Yeah,
I'm not sure how many

00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:53.337
young American children
aspire to be elite sailors.

00:14:53.337 --> 00:14:54.170
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.246
ROSIE SPAULDING: You never know.

00:14:56.246 --> 00:14:58.620
But in terms of growing the
fan base and that side of it,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.670
it was somewhat similar.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.760
And then I think
the other difference

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.610
for me is just that it's
an incredible sport,

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.140
and just the values
really resonated,

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.140
the sort of teamwork, respect,
and inclusivity around rugby

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.827
is very much, I think,
authentic throughout the game,

00:15:17.827 --> 00:15:19.410
throughout wherever
it's played, and I

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.900
think that's something
that stands out compared

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.440
to some of the other sports.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.080
And then I guess
probably a third thing

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.746
I'll add in there is
the fan experience.

00:15:25.746 --> 00:15:28.670
And for sevens, at
least anyway, people

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:32.214
come as much to watch the
Olympic class athletes-- world

00:15:32.214 --> 00:15:34.130
class athletes --as they
do to be entertained.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.850
And it's a really fun
event to entertain people

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.610
as well as just the
sport side of it.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.170
It's a great sort
of beta breakers--

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.530
we sort of joke about
it being beta breakers

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.320
meets rugby meets
Olympic athletes,

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.955
and that resonates with
folks here in the Bay Area.

00:15:48.955 --> 00:15:49.830
And that's different.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.206
I think that's
special to sevens.

00:15:51.206 --> 00:15:52.413
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: That's great.

00:15:52.413 --> 00:15:53.890
I'm picking up on that theme.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.660
Blaine, you mentioned
earlier the decision-making

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.180
that the players have on the
field, and the kind of passing

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.860
of the baton from the
coach over to the players,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.520
particularly the
captain in your case.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.750
Talk to us a little bit
about what that means,

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.320
both in the sevens and
15s form of the game,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.910
and how you handle that from
a leadership perspective.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.400
BLAINE SCULLY:
Yeah, I'd say it's

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:18.682
very much a service-based
responsibility position.

00:16:18.682 --> 00:16:21.015
You serve the team, and you're
responsible for the team,

00:16:21.015 --> 00:16:22.130
and speaking with
the team's voice,

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.440
and representing the team,
whether it's conversations

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.400
with the referee, or
the press, and even

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.382
inside a team dynamic, between
the coaches and the playing

00:16:31.382 --> 00:16:33.590
group, and between the
playing group and the coaches.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.350
So very much serve all
the different entities,

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.110
and then my mindset's
always been you're very much

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.760
a first among equals.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.060
It's not a privileged position.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.040
It's a service position.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:49.010
And I think that's one of the
really unique aspects about

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:54.950
rugby is that it is very much
everything about the 15 people

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.750
that are on the field, or the
seven people on the field,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.950
and supporting one another,
because really that's

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.600
all you have.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.609
There's limited substitutions
in both forms of the games.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.440
So you have to problem
solve and come up

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.440
with solutions on the
field because there's only

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.315
two breaks, halftime
and the end of the game.

00:17:13.315 --> 00:17:15.815
You really don't get any other
chances besides that in order

00:17:15.815 --> 00:17:17.480
to download
information, communicate

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.335
between your teammates, and try
to figure out how the heck are

00:17:21.335 --> 00:17:23.660
we going to win this game.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.890
And obviously a lot of that
is down to how you prepare,

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.339
and getting ready
for competition.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.654
And then once the
pressure's there and once

00:17:30.654 --> 00:17:33.080
the balls are
live, then how well

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.980
do you react and respond to
all the different elements

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.230
and various things
that can derail a team,

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.720
and disrupt connection
and decision-making,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.520
and it really has to be one
collective unit on the plan,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.160
and executing it to the best of
their ability for 80 minutes.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.170
So it requires a huge amount
of preparation, obviously,

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.369
and training.

00:17:53.369 --> 00:17:55.660
Your ability to decision-make
and connect on the field.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.820
And then you have
to be fit enough

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.190
to be able to do it for
however long it takes.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:05.080
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: And do the fans
getting too loud ever impact

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.945
on your on-field communication,
particularly the sevens?

00:18:07.945 --> 00:18:09.820
BLAINE SCULLY: It
definitely can be a factor.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.460
I think probably more so
in sevens it's your lungs.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.550
It is very, very
fast-paced game,

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.310
and it is happening quick.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.235
So you only have
really micro-seconds

00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:23.510
to connect and have
a conversation.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.770
So that's why communication
for us is so important,

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.145
is you have to be
able to give it

00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:29.830
and give it back really quickly.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.032
So being able to
communicate on the field

00:18:32.032 --> 00:18:33.490
when you don't have
a lot of breaks

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.970
is a hugely important
part of really a team

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:41.260
functioning, as anybody knows
in any team in the world.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.390
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Yeah,
definitely correct,

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.750
and I think the way teams
function here at Google as well

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.910
is that kind of trust
and communication,

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.740
and you can't always
have the person there.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.270
You've got to figure it
out a lot on your own.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.170
BLAINE SCULLY: It
would be nice if I

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.295
was at the wing to send a
text message to my scrum,

00:18:55.295 --> 00:18:56.080
how's it going?

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.120
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Exactly.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.090
With the wearables
team, I can probably

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.200
get in touch about that.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.440
Ross, going back to
you, but sticking

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.410
on the path of
elite athletes, how

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:12.280
do you identify, and train,
and kind of bring people

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.380
into the USA Rugby program?

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.109
Because I imagine you want to
be identifying folks early,

00:19:17.109 --> 00:19:19.150
and taking them all the
way through to these kind

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.810
of aspirational paths that
Blaine was mentioning.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.893
ROSS YOUNG: Yeah, we touched
on that a little bit,

00:19:23.893 --> 00:19:26.830
and Blaine obviously
represented the All-Americans

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.620
at various different
age groups, and there's

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:33.250
a good history of age group
representation with the US.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.772
But there are challenges.

00:19:34.772 --> 00:19:36.355
I mean, the geography
of the country--

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.000
I mean, the hotbeds tend to
be around the bigger populated

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.930
areas, around the east
coast, west coast,

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:50.560
and I think Texas has always
had a long history as well.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.230
So its volunteers-- it's
network of volunteers,

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:58.510
its ensuring that regionalized
rugby organizations are

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.220
equipped to be able
to push forward

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.590
certain recommendations.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.330
There's a number of
entities out there

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:13.620
that run camps that the
upscale-- certain players.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:18.520
And I think through the
state-based organizations,

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.260
through the volunteer
network, it's

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.580
just pushing people in
the bottom of the funnel,

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.712
and allowing them to then
to then be challenged.

00:20:27.712 --> 00:20:29.170
A lot the other
issues of that come

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.110
back to having the finances
and resources able to do that.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.542
If you want the best group
of players in an age group

00:20:37.542 --> 00:20:40.000
to get together, it's got to
be in one area of the country,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.570
obviously.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.010
And there's a lot of them
got to fly a long way

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.820
and stay to do it.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.940
So it's never easy.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.349
The advent-- technology's,
again, another great help.

00:20:52.349 --> 00:20:53.890
More and more games
are being filmed.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:59.690
More and more games are being
broken down and reviewed.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.930
So getting that film out
there as well is important.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.360
But for us it's having
the right coaches

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.540
in place at the right
age grade levels that

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.610
have the connectivity
through the various parts

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.780
of the country that can go out
there and identify the talent.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.610
And people keep on
talking about it,

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.440
and there's some great examples
in the sevens game as well

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.980
of the crossover athlete, and
players that maybe haven't

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.040
quite made it to
the NFL or the NBA,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.080
and Blaine will probably
talk more to that.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.260
It's interesting that
football is obviously

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.540
seen as a farm for
building athletes,

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.550
but a lot of what
happens in basketball

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.130
has probably got more
synergy to the game of rugby,

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.670
and use of space, et cetera.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:46.990
So I think having the
ability to supplement teams

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.990
with incredible athletes that
are part of the American system

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.510
is great, but it comes back
to what we talked about

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.430
earlier, that it's
a complex game,

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.320
and the younger you
play it, the better.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.370
And I think for all
of us here there's

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.070
a huge advantage
that rugby is now

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.530
being seen as being an outlet.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.691
A lot of football coaches
are encouraging their players

00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:09.940
to play rugby, whereas
previously they were restricted

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.780
from doing that, because
of the complementary skills

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.560
in both sports.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.000
So it's age-- as young as
possible, and then by all

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.580
means try and get
the athlete along

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:29.277
to supplement the
skill base later on.

00:22:29.277 --> 00:22:31.860
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Rosie, I want
to get your views on what you've

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.390
been doing around
this tournament

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.810
to increase what Ross has been
saying, which is viewership,

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:40.560
and getting people involved who
may not really know the game,

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.947
and have that passion for it.

00:22:41.947 --> 00:22:43.530
Can you talk to us
a little about some

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.097
of the programs that kind
of dovetail with what

00:22:46.097 --> 00:22:48.680
Ross has been talking about on
the players' side for the fans?

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.740
ROSIE SPAULDING:
Yeah, and I think

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.840
it's been our approach--
sort of marketing-wise--

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.176
has been very much sort of
tapping into other audiences.

00:22:55.176 --> 00:22:57.300
We know that the rugby fan
base are probably pretty

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.549
excited about this tournament.

00:22:58.549 --> 00:23:01.420
So it's as much about making
them aware of the tournament,

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.910
but they're more easily sold.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:06.090
And what we've been
working on is other ways

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.350
to relate the game to football,
and encourage football fans

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.720
to get excited about it, or
because it's at AT&amp;T Park,

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.000
through the Giants fan base.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.730
But also a big
piece is what it was

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.980
talking about before, which
is the entertainment side,

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.734
and just tapping
into what is a--

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.150
I think there's a
lot of synergies

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.680
between the sevens fan and the
population of the Bay Area--

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.410
not everybody, but
generally the sort

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:34.484
of celebration part of sevens,
and the costumes that people

00:23:34.484 --> 00:23:36.900
tend to wear, the fancy dress
that people wear for sevens,

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.180
and the fun that people
have at sevens very much

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.620
resonates with
the Bay Area here.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.850
So we've very much been focused
on that, and the fun side,

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.850
and the entertainment
piece, and pulling that

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:51.930
into our marketing and promotion
over the past year or so.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:55.320
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: I was in Vegas
a few years ago for the sevens,

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.800
and made the front
page of the BBC News.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.210
It said, "American fans
enjoying themselves in Vegas."

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:01.470
I was in a penguin costume.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.950
I'm not entirely
sure what country

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:04.950
they thought I was from.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:06.741
But I was with a lot
of my American friends

00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:09.930
who were very clearly
supporting America.

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:13.170
So talking about the
sevens and the 15s form

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:18.630
of the game, Blaine, how
does your training change

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.930
depending on--

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.930
you mentioned the kind
of lung capacity required

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.880
for the sevens, and the form
of the game is quite different.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.580
Talk to us a little bit about
how that changes what you do.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.288
BLAINE SCULLY: Yeah,
so I mean obviously,

00:24:30.288 --> 00:24:31.890
from a sevens
perspective, you play

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.380
multiple games in a weekend.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.622
So your anabolic threshold
and your aerobic capacity

00:24:37.622 --> 00:24:40.080
needs to be very, very high
from an athletic point of view.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.700
That means you have
to be able to be

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.165
prepared to sprint a lot of
times in a short amount of--

00:24:45.165 --> 00:24:48.540
a short period of time as well.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.450
So it's a tough
training regimen.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.150
A lot of running, and you
have to actually be very, very

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:56.220
efficient in what
you do as an athlete,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:01.110
because the game of sevens is
very isolating for an athlete

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.390
because there's only
seven people on the field.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.030
Every once in a while you
can kind of potentially

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.600
hide on a 15s field.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.090
There is zero hiding
on a sevens field.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.952
Typically, the
classic example is

00:25:13.952 --> 00:25:16.410
you hide a front rower because
you need him for scrum time,

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.707
right.

00:25:18.707 --> 00:25:19.790
Sevens, there's no hiding.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.123
Everyone's got to be able to
do everything at all times,

00:25:22.123 --> 00:25:25.230
and do it at a high, high
intensity for 14 minutes,

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:29.520
whereas in 15s it's very much
a bigger man's game, more set

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.100
piece, which is just-- for
anyone out there-- is just

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.541
a way to restart play.

00:25:33.541 --> 00:25:35.040
There's a couple
of ways to do that.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.190
There's a line out, which is
sort of like a jump ball soccer

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:41.760
throw-in, and then a scrum
is kind of a classic example

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.690
as well.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:50.360
And very much a position
is dictated by the demands

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.620
of whatever that is.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.770
So a front rower's
specific job is to scrum,

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:58.292
just like an offensive liner
would be tasked to block.

00:25:58.292 --> 00:26:00.250
But he also has to be
able to pass, and tackle,

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.710
and all that kind
of stuff as well.

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.920
And 80 minutes is
challenging because it's

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.660
a lot of intensity, so
kind of break it down.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.590
I'd typically run seven
and a half kilometers

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:15.170
a game, probably
more, in addition

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.220
to having 20, 30 collisions.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.180
So our training regimen
will try to reflect what

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.012
we are faced with in the game.

00:26:22.012 --> 00:26:23.470
So we want to train
above the game,

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.261
so that means we're
running high intensity,

00:26:25.261 --> 00:26:27.350
and our meters have to be
at a certain percentage

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.880
of high speed.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.430
And then the way we train
our contacts, I have to be--

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.460
my teammates and I have to meet
a certain amount of contacts

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.350
per training session
in order to make

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.320
sure we're physically prepared
for when we play the game.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.690
So our trainings are
very much reflective

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.130
of what the game demands.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:47.460
And really, they're-- while
they're both forms of rugby,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.610
they are slightly
different in that way.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.444
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: So you
touched on two things

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:54.068
that I want to pick
up on, one for you,

00:26:54.068 --> 00:26:55.580
and then flicking
it back to Ross.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.490
But for you, Blaine,
trying to explain

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.710
to the American audience,
or people who haven't seen

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.360
rugby before, the concept
of a scrum or a line out.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.040
Rosie and I know what that means
because we grew up with it.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.790
How do you find explaining,
even to your friends and family

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.830
when you first started
out, what you were doing,

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.310
and how do we get a
common language for people

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.032
to understand this?

00:27:17.032 --> 00:27:19.490
BLAINE SCULLY: Yeah, well, I
mean, just from my experience,

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:20.960
so I mean, I was
introduced to rugby,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.350
and I was new to the sport once.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.530
You know, so what
I did is I just

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:26.720
took the basic
elements of the game,

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.410
and I tried to break it down and
put in the stuff that I know.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.400
I know what a kick
return is like when

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.390
a returner returns a football.

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.170
And so there's a lot
of that in rugby.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.479
Like I said, a line out
is sort of like a jump

00:27:40.479 --> 00:27:42.770
ball meets a soccer throw-in
that has to go the middle.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.940
I can kind of picture of what
that is, and kind of see--

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.700
FLEUR KNOWSLEY:
Lots of analogies

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.660
back with the American sports.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.130
BLAINE SCULLY: A scrum is
effectively two offensive lines

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.546
going head to head, and they
put the ball down the middle,

00:27:51.546 --> 00:27:52.550
and then it's a contest.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:55.370
Everything in rugby is
very contest-driven,

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.620
even in-- like take the
tackle for instance.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:02.510
In football, play stops, whereas
in rugby it's another contest.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.380
So a new line of
scrimmage is established,

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.950
which football fans would
know, but then the offense

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:10.640
and defense are still
trying to get that ball.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.070
So I just equated
stuff I knew, and then

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.719
thankfully for YouTube, I was
able to watch a lot of rugby.

00:28:15.719 --> 00:28:16.635
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Great.

00:28:16.635 --> 00:28:18.620
YouTube shout-out there.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.590
And touching, then, on
some of the safety aspects.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.627
You know, Ross, it's
probably a question for you,

00:28:24.627 --> 00:28:26.960
as well as interested in
thoughts from Rosie and Blaine.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.722
But what are you
doing for USA Rugby

00:28:30.722 --> 00:28:35.150
to encourage parents
of young children

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.250
that this is a
safe game to play,

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:41.600
and the way that you treat
tackling and other hit

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.170
injuries.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.628
Talk to us a little
bit about that,

00:28:43.628 --> 00:28:45.860
especially given the
spotlight on American football

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.770
in that regard.

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.020
ROSS YOUNG: Yeah, and I think
there are lots of quotes

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:53.739
out there about saying the head
injuries that have received

00:28:53.739 --> 00:28:55.322
a huge amount of
publicity in football

00:28:55.322 --> 00:28:57.420
is an advantage for rugby.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.720
I mean, I disagree with that.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.460
It's still a high-impact sport.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.350
Being involved in
an environment--

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.650
Blaine says that it has
many collisions, that it's

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.870
all about force and power.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.759
I think the big
advantage that rugby has,

00:29:13.759 --> 00:29:15.800
and the one thing we have
to continue to focus on

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.880
as a national governing body
is the quality of coaching,

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.540
because that--

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.750
ultimately technique
is what helps you

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.050
in rugby when it comes to
those impact situations.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.320
And you know, the transference
in my previous role

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.140
at [INAUDIBLE] Rugby
and then Atavus,

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.350
there's a whole other arm shoot
of the business that's gone

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:40.490
off, which is all about
designing a very specific

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.470
defensive system and tackle--

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:46.130
taking the complementary
parts from the rugby tackle

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.320
and moving it into a
football environment

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.690
from drills, et cetera.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:52.310
Texas High School
Association has just

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:55.250
mandated that all
their youth coaches

00:29:55.250 --> 00:30:00.860
have to take the
certification for that, which

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.260
is going to continue
to help and improve

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.310
from a rugby perspective.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:08.980
So for us, it's those younger
kids at the younger ages,

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.599
as Rosie will attest to.

00:30:10.599 --> 00:30:12.140
When you start off
playing mini rugby

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.320
in the southern hemisphere, one
of the very first things you

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:15.890
do--

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.720
it's very game-based,
it's fun-based.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.810
But it's all about learning
to fall, learning how to roll,

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.610
learning to protect
yourself, and you

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:26.120
build the more complex
elements of the game

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.530
into that as you go forward.

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:28.322
And unfortunately--

00:30:28.322 --> 00:30:30.071
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Not
the Neymar roll there.

00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:31.920
ROSS YOUNG: No, not
quite the Neymar roll.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.003
BLAINE SCULLY: He was on
the ground for 15 minute,

00:30:34.003 --> 00:30:34.610
I believe.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.232
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: 15 minutes?

00:30:36.232 --> 00:30:38.440
ROSS YOUNG: It's a bit like
Blaine's version of that.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.606
BLAINE SCULLY: Come on, man.

00:30:39.606 --> 00:30:40.802
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.040
ROSS YOUNG: From our perspective
it is-- you have to--

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.960
coaching is so-- you know,
you said earlier about,

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.874
what do we have to do to
improve the numbers of players?

00:30:52.874 --> 00:30:55.040
By the way, the Neymar was
more the pretty boy thing

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.750
rather than lying on the field.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:57.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.186
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: I
reserve all my judgments.

00:31:00.186 --> 00:31:03.846
ROSS YOUNG: No, it's coaching
and the number of coaches that

00:31:03.846 --> 00:31:05.720
really understand what
to do, and the younger

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.510
you get kids playing, because
it's much tougher to do at,

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:12.170
I mean, when Blaine
started, his age.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.030
It just doesn't
become instinctive,

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:18.530
and I think that's the
big difference is rugby,

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:22.240
the younger you start, the
more instinctive it becomes,

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.153
how you protect yourself going
into a tackle, and a tackle,

00:31:25.153 --> 00:31:27.915
and I think there's
more technology around

00:31:27.915 --> 00:31:30.189
that, you said there's
more game review that's

00:31:30.189 --> 00:31:30.980
going to help that.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.530
So doing that, and helping
that, and driving through,

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.100
especially, an awareness
in the US about it

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.584
is massively important.

00:31:39.584 --> 00:31:41.000
FLEUR KNOWSLEY:
And Rosie, I'm not

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.740
sure if you are involved
in this as well,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.690
but the publicity and the
marketing piece of it,

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:51.300
is much of that focused
on parents, saying hey,

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.734
bring your kids along?

00:31:52.734 --> 00:31:54.900
ROSIE SPAULDING: Yeah, for
the tournament, you mean?

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.270
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Yeah, for
the tournament, and then more

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:56.820
broadly.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.236
ROSIE SPAULDING:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:58.236 --> 00:31:59.810
That's part of
what we do, or part

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:02.090
of what I'm doing, is
the marketing promotion,

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.430
and very much certainly
to rugby fans,

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:07.160
very focused on the
parents as a core audience

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.770
across the country, but
also very much here, again,

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:12.340
in the Bay Area making sure
that rugby clubs are aware,

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.749
and that kids feel engaged.

00:32:13.749 --> 00:32:16.040
And then like I talked about,
through the Impact Beyond

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.010
program, it's also
increasing that awareness,

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.200
and getting into the
82 schools that we've

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:26.160
got into that have not played
rugby before, and just growing

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:26.660
the game.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.600
And we've had a really,
really, really positive

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.170
reception to rugby, and we've
been in schools where they

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.720
really had no idea what it was.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.450
But the fact that boys and
girls can play it, the fact that

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.710
the values, the thinking--

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.682
I've mentioned them
previously but the core values

00:32:42.682 --> 00:32:44.390
of teamwork, and
respect, and inclusivity

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:45.889
are very authentic
and very genuine,

00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:49.460
I think, in rugby, and
something that aligns

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.770
very well with school programs.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:52.870
And so it's been
very well-received,

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.980
and the parents have
been excited about it,

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.480
the kids have been
excited about it,

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.100
and it's another way that we've
been operating the tournament,

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.612
but also helping to
grow the game as well.

00:33:04.612 --> 00:33:05.820
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: That's great.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.820
And you mentioned obviously
both boys and girls play.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.820
I think this weekend is
a great example of that.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.760
We've got a combined tournament
where the men and the women

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.550
are playing the tournament
at the same location, which

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.830
I'm really happy to say.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.290
I think it helps with
promotion of the game,

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.450
particularly for women.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:25.690
And Blaine, you're involved--

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.250
the chair of the
Players Association.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.350
Does that-- is it
the same association

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.420
for the male players
and the female players?

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.430
And talk to us a bit
about how that's going,

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.264
and what your role is there.

00:33:36.264 --> 00:33:38.180
BLAINE SCULLY: So we're
very fortunate to have

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.090
that up and running.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.690
We've been working on it
for a couple of years.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.870
So it's inclusive of all four
national teams, men and women,

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:46.210
and our board reflects that.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.620
It's two representatives
from each team, so sevens

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.410
and 15s on both sides.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:55.830
So it's four women and five--
only because myself as chair.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.560
And it's something we're
really looking forward

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.240
to building, is kind of
that universal standard,

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.210
and standardizing expectations,
and from an athletes'

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.560
perspective, player welfare.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.920
That's not gender
specific-- gender equal.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.770
And that's really what we
think the game is about,

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:16.820
and we think we want to
be about as well, So being

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.330
really inclusive, and growing.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.880
It's not enough just to grow
one aspect of the sport.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.480
We want to raise,
collectively, all boats,

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.690
because I think, personally,
that the women's game has

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.227
a huge opportunity
in America to be--

00:34:32.227 --> 00:34:34.310
I think it's-- well, it's
actually one of the only

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:36.500
contact options
women have to play.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:41.150
And I think we have so
many world class female

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.380
athletes that can
bring us on a level

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.380
that we've already
demonstrated we're very, very

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:46.671
competitive on the world stage.

00:34:46.671 --> 00:34:49.520
We were fourth at
last year's World Cup.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.820
We won a bronze medal and
silver medal this year,

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.330
and I think it's really exciting
from a union's perspective

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:57.980
that our women have
so much potential,

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:01.280
and are already seeing success.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.120
So I think it's the right
thing that we're all in this

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.347
together, and hopefully
we can do our part

00:35:07.347 --> 00:35:09.680
to leave the jersey in the
better place, which is really

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.247
what we're all about from a
Players Association standpoint.

00:35:13.247 --> 00:35:15.080
We want to leave it
better than we found it.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.788
We want to be a part
of growing the game,

00:35:16.788 --> 00:35:19.730
but we also want to grow the
people in the game, which

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.500
is really, really
important for us,

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.795
and that's not just male
or female, it's everyone.

00:35:24.795 --> 00:35:27.170
ROSS YOUNG: From a national
governing body's perspective,

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:28.309
we've got to respect that.

00:35:28.309 --> 00:35:30.100
I mean, we joked about
Neymar, and what was

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.050
it, 100 million euros a week.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.980
I mean, there's a
financial responsibility.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.264
The players, both the men
and women, are huge assets.

00:35:37.264 --> 00:35:39.680
We talked about building value
through sponsor and sponsor

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.250
relations.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:45.080
We need to use
them in a way that

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:49.940
builds out a collective
benefit that goes into a pot.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:54.340
I mean, collective bargaining
agreements are pretty much

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:58.860
standard in the other
established rugby countries,

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.260
and we don't have that.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.260
But if we are going to
benefit, then the players

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.950
need to benefit, and as a
national governing body,

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.860
we need to ensure that,
again, both the men

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.076
and women, that
they're a part of that,

00:36:11.076 --> 00:36:14.694
are looked after properly,
these player welfare issues

00:36:14.694 --> 00:36:16.360
that other players
unions have addressed

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.630
in other parts of the world.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:21.460
And obviously, creating
a financial model,

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.920
because they just don't get
paid enough for what they do,

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.080
and is just ensuring that
we use that union as well

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.120
to create a pot that
helps renumerate them

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.970
for the time, and
effort, and dedication

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.590
that they've got to the sport.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.590
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Yeah,
totally agree and support,

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:42.620
and I think it's had to build
that up from the beginning.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.694
And I think there's an innate--

00:36:44.694 --> 00:36:46.360
in New Zealand and
some other countries,

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.700
there's just everyone wants
to play for the jersey,

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.090
and they'd really do it for
not a whole lot of money often.

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.570
So I think building
that up is so important,

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:58.990
having that be a goal for the
kids when they start playing.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:01.370
So we have time for
audience questions.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.910
Is there anything on
the Dory, [INAUDIBLE]??

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.690
Folks on Livestream,
definitely put your questions

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.850
into the Dory, but do we have
any questions in the room?

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.090
AUDIENCE: My nephew is 10,
just starting out the sport,

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.550
playing flag rugby,
getting involved.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:18.580
I know Blaine, you mentioned
about looking stuff up

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.230
on YouTube--

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:23.800
the hard part about YouTube
is there are tons of videos,

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.270
and a lot of times you just
get the big hit videos.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.020
What maybe recommendation
would you give to--

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.710
I mean, not only the youth,
but maybe some older players

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:35.940
who are looking to YouTube to
kind of learn about the sport--

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.457
maybe just some
direction on that.

00:37:37.457 --> 00:37:38.290
BLAINE SCULLY: Yeah.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:39.940
No, for sure.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.610
I think it doesn't matter
if you're a 10-year-old,

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:45.340
or me, I'm a 30-year-old
now, curiosity

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.640
is fundamentally a huge part
of your growth as an athlete.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.390
And so when I was first starting
out, I watched the game,

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.980
and obviously was learning
as much as I could.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.820
And then I started specifically
picking out players

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.720
who I thought I would
want to play like,

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.170
and who my skill set paralleled.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.760
And so what I would do is--
and I still actually do it

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.510
to this day, because
now, fortunately, I'm

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.010
part of a professional
setup, and we

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.980
have every game in
the world coded,

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.720
and I still go in
and watch Ben Smith,

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.060
who's a very good All Black.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.210
I'll watch his clips,
because it's really important

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.280
to see what the best
players are doing,

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.890
because there's a reason why
they're the best players.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:25.270
So I'd say for
any young athlete,

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:28.510
having that fundamental
curiosity is a huge component

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:29.927
to your growth as an athlete.

00:38:29.927 --> 00:38:31.510
And then being able
to put in the work

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.009
to actually do the homework,
and then going out on the field

00:38:34.009 --> 00:38:36.020
and actually working hard
to try to get better.

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.830
And that doesn't stop
whether you're 10 or an older

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.414
athlete like myself now.

00:38:40.414 --> 00:38:43.080
AUDIENCE: One of the best things
about sevens is the atmosphere.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.710
You alluded to it a few times.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.590
I sit in GHS so I can
sit with the Nigerians

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.230
because they're singing
through the whole thing,

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.350
and it's a blast.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:54.340
Who are you looking
forward to seeing play,

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.590
and maybe in your case,
Blaine, if you want to--

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.460
who do you like
playing against, or is

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.540
the team that drives
you nuts, like Fiji

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.800
or somebody, where it's just--

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.549
BLAINE SCULLY: Fiji
drives everybody nuts.

00:39:04.549 --> 00:39:05.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.621
AUDIENCE: Exactly,
and that's the fun

00:39:06.621 --> 00:39:08.639
part is each team
has a personality,

00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:10.430
the fans bring the
personality to the game.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.050
So just curious, as you look to
this weekend, who should we--

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:16.960
don't be in the parking lot when
they're playing, besides the US

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.060
team, of course.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.310
ROSS YOUNG: Add something
then I'll pass on to Blaine,

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.720
but I think that that's the--

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.380
each team has its own character.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.940
Each team has its own style.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.270
The balance of pace and power.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.050
I mean, the Fijians,
you said, are just so--

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:35.290
they've managed to put a bit
of structure behind the flair

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:39.295
that they used to have, which
has made them even stronger.

00:39:42.015 --> 00:39:43.750
The issue of sevens
as well is anybody

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.540
can win on the day,
which is a great upside.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.610
It's also one of
the risks around it.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:52.570
The World Cup in Dubai,
the top four seeds

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.100
all went out in
the quarterfinals,

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.975
and you ended up with Kenya,
Wales, Argentina, and Samoa,

00:39:56.975 --> 00:39:58.100
I think, in the semifinals.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:58.780
BLAINE SCULLY: And Wales, won.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:59.575
Yeah, 2009.

00:39:59.575 --> 00:40:01.145
ROSS YOUNG: Wales
ended up winning.

00:40:01.145 --> 00:40:02.770
And have never won
a tournament before,

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.770
and they've never won a
tournament since in sevens.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:09.010
So there is an unpredictability.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:13.660
And sevens is definitely
about the event, as well as

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.050
the sport that's taking place.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:20.350
But you're right, there
are some incredible fans.

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.510
There's a great
culture to it, and I

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:25.750
think-- we keep on talking
about the brand values

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.680
as well as the camaraderie,
all the fans mingling together.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.849
It just adds something
very special.

00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:35.640
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Do you
guys want to add on.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.030
ROSIE SPAULDING:
I was just going

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:38.010
to add on that we're
fortunate that there's

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.485
28 countries competing this,
weekend, and all of them

00:40:40.485 --> 00:40:43.110
are represented here in the Bay
Area, which is really exciting.

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:46.980
So from a fan perspective,
it's been one of our tracks

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.645
for marketing as well, has been
working through the communities

00:40:49.645 --> 00:40:52.020
here in the Bay Area, the
Consul General in the Bay Area,

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:55.275
to attract all
those nationalities,

00:40:55.275 --> 00:40:57.795
and I think we expect to
see a lot of national pride,

00:40:57.795 --> 00:41:01.470
and a lot of excitement,
and all of those fans

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:02.770
coming out to watch.

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:05.790
So I think that's very unique
about sevens, and really unique

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:10.110
about this tournament, and it's
something to be excited about.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.090
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Blaine,
who do like playing,

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.056
and who drives you mad?

00:41:14.056 --> 00:41:15.037
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:15.037 --> 00:41:16.620
BLAINE SCULLY:
Obviously you mentioned

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:22.080
the Fijians are incredible
and unpredictable, but more

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.364
incredible than not.

00:41:23.364 --> 00:41:25.530
I think the South Africans
have a really good chance

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:26.100
this weekend.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:26.600
They're--

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.892
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: He's
saying that to rile me up.

00:41:28.892 --> 00:41:29.642
BLAINE SCULLY: No.

00:41:29.642 --> 00:41:31.110
I mean, they're just such
a well-balanced team.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:32.410
ROSS YOUNG: Well, they're
ranked number one.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:34.050
BLAINE SCULLY: They're
such a well-balanced team,

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.758
they're well-coached,
and they have a lot

00:41:35.758 --> 00:41:38.000
of really quality players.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.500
I mean, you can go
across the board.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.625
(FACETIOUSLY) New Zealand
is OK at rugby, you know.

00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:43.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.680
They all have a chance--

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.346
ROSS YOUNG: If you
take the blinkers off

00:41:46.346 --> 00:41:47.430
they'd be even better.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.030
FLEUR KNOWSLEY:
Sometimes we like

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.655
to let the other
countries have it too.

00:41:49.655 --> 00:41:52.890
BLAINE SCULLY: Yeah, but
they both just mentioned

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:55.060
that the thing with sevens is--

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.990
I mean, if you're the
better team for 14 minutes,

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:59.070
anything can happen.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:04.470
And whether you're South
Africa or someone like Chile,

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:05.370
it doesn't matter.

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:09.810
The game of sevens is pure
and ruthless form of rugby

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.442
that there is, because
anything can happen.

00:42:13.442 --> 00:42:15.900
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: And just before
we got to the next audience

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.200
question, I know there have
been some big games, mainly

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.470
out in Chicago, on the 15s side.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.870
We'll have another series
coming up on November 3rd,

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.180
I think it is, out
there this year.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:31.230
Is that something that the more
mature rugby-playing nations

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:37.380
can really help the US grow
by doing these kinds of more

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.210
exhibition-type games?

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:39.880
Ross.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.860
ROSS YOUNG: Yeah,
I mean the profile

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:46.880
of when the Eagles play the All
Blacks maybe four years ago now

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.830
in Soldier Field to a sell-out.

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:51.660
It was ridiculous.

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.670
The Ireland game
that New Zealand

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.310
played a couple of years
later, and then as you said,

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:58.340
we've got Ireland back
playing Italy this time,

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:02.910
plus the men's Eagles
playing the Mary 15,

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:05.400
and then the Black
Ferns playing the women

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.350
in that triple-header.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.550
And I think the more that we
can do that to raise profile,

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:10.890
then the better it is.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:14.380
But again, it's all
about a balancing act.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.340
It's not overdoing it,
it's not saturating.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.950
We need to support what
we're doing domestically

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:23.130
as well so that
people really get

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:26.490
behind what the national
team are doing rather

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:29.760
than concentrating on the
other teams that are out there,

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.894
and the big names
that are coming in.

00:43:31.894 --> 00:43:33.060
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Fair enough.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.460
I think I've got
another question.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.710
AUDIENCE: From a-- there's
a number of different entry

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:40.310
points into rugby as a sport,
as you guys have spoken about.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:44.232
But in the southern hemisphere
and in Europe that's--

00:43:44.232 --> 00:43:46.440
the primary drive of that
is through the club system,

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.023
which potentially
we don't really have

00:43:48.023 --> 00:43:49.420
the same format here in the US.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.669
Sports are generally driven
through a collegiate point

00:43:51.669 --> 00:43:52.350
of view.

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:54.040
First of all, I'd be
interested to hear,

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.130
is that where you think
you need to double down on?

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:57.713
IS it from a collegiate
point of view,

00:43:57.713 --> 00:43:59.924
and to drive player
participation through that?

00:43:59.924 --> 00:44:01.340
And then secondly,
more for Rosie,

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:04.980
do you see this World Cup
being something that's

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.140
going to enjoy
participation as a success,

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.180
or is the main success going
to be more of an increased

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.530
viewership, just a
larger fan base, people

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.051
being more aware of rugby
amongst the other big sports

00:44:16.051 --> 00:44:16.550
in the US.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.240
I'd be interested
to hear that, too.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.030
ROSS YOUNG: Rosie,
do you want to start?

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:20.613
ROSIE SPAULDING:
Sure, no, absolutely.

00:44:20.613 --> 00:44:23.270
I mean, a huge part of our--

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:24.720
probably our number
one objective

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.200
for running this tournament
was to increase participation

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.283
and awareness of the game.

00:44:28.283 --> 00:44:30.620
So it's about-- been
growing participation,

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.030
but part of growing
participation is growing

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.300
awareness with an
emerging sport like that--

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:35.810
like this.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:39.930
So we've been-- there's a lot
of focus on that education piece

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:43.182
that I talked about,
and just really growing

00:44:43.182 --> 00:44:45.390
the awareness of the game,
both here in the Bay Area,

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.920
but also nationally.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:52.290
And through that-- and on the
participation side specifically

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:55.530
we've been very much Bay
Area-focused, and leveraging

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:59.130
the tournament to introduce
schools to the game, et cetera.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.160
But I mean, absolutely,
it's your number one

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.140
priority for us, and
with any major event,

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.520
you have that
opportunity to leverage

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.230
the tournament for
different reasons,

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:10.242
and that's a major
one for us, and it's

00:45:10.242 --> 00:45:13.050
sort of a micro version of
what the '94 soccer World

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:17.640
Cup did for soccer, on a
smaller scale, but still just a

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.280
important.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.420
So what can we do with this
opportunity to grow the game?

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.630
ROSS YOUNG: And to come
back to the balance of club

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:27.540
versus this college, I mean,
it has to be a balancing act.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.250
I keep on saying
that, but it has.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:31.740
I mean, it's no good,
nothing, certain people

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.310
try-- you can't
just replicate how

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:34.810
it works in other
parts of the world

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:37.060
and try and force it
into this environment.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.460
And you look at the lessons
that soccer learned.

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.440
You've got the
advantages, especially

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:46.540
with Title IX and [INAUDIBLE]
soccer awareness, a lot of it

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.940
was driven by the
women really getting

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.610
involved in full
NCAA varsity programs

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:54.040
off the back of funding
through Title IX.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.380
We've got to pick up
and try and use that.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.690
I mean Cal--

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.440
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Ross,
can you just explain

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.555
what Title IX is for folks.

00:46:00.555 --> 00:46:02.554
ROSS YOUNG: So Title IX's
all about equalization

00:46:02.554 --> 00:46:07.210
of funding across men
and women, across sport

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.950
expenditure within that
particular college network.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:14.800
So you've got huge programs
spending lots of money

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.830
on football programs, there
has to be a balance there,

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:19.870
and soccer did a great
job in harnessing that,

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.480
and rugby have got to
do that more as well.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.827
I mean, Cal's one of the few
that's full varsity men-wise.

00:46:26.827 --> 00:46:29.160
I think there's only about
nine, isn't there, varsities.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:35.770
There's about 20-odd women's
that are now NCAA varsity.

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:38.536
40 is the magic
number for it to be--

00:46:38.536 --> 00:46:41.380
to move from being
a club sport to be

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.480
full NCAA-ratified tournament.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.540
And the women are
obviously a lot closer

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:49.630
to doing that than the men are.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:52.240
There are also incredible
associations-- the National

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.540
Small Colleges
Rugby Association,

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.260
they've got 220-odd men's
side, 115 women's side playing

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.000
in national contests every year.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.639
And again, the small colleges,
a lot of the good rugby players

00:47:04.639 --> 00:47:06.430
that come through that
play with the Eagles

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:07.805
come from those
smaller colleges,

00:47:07.805 --> 00:47:10.990
because they tend to be
the prime focus of sport

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:13.400
within those smaller
environments.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.070
So there's certainly
lots out there,

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.040
but it has to be
a balancing act,

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.420
and we've got to hopefully--

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.100
drive participation is key.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.692
AUDIENCE: So to the
uninitiated, sevens--

00:47:26.692 --> 00:47:27.650
where did it come from?

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:31.690
Why does it exist, and what
is the relationship to 15s,

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:32.810
I guess, would be the--

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:33.644
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:33.644 --> 00:47:35.435
BLAINE SCULLY: 15s is
the traditional game,

00:47:35.435 --> 00:47:37.750
and then I believe sevens
was invented in Scotland--

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:38.070
ROSIE SPAULDING: That's right.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:38.805
BLAINE SCULLY: --in Melrose.

00:47:38.805 --> 00:47:39.070
ROSIE SPAULDING: Melrose.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.278
ROSS YOUNG: In Melrose, yeah.

00:47:40.278 --> 00:47:41.290
And it's very much--

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:44.380
I think sevens initially
came to pass with--

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:47.930
and again, we talk about values
of rugby, community values.

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:51.400
So sevens really started as
a end-of-season celebration

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.610
where lots of the local clubs
would get together and play

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.760
a tournament over a
day, with the barbecue

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.700
and beers, et cetera.

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:04.630
So that's really how
it started, and then

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:08.320
as it's developed into
a sport of its own,

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.720
it's now very-- as Blaine
mentioned-- very specific

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.860
athlete requirements.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.650
But yeah, initially
in those days

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:22.090
it was a social,
end-of-season gathering,

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:23.600
was how it really kicked off.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.680
Sevens have been around for--

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.307
I mean, 1866 is the original--

00:48:27.307 --> 00:48:28.890
BLAINE SCULLY: 120
years or something.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:29.723
ROSS YOUNG: --rugby.

00:48:29.723 --> 00:48:31.894
And I think sevens
pretty much is

00:48:31.894 --> 00:48:33.310
when you don't
have enough people,

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:34.851
people would play
the form of sevens.

00:48:34.851 --> 00:48:38.120
So it's been around from
the very early stages,

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.740
but it's only really
the last 20 years

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.950
where it's been established
as a standalone sport.

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:45.590
ROSIE SPAULDING: Yeah,
I was just going to add,

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:47.260
I think that it has
great potential,

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.870
especially with we're seeing
the Millennials as being

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:53.560
on of our major demographics,
and it is this very fast-paced,

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.515
quick, 15-minute--

00:48:55.515 --> 00:48:57.640
audience has a 15-minute
attention span for a game.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.390
And a lot of its
appeal is that it

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:05.250
is easier to understand than
the 90-minute game, fast,

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.587
and quick to learn, and great
to watch from an entertainment

00:49:08.587 --> 00:49:09.420
perspective as well.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.670
So I think that's one of
the reasons we're starting

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:14.710
to see growth in in every year.

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.530
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: And
other than rugby,

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:20.617
are their other sports that you
like to play, watch, or enjoy?

00:49:20.617 --> 00:49:21.700
BLAINE SCULLY: Everything.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.061
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Everything.

00:49:23.061 --> 00:49:23.560
Multi-sport?

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.935
BLAINE SCULLY:
Yeah, multi-sport.

00:49:24.935 --> 00:49:27.820
I mean, I think when you're
an athlete you just kind

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.270
of appreciate athletic
excellence wherever you see it,

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:31.600
and performance excellence.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:36.090
And I enjoyed watching
Wimbledon this weekend, or golf,

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:39.337
and obviously I'm a 49ers
fan and Giants fan--

00:49:39.337 --> 00:49:40.420
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: I'm sorry.

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.294
BLAINE SCULLY: --because
I'm from Sacramento.

00:49:42.294 --> 00:49:43.225
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:43.225 --> 00:49:44.475
BLAINE SCULLY: It's all right.

00:49:44.475 --> 00:49:45.980
We're OK.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.010
We will be.

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:53.780
And yeah, so I think as an
athlete I just appreciate

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.560
the greats, and the
LeBrons, and Tom Bradys,

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.350
and all those guys who exhibit
athletic excellence, I think,

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:02.192
is really cool.

00:50:02.192 --> 00:50:03.400
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: That's great.

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.190
ROSIE SPAULDING: Yeah,
similar for watching sport.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:07.481
I love watching sport at the
highest standard, whatever

00:50:07.481 --> 00:50:10.500
that might be, whether it's
soccer World Cup or Olympics.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.910
But I would always rather
participate in sport

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.030
than watch it, if I
get the opportunity.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.590
BLAINE SCULLY: I would agree.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.710
ROSIE SPAULDING: And
that's skiing, or surfing,

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:19.710
or mountain biking,
whatever it might be, just--

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:20.751
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Doing it.

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:23.400
ROSIE SPAULDING: --doing it is
always my preference if I can.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.110
ROSS YOUNG: I used
to root for Seattle.

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:26.760
I was much more an armchair fan.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:27.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.280
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: Nothing
wrong with that.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.020
ROSS YOUNG: I think
it's the same thing,

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:35.420
that you get drawn to sport,
and I'm very much like Blaine.

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.200
You know, if it's--

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.210
not so much now, I'm
old and decrepit,

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:45.320
but getting out there, doing
it, but just any sport is--

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.220
I used to play a little
bit of basketball

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.710
because I was, again, coming
back to my athletic prowess,

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.230
was the worst trainer ever.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:54.429
And to try basketball, probably
played in the summer in the UK.

00:50:54.429 --> 00:50:56.220
So at least it kept me
moving, and I didn't

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.731
have to start pre-season.

00:50:58.731 --> 00:51:00.720
It used to take me
three months to get fit,

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.830
and a month to get unfit.

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:03.570
So keep doing something so--

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:08.604
yeah, basketball definitely, and
then rugby through and through.

00:51:08.604 --> 00:51:10.020
BLAINE SCULLY:
Sorry, just to jump

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.650
in, I think that's a
real appeal about rugby,

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:14.340
is that it combines a lot of
these different elements of all

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:19.350
these different games, and
throws it into one competition.

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:21.340
And that's what I
found in my experience,

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.700
and that's one of the reasons
why I love it so much is

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.370
you have to play offense,
and you have to play defense,

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:27.350
and you have to
be able to catch,

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.641
and you have to be able to
pass, and you have to do all

00:51:29.641 --> 00:51:31.950
these different things
inside one game,

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:33.450
and that's what
makes it special,

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:35.565
I think-- in addition
to all the values

00:51:35.565 --> 00:51:36.690
and the different elements.

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:39.735
How much sports talk about
integrity, and sportsmanship,

00:51:39.735 --> 00:51:41.990
and discipline as values?

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.880
And then safety--

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.880
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: They
call the referee, sir.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.829
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:47.370
BLAINE SCULLY: Make
sure you do that.

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.870
ROSS YOUNG: The rugby values--
the respect, the camaraderie,

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:52.811
and I think there are so many
crossovers to your working life

00:51:52.811 --> 00:51:53.310
as well.

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:54.950
And I think that is--

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:59.340
there's great examples of people
that get involved in rugby,

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:01.560
and the benefits of
that decision-making,

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.120
a little bit of confidence.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.970
And Play Rugby USA
is a great program

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:08.435
that really hits some lower
demographics, initially

00:52:08.435 --> 00:52:11.414
out in New York and now in
LA, with kids who would never

00:52:11.414 --> 00:52:13.080
had a chance to get
to college that have

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.270
got to college through rugby.

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:16.676
So I think the--

00:52:16.676 --> 00:52:20.460
and then if you Google Olive
Kilifi from the Seattle

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:21.570
Seahawks--

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:23.720
Seawolves, even.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.550
I mean, he-- at the end of--

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:28.080
when they won an overall
MLR championship,

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.760
he did a great interview
about exactly that, and about

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.120
the difference that rugby made
to him, not just as a player

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.520
but from his own personal
life, by taking on those values

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.274
and adapting them to what
you do off the field as well.

00:52:42.274 --> 00:52:44.940
FLEUR KNOWSLEY: So everyone just
join me in thanking our guests,

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.920
and good luck for the
recovery, and the tournament

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:48.980
this weekend.

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:52.330
[APPLAUSE]
