I'm here with Sara Alspaugh, who is a PhD student at Berkeley,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in the lab where she works on energy-aware computing.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So tell us about this here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm working on a project in which we try to create electric loads

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
whose power consumption can be scheduled at a given point in time

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in order to make use of renewable supplies of energy like wind and solar

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which are only available when there's wind or sun

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and not available when we necessarily need them to be.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And so on this project we tried to create a computing cluster

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
in which we scheduled the work that the cluster did

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
at times when there was wind energy available.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So for instance, the types of work this cluster might be doing

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
is you might have some set of these machines which act as web frontends

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and respond to search queries, and they would need to respond to the search queries

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
as soon as the query came in, and you wouldn't be able to schedule this work any other time.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But some of the other stuff that the computing cluster might be doing

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is building the index for the search engine,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and that sort of work has some flexibility in when you actually can do it,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so you can wait until there's wind energy available to schedule this work.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And so these machines can do their work powered off of wind energy,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and the rest of the time you can keep them in a low power state

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
so they're not consuming energy.
