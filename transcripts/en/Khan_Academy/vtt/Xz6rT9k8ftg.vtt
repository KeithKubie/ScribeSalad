00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
Let's do some word problems.
It says this year

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.790
you got a 5% raise.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.830
If your new salary is $45,000,
what was your

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.960
salary before the raise?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.790
So let's say my old
salary is x.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.670
x is equal to old salary.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.030
And I got a 5% raise
off of that salary.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:32.549
So x plus 5% of x, plus 5%
times x-- that's my raise

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.880
right there-- is going to be
equal to my new salary.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.390
Well my new salary, they
tell us what it is.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.680
It's $45,000.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.850
And let's see if we can
algebraically manipulate this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.500
a little bit.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.050
5% is the same thing
as 0.05, 5%.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.960
Per cent literally
means per 100.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.580
So this is the same thing
as 5 over 100.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.770
This is 5%, per 100, which is
the same thing as 0.05.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.960
So here we could say this is
the same thing is 1x plus--

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.630
let me write that x a little bit
nicer-- 1x plus 0.05x is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.230
equal to 45,000.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.670
1 of something plus 0.05
of that same something.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.550
You can add the coefficients.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.530
So you add those two.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.200
You're going to get 1.05x
is equal to 45,000.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:45.720
And then to solve for x, you
divide both sides by 1.05.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.280
These will just cancel out.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.195
And we're going to get x is
equal to 45,000 over 1.05.

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:56.850
And let's figure out
what that is.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.820
So 45-- one, two, three--
$45,000 divided by 1.05 is

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.240
equal to $42,857.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:18.160
I'll say that again, $42,857.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.540
This is how much your annual
income was last year.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.160
Let's make sure that
that makes sense.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.240
Let's see if that works out.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.370
So if we check it, let's
say we start with this.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.300
Let's take 5% of that.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.700
So times 0.05 is equal to-- so
that's the amount of raise you

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.350
had-- plus your old salary,
plus 42,857.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.060
And, of course, we round
it off a little bit,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.500
so it won't be exact.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.020
And it equals almost
exactly $45,000.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.280
We're like 14 cents
below that.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.740
So $45,000.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.090
So this answer checks out.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.100
Let's do this next one.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.930
It costs $250-- let me write
this down-- it costs $250 to

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.570
carpet a room that
is 14 by 18.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.860
How much does it cost to carpet
a room that is 9 by 10?

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.700
And the units here are feet.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.910
Well in case you have never
carpeted a room, you normally

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.910
carpet a room by the amount of
area the room is, or the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.920
square footage of the room.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.000
So what we could do is use this
information up here to

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.475
figure out how much it costs
per square foot.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.220
So in this situation we had
14 by 18, so how many

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.760
square feet is that?

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.920
So I'll multiply it out.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.790
18 times 14.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.580
4 times 8 is 32.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.840
1 times 4 is 4, plus 3 is 7.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.220
You have a 0.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.810
1 times 8 is 8.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.800
1 times 1 is 1.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.170
You have a 2.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.470
You have a 15.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.500
And then you have a 2.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.430
So it's 252 square feet.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:15.990
So 14 times 18, this
is 252 square feet.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.260
Which is kind of a
strange number.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.180
It's almost exactly $1.00 per
square foot, but not exactly

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.800
equal to $1.00 per
square foot.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.240
So if you want to know per
square foot, they charged us

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.830
$250 for 252 square feet.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.150
So it's going to be a
little bit less than

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.450
$1.00 per square foot.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.550
Let me confirm my math.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.040
So you have 18 times
14 is equal to 252.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:52.530
And then so they're charging us
$250 for 252 square feet.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.820
So it's like 99.2 cents
per square foot.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.960
So if we write this as a
function, they're going to

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.720
charge us as a function of,
let's say the square footage,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.760
or let me say as a function of
the area where a is the area

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.800
of our floor.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.960
They're going to charge us--
what was that number I just

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:20.620
had-- 99.2 cents, 0.992 times
our area in square footage.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.980
This is an expression
of how much they're

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.510
going to charge us.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.010
So here, what's our area?

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.460
We have 9 by 10.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.550
So this is our area is equal
to 90 square feet.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.620
So the cost of 90 square feet
of carpeting for 90 square

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.170
feet is going to be a little
bit less than $90.00.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.100
We know this is a little
bit less than

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.630
$1.00 per square foot.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.440
We can actually do it.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.580
It's 0.992 times 90.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.830
So let's multiply
this times 90.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:01.410
It's equal to like $89.29.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.830
If I were to have written this
problem, I would have made

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.780
this number 250 so that it would
have been exactly $1.00

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.840
per square foot, and so we
wouldn't have had to break out

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.560
the calculator.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.160
But anyway, I didn't
write this problem.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.590
Problem 6.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.150
It costs $12.00 to get into the
San Diego County Fair, and

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.340
$1.50 per ride.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.530
If Rena spent $24.00 in total,
how may rides did she go on?

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.510
So no matter what, it's going
to cost you $12.00,

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.390
plus $1.50 per ride.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.950
Plus $1.50 times the number
of rides you go on.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.960
This is how much it's going to
cost for you to spend your day

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.780
at the San Diego County Fair.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.370
I could write this
as a function.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.680
I could write cost as a function
of rides is $12.00

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.805
plus $1.50 times the
number of rides.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.560
So we know that Rena spent
$24.00 in total.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.710
So what was the number
of rides she went on?

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.820
Well we could solve for this.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.260
We could just look at
this part of the

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.580
equation right there.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.680
So what do we get?

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.750
We get 12 plus-- I'll
just write this as--

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.990
1.5r is equal to 24.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.370
Let's subtract 12 from both
sides of the equation.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.500
So that becomes-- so I'll write
it here-- negative 12

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.470
plus negative 12.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.290
Subtract the 12 from
both sides.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.770
You get 1.5r is equal to 12.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.670
And divide both sides by 1.5.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:43.300
You get r is equal to-- what's
12 divided by 1.5-- that is 8.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.660
1.5 times 8 is 12.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.780
1-1/2 times 8.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.380
One 8 is 8, and 1/2 of
an 8 is 4, that's 12.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.650
So she went on 8 rides.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.060
And let's verify.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.430
Let's verify by looking at
what's the cost of 8 rides?

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.550
It's going to be $12.00 plus
1.5 times the 8 rides.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.850
So that's going to be
$12.00 plus, well

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.200
1.5 times 8 is $12.00.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.230
So this is going to be
equal to $24.00.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.100
So we have verified
our problem.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.830
All right.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.220
Let's do one more.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.900
The sum of angles in a triangle
is 180 degrees.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.530
That's good to know
in general.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.040
You'll see that many
times in geometry.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.980
Let me write this down.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.520
So let me draw some random
triangle right there.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.250
So that is my triangle.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.684
If the second angle is twice the
size of the first angle.

00:08:33.684 --> 00:08:35.570
So let me make my first angle.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.350
Let's say that the angle is x.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.140
That's my first angle.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.450
The second angle is twice the
size of the first angle.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.730
So let's say this is the second
angle, that's 2x.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.540
And the third angle is
three times the size

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.420
of the first angle.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.950
So the third angle is three
times this one, so that's 3x.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.910
What are the measures of the
angles in the triangle?

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.480
Well they tell us that
they all have to

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.790
add up to 180 degrees.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:06.030
So we get x plus 2x
plus 3x has to be

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.650
equal to 180 degrees.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.450
And I could even write
this as 1x.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.990
Just remember that there's
a coefficient there.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.180
So 1 of something plus 2 of
something plus 3 of something.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.710
That's going to be 6
of the somethings.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.830
1 plus 2 plus 3.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:23.140
So 6x is equal to 180 degrees.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.320
Divide both sides by 6.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:34.110
And you get x is equal to
180 divided by 6 is 30.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.450
So this angle right
here is 30.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.410
This angle right here is
two times that, right?

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.050
It's 2x.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.200
So this angle right
here is 60.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.280
And this angle right here
is three times that.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.500
That's equal to 90.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.370
So let's see if this meets
our requirements.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.950
This is a 30, 60, 90.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.360
They definitely add up to 180.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.140
30 plus 60 is 90,
plus 90 is 180.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.360
And then if we look at the
requirements, the second angle

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.200
is twice the size of the first.
Right, 60 is twice 30.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.070
And the third angle is three
times the size of the first.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.980
90 is 3 times 30.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.230
So it all worked out.
