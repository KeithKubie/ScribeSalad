00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:04.786
&gt;&gt;Wings, can I give you some praise?

00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:05.106
&gt;&gt;All: Yeah!

00:00:05.106 --> 00:00:08.236
&gt;&gt;This is Wings for Kids, an after
school program in Charleston,

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:11.076
South Carolina, for children
in grades K through six.

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:16.006
It's three hours a day, five
days a week, dedicated solely

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:18.976
to teaching kids critical,
social and emotional skills.

00:00:20.206 --> 00:00:22.196
&gt;&gt;All: I saw the wings.

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:24.766
Let me tell you why I learned--

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:28.516
&gt;&gt;Every day, the children
chant a song that sums

00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:31.956
up Wings' essential teachings:
monitoring your feelings,

00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:36.066
listening to each other and
making good choices for yourself.

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:37.746
It's called the creed.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:42.976
&gt;&gt;All: The choices I make shall
be what's best for me to do.

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:46.326
&gt;&gt;Throughout the afternoon,
the teachers stay on message,

00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:49.846
reminding the students how they
can live these lessons and succeed.

00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:52.956
&gt;&gt;We have to learn how to
say no to peer pressure,

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:56.886
so that we can make the choice that's
best for ourselves to make, okay?

00:00:57.606 --> 00:01:00.656
&gt;&gt;Wings is a nonprofit,
established more than a decade ago.

00:01:01.176 --> 00:01:04.356
It serves boys and girls who
come from a poor community.

00:01:04.576 --> 00:01:09.076
At Wings, they're taking dance
classes and doing art projects

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:13.406
and playing competitive games,
all activities with social

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.316
and emotional lessons
hidden inside them.

00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:21.076
&gt;&gt;When I say "go" you must find
the right sentence to create to go

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:22.556
against that peer pressure.

00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:27.076
Once again we go into Wings,
when someone says "Hey,

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:30.776
you want to skip wings and let's
go to the store over there?"

00:01:30.776 --> 00:01:30.906
Go!

00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:34.756
&gt;&gt;These lessons give children
confidence to express themselves,

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:37.456
overcome setbacks, and
work well with others.

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:42.086
Tools that equip them for
success in school, work and life.

00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:45.976
&gt;&gt;Let's see who can tell me
what our objective this week is.

00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:48.686
&gt;&gt;The Wings teachers, who
are local college students,

00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:50.996
emphasize a new lesson each week.

00:01:51.406 --> 00:01:55.986
&gt;&gt;When I say "go" do your
move and say your phrase.

00:01:56.396 --> 00:01:59.486
Once again, "Let's steal
the candy from that desk."

00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:00.856
All right, brainstorm."

00:02:01.056 --> 00:02:02.616
&gt;&gt;After school is an ideal time

00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:05.356
for teaching these skills
in the guise of fun.

00:02:06.046 --> 00:02:09.206
Skills that often don't get full
attention during the school day.

00:02:09.206 --> 00:02:11.546
&gt;&gt;One more time, don't
want to get in trouble!

00:02:11.546 --> 00:02:13.976
&gt;&gt;All: Don't want to get in trouble!

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:16.486
&gt;&gt;People often think of
these abilities as innate.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:21.056
Either you're resilient and good at
managing your emotions or you're not.

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:25.486
But anecdotal evidence shows
Wings kids are behaving

00:02:25.486 --> 00:02:28.336
and performing better
in the classroom.

00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:31.526
Among the small group of students
who attended the first year

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:35.556
of the program, 40 percent
more graduated from high school

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.716
than those who didn't go to Wings.

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:42.196
So Wings believes, and the first
bits of data from the program suggest

00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:47.566
that social and emotional skills
can be taught, enabling each child,

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:51.736
even children whom life has
dealt many obstacles, to soar.
