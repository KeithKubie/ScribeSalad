00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.410
- [Instructor] We're told the function f

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.300
is twice differentiable
with f of two equals one,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.960
f prime of two is equal to four,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.790
and f prime prime of
two is equal to three.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.020
What is the value of the approximation

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.630
of f of 1.9 using the line
tangent to the graph of f

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.280
at x equals two?

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.300
So pause this video and see
if you can figure this out.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.483
This is an actual question
from a past AP Calculus exam.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.720
All right now let's do this together.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.330
And if I was actually
doing this on an exam,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.160
I would just cut to the
chase and I would figure out

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.440
the equation of the
tangent line at x equals

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.560
to go through the point two comma one,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.650
and then I would figure out okay,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.140
when x is equal to 1.9,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.690
what is the value of y?

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.270
And that would be my approximation.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.640
But for the sake of learning
and getting the intuition here,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.220
let's just make sure we
understand what's happening.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.900
So let me graph this.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.190
So let's say that's my y-axis,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.370
and then this is my x-axis.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.820
And this is x equals one.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.820
This is x equals two.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.230
This is y equals one.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.400
We know that the point two comma one

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.060
is on the graph of y is equal to f of x.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.040
So we know that point
right over there is there.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.760
And we also know the
slope of the tangent line.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.920
The slope of the tangent line is four.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.630
So it's gonna look something like this.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.780
It's gonna probably even be
a little steeper than that.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.850
The slope of the tangent
line is gonna look

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.390
something like that.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.480
And we don't know much more about it.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.230
We know the second derivative here.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.260
But what they're asking us
to do is without knowing

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.650
what the function actually looks like,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.850
the function might look
something like this.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.670
Let me just draw something.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.660
So the function might look,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.210
might look something like this.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.890
We're trying to figure
out what f of 1.9 is.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.883
So if x is 1.9,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.080
f of 1.9, if that's the way
the function actually looked,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.600
might be this value right over here.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.020
But we don't know for
sure because we don't know

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.580
much more about the function.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.650
But what they're suggesting for us to do

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.470
is use this tangent line.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.120
If we know the equation
of this tangent line here,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.400
we could say well what does
that tangent line equal

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.190
when x equals 1.9?

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.260
When x equals 1.9,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.770
it equals that point right over there.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.180
And then we could use
that as our approximation

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.000
for f of 1.9.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.350
Well to do that we need
to know the equation

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.000
of the tangent line.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.520
And we could do that in point-slope form.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.130
We would just have to say y minus

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.520
the y value that we know is on that line,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.150
the point two comma one
we know is on that line,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.820
so y minus one

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.030
is going to be equal to the
slope of our tangent line,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.150
which we know is going
to be equal to four,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.470
times x minus the x value that corresponds

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.200
to that y value, so x minus two.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.970
So now we just have to
substitute x equals 1.9

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.660
to get our approximation for f of 1.9.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.410
So we would say y minus
one is equal to four times

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.100
1.9 minus two.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.520
1.9 minus two is negative 0.1.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.600
And let's see four times negative 0.1,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.100
this all simplifies to negative 0.4.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.710
Now you add one to both sides,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.720
you get y is equal to,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.100
if you add one here you're gonna get 0.6.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.010
So this, I didn't draw it quite to scale,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.080
0.6 might be something
closer to right around there,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.913
but there you go.

00:03:10.913 --> 00:03:14.780
That is our approximation for f of 1.9,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.060
which is choice B.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.040
And we're done.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.830
And one interesting thing to notice,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.260
we didn't have to use all
the information they gave us.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.270
We did not have to use this information

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.020
about the second derivative
in order to solve the problem.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.030
So if you ever find
yourself in that situation,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.030
don't doubt yourself too much.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.823
Because they will sometimes
give you unneeded information.
