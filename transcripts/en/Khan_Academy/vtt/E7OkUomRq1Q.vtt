00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.450
Let omega be the complex
number cosine of 2 pi over 3

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.660
plus i sine of 2 pi
over 3, then the number

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.800
of distinct complex numbers
z satisfying this determinant

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.850
equaling 0.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.470
So we have this 3 by 3
determinant equaling 0.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.340
So let's just evaluate
this determinant

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.270
and see if we can solve
for z, or figure out

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.860
how many complex numbers z
that we get satisfying this--

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.450
what's essentially an equation.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.140
So let's evaluate
the determinant.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.290
So if we start with
this term up here

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.790
it's going to be this term times
the determinant of this sub 2

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.220
by two matrix.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.830
So it's going to be
z plus 1, times z

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:56.060
plus omega squared, times
z plus omega, minus 1.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.400
So this is the determinant
of the sub 2 by 2 matrix

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.830
right over here-- the sub 2
by 2 determinant-- and that's

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.300
the z plus 1.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.310
And then we have to swap signs.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.150
We go here.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.220
We want to put a
negative sign out front.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.650
You have that
checkerboard pattern

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.970
when you evaluate determinants.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.370
So minus omega times-- you
block out that row, that column.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.540
So the sub-determinant is
omega times z plus omega.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.250
Let me just multiply
that out right now.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.840
So that's z omega plus omega
squared, minus omega squared,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.594
times 1.

00:01:32.594 --> 00:01:33.510
So that's pretty neat.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.490
We already got something
that simplifies a little bit.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.930
And then we have to worry
about this omega squared.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.180
So it's going to be plus omega
squared times omega times

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.930
one-- omega times 1
is omega-- minus omega

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.560
squared times z plus omega.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.235
So minus omega squared z
minus omega to the fourth.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.790
And remember this
whole expression

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.490
needs to be equal to 0.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.890
This whole thing needs
to be equal to 0.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.680
Now let's see if we can simplify
this thing a little bit.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.690
So let me first multiply
these two guys in here.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.600
So z times z is z squared.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.120
Z times omega is z omega.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.450
Omega squared times
z is omega squared z.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.550
And then omega
squared times omega

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.430
is omega to the third power--
plus omega to the third power.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.570
And then we have
this minus 1 here.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.870
And then all of that's going
to be multiplied by z plus 1.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.700
Let me just continue
with this blue part

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.074
since we're already
focused here.

00:02:48.074 --> 00:02:50.580
So this is going to be
z times all of this.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.550
So it's going to be z to
the third power plus z

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.470
squared omega, plus
omega squared z squared,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.380
plus omega to the
third z minus z.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.450
I just multiplied z
times all of this.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.850
And then plus 1
times all of this.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.200
So plus this thing again,
z squared plus z omega,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:23.130
plus omega squared z, plus
omega to the third, minus 1.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.160
And then let's simplify
this over here.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.716
So that in green,
these canceled out.

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:29.090
So we're just left
with-- I'll do

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.620
the same green-- negative
omega times z omega.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.200
So it's minus z omega squared.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.739
And then over here
in magenta we have

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:50.040
plus omega to the third power
minus omega to the third z.

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:54.750
Oh, let me be careful.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.230
That would be omega
to the fourth.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.830
Omega squared
times omega squared

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.780
is omega to the fourth--
omega to the fourth z.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.870
And then omega squared
times omega to the fourth

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.924
is omega to the sixth.

00:04:06.924 --> 00:04:08.090
And we have a negative sign.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.800
So negative omega to the sixth.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.920
And of course, this whole
thing needs to be equal to 0.

00:04:18.494 --> 00:04:20.160
Well, let's see if
we can simplify this.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.870
Let's just group the terms--
the different powers of z.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.410
So we have a z to
the third here.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.430
And that is the only z to
the third that we have.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.030
And then let's group
the z squared terms.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.160
So this is a z squared term.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.470
This is a z squared term.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.370
That's a z squared term.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.120
And then we don't have
any more z squared terms.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.720
And so the
coefficients-- this is

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.020
going to be the same thing as
omega squared-- that's this one

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:58.815
right over here-- plus omega,
plus 1, times z squared.

00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:00.190
So we've taken
care of everything

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.430
that I've underlined
in pink over here.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.439
Now let's worry
about the z terms.

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:08.480
I'll do it in this color.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.060
So this is a z term.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.890
We're just multiplying times z.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.060
This is a z term.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.990
This is a z term.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.970
That is also a z term.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.480
And then do we have
any other z terms?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.400
Well, this is a z
term right over here.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.010
And in fact, these
two cancel out.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.780
You have negative
z omega squared,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.060
positive z omega squared.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.500
So this and this cancel out.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.060
And so our only z terms
are these three over here.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.330
So we have plus
omega to the third.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.590
And then we have plus
omega to the third.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.460
Oh let me-- this
color is too close.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.250
Plus omega to the third.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.981
And then our next z is minus 1.

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:49.730
But then we actually
have this omega here.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.737
So plus omega minus 1.

00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:53.570
I was getting confused
because this white is

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.860
so close to this pink.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:02.470
So it's omega to the third
minus 1, plus omega, times z.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.514
And then oh, we
can't forget this.

00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:05.680
We have this term over here.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.260
Omega to the fourth times z.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:17.100
So we have minus 1
omega to the third z.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.550
Then we have minus 1 z.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.110
Then we have plus omega z.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.870
And then we have negative
omega to the fourth z.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.287
So I'll just put it out here.

00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:29.370
I'm not doing it in a nice
descending power order,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.520
but I don't want to have
to rewrite all of this.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.250
So then we took care
of all of the z terms.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.530
And then what we have
left is just what

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.800
we can view-- the constant
terms, from a z point of view.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.580
So we have omega--
So plus omega cubed.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.422
Actually, we have
two omega cubed.

00:06:47.422 --> 00:06:49.630
We have an omega cubed here
and an omega cubed there.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.270
We've taken care of those.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.680
And then we have minus
omega to the sixth.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.810
And then we have minus 1.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.490
And all of this
needs to equal 0.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.900
Now, this might look
pretty daunting,

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.550
especially when omega looks
like this fairly complex-- well,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.930
it is a complex expression.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.070
But maybe, or probably,
it popped into your mind

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.270
that this can also be expressed
as an exponential using

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.470
Euler's formula.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:24.610
We know that e to the i theta is
equal to cosine of theta plus i

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.680
sine of theta.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.580
So omega can be
rewritten as, omega

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:38.480
is the exact same thing
as e to the 2 pi over 3 i.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.615
That's what omega is.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.240
And what is e to
the 2 pi over 3 i?

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.730
We can evaluate that here.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.880
It's cosine 2 pi over 3.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.580
And we can get our
unit circle out.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.079
2 pi over 3 corresponds
to 120 degrees.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:54.620
So let me get my
unit circle out just

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.480
so we can figure out
what the values are.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.480
And the reason why I'm
doing this-- I'm actually

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.688
going to evaluate it here
just to get a number here--

00:08:02.688 --> 00:08:04.990
but the reason I'm doing this
is it becomes much easier

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.060
to take the powers of
e to the 2 pi over 3 i

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.104
than to take the powers
of this thing over here.

00:08:11.104 --> 00:08:12.770
But if we take the
unit circle, if we're

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.090
at 120 degrees on the
unit circle like this,

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.050
this is 2 pi over 3.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.920
Then we have a situation.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.870
This angle over here is
going to be 60 degrees.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.670
And so our height is going to
be square root of 3 over 2.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.000
And our x-coordinate is
going to be negative 1/2.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.270
So this is going to be
equal to negative 1/2.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.840
Cosine of 2 pi over
3 is negative 1/2.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.919
And then our sine of 2 pi over
3 is square root of 3 over 2.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.930
But that's being
multiplied by an i.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:47.320
So plus square
root of 3 over 2 i.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.120
So that is omega.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.600
Now, let's think
about omega squared.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.000
Omega squared is
going to be this

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.070
raised to the second power.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.580
So it's e to the-- we just
multiply it by 2. e to the 4 pi

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.000
over 3 i.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.310
We just multiply this by 2.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.390
So it's equivalent
to 240 degrees.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.829
So it's equivalent to
this right over here.

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:10.620
So let me write it.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:16.240
This is the same thing
as cosine of 4 pi over 3,

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.110
plus i sine of four pi over 3.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.060
And here our x-coordinate
is going to be the same.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.360
It's going to be negative 1/2.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.350
So this is equal
to negative 1/2.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:34.620
And our y-coordinate is negative
square root of 3 over 2 i.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.280
Now let's think of omega
to the third power.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:45.050
Omega to the third power is
equal to e to the 2 pi i, which

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:51.010
is equal to cosine of 2
pi plus i sine of 2 pi.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.400
Well, sine of 2 pi is just 0.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:58.120
Cosine of 2 pi is equal to 1.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.650
Then we go to omega
to the fourth power,

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.540
because that also shows
up in these expressions.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.640
So we have omega to the
fourth power is equal to-- we

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:17.040
just multiply it times 4--
it's e to the 8 pi over 3 i.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.280
8 pi over 3 is equivalent
to-- so this was 2 pi over 3.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.030
This is 4 pi over 3.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.560
This is essentially 6 pi over 3.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.910
And then 8 pi over 3
becomes-- is essentially

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:32.010
the same angle as 2 pi
over 3-- so its value is

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:32.950
going to be the same.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:38.110
Negative 1/2 plus square
root of 3 over 2 i.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.170
And then we don't have
an omega to the fifth,

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.940
but we do have an omega
to the sixth here.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.290
So let's just figure that out.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.095
Omega to the sixth-- well,
that's just omega cubed

00:10:46.095 --> 00:10:46.595
squared.

00:10:46.595 --> 00:10:48.180
And omega cubed is 1.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.850
So it's just going
to be 1 squared,

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.245
or it's also going to be 1.

00:10:51.245 --> 00:10:52.870
Now with that out of
the way, let's see

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.710
what these things simplify to.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.070
Hopefully they
simplify to something.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.740
So this expression
right here-- omega

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.489
squared-- we have--
I'll write it up here.

00:11:00.489 --> 00:11:04.810
We have negative 1/2 minus
square root of 3 over 2 i.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.230
That's omega squared.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.140
Then we have plus omega.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.770
Omega is right here.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:14.500
Negative 1/2 plus square
root of 3 over 2 i.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.450
And then we have a plus 1.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.270
So the negative square
root of 3 over 2 i

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.820
and the positive square root
of 3 over 2 i cancel out.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.370
Negative 1/2 minus 1/2 is
negative one, plus one.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.510
Those cancel out.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.182
So this whole expression
comes out to be 0.

00:11:28.182 --> 00:11:28.890
So we can ignore.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.970
This is going to be
0 no matter what.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.440
Now let's look at
this over here.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.410
This is omega cubed.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.910
Omega cubed we know
is 1, plus omega,

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.790
which is-- so I
should write minus 1/2

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:49.160
plus square root of
3 over 2 i, minus 1,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.505
minus omega to the fourth.

00:11:51.505 --> 00:11:54.290
Well, omega to the fourth
is the same thing as omega.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.670
Omega to the fourth is
the same thing as omega.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.367
So you have omega
minus something

00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:00.700
that's the same thing as itself.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.100
Those are going to cancel out.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.079
Omega cubed is 1.

00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:04.870
So the 1 and the 1 are
going to cancel out.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.230
So this is also equal to 0.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.890
I think I see a pattern here.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.348
And then finally, let's look
at these characters over here.

00:12:11.348 --> 00:12:12.930
2 times omega
cubed-- this is just

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.740
going to be a 2 here--
minus omega to the sixth.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.190
Well, that's just minus 1.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.860
And then you have a minus 1.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.090
So this 2, minus 1, minus 1.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.270
This is also equal to 0.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.410
So that whole determinant that
whole equation has simplified

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:34.020
to z to the third
power is equal to 0.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.920
And the only number,
that when they take it

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.580
to the third power-- real,
or complex, or anything--

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.290
is going to be 0.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.610
z equals 0 is the only solution.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.910
But they're not asking us that.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.070
They're asking the number
of distinct complex numbers

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.720
z satisfying this.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.340
So z equals 0 is the only
one that satisfies this.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.810
So the number of complex
numbers satisfying it is 1.
