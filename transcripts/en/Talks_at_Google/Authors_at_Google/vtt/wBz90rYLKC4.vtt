OWEN: Hi, and welcome
to Authors at Google.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.920
This is my first event
that I've organized.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.930
So I'm very proud to
have a good turn out,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.532
and have everything
going smoothly.

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:27.180
Rosalind Williams has been
teaching at MIT since 1980

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.660
starting in the
writing program and now

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.040
with the program in Science,
Technology, and Society,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.430
eventually becoming its head.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.560
In the '90s she served
as dean of student life

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.320
in undergraduate education.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.360
At the same time
she managed to raise

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.960
a future DBA, and an
astrophysicist, and a Swede.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.235
Her previous book,
"Retooling," emerged

00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:53.510
from her experience of
seeing technology launched

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.440
by an institution come
back later to change it.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.425
And many of her other
works she uses literature

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.700
to get a phone call
during the [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.230
She uses literature to study
the history of technology.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.156
And that's what she's done with
"Triumph of the Human Empire."

00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:14.080
I'm happy to present
Rosalind Williams.

00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:22.560
ROSALIND: Thank
you very much Owen.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.240
This is like a classroom.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.380
Everybody's at the back.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.400
You can creep up if you care to.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.000
But even though I spend
time in the classroom

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.500
I like to be a
historian who's talking

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.470
not only to other historians.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.310
So I really appreciate
your coming,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.510
spending the time and attention,
and I'll be very interested

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.580
in your feedback.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.390
So the beginning is always
a good place to start.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.980
And the beginning
here is the title

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.190
of this book, ie. what I've been
thinking about for the last 10

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.180
years.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.130
So I want to start by explaining
the key words in that title,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.750
especially "human
empire," but also

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.460
what do we mean
by its "triumph."

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.970
What's with the "end of the
world" and why these three

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.330
guys, Verne, Morris,
and Stevenson?

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.170
So I'm going to start with
the phrase "human empire"

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.100
because it's the
key to the rest.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.170
And this sentence,
this one sentence,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.290
is the key to Western
history as we know it,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.510
to the modern world.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.440
So I'm going to spend some
time on this sentence,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.070
and explain first of all that
Francis Bacon, Sir Francis

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.330
Bacon, who wrote it, is a
Renaissance man in the sense

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.320
that he was a mover and shaker.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.350
He was the equivalent of
Attorney General in Britain

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.450
in his day, and a fabulously
good writer and speaker.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.440
But of course he's also
a real Renaissance man.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.350
This is the Renaissance.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.340
And so it's important
that he's writing

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.290
at this time in the
early 1600's because this

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.860
is the pivotal moment when
Westerners are beginning

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.060
to imagine history being
different from history

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.510
as the human race had
known it ever before.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.730
This is the pivot point of
defining a new kind of history,

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.980
a history of what we
now call progress.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.090
I mean it's a time when
Europeans have discovered what

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.050
for them is a new world.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.180
They're busy settling it.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.040
You notice the date.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.360
This is when
Jamestown was settled,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.080
Plymouth is just
getting started.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.710
The Catholic Church has
ceased to be a monopoly.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.610
There's now a choice of
religion after the Protestant

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.080
Reformation.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.330
Copernicus has opened up the
idea of a whole new world

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.110
system.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.070
Just 15 years
earlier, give or take,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.640
Galileo has assembled
a telescope, turned it

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.590
to the heavens, has
seen the phases on Venus

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.950
and the craters on the moon.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.550
This is a time when
the world is breaking

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.560
open from the closed
medieval world,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.920
and everything is happening, and
all sorts of new possibilities

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.620
are out there.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.600
And Bacon is best known for
articulating what we now

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.810
call the scientific method.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.440
He is the guy, when you say the
Baconian method, this is Bacon,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.420
and what you mean is a method of
experimentation of a purisicm.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.260
And so this sentence comes
from not one of his essays.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.560
It comes from a
fantasy novel that he

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.190
wrote called "The New Atlantis."

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.940
And in this fantasy
a group of Europeans

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.160
are shipwrecked somewhere
in the South Pacific.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.790
They wash up on an
uncharted island

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.080
and they discover a
lost civilization.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.240
And it's a civilization of some
lost Atlantis run by Solomon,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.880
the ruler, who has started a
foundation, a sort of research

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.210
university on the island.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.500
And most of the story is
telling about the research

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.705
they do on that island
in great detail.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:07.140
It's quite fascinating.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.480
This is one sentence at
the beginning of the book,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.200
towards the beginning,
where Solomon

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.670
is telling the shipwrecked
sailors what that foundation is

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.650
all about.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.940
And you can read it. "The
end," that is the purpose,

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.500
"of our foundation is
the knowledge of causes,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.360
and secret motions of
things; and the enlarging

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.060
of the bounds of human
empire, to the effecting

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.370
of all things possible."

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.435
This is the agenda
for the modern world.

00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:36.935
That's it.

00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:39.180
That's what we're trying to do.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.800
And it's not an empire
in a territorial sense,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.050
like the British empire.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.620
This is an empire in the
sense of a vast expansion

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.050
of human knowledge,
leading to more power,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.690
leading to a better
world for humans.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.010
It's the dream of progress.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.650
So my question in this book
is did the dream come true?

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.350
And did this great experiment
in changing history work?

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.200
And, if so, how
would we know it?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.840
How do you tell if
it's been successful?

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.470
It's a macro history question.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.200
This is big history.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.530
But I answer it
through micro history,

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.430
because while there is all
sorts of material evidence

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.480
you can point to
that humans have

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.100
come to dominate the planet
I would argue that there's

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.500
no single piece of
material evidence

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.390
that nails the case
that ultimately it's

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.440
an event of consciousness
for human beings

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.290
to conclude that we
dominate the planet,

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.750
and to conclude what the
meaning of that event is.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.080
And I'll talk more
about this, but I really

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.720
want to focus on
people's consciousness.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.090
When did human
beings become aware

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.730
of our domination of the planet?

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.430
And my answer is it's
the late 19th century.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.840
And my answer is the best
way to look for this event is

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.330
through very thoughtful,
articulate, smart people,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.930
and they happen to be writers.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.560
Because I think if
you look at literature

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.950
you're getting consciousness.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.190
That's where you go.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.280
Those are the archives
of consciousness.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.980
It's in literature.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.380
So I'm not using these
guys as case studies.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.980
I'm using them as
kind of allegories.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.520
Well, maybe they're more
like-- I'm not using them

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.390
as biographies, but I'm
pulling out evidence

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.680
from their lives and
work to make my point

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.400
about the rise of and
triumph of human empire.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.590
Now note the dates.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.130
They're all born in the second
quarter of the 19th century

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.070
give or take.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.330
The earliest to be born,
Verne, is the last to die,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.760
and he lives into
the 20th century.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.670
Morris and Stevenson
live until the 1890's.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.520
The point though is they're
all most active as writers

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.210
in the last quarter
of the 19th century.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.280
So they overlap.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.170
Their lives aren't quite overlap
as much as their works do.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.190
So they are writing
at the time when

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.410
I'm claiming that the
triumph of human empire

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.260
is becoming evident, and they
are really aware of this,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.860
and they're really interested
in how it's happening

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.210
and what the meaning is.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.770
So I'm just going to give
a little background sketch

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.690
of what is happening in the
greater world at that time,

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.539
later 19th century.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.210
And I'm trying to
remind you that it's

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.010
an age of globalization
as much as ours is.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.970
We are new but
we're not that new.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.050
So let me give some examples.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.970
Actually the best is
given by Verne himself.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:55.020
He was interviewed in 1891,
so he was kind of 60-ish,

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.440
by an editor of a
Boston based kids

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.300
magazine, "The
Youth's Companion."

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.050
So this editor
contacted Verne and said

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.700
give me some reminiscences
of your youth,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.350
because Verne grew up
in Nantes, in France.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.160
So Verne wrote back.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.840
He said, "I have seen the
birth of phosphorus matches,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.060
stamps, the metric
system, steamboats

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.380
on the water, omni-buses,
railways, trams, gas,

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.660
electricity, the telegraph,
the telephone, the phonograph.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.360
I am of the generation between
these two geniuses, Stevenson,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.060
and Edison!"

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:38.580
Stevenson is the inventor of
the railway, effective inventor.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.780
And Edison, we all know Edison.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.870
So between the
railway and the dynamo

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.970
Verne says that's my
generation, and that's

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.290
a really good way
of defining it.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.660
Another way though is just
to look at the map of world.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.330
This is a map from 1878.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.850
It's from a British publisher.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.550
I don't know how
well you can see it,

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.470
but it's really-- I wish
you could because it's

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.510
a very useful map
to make my point.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.440
In fact, when I saw this atlas
containing this map in the map

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.700
room of the Oxford library,
the Bodleian library,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.190
I said that's it, I'm
seeing human empire.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.120
I see it.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.840
And one thing I saw was
the fact that up here

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.600
at the top of Greenland
it's still unfinished.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.190
They don't quite know what
the Arctic geography is.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.150
But most of all I
notice-- See these lines

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.130
show steamship lines and some of
them are submarine cable lines.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.640
And they are connecting the
old world with the new world,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.035
and where they hit the new
world you can get on a railway

00:10:46.035 --> 00:10:48.130
and go across the United States.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.160
This is 1878.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.030
You can do this in
three weeks or under.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.500
And actually Robert
Louis Stevenson

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.590
did it, because he was chasing
his American girlfriend who

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.110
lived out in Monterrey.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.020
So three weeks from Glasgow
to the beaches of Monterrey,

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.570
which I have to say you will
hear in "Treasure Island."

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.170
"Treasure Island" is California.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:12.918
It's not the Caribbean,
Johnny Depp aside.

00:11:12.918 --> 00:11:13.890
OK?

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.950
But you can see the
wiring of the world then.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.811
And I'll remind you
what this means.

00:11:20.811 --> 00:11:22.560
It means, first of
all, people are moving,

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.140
and not just writers.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.530
Between 1870 and
1925 one seventh

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:34.470
of the world's working age
population changed countries.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.380
That's a huge
amount of migration.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.310
In the same era there's much
lower cost for transport.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.810
And it's not just
wheat opening up,

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:47.030
say the American West
to the European market.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:52.620
It's also stuff like petroleum,
and rubber, and frozen foods

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.632
pretty soon.

00:11:53.632 --> 00:11:55.840
And finally, there are a
lot of financial connections

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.775
that you don't see but
are implied by this.

00:11:58.775 --> 00:12:00.440
There's the gold standard.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.040
Investments overseas are
at a much higher rate

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.630
than they are now.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.240
Before World War
I more than half

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.680
of the British investments
in everything were overseas.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.110
They weren't in Britain.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.640
So for these writers
that I'm talking about,

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.010
they love this world.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.710
They're excited by it.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.370
These are people who are
really interested in science

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.540
and technology as
we would now say.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.190
And so this world of human
empire is to them thrilling.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.420
This is Verne in his old age.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.940
Even if you haven't
read him you know him,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.390
because you know "20,000
Leagues Under the Sea,"

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.471
and "Around the
World in 80 Days,"

00:12:42.471 --> 00:12:44.720
and "Journey to the Center
of the Earth," and the moon

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.220
novels.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.800
You know him.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.510
He was not a scientist himself.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.500
He never claimed to be.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.420
He never used the term science
fiction, didn't like it,

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.820
but he read everything he
could in science journalism,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.620
as we would now say.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.570
And so he took note cards
and many of his books

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.830
feel sort of spliced
together from these notes

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.690
that he took from this
voracious reading.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.270
But in the moon novels
it's not only what he read,

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.680
but he also talked a
lot with his cousin who

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.120
was a physics teacher in
one of [INAUDIBLE] in Paris.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.080
So some of the chapters
of the moon novel

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.220
were just kind of like
your physics textbook cause

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.180
he's telling you what
the trajectories are,

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.670
and how this works,
and how that works.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.340
William Morris is not
so familiar a name

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.530
in the United States.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.830
He's very familiar
in Britain mainly

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:39.610
as a writer, a poet, and a
folklorist, but he is also,

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:44.270
we would now say, an
entrepreneur, an innovator,

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.200
and a maker, because
his great thrill

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.460
was to manufacture household
goods for a large market.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.510
He's a lay engineer,
running factories

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.750
to make household products
that are versatile, durable,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.080
and beautiful.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.190
To this day this is
my study at home.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:10.460
This is a Morris chair with
a very nifty adjustable,

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.510
reclining back.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:16.190
You see you just move the
pole, and you can lean back.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:22.260
So Morris is, as I say, an
entrepreneur par excellence.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.100
And finally, Robert
Louis Stevenson.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.300
Now this is a portrait
of him in middle age.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.220
He's living in Britain now
in the south of England.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:37.070
And this is his wife, that
American wife he chased after,

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.620
finally got her to divorce
her husband, marry him.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.230
It was quite a story.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.110
She's on the sofa with this kind
of Indian shawl [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.210
He is pacing talking.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.450
He is an intense person.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:56.670
Now you know again that he
wrote "Treasure Island."

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.700
This is the map that started the
book, another uncharted island.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.710
You also know that he wrote
"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.910
I love this cover,
the transformation,

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.105
great god, can it be.

00:15:11.105 --> 00:15:13.520
But in the background
is this lighthouse.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.200
And that's a reminder
Robert Louis Stevenson

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.440
is of the family of the
lighthouse Stevensons,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.380
as they've been called.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.290
This is a family
of Civil Engineers

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.990
who've built most if not
all of the lighthouses

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:30.300
that to this day stand around
the northern tier of Great

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.640
Britain.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.600
His great grandfather, no
his grandfather, sorry, also

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.640
Robert, designed and built
the Bell Rock Lighthouse,

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.080
which is off to the east
of Edinburgh to this day.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.430
Stevenson got a degree from
Edinburgh in engineering.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.620
He wrote a thesis with honors.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.270
The family expected
to be an engineer.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.550
He wanted to be a
writer, but he always

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:58.170
kept his respect for engineers,
and to be very interestingly,

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.260
talks about writing
as design problems,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.890
as engineering design problems.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.800
Anyway, so he is a
professional engineer.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.180
The other two are just lovers
of science and technology.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:15.110
I want to just stress, these
guys love this new world,

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:20.410
but they are also deeply
disturbed by it, troubled

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:21.360
by it.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.444
And this is a paradox
that I'm going

00:16:23.444 --> 00:16:26.520
to be talking a little about.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.630
They are uncompromising
in saying

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.490
it may be an interesting
world but it's not for me.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:38.480
Verne's mouth piece
is Captain Nemo.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.560
We know this from letters that
Verne was writing to his editor

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.480
when he was writing that book.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.660
"I am not what you
call a civilized man."

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.580
This is Nemo, who was
a terrorist by the way,

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.810
seeking ships
without provocation.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.020
He wasn't civilized.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.960
Verne is saying
this about himself.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.720
Morris is so disaffected that
he is a revolutionary socialist

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:06.020
who spent a lot of time
advocating for revolution

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.050
in Britain at a time
when Marx had died

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.079
but Engels is still there.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:16.130
And this is an astounding
statement of disaffection.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.619
"Apart from the desire to
produce beautiful things,

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:22.470
the leading passion
in my life has been

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.650
and is hatred of
modern civilization."

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.510
And he means it.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.630
He really means it.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.700
And Stevenson is
a little gentler,

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.660
but still he goes into
exile essentially.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.420
He takes a trip
to the south seas

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.050
that ends up that
he settles there.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.020
First he's going to
spend his winters there,

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.500
and then he decides to
move there permanently,

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.880
and essentially
throws in his lot

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.920
with the native Polynesians,
especially the Samoans.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.130
And here he is writing
to his best friend back

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.920
home, Henry James,
trying to explain

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.710
why he's decided to
spend his life in Samoa.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.800
"I was never fond of
towns, houses, society,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.130
or -it seems- civilization."

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.530
They're all using this word.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.990
What is the problem
with these guys?

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.970
They are well-to-do, bourgeois,
white, male Westerners.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.890
The world is organized
around their benefit.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.900
And yet that is the
feeling that they have.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.466
What is their problem?

00:18:26.466 --> 00:18:28.690
One way to answer it is
to go back to the maps.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.870
This is the same atlas
that I showed you before.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.340
OK, same atlas that
had 50 maps in all.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.090
This is Africa in 1878.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.280
So for Verne one way to
answer the question what

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.990
is his problem is that he
sees that he's running out

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.800
of room in the world
to write about.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.940
You notice he wants to
map the globe in words,

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.055
but just as he and others map
the globe you lose the unknown.

00:18:58.055 --> 00:18:59.420
It becomes all known.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.820
There's no more mystery.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.620
I love this map
because, look, you

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.520
can see places that have
been mapped and claimed.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.200
Different colors are
different countries.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.130
This is the scramble for
Africa that's going on.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:16.440
But then there are these empty
areas that haven't been mapped.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.150
Verne's first novel is
"Five Weeks in a Balloon,"

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.730
and it's the story of a journey
across this part of Africa,

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.770
trying to put together
some of the earlier maps

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.690
to make a coherent picture.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.420
The balloon is exciting, but
once you keep mapping Africa

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.450
you're sort of
losing the adventure

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.450
of having the unknown.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.150
Verne's second
novel is the story

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.950
of Captain Hatteras who
was an Arctic explorer.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.320
And this captain
is going up here

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.510
trying to understand the
geography of the Arctic.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:52.100
And again from the map and
the atlas, you can see,

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.240
it almost got it.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.970
There are the names of
the expeditions here

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:01.140
that are listed, that
Verne listed in his novel.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.939
So it's exciting
to think that we're

00:20:02.939 --> 00:20:04.230
going to have the answers soon.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.080
But once you have
the answer-- Verne

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.074
has a sense of running
out of free space.

00:20:10.074 --> 00:20:10.990
And he's an anarchist.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:14.970
He doesn't want to have to
live under somebody's command.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.620
And there's not a lot
of that space left.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:22.070
This map, same atlas,
of outer London,

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.802
OK, this is outer London.

00:20:23.802 --> 00:20:25.760
This is inner London that
you're familiar with,

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.540
the houses of parliament
and so forth, Big Ben.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.780
But this is what's growing
in Morris' lifetime,

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.430
and this is what bothers
him most about this world,

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.370
the expansion of urban
settlements, which he considers

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.750
crowded, ugly, constraining.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.630
He was born and raised
near Epping Forest

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.890
just outside this area.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.500
Actually he was raised in
the area where the London

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.350
Olympics took place a
couple years ago, which

00:20:55.350 --> 00:21:01.360
was sort of a wasteland even
then that Morris felt still

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.450
had the beauty of the
marshland, and the rivers,

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.470
and the streams, and the
little baby Thames there,

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.150
forests, the old medieval
fortress in Epping.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.050
He loved this.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.830
He saw this disappearing
as the city just overflew,

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.290
like overflowed its banks.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:21.540
Maybe another analogy would
be like a volcano, just kind

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.150
of throwing lava
all in this area.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.590
So that's what bothered Morris.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:32.120
And as for Stevenson, his
move to the south seas

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:39.240
was intended to be helping him
find better physical health,

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.750
to get some interesting
writing out of it.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.590
It turned out to be a
lesson, he very quickly

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.420
learned, in extinction.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:52.710
He saw the Polynesians literally
being extinguished as a race

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.990
by an enormously
high death rate,

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.030
especially on some islands.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:01.190
It varied a lot, and
he was interested why.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:06.030
But within a few days of his
landing in the Marquesas,

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:10.750
that was his first stop,
this island world he saw

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.380
was a dying world because
of the Western invasion.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:20.940
And he felt that, he said they
are being destroyed inevitably

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.950
by our shabby civilization.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.530
Shabby.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:30.130
And this is one of his
early journal entries

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.420
about his landing.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.370
This is like two days after
he landed in the Marquesas,

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.930
and he's realizing
these are dying people.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.860
And what's so interesting
is he says it's not just

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.630
they're dying, we're
going to die too.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.860
We're in this together.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.380
Their case will be as ours,
"death coming in like a tide."

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:56.040
So all three of these writers
have real fundamental, not just

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.480
quarrels, but arguments
with civilization

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.700
as it's being defined
by the expansion

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.970
of human empire in their time.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:12.560
So what I'd like to do
now is describe, briefly,

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.500
how they dealt
with this, and how

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.700
they came to terms living
in this kind of a world.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.150
And the answer is romance.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:27.040
And by that I don't mean
"Fifty Shades of Grey."

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.290
I don't mean erotic romance,
though there's an element.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:36.165
Or I don't even mean
chick lit kind of you

00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:40.510
know adult romance,
softer stuff.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.715
What I mean is a much
broader, deeper understanding

00:23:43.715 --> 00:23:46.780
of what romance has been
in world literature.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:51.150
It's basically the oldest kind
of literature that humans have,

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:54.540
telling stories about heroes
that aren't quite superhuman

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.090
but are more than
normally human.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.780
Stories that are not
entirely fantastic,

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:06.480
but are not constrained
by every day reality.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.250
In the words of Henry
James, Stevenson's friend,

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.310
romance is
experienced liberally,

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.720
experienced liberally.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.160
So not unreal but free.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.050
So the Ur example are the
legends of King Arthur.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:22.950
King Arthur was nice.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.030
Those are romance stories.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:29.880
There are Norse sagas that
so entranced Morris and that

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.450
make the basis of
Wagnerian opera.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.730
Those are other examples.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:38.130
They consider Atlantis
as a romance, shipwreck,

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.200
undiscovered island.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.680
Now romance lost some
prestige with the rise

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.730
of the novel, which is much more
focused on every day realism,

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.700
both social and
material, but romance

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.190
endures even if it
doesn't have the respect

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.140
that the novel typically has.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:01.600
There are graphic novels
that lead to Stephen King.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.150
There is historical novels
that start with Sir Walter

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.100
Scott, lead to
Hillary [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:14.140
There's just creepy stories
like Edgar Allan Poe wrote.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.090
These are all
examples of romance,

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.350
and that's what I'm
talking about when

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:23.040
I talk about these three writers
all wrote romance, and not

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.060
only wrote it, they
found their salvation

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.950
in reading and writing romance.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.809
They all set out to
do this, but they all

00:25:31.809 --> 00:25:33.350
changed the kind of
romance that they

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:37.310
wrote to fit their interests
in what we would now

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.800
call science and technology.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.970
So Verne, here he is.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.300
I showed you the old Verne.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.070
I want to show you the young
Verne, just to remind you.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.230
Yes, he was young once.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.640
This is when he first
arrives in Paris.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.850
He's in his early 20's.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.510
He's going to conquer the world.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.010
He's going to be a
great playwright.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.540
Well, that didn't work
out, but 20 years later

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.720
what he did do was invent
the geographical romance.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.000
That's what he
called his stories.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.420
He said collectively they
are extraordinary voyages,

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.820
extraordinary journeys.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.560
That's what intrigued him.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.680
And that formula was
enormously successful.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.020
He wrote 80 odd of these novels.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.670
Many of them were staged.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.650
Made a lot of money for him.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:25.920
But he has this
attitude of defiance

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.560
that he's going to go where
he wants to go and not

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.440
be constrained by
Western Europe.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.220
He doesn't write
about Western Europe.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:32.900
That's home.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.540
That's boring.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.660
He writes about other
people and other events.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.670
This is an illustration from
"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.930
the original edition, and if
you just read the words of Verne

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.900
you're missing the
illustrations that

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.770
go in these early editions
here are fabulous.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.980
This is Nemo on the deck of
the Nautilus, arms crossed.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.670
He's also defiant, looking
at that British frigate

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.670
that he's going
to sink very soon.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:04.800
And this is terrorism
but it's thrilling.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:10.790
And Nemo, of course, has just
become an icon of modern world,

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:14.540
I suggest because that world
feels pretty constraining,

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.290
and romance gives us
a hero who defies it.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.850
James Mason who was the
Disney version, or just

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:26.210
these endless mash-ups
of Captain Nemo

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:29.500
doing whatever that defies
the rest of civilization.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.150
So Morris also,
I'm going back to

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.780
the young, vulnerable Morris.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.160
This is a self portrait
just to remind you.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.200
He was not always an old man.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:48.605
This is when he married a
gorgeous but difficult woman.

00:27:48.605 --> 00:27:51.410
But all these guys have marriage
stories worth going into,

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.010
but we'll skip that for now.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:57.260
I remind you that Morris
started as a medievalist.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.720
He was starting with
the King Arthur stories.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:05.870
But when he discovered the
Norse language and Norse sagas

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.570
the land of Iceland
became for him

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.960
another land where
real stories could

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.760
be told that could
no longer be told

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.160
in London, in outer London.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.780
So he went to Iceland on a
couple of trips in the early

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.200
1870's.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.140
These are pony
trek trips that he

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.130
took as a sort of
Bourgeois adventure,

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.100
and he began to
think about stories

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.190
that were set in
places like Iceland

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.880
but aren't in any real place.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.910
It was a place that offered
him an imaginative alternative.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.630
And so out of this
Morris invented

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:49.380
a new kind of romance,
which we now call fantasy.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.080
He invented secondary worlds.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.460
That's Tolkein's phrase.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.770
Tolkien, like Morris,
studied Icelandic, taught it.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.830
The two of them
are very similar,

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.340
and Tolkien is really
a disciple of Morris'.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.320
So if you haven't heard
of Morris you should.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.720
This is his first fantasy novel,
"The Story the Glittering Plain

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.610
or the Land of the Living Men."

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:18.310
The one that's best
known and longest,

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:22.020
"The Well at the World's End."

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:27.080
This chapter reminds us there
is always eroticism there.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.380
"The Chamber of Love
in the Wilderness."

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.890
That's the story of that.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.660
That's the title of
that illustration there.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.130
These books he produced
with a press that he started

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.010
called Kelmscott
Press, because he

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:43.010
felt that ordinary printing
was unworthy of these stories.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.900
He wanted a sort of
magical feel to them.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.880
So Morris is just
extraordinary for just

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.670
leaving the world
behind and inventing

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.420
a whole new kind of
romance famously.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.860
Robert Louis Stevenson-- This
is the defiant Stevenson.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:03.760
When he was entering
university to study engineering

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.070
he has a velvet jacket
on and long hair,

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.550
and he's no engineer.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:11.770
Or he's going to at least
show that to others.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:16.080
But Stevenson really
expanded and reconfigured

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.290
his own understanding of
romance through 20 years

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:24.910
of difficulties, some of them
health, some of them related

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:27.000
to his exile.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
As I say you know him
from "Treasure Island,"

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.030
and from stories like "Jeckel
and Hyde," or "Kidnapped."

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.360
But when he got
to the south seas

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.070
he started writing
much grittier romances.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.990
I mean maybe this
is an image of what

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.240
you would think
the south seas is.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.190
This is Stevenson on the right
fanning his wife who is just

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.830
below the palm tree,
two Polynesians.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.210
They look like hippies
on the lawn here,

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:57.540
but this is an interlude
in a much tougher world,

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:02.180
particularly when
Stevenson got to Samoa.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.820
It was in the midst
of colonial wars

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.640
involving Germany,
Britain, and America.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.870
So one of the first
things he wrote in Samoa

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.070
is what we would now
call new journalism.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:16.650
And he wrote about these
words in a little pamphlet

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.760
titled "A Footnote to History."

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.970
And he meant that ironically.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.530
In other words it now looks
like a footnote to history,

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.170
but these dirty little wars
are going to be history.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.970
That's the message.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:34.170
And that's why this book
is well worth reading.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:39.900
But he also, in lots of
conversations with Polynesians,

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:44.230
picked up some of their tails
and retold them in English

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:47.400
for both the Polynesian
and a Western audience.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.780
This is Stevenson
on the front deck

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.770
of the house he lived in
in Samoa, his wife Fanny.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.160
Her daughter is down here.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.020
Son here, son in-law.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.580
And Stevenson's mother,
who is there from Scotland.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.080
She came all the way from
Edinburgh to live with her son

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.550
after her husband's death.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:12.100
So there she is in
her widow's cap.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.490
I mean I just think this image
is just really something,

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:22.680
but as a writer Stevenson
found all sorts of new material

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.080
and ways of looking
at the world in Samoa.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.820
And he wrote, as I
say, some from legends,

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.980
but he also wrote some
very tough, gritty stories

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:38.800
of criminality, greed,
and sexual exploitation

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.390
in the south seas.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:42.730
The best of them
is "The Ebb-Tide."

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.450
It's a book about the length
of "Heart of Darkness."

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:46.520
It's better.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.480
You should read it, and
this is the first sentence.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.740
"Throughout the island
world of the Pacific,

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.570
scattered men of
many European races

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.580
and from almost every
grade of society

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:03.630
carry activity and
disseminate disease."

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.130
Now if I were in a
lit class I would

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:09.650
go over every word, every
word, because it's meaningful.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:13.760
Here's another sentence like
Bacon's that just says so much,

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.550
and that's just
the first sentence.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.730
Read that story.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.190
Those writings of
Stevenson in his day

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.240
were either ignored
or ridiculed.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.740
Nobody took them seriously.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.820
People wanted more
"Treasure Island" kind of.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.500
And Stevenson, no, that's not
what he was interested in.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:36.060
He said, I have a romance of
destiny, romance of destiny,

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.200
it has led me here, and
this is what I'm writing.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.111
So I just want to
wrap up by kind

00:33:42.111 --> 00:33:44.900
of following up on that
statement of Stevenson's,

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.910
and talking about the way
these three writers help

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:55.540
us think about human
empire both as progress

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.666
and the end of the world.

00:33:57.666 --> 00:34:02.490
It's both, at least
that's their conclusion.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:06.520
For one thing they all
remind us that what

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.489
we're going through today
in the sense of a highly

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:14.840
constrained and human
dominated world, it's new

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.659
but it's not completely new.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:18.734
They felt they were
living in such a world,

00:34:18.734 --> 00:34:21.150
and they were trying to figure
out how to live best in it.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.739
And I don't want to turn
them into self help writers.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:25.340
They are not.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.620
But there are some
examples that they

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.960
set that I think are
worth pointing out.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.070
The first one is that
they are realistic.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.040
They understand,
want to understand

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:42.010
how the world is and not
invade the facts of life.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:45.350
In fact, CS Lewis, another
famous writer, very fond

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.310
of Morris, wrote about Morris.

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:51.020
He said Morris has
faced the facts.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:57.430
So facing the facts
is-- These are realists.

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:59.890
They also love romance.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:01.660
And the argument
I'm trying to make

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.030
is in some ways romance helps us
face facts more than just kind

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.080
of brutal enumeration
of material conditions,

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:14.040
because it takes into account
humans needing stories

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.190
and symbols to
understand the world.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:20.080
Second thing is they all
have a lot of courage.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.270
This is the defiance.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:23.140
They're going to do
what they want to do,

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.960
and it doesn't
matter if they lose.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.020
It doesn't matter if their
book sales don't go up.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:31.730
It doesn't matter if people
don't appreciate them.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.620
If there's something
they want to do,

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:39.830
and they just say this is my
adventure, I'm going to do it,

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:43.060
and I don't have to
win to be successful.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.080
And third, and this is
very interesting in a world

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:52.490
where so many people want
to save the world, right?

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:53.930
Yeah, they want
to save the world,

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:59.000
they want the revolution, they
are out there actively trying

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.660
to make it a better
place, but they also

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:06.130
believe they have a duty
and a right to happiness,

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:09.750
and that it's a beautiful world,
and part of the human duty

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:14.390
is to enjoy it, and
to think about this

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:18.470
and actively seek ways
of enjoying the world.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.960
So they realize the
live in human empire,

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:26.290
but they are trying to
liberate their experience,

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:29.680
and to create a
human world that's

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.910
livable and beautiful
within human empire.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:33.450
Thank you.

00:36:40.287 --> 00:36:40.786
Questions?

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.830
AUDIENCE: What I think
empire in the usual sense of

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:53.890
say a society within
humanity having

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:57.280
territory and power there
are two aspects, one of them

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.450
is spread, scope, and
the other one is control.

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.200
When we think of
human empire I see

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.005
that as how much of the
population of creatures,

00:37:06.005 --> 00:37:09.390
whether it be humans or
whatever, spreads and takes

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:11.460
over the food supply,
takes over the water

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.660
supply, and so on,
possibly slamming

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.040
into the wall with
population growth,

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:23.750
versus understanding and
ability to make the setting

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:24.690
work for it?

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:27.420
So we have both of
those with humanity.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:32.590
We're clearly in disagreement
with some people about

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:36.520
whether we're crashing head
long into a wall or not,

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:41.520
but I see these as
both important factors

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.920
but very different factors in
the growth of human empire.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:50.380
And those who believe we've
only extend the empire to space

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:53.170
soon enough to avoid greater
overcrowding problems,

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:56.780
[INAUDIBLE] much greater
problems on Earth,

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:01.120
have fantasies or romances
in that direction.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.635
It seems to me there's
still a large space

00:38:03.635 --> 00:38:09.650
that you didn't cover in this
talk, I guess the initial talk.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:12.780
Do your writings cover
those dimensions as well?

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.320
ROSALIND: So tell--
There's a lot

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.140
to respond-- No this
is a great comment.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.450
But tell me what space
you're asking about.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.985
AUDIENCE: Oh, at
least once when I

00:38:22.985 --> 00:38:24.740
used the word space
I meant expanding

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:28.820
to space stations, or
the moon, or some such,

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:34.313
but also the topic
area of human empire.

00:38:34.313 --> 00:38:36.813
It seems to me there are those
two very different dimensions

00:38:36.813 --> 00:38:37.799
of it.

00:38:37.799 --> 00:38:44.320
ROSALIND: Yeah, at least two
and maybe more, but certainly

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.720
in human empire and also
just in more normal empires,

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.490
the sense of the British
empire, whatever, there's

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:56.370
control of territory,
but then there's

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.540
control of what goes on
within the territory.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.930
That's very different.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.880
And some empires
are famously loose.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.680
It's like whatever
can go on, and there's

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.460
a lot of local autonomy,
and others are much more

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.680
controlling.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:16.950
So there's that distinction,
and it's not clear.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.160
I don't think it's clear yet
sort of how human empire fits

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.760
into that spectrum.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:29.810
I think what is obvious is
that domination is not control.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:36.870
I would say that humans dominate
what happens on the planet.

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:42.370
You name a topic, the human
influence is paramount.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:45.880
It doesn't mean we
control what goes on.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.010
So that's the problem in
fact, or one of the problems

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.860
is the domination
without the control.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.900
In terms of going
to outer space,

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:59.890
and that is just I
think a way of saying,

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:04.460
yeah there's a lot more to
the cosmos than the Earth,

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.275
but realistically speaking the
numbers of people on the Earth,

00:40:08.275 --> 00:40:12.760
the expense of-- I
mean imaginatively it's

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.800
very important.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:19.738
Realistically, pragmatically I
have not booked my ticket yet.

00:40:23.389 --> 00:40:25.180
AUDIENCE: So I was just
interested actually

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.875
in your choice to focus
on British writers.

00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:31.170
I think the time period they're
kind of writing in, living in,

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:33.030
I see a lot of the
same things happening

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.920
in like the expansion of
the West, transcontinental

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.990
railroad, obviously
Africa kind of came up,

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:41.600
and their view I
think could probably

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.880
be expanded to look at
a few other regions that

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.838
were going through very
similar transformations

00:40:45.838 --> 00:40:48.180
if not more dramatic
at that time period.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:52.640
I wasn't sure if it was just for
the sake of [INAUDIBLE] if you

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.641
started to see this happening
in writers that were writing out

00:40:55.641 --> 00:40:58.170
the West or explorers that
were in Africa at some

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.070
of the same time?

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.350
ROSALIND: Well,
I work with a lot

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.690
of people who only
write about the United

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:06.020
States or the Americans.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.341
So part of it was a little
rebelliousness on my part.

00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:11.090
It's like you know,
there are other people

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:14.760
who are-- You could write
an American version of this,

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.010
but to some extent
Leo Marx already

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.240
has in "The Machine
in the Garden."

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.040
So I would point
you there to look

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.180
at this theme with
American writers.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.320
I think you could take any
part of the world in this time

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.670
period, any literary tradition.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.780
Gabriel Garcia Marquez
has written about it

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.250
in the "Hundred
Years of Solitude."

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:40.840
This is his theme.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.630
I could go through sort of--

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.286
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
guess I was just

00:41:43.286 --> 00:41:45.702
wondering if you see it as a
war of like the consciousness

00:41:45.702 --> 00:41:47.879
of the time or [INAUDIBLE]
a product of there.

00:41:47.879 --> 00:41:50.170
Because it is such a global
phenomenon during this time

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.220
period, which is sometimes
uncanny in literature,

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.020
where you have so many different
writers who never have met

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.030
or read each others' works
writing in such similar themes.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.270
ROSALIND: Exactly.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.690
Yes, I would say that.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:05.740
And taking these
three guys is in part

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.590
because I wanted to
focus on this paradox

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:12.310
that they are the winners, or
that they are the people you

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:15.170
would expect to
be most satisfied.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:19.020
I mean you can see why
somebody writing from Polynesia

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.040
is not going to be real
happy about what's going on,

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.450
but you would think--
So it's the kind

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:29.370
of counter intuitive nature
of their dissatisfaction

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:33.470
that interested me, and just
the fact it's a big world,

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:35.610
many too many people
to write about.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.940
But I really regard the
book as opening a door,

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.940
and I would love other people
to start thinking about this

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.020
and thinking of other ways of
thinking about human empire,

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.260
thinking about writing.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.270
There's a whole age of the
anthropocene discussion going

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:54.600
on that I think this
really relates to.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:59.040
I think that's just
another terminology

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.320
for similar analysis.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.060
So I don't at all mean for
this to be, OK, read the book

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.365
and that's the end of it.

00:43:06.365 --> 00:43:08.110
It's door opening
books that I like,

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:10.187
and I would like this
to be one of them.

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:26.570
Is there some general things
you could say about the way

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.350
that the three of
them articulated

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.197
what was being lost?

00:43:30.197 --> 00:43:32.193
Was there any kind
of generality?

00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:34.688
I mean, you talked about
their dissatisfaction.

00:43:34.688 --> 00:43:39.179
Was there some other
themes that they

00:43:39.179 --> 00:43:40.925
shared about what
was actually being

00:43:40.925 --> 00:43:42.173
lost in that transformation?

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.220
ROSALIND: Most
generally that when

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:57.682
you live in a human
condition of human domination

00:43:57.682 --> 00:44:01.110
you lose so much.

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:10.100
It's the sense of loss of ways
of life, ways of thinking,

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:15.620
experiences that humans
need to make us human.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.550
And once you displace
the non-human

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:22.360
you become less human.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.390
And each of them could
name somewhat different

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:27.240
what those experiences are.

00:44:29.835 --> 00:44:31.990
It's like humanity
works fine if you

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:34.030
have other things in the
world, but the moment

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:39.660
that you essentially have
a monoculture then it's

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.180
harder to be human
because there's

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:49.325
nothing else, no other scale of
reference or mode of reference.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.340
All right.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.130
That's a really great question.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.950
AUDIENCE: I was curious
about the use of the word

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:11.662
civilization.

00:45:11.662 --> 00:45:14.490
It seems to me that would have
meant something substantially

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.466
different than now.

00:45:16.466 --> 00:45:19.420
When What trying
to think of what

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.220
they might have meant by
it, civilizing influence

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:26.570
is basically the
collective pressure

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:30.990
on people to behave
less like their nature

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.450
in order to get along.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.235
And it seems to me,
the more crowded

00:45:35.235 --> 00:45:39.078
we get the more
organizations dominate rather

00:45:39.078 --> 00:45:41.922
than individuals or
families dominate

00:45:41.922 --> 00:45:45.010
behavior in a town square.

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:47.860
If it's a village it's a
few families getting along.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:53.902
If it's a big city there are
enormous city rule impositions

00:45:53.902 --> 00:45:56.330
controlling how things
go in that little place

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:58.920
where a few people live around
because of all the other people

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.230
who live within a mile or two.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:05.740
Do you see it as that
kind of, you could call it

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:08.180
governmental pressure on
people's behavior, that's

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:09.860
part of the problem?

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.710
ROSALIND: I would
just say organized,

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:14.480
because the organizations
can be non-governmental.

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.610
They can be commercial
or whatever.

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:21.930
Again, I think you really put
your finger on a major theme

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:22.820
here.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.370
The word civilization,
thanks to Google,

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:28.680
now we can go back and find
it everywhere in the past,

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:33.070
and scholars are greatly aided
by having search engines that

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:36.720
allow us to pull out that
word, and see where it is,

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.270
and see patterns, and so forth.

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.940
There's also, I will say, the
Oxford English Dictionary,

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.120
which gives contextual usages.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.160
So we can study that word.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.110
But you're right
that it, for them,

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:54.080
is pointing to what is generally
a plus thing, because there's

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.050
non-civilized or uncivilized.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:56.850
That's bad.

00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:01.220
I mean that's a word that's used
a lot in this era and even now,

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.230
I mean uncivilized.

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:03.970
So civilization is good.

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:07.470
So for them to be saying
I am having trouble

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:10.970
with it is somewhat rebellious.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:20.700
I would say that beginning in
the early 1900's there is just

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:31.370
a fundamental disconnect
in Western civilization

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:37.250
between a real emphasis on the
individual as having rights,

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:42.070
and liberties, and a future, and
a story that's worth telling.

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.520
This you find in romanticism,
you find in democracy,

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.270
you find in the invention of
the word individualism by de

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:52.130
Tocqueville in the 1830's.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:55.420
The whole romantic movement
in that large sense

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.840
says you matter,
you matter a lot,

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.930
and you should follow your
bliss, and write your poetry.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:05.840
And these romance writers
believed that and follow it.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:10.090
But it's the same era when the
increasing powers of humanity

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.040
are creating more and
more systems, right,

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.580
that constrain
individuals, and that,

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:19.860
yes, bring progress of certain
types that are undeniable.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.550
But these two things
are happening together.

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:25.000
And I think we still
live in a world

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.710
where that tension is
very real, and each of us

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:32.390
struggles with it.

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:36.610
The sociologist Manuel Castells
has brought this idea up

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:40.120
to date by saying there are two
things going on in the world.

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.880
This is in his trilogy
on the information age.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.430
One thing is the development of
networks which are, especially

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:48.995
financial, but
also technological

00:48:48.995 --> 00:48:52.750
of all sorts, networks
that connect us.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:57.940
And there's also a quest for
identity, for self, who am I,

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:02.740
and where do I fit, who do I
belong to, what matters to me.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.590
So Castells says
network and self.

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:09.910
I would say romanticism, or
romance, and civilization.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:14.390
These are two variations on the
theme of a fundamental tension,

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:19.500
and tensions make the world
interesting but not easy.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.874
AUDIENCE: I think there
may be another aspect

00:49:31.874 --> 00:49:35.490
to the reaction, their
reaction, to civilization.

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:37.840
I'm thinking particularly
[INAUDIBLE] but may well

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.080
[INAUDIBLE], and
that is that this

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:44.140
was during the real growth
of the industrial revolution,

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.884
and civilization as it expanded
involved a lot of pollution,

00:49:47.884 --> 00:49:50.050
a lot of noise, and certainly
from Morris' viewpoint

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.562
it was just plain
ugly and disgusting.

00:49:53.562 --> 00:49:58.360
And also in terms of romance
and romanticism looking back

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:02.625
this is not too long after
large numbers, maybe a majority

00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:04.940
of the English farmers
were forcefully expelled

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.834
from their lands
to force them to be

00:50:06.834 --> 00:50:08.408
wage slaves in the factories.

00:50:08.408 --> 00:50:12.660
And so again he was looking
back to that and those aspects.

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:16.060
ROSALIND: You know more British
history than the average bear.

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:21.310
This is all very pertinent
to Morris particularly.

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.110
Similar things were
going on in France,

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:27.335
but Morris does something like
he takes a paddle on the rive,

00:50:27.335 --> 00:50:30.980
and he's fishing, and he
notices that some agency, it's

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:38.640
like the equivalent of the
MDC, has trimmed the bushes

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.150
to make them less obtrusive.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:43.830
But it's so ugly he says.

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:46.460
He writes letters
to the newspaper.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.210
Just how can it be
so ugly, and then

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:52.180
the ducks can't swim among the
branches that you've trimmed.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.420
It's not even just pollution.

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.130
It's the management.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:56.560
Because he looks at the bush.

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.550
He doesn't see a bush.

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:00.800
He sees an agency, I mean
in the literal sense.

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:05.720
So that's really-- It doesn't
have to be destruction.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.030
It can just be the
sense-- Well, again,

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.390
one of my favorite quotes
is from "Buckaroo Banzai."

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:14.650
Right? "No matter where
you go, there you are."

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:18.030
And that's one way of describing
what makes him so angry.

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:21.412
It's I can never get
away from people.

00:51:21.412 --> 00:51:22.715
I'm always seeing evidence.

00:51:26.234 --> 00:51:26.733
You know.

00:51:29.904 --> 00:51:33.092
Any other questions?

00:51:33.092 --> 00:51:35.860
Well, you know systems
can be very good at times

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.210
and they bring you lunch.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:41.650
So I think maybe we'll
enjoy that together.

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:44.380
Thank you again for taking
the time and attention.

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.490
I really, really appreciate it.

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:48.040
Thanks.
