00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:08.340
So the actual allele is minus 1639T. Or rs9923231.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.130
And this has the net effect of reducing VKORC1 transcription. Resulting in less

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.520
protein. The saturation of Warfarin happens sooner, increasing Warfarin's

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.350
overall efficacy. This means that if you have the C allele of VKORC1 that

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.840
has more transcription, then we need a higher

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.030
dose of Warfarin because we have more VKORC1. If

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.180
we want to see an affect on blood clotting we're

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.510
going to have to up our dose. But, if you

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.150
have the T allele, you have less VKORC1

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.330
overall, so you need less Warfarin to actually inhibit

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.560
or saturate the VKORC1 protein. Plus, to make sure

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.380
we don't block too much blood clotting we might

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.270
want to give a lower dose. Achieving the right dose is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.730
important. You want enough Warfarin to be effective, to stop blood

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.480
clotting in your vessels, but not so much that there

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.650
are negative side effects where you just bleed or hemorrage internally.
