00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.490
Mitt Romney is wearing crazy underwear.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.589
&nbsp;He’s wearing magic underwear.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.110
&nbsp;He is.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.240
&nbsp;I mean, under his pants, he is wearing magic
underwear.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.190
&nbsp;Magic underwear.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.689
&nbsp;And he believes that a convicted con man
got golden tablets that no one else could

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.670
see, and sat with an angel to find out that
the original Jews of the Bible were living

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.539
in North America.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.420
&nbsp;Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.780
&nbsp;But… just more modern, not more crazy,
than other religions.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.120
&nbsp;Not more crazy than Islam, you know, with
your… not more crazy than virgin births

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.420
and resurrections.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.500
&nbsp;Not more crazy than any of that stuff.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.500
&nbsp;What’s really fascinating to me, fascinating,
is that… and I cover this in my book when

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.650
I say signs you may already be an atheist,
it fascinates me that you can have the Bible

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.410
Belt and you can have a court trial, and we’ve
seen this.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.740
&nbsp;I’m going to use it hypothetically, but
you’ll know the specifics I’m talking

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.970
about, I just don’t want to talk about that
kind of pain too directly, it’s too unpleasant

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.970
for me.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.860
&nbsp;But hypothetically, in the Bible Belt, where
you can have a born-again Christian Judge,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.370
born-again Christian Judge.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:30.990
&nbsp;I believe the Bible is the literal word
of God, there were talking snakes, there were

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.670
talking snakes and virgin births.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.060
&nbsp;Burning bushes and Abraham being willing
to kill his son for God.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.780
&nbsp;He believes that.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.060
&nbsp;
 The jury is made up of 12 people who, let’s

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.640
say 10 of them believe that.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.990
&nbsp;And two of them believe that, but a little
less.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.840
&nbsp;You’re Prosecuting Attorney believes that.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.960
&nbsp;The people that are sitting in the courtroom
believe that.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.549
&nbsp;These are all people that know each other
in church.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:12.390
&nbsp;And the person on the witness stand says
that she killed her three children in cold

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.860
blood because God told her to.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.600
&nbsp;And every single person in the courtroom
decides whether she is guilty or not guilty

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.110
by reason of insanity.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.680
&nbsp;Those are the two choices they weigh.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.410
&nbsp;And nobody, not the Defense Attorney, not
the Judge, not the jury people, not the people

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:45.150
in the gallery, not one person stands up and
goes, maybe God told her to.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.770
&nbsp;It’s less weird than the talking snake.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.220
&nbsp;Maybe God told her to.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.590
&nbsp;  And in this country, which they say
over and over again is founded on Christian

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.260
values, and I’ll give them that; founded
on Christian values.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.830
&nbsp;Okay, it is, fine.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.690
&nbsp;This country, founded on Christian values
has guilty, not guilty, not guilty by reason

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.209
of insanity, end of list.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.500
&nbsp;There is nothing that says, not guilty because
God told me to.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.840
&nbsp;And why?

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.530
&nbsp;Why isn’t that there?

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.379
&nbsp;Why isn’t this country allowing in the
court system someone to go on the witness

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:38.329
stand and go, “Snake walked up to me, snaked
opened his mouth, snake said, ‘go into McDonald’s,

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.220
pull out an AK15, kill 10 people, walk back
out,’ snake told me that.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.250
&nbsp;It’s that snake there, he’s not talking
anymore.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.540
&nbsp;I throw myself on the mercy of the court.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.970
&nbsp;Aren’t you all good Christians?

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.130
&nbsp;Don’t you believe in the miracles of the
Bible?

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.019
&nbsp;You’re seeing one now.”

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:03.480
&nbsp;  And that’s the part that amazes
me is that kind of stuff.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.019
&nbsp;So Mitt Romney comes along and at some level
doesn’t he know what he believes is crazy?

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:17.720
&nbsp;At some level, isn’t he going, “There
weren’t Jews in North America.”

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.710
&nbsp;You know, that’s not where the Garden
of Eden was.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.970
&nbsp;Doesn’t that go through his mind?

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.760
&nbsp;And that’s the part of that whole thing
that kills me.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.840
&nbsp;If Mitt Romney really believes what he says
he believes, he is bug-nutty, bat shit crazy.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.560
&nbsp;And he’s not, bug-nutty, bat shit crazy.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.841
&nbsp;He’s the same as Obama.

00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:52.560
&nbsp;If Obama believes what he was being taught
in that church in Chicago, okay, he is bat

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.560
shit crazy.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.949
&nbsp;And Obama is demonstratively not bat shit
crazy.

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:05.780
&nbsp;  So we have this weird deal we make
with all the politicians where we say, you

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:15.050
can say you believe bug nutty, bat shit crazy
shit, and we’ll shrug it off because you’re

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.070
clearly not bug nutty, bat shit crazy.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.340
&nbsp;And all I want out of our politicians is
for them to just say, “You know, a lot of

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.110
the religious stuff I’m talking about is
bug nutty, bat shit crazy, but I’m not.”

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.740
&nbsp;Because I don’t think any of these men
and women are crazy.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.270
&nbsp;And I’ll even give you Michelle Bachman,
I’ll even give you Rick Perry, I’ll even

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.270
give you Sarah Palin.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:46.030
&nbsp;I don’t have that cynical MSNBC point
of view that they are bug nutty, bat shit

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.030
crazy.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.940
&nbsp;I think they are good people who somehow
think that they’re morality and their love

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.150
for humanity and their love for their families
are tied up in this weird tradition.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.789
&nbsp;And when they think that the Bible is the
word of God, I think they mean something else.

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:09.669
&nbsp;I sometimes think that many other people
are speaking in a code that I’ve not been

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.389
given the key to.

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.979
&nbsp;  When someone says to me, I believe
in the Bible literally.

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.020
&nbsp;Well, I personally, Penn Jillette, read
about a chapter in the Bible a day.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.240
&nbsp;I just read through it, over and over again.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.919
&nbsp;So when someone says, they believe in the
word of God literally, I go back and think

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.729
about Genesis, where people were living to
be 900 years old.

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:33.729
&nbsp;And I say bullshit!

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.419
&nbsp;And then I think about Noah and the flood,
killing everybody?

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.020
&nbsp;God that loves us kills everybody?

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.660
&nbsp;And he wants to get two of every species
and seven of the ones that are clean onto

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.090
a boat that floats for that amount of time?

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.130
&nbsp;And I just go, really?

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.160
&nbsp;Because you don’t act that way.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.920
&nbsp;You’re able to go to Home Depot, you’re
able to pay with a credit card, you’re able

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.650
to go to Starbucks, you know how to use a
computer.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:02.650
&nbsp;Really?

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.919
&nbsp;Do you really mean that?

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.259
&nbsp;What do you mean literally?

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:09.319
&nbsp;Do you really mean that you’re going to
stone someone to death who because they work

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:12.050
on the Sabbath, are you really gonna do that?

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.100
&nbsp;Really, honestly?

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.820
&nbsp;You’re gonna take a rock in your hand
and throw at the mother-fucker’s head because

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.569
he worked on a Sunday to support his family?

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:22.330
&nbsp;Are you really gonna do that?

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.870
&nbsp;If you mix cotton and linen in your clothing
are you really going to go to hell?

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.069
&nbsp;What do you mean when you say that?

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:31.580
&nbsp;  And no one’s ever answered me.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.669
&nbsp;There’s a code going on that I need the
Rosetta Stone.

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:42.190
&nbsp;I need someone to sit me down and go, Penn,
when Obama says he went to that church and

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:48.860
they talked about all this stuff being literal,
what he really meant was… fill in the blank!

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.860
&nbsp;Tell me!

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.860
&nbsp;What does he really mean?

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:57.919
&nbsp;These people are good, honest, smart, not
bat shit crazy people, so why the fuck are

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.100
they saying bat shit crazy stuff to me?
