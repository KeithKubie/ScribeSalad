00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How can we simplify this further?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Should we try to remove NAME equal operating system?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Remove the multiple attribute?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Remove size equals 7?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Remove select?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Or remove the angled braces?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Pick those three which have the highest chance of still reproducing the failure. Over to you.
