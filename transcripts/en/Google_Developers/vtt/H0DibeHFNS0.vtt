Hello, and welcome to
the Developer Show.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.880
This is your TL;DR. Today, we're
open-sourcing three new hash

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.970
function
implementations-- faster,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.600
data-parallel versions
of SipHash, a fast,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.820
cryptographically strong
pseudorandom function,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.360
and the entirely
new HighwayHash,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.390
which reaches even higher speeds
thanks to the data parallel

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.000
features of modern computers.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.280
Check out the post for more
info and the GitHub link.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.440
Learn how to build your
own recommendation engine

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.630
using machine learning on Google
Compute Engine with this post

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.690
from the Google
Cloud Platform team.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.970
Want to know why your
application is slow?

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.620
Cloud Trace for Google
Cloud Platform can help.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.070
Today, we're adding more
features and functionality,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.030
including automatic
tracing and performance

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.750
analysis for all App Engine
projects and latency shift

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.600
detection.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.550
As always, the post has more.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.850
Add-ons run inside Google
Sheets, Docs, and Forms.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.410
Check out this post for
five simple design tips

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.764
to help make your add-on
a pleasure to use.

00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:01.430
And don't worry if
you're not an artist.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.090
These are basic concepts
that anyone can apply.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.250
Optimizing retention before
investing in acquisition

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.510
and retaining users with
step-by-step engagement

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.170
are concepts that come
from the world of games.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.460
Learn how you can use
these tips and insights

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.600
from successful game
developers in your app

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.560
with this post from Google Play.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.110
We've redesigned our Developer
Program Policy Center

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.070
to communicate our
policies with greater

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.030
transparency and clarity.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.660
From making it easier to
self-correct minor violations

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.000
in minutes using the
app publishing status

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.870
feature to improving our
policy communication,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.060
the new Policy Center is
part of our ongoing effort

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.860
to improve the
developer experience.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.560
We recently invited Mobile
World Congress attendees

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.140
into the National Art
Museum of Catalonia

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.240
with Tango developer kits loaded
with GuidiGO, a museum tour

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.890
app, and Glympse, a
location-sharing app,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.670
to experience augmented
reality and indoor navigation

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.310
for themselves, and
it was really cool.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.920
Check out the post
for more details

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.220
and a video of the experience.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.470
Whitfield Diffie and
Martin E. Hellman

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.380
have won the 2015 ACM
Turing Award, commonly known

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.050
as the Nobel Prize of computing.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.510
Their 1976 paper entitled "New
Directions in Cryptography"

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.160
introduced public-key
encryption,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.870
which is a
foundational technology

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.180
for the commercial
World Wide Web.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.940
That's your TL;DR for this week.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.430

I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next time.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.480
Hey!

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.896
Remember when I was at the
International Women's Day event

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:44.960
a couple weeks ago?

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.080
It was awesome.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.310

to check out more
events and ways to get

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.418
involved with Women Techmakers.
