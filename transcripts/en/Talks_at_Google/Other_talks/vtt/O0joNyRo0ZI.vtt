00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.930
JAN YANEHIRO:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.550
Welcome to a special chat
with a star in the food world,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.340
Deepa Thomas.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.966
How about an applause here?

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:16.549
Let's hear it.

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.634
Come on, Google people.

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:18.634
DEEPA THOMAS: Thank you.

00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:20.010
JAN YANEHIRO: Deepa Thomas--

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.770
This is her cookbook,
"Deepa's Secrets."

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.960
And today here at the
188 Embarcadero Campus,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.749
you are sampling her cuisine.

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:30.290
So thank you.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.720
Oh.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.220
Right here.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.630
The chefs right here,
thank you for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.800
So I'm Jan Yanehiro.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.530
I'm a longtime broadcaster
in San Francisco,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.360
and I have the honor of
interviewing the star Deepa

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.350
Thomas.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.180
And here's what
we'd like to do--

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.310
I've prepared some
questions, Deepa.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.370
Thank you very much.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.230
We've got the book.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.730
We've got slides going on.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.280
We've got a studio audience.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.000
I will open it up for Q&amp;A
from the studio audience,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.140
and we will adjourn--

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.910
because I know this
is lunch hour--

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.430
we're going to adjourn
by 1:00 o'clock.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.450
So everybody good
with that plan?

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.950
OK.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.459
Here we go.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:05.970
Here we go.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.990
Here we go.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.710
Here we go.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.840
Thank you for making time.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.920
OK.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.130
First question-- love the
book, and I hope all of you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.820
get a copy of the book here
and all Google campuses.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.750
It is a beautiful
book, and I want

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.170
to say that every single
photograph in this book--

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.200
the food was cooked by
Deepa, photographed by Deepa,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.840
and no artificial light.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.380
It's all natural lighting.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.420
So when you see pictures
like this in the book--

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.010
Mike, can you see this close up?

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.950
I mean, it's just
stunning and beautiful.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.630
And she also wraps the
book up with history,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.980
growing up in India, meeting
the most eligible man in India,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.990
and marrying him.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.140
So here we go.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.790
Third printing, congratulations.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.850
DEEPA THOMAS: Thank you.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.660
JAN YANEHIRO: But looking
back, you studied journalism

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.530
and political science at
India, came to the US,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.940
did a textile company--

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.550
congratulations--
and here you are now

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.370
writing a book on
Indian cuisine.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.330
What made the transfer from
textiles to food, Deepa.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.290
JAN YANEHIRO: Well, first
of all Jan Yanehiro, people.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.890
How lucky am I to have the
Hall of Fame broadcaster

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.500
herself talking about my book,
my first little experiment

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.880
in cuisine?

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.040
But to answer your
question, you probably

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.320
guessed it's not just
the book in third print.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.260
I've been in third or
fourth or fifth print

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.060
because I think you have to show
up and meet the opportunities

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.360
as they appear and put one
foot in front of the other

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.190
and think about how you can make
your talents useful to others.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.290
And this came about with
discovering that my husband was

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.480
a type 2 diabetic.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.370
Of course, he looks
like Omar Sharif,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.370
but that didn't mean he
didn't have diabetes.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.160
And we didn't know
how to manage this

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.700
except with insulin shots,
which he was on for 10 years.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.390
And when I finally
retired from my business,

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.010
I thought, well what happens
if I looked at food--

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.860
[? dinner-- ?] food as art.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.030
And definitely we eat with
our eyes first, right?

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.710
You'd agree.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.580
If you see it and it looks
beautiful, you want to try it.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.810
So I thought, is there a way
I could trick my husband--

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.490
like a good wife--

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.740
trick him into eating healthy.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.030
Because if I told this rice
bowl kid growing up in the south

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.590
of India-- rice was the staple--

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.340
oh, you know what?

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.674
I'm just going to take rice out.

00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:49.840
I'm going to take bread out.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.640
I'm going to take all
the white carbs out.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.020
He's have gone shopping
for another wife.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.470
So I had to trick him into it.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.200
And the rule I apply,
for those of you

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.400
who like to cook and understand,
cooking in layers of flavor--

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.940
you can bump up the flavor if
you're taking something out.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.000
So if I took out a
bad ingredient that

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.200
causes sugar spikes and weight
gain, like a refined carb,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.350
I would bump it up with
an Indian gremolata

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.170
or caramelized
shallots at the end.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.530
And I like to think you
can redo and recover

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.780
from any mistake in cooking--

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.460
and I've made my fair share
of them-- except burnt garlic.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.396
Because then you just throw
it out and start again.

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:37.770
JAN YANEHIRO: That
was the start.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.520
DEEPA THOMAS: Yes.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.540
JAN YANEHIRO: And to be honest,
in fact, with your cooking

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.071
you lost 20 pounds yourself.

00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:44.820
DEEPA THOMAS: Yes.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.530
JAN YANEHIRO: Your
husband lost weight,

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.320
and in fact, he is off of
insulin shots with Deepa's

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.580
cooking from this book.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.660
So let that be a
lesson to all of us.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.100
Now, moving on.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.440
It appears to me that Indian
cuisine is having its moment

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.120
here in the US.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.590
It's become very popular.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.980
We're all flocking to all
the Indian restaurants.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.710
Why do you think that
Indian food is now having

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.617
its moment here in the US?

00:05:12.617 --> 00:05:14.200
DEEPA THOMAS: That's
a great question.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.260
In fact, there was a
story in the local papers

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.970
about Indian food on the
rise, and they actually

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.290
asked me to say something.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.380
And I shot my mouth
off, as is my want.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.600
And what I think is happening is
borderless cuisine is probably

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.460
what we need to focus on.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.660
Indian food has been very
much an exotic cuisine

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.540
for a lot of years.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.360
Now it's slowly moving
into mainstream,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.770
like before it, Italian
food did or Chinese food.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.470
I think this is the melting
pot, not just of people

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.520
from different
parts of the world,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.040
but of techniques and flavors.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.340
And when you can
blend the flavors

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.010
without creating
a flavor model--

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.860
I'm not a big proponent
of fusion cuisine

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.600
because you don't know
what the heck it is.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.720
But if you can have,
like music, clear

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.210
notes even if it's borrowed
from other cuisines.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.650
So Indian food is coming into
the mainstream for that reason

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.910
maybe.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.420
It's always been the high
flavor ticket, right?

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.284
But now people are getting
aware of its health benefits.

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:25.200
JAN YANEHIRO: Correct.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.940
And the health benefits-- do you
think it comes from the spices

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.100
or how it's cooked,
the ingredients?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.060
DEEPA THOMAS: Yeah.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:39.270
You know, it's really an irony
that India 3,000 years ago knew

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.860
that food is medicine, that
when your diet is right,

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.180
medicine is of no need.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.420
And when diet is wrong,
medicine is of no use.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.810
This is 3,000 years
ago, Ayurveda, India.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.795
Well then how can India be the
diabetic capital of the world?

00:06:55.795 --> 00:06:56.670
Isn't it interesting?

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.360
JAN YANEHIRO: Yes.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.735
DEEPA THOMAS: So
what happened is

00:06:58.735 --> 00:07:01.470
what we did to ingredients
in the course of time

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.690
from 3,000 years to now.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.830
We treated food in
such a manner that it

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.380
would stay stable on supermarket
shelves and in warehouses.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.900
And in the process, we overly
refined all the ingredients.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.620
So as Michael Pollan
says, eat food

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.240
that your grandmother
would recognize.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.110
She wouldn't recognize
wheat today, for instance.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.770
And India knows,
but they don't know

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.790
how to handle modern,
industrialized ingredients.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.540
But it knows that all disease
starts in the inflammation that

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.190
begins in the gut.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.590
And all disease--
not some disease--

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.010
inclusive of type 2 diabetes,
but not limited to it.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.750
So Indian ingredients from
the seeds to the spices

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.190
were really a focus of the
old Ayurvedic practitioners

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.760
on how to reduce inflammation
while bumping up flavor.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.250
So that's really key.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.140
And what I'm trying to do is
make everything old new again.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.100
It's not that I invented
this way of cooking,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.040
but I'm shining a
light on what is

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.740
incredibly anti-inflammatory
about Indian seeds and spices.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.690
And so even if you're
cooking Italian food,

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.670
throw some Indians
spices in there.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.090
JAN YANEHIRO: It's healthier.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.048
DEEPA THOMAS: Yes, yes.

00:08:23.048 --> 00:08:25.590
JAN YANEHIRO: So you talk a
lot about new Indian cuisine.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.430
DEEPA THOMAS: Yes.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.096
JAN YANEHIRO: Tell
the audience what you

00:08:28.096 --> 00:08:29.940
mean by the new Indian cuisine.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.789
DEEPA THOMAS: Well, I'm
an incurable brand geek.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.559
So I had to differentiate
from Indian cuisine

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.200
at large and new Indian cooking.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.120
So what is the difference?

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.190
Traditional Indian
food we all know

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.350
is flavorful and
exciting and exotic.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.857
JAN YANEHIRO: Spicy and curried.

00:08:48.857 --> 00:08:50.940
DEEPA THOMAS: And exotic,
if you're not from India

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.440
I suppose.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.610
But it's also high in carbs,
very high in refined carbs.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.670
It's incredibly labor intensive.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.000
So you ask what
new Indian cuisine

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.900
is-- it's exactly the opposite.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.890
It's less labor, higher flavor,
healthier, lots of shortcuts--

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.630
I call them secrets--

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.230
and I think that's the
positioning I'd like to take.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.160
It just shines a light on
all that is potentially

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.822
good about Indian cuisine.

00:09:21.822 --> 00:09:24.030
JAN YANEHIRO: And I think
that's why it's so popular.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.745
But in on your book--
here's a cover everybody--

00:09:26.745 --> 00:09:28.830
it says, "Slow Carb."

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.780
You know, we hear about
this, but I'm just

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.570
going to ask for
everybody in the audience

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.700
and across the Google campuses.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.100
Tell us slow carbs--

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.800
what is slow carb?

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.520
What is it?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.790
DEEPA THOMAS: Well, we can
contrast it with low carb.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.350
Low carb cuts carb across the
board, that all carbs are bad

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.790
is the approach in low carb.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.860
I don't believe that to be true.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.670
I think taking the thesis
what we do to a carb

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.870
is what makes it bad.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:02.820
So refining it to one
inch of death is bad.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.920
And the whiter something is--

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.340
I'm sorry white people--

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.340
you got to look at it again.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:15.690
But slow carb is closer
to the grain itself.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.960
So complex grains that
haven't been processed,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.880
that make the body work to
be absorbed, higher fiber.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.650
And so the longer a food
takes to be digested,

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.260
the better it is for you
as a simple principle.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.300
The quicker it is
to be digested--

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:39.210
like sugar itself or white
carbs, potatoes, rice, flour--

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.400
it converts very
quickly to sugar.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.080
And all foods convert to
energy, sugar, energy.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.250
But when it's quickly
converted, it is stored as fat.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.060
So that's the big difference
between slow carb.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.530
You're really focusing on
low glycemic index of foods.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.409
That is how quickly or slowly
food converts to sugar.

00:11:02.409 --> 00:11:04.200
JAN YANEHIRO: So whenever
I talk to a chef,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.600
I always say, well, what's
your background, your mother,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.800
your grandmother, or
some your father cook?

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.650
I see some people
nodding their heads.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.710
But I've read
Deepa's book, and she

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.660
didn't cook as a young girl.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:23.246
And in fact, she learned to cook
when she came here to the US.

00:11:23.246 --> 00:11:25.620
And in fact, she talks about
how she burnt her first meal

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.286
for her husband.

00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:27.300
Burnt it.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.280
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.080
JAN YANEHIRO: They
had to go get pizza.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.360
But let's talk a
little bit about what

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.560
did you learned
growing up in India.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.990
In fact, one of your
grandparents did milk cows.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.740
DEEPA THOMAS: Yes.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.480
JAN YANEHIRO: But
you didn't grow up

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.660
with going into the kitchen and
learning everything and trying

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.160
everything.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:47.989
Tell us about that.

00:11:47.989 --> 00:11:48.780
DEEPA THOMAS: Yeah.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:53.220
So I thought everyone grew
up with kitchen stuff, which

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.050
is another thing
about Indian cooking.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.540
It's so high in labor
because it was easier

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.580
to have people help
you in the kitchen.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.330
Well, when I came to Stanford
campus as a young bride,

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.111
I rang the bell and no one came.

00:12:06.111 --> 00:12:07.350
So good luck.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.060
Get up and do it yourself.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.740
So it was necessity.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.960
And when the kids
were growing up--

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.970
and Suneil will attest to this--

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.700
if I got food on the table,
it was considered a win.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.070
It didn't matter what it was.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.960
Just food on the table.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.297
But as we looked at
how we will-- you know,

00:12:27.297 --> 00:12:29.020
we were becoming successful.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.450
It's the immigrant dream.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.060
Thampy and I probably
overshot the mark

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.030
in all the hopes and dreams
we had to be successful.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.270
But the price we
paid was completely

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:43.890
neglecting our own selves,
not thinking about nutrition

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.830
or exercise or well-being.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.210
It was just survival.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.230
You've got to make it.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.310
There's no safety net under you.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.950
So if you're in that
kind of a mindset,

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.060
cooking becomes a burden.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.430
But if you start to pay
attention to the one thing you

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.240
have in life,
which is your life,

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.310
and you start to think about
H-O-L-E's that never get filled

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.862
with food, I think it took me--

00:13:11.862 --> 00:13:14.320
I'm a very slow learner, as
you've probably guessed by now,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.700
but it took me the better
part of half a century

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.350
to really get there.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.540
So I had a very adversarial
relationship with food.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.040
And I don't know how many
people in this room would relate

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.240
or across the campuses.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.050
But the fact is food,
if you're a woman--

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.700
at least, it was in my culture--

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.570
oh, don't eat it.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.010
You'll get fat.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:36.949
Right?

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.240
JAN YANEHIRO: This culture too.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.620
DEEPA THOMAS: Yeah.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.610
Or I'm depressed.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.530
I'm just going to
have a bag of chips.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.660
Well, both ends don't work.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.270
And I talk about my own journey
with the H-O-L-E's that never

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.020
get filled with food.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:55.330
And then so you look at
food as your nourishment

00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.299
for your spirit and body,
but not just for your body.

00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:02.590
JAN YANEHIRO: And we've been
talking about her husband.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.390
And Thampy is here.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.290
And in fact, it was sort
of an arranged marriage.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:08.945
Sort of.

00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:09.736
DEEPA THOMAS: Yeah.

00:14:09.736 --> 00:14:12.490
JAN YANEHIRO: But he was
considered the most eligible

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:16.180
bachelor back in her home state.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.040
And he was studying
here at Stanford.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.712
And she thought, oh well.

00:14:21.712 --> 00:14:23.920
I mean, her family said,
oh, you've got to marry him.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.600
And you didn't quite
have that idea.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.308
DEEPA THOMAS: No.

00:14:26.308 --> 00:14:29.350
JAN YANEHIRO: And I say
this because she has helped

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.080
have him get his health back.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.000
They have two
children, two sons.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.710
And her son is here.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.990
He's one of the reasons why
we are all here because he

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.980
works here at Google.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.050
DEEPA THOMAS: Uh-huh.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.590
Suneil Thomas.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.360
JAN YANEHIRO: So you know, this
is a family affair right here.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.170
So I just want to digress
just a little bit about this

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.590
and then just say--

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.170
this is a reporter question.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.650
Both you and your
husband are immigrants.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.430
So this is slightly
off topic from food,

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.660
but you both are immigrants.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.750
You both became huge successes
here, raised your family here,

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.220
your children.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.850
What do you feel about the
immigrants in America today

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.050
and what should happen?

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.440
So this is a political question.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.090
Forgive me.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:10.828
I'm a reporter.

00:15:10.828 --> 00:15:12.286
DEEPA THOMAS: She's
going off book.

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:14.619
JAN YANEHIRO: Off book, but
we'll come back to the book.

00:15:14.619 --> 00:15:15.850
So what do you think?

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.810
Well, you know, one has to
look at a personal journey,

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.060
and times have changed.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.360
When Thampy and I
came here, I think

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.330
Suneil will attest to this--

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.730
by the time we had Suneil,
he was the first Indian

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:35.170
in all of the Portola Valley
schools, which is unbelievable.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.340
You see him sitting there.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.650
He's not that old.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.340
He is rudely very old.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.040
So things have changed.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:48.940
And the understanding
of ethnic difference--

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:54.490
what has happened to the
American economy and how the 1%

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.050
is literally--

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.120
and we probably are in the 1%.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.200
So I can say this today--
when we came here, Thampy

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.240
was making $300 a month
assistantship at Stanford

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.610
doing his PhD.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.320
Try living on $300.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.340
Well, I spent $50
on a straw hat.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.100
So that took care
of the first month.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.760
You know, we had to learn.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.810
But here we are.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.960
The minute we became
successful, you

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.680
have this need to hold
that door open for others.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.130
So I don't know when you
want to talk about this, Jan,

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.010
I think I'd like to
talk through FoodCorps,

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.230
the reason I got involved.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.680
This entire book and
all of my royalty

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.450
will go to a nonprofit
called FoodCorps.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.700
And why?

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.720
Because my American
friends who grew up

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.670
being told to finish
what's on their plate

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.370
because there are
kids starving in India

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.530
fall off their chairs
when I tell them

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.330
that one out of five
kids in American schools

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.350
is going to bed hungry
and waking up hungry.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.860
It is just not OK.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.690
It's not a political thing.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.700
So when I met Kurt Ellis--

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.920
that's a longer story-- but
he's written the forward

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.569
to my book--

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.500
he is the founding
CEO of FoodCorps--

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.690
I found a new hero.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.240
This young man came
out of Yale and figured

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.849
out how to create a
scalable nonprofit which

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:29.250
goes into the schools and
works with the schools,

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.450
especially in
underprivileged areas,

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.730
to do something about
the lunch programs

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:39.240
and connect the kids
to healthy food habits.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:44.510
So I think the immigrant story
is one of desperately trying

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:49.580
to succeed, and then some
of us are fortunate enough

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.490
to make it and ask the
question, how much is enough?

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.270
How much money?

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.840
How much food?

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.230
And when you answer
that question,

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.090
you hold the door
open for others.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.540
And if you want to get into
all the politics of today,

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.480
I think it's ridiculous.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.870
But the fact is we're individual
human beings all aspiring to be

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.920
successful, and I'd like
to stay with that thought

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.050
of philanthropy and immigrants.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.280
It's a new story, I think,
because philanthropy was always

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.810
part of the American history.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.440
But for immigrants,
it's sort of a luxury

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.840
to even think about
it, and we might

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.970
be on the first wave of it.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.930
So I'm proud of that.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.150
JAN YANEHIRO: And we are too.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:36.860
So the proceeds from this
book will go to FoodCorps.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.250
DEEPA THOMAS: My royalties.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.150
JAN YANEHIRO: Deepa's royalties.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.940
And for that, I think
we need to-- yeah.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.640
JAN YANEHIRO: So I do
want to open up for Q&amp;A

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.710
and leave you a lot
of time for that.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.070
And we've got Chef
Dina here and her team.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.440
So I'm going to
say, Dina, you're

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.520
first up for the questions.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.140
So let's give Dina a microphone.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.440
And we want to ask everybody
else to chime in too.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.149
So Dina, thank you for
preparing today's menu.

00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:07.190
CHEF DINA: Oh, it was my
pleasure, but thank you.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.148
JAN YANEHIRO: What would
you like to ask Deepa?

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:11.420
JAN YANEHIRO: I wondering
what really brought you

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.302
into the idea of
writing this book?

00:19:13.302 --> 00:19:15.260
What was your inspiration
for really spreading?

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.260
DEEPA THOMAS: That's a
very good question, Dina.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.260
It took five years.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.260
And I tried to say, no.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:19.760
No.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.259
No.

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:21.130
It's not me.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.670
And this is not
what I want to do.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.240
And to the first order, I
wanted to document my recipes

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.670
for my sons because both
of them like to cook.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:34.400
And it was really a dear friend
of mine who is Susan Dreyfus,

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.860
and she's in this
book as a chapter.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:43.105
Susan is an award winning Oscar
nominated documentary filmmaker

00:19:43.105 --> 00:19:44.160
it turns out.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.060
But that aside, she and I served
on the Board of Rhode Island

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.310
School of Design together,
and we became good friends.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.300
And it was Susan,
who in her kitchen--

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.810
and she hates to cook, but she
had a really beautiful kitchen

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.130
in New York--

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.070
she turned an
imaginary lens onto me

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:05.240
and said, what was your
first memory with food?

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.970
And out came tumbling my
story of my grandmother

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.699
who's in this book.

00:20:10.699 --> 00:20:11.990
And she said, freeze the frame.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.340
I said, I beg your pardon.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.470
And she said, write it
the way you said it.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.390
Because if you connect
your life stories

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:25.220
and how improbable it was that
you would write a cookbook--

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.640
but if you write those stories,
maybe the people who read it

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.580
will not be intimidated
by the recipes

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.970
that, yes, I've simplified it.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.120
I've have taken the
labor out of it.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.090
I've tried to Americanize
the understanding

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:42.050
of the ingredients and process.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:46.480
But the real impetus was what--

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.980
it was so shocking that
five days of an accidental

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.380
turn in Thampy's life,
my husband's life,

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.500
where he forgot to take
his insulin shot, which

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.010
was grounds for panic in our
household back in the day.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.500
But when he took his blood
sugar after five days

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.690
of eating this way, his
blood sugar was normal.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.570
So we-- our last
name is Thomas--

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.820
so Doubting Thomases
ran off to Walgreens

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.890
and got another monitor,
and it remained normal.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.380
So then I told my
general physician

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.170
who is the associate
dean of UCSF,

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.670
and he said, Mrs.
Thomas, you better

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.970
come in tell us
what you're doing

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:29.020
because there are three million
Indians in America alone

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.519
and 50% are diabetic.

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:33.310
India is the diabetic
capital of the world.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.550
One third of the adult
population of America

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:40.150
is fighting obesity
or diabetes or both.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:41.500
It's related.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.820
So I felt if I was
going to do this then

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.640
this is going to be my gift.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.730
And now our other
son, he and his wife

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.770
had our first grandchild.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:58.720
And so of course it is
a gift to her, I hope,

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.220
that to write the course--

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.160
you know, there's been so
many challenges in life.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.290
We all have them.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.880
But how we overcome them.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.330
And did I think I'd
write a cookbook?

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.110
No.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.220
But that it sold 10,000
copies in three months,

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.119
they tell me is something good.

00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:21.160
JAN YANEHIRO: It is good.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.680
It's fabulous.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.680
DEEPA THOMAS: Thank you.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.350
JAN YANEHIRO: And we want to
say that Thampy, her husband,

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.455
is still off of insulin.

00:22:27.455 --> 00:22:28.300
DEEPA THOMAS: Yes.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.309
Six years and counting.

00:22:29.309 --> 00:22:30.850
JAN YANEHIRO: Six
years and counting.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.240
And ever since he started to--

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.790
because Deepa has
secrets in this book.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:41.860
So ladies, you're
part of the crew here

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.400
that prepare healthy foods
for all the Google employees.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.330
Questions from you.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.722
Want to pass the mic down.

00:22:47.722 --> 00:22:49.180
AUDIENCE: So I was
actually curious

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.150
about how different the
cuisine in your book

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:56.504
is from what I would consider
modern or typical Indian food.

00:22:56.504 --> 00:22:57.295
DEEPA THOMAS: Yeah.

00:22:57.295 --> 00:22:57.550
JAN YANEHIRO: OK.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.090
Good question.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.298
DEEPA THOMAS: Great question.

00:22:59.298 --> 00:23:00.820
JAN YANEHIRO: Deepa.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.730
DEEPA THOMAS: You know,
it's really my commitment

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.970
to art and flavor
brought together.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.900
Now, traditional Indian food--

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.010
I promised someone earlier
I wouldn't say risks

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:18.460
being fifty shades of
brown, but I'm sorry folks.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.100
Pay attention to how it
looks when it's plated

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.980
is not the first thing you
think about with Indian food.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.780
For me, it's essential.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.790
You know, my environment
is important.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.970
It affects my well-being, that
there's a candle on the table.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.170
There's maybe some fresh
flowers, even weeds.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:39.220
You know, the thoughtfulness
which really help the healing

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:44.260
that I had to go through
in my American life,

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.720
I found that no matter
what difficulties

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.160
I was facing, if I just made
my environment a little tidier

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.680
or prettier or
maybe it's just me,

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.960
but there's a part
that I actually

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.280
write about the things we can
do to be a little more mindful.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.170
JAN YANEHIRO: Go ahead.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.580
DEEPA THOMAS:
First of all, which

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.390
cookbook author gets read?

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.600
But I suggest no
carb comfort foods.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.220
Make something more beautiful.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.590
A plate, a table,
your nightstand,

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:18.130
light candles in the
bedroom, window at dawn,

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:22.870
at the dinner table in the
back, linger after a meal.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:26.980
And it's just a little--
you might see it on page two

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.300
or one--

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.450
suggestions of how to
bring up well-being.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:36.230
And this was my approach
to the whole of this book,

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:41.350
and Indian food
suffers sometimes

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.840
from lack of thoughtfulness.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.350
The flavor is overwhelmingly
either beautiful or spicy,

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.160
and you eat it.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.360
And that's it.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.440
But to take the time to
present an ancient cuisine that

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.140
has health benefits
and is beautiful.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.310
I mean, this was--

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:00.670
when Sherry Heck, the
photographer in my kitchen,

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.610
saw what I was putting out
for one of the recipes,

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.540
she said, stop.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.100
Let me take a picture of that.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.880
So this was that shot.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.930
I put this nutmeg with
the mace around it,

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:18.460
is from my husband's younger
brother's backyard in Kerala.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.850
So I had just thrown it
on the cutting board,

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:22.900
and we took a shot of it.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.460
It's that beautiful.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.960
So why wouldn't
we lead with that?

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.320
JAN YANEHIRO: Right.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.480
So it is beautiful.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.670
Maybe you can talk about some
of the other spices on the book.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.477
So the nutmeg.

00:25:32.477 --> 00:25:33.310
And then we've got--

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.980
DEEPA THOMAS: Well, if you
start from the center out,

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.380
most of the spice
wars were fought

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.221
over this little
creature called a cloves.

00:25:41.221 --> 00:25:42.220
JAN YANEHIRO: Which is--

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.636
DEEPA THOMAS: Right
in the middle,

00:25:43.636 --> 00:25:46.280
and it's that
long-ish right there.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:46.780
Right there.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.560
JAN YANEHIRO: OK.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.226
DEEPA THOMAS: And
then this is cardamom.

00:25:49.226 --> 00:25:51.640
So clove and
cardamon and cinnamon

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.970
were the lead reasons why
trading with the South of India

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.750
was so through all the ages.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:03.210
And we feel that even
during the biblical times,

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.630
St. Thomas came to
the south of India--

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.990
our church that we
belong to, Thampy and I,

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:13.000
dates back to St. Thomas was
martyred in Kerala apparently.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.310
So you go on with--

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:19.180
I'd like to talk about this
actual spice in the background.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.450
We think curry powder is
an Indian spice blend.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.240
It is not.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:30.180
It is a signature blend that
every housewife would make up

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:34.740
in her kitchen, and every mix
would be slightly different.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.590
And then the Brits
happened in India.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.350
And so they created
this thing called

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.230
curry powder, which can
be quite nauseating I

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.896
find in the stores.

00:26:44.896 --> 00:26:46.020
And that's the other thing.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.730
If you have spices
in your kitchen

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:52.530
that have been there for more
than six months, throw it out.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.690
I had stuff when we
moved from years,

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.370
and I thought, oh my god.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.200
So all the nutritional
value is gone.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.140
It smells and
tastes like sawdust.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.540
It is important to
keep whole spices.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.650
So that spice there is powdered.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.540
And of course, it
includes turmeric,

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.760
which gives that the yellow.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.770
But it would have coriander
seeds, cumin seeds, anise seed,

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.170
fennel seed.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.060
And if you kept seeds in your
kitchen, you can toast them up

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.370
and grind them and
that is much better way

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.550
to go than have ground spices.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:31.490
And I give you recipes for
my curry blend and also

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.690
Deepa's secret spice,
which someday I

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:37.560
hope to productize because
then I can help more kids.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.150
But it's 16 different spices
toasted and ground up,

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:46.620
and a pinch of it will make
your omelet taste one way.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.540
And three tablespoons of it will
take your roast another way.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.320
The recipe's in
the book as well.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.320
JAN YANEHIRO: So does
that answer your question?

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:55.820
Yes.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.850
And do you have
another question here?

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.930
You also work in
food service here.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.100
So tell us your question.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.430
AUDIENCE: So you had so
much success with your book.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.671
What's next for Deepa Thomas?

00:28:07.671 --> 00:28:08.670
JAN YANEHIRO: All right.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.710
Good question!

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.210
DEEPA THOMAS: Tell me your name.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.215
AUDIENCE: Jessenia.

00:28:12.215 --> 00:28:12.630
DEEPA THOMAS: Jessenia?

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.650
What a beautiful name.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.561
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:14.561 --> 00:28:16.560
DEEPA THOMAS: That's a
great question, Jessenia.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.080
I think you and I have
to have coffee some day

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.990
and talk about it some more.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.310
You know, every day
is an opportunity.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:27.270
And just having become a
grandmother, I'm besot.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.960
but with this little
creature that something

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.160
will happen in this journey
that is taking another turn yet.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:41.386
I never thought a grandchild
could change how I view life.

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:42.510
It is completely different.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:48.010
Every window that was close in
my spirit has been blown open.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:51.040
So now the possibilities
are endless.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.430
I think the universe
is abundant.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.040
And I was saying earlier I
find if I leave my hands open,

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:02.460
as in my mind, incredible
opportunity comes my way.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.480
So I'd love to do a line of
products that makes it easier

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.330
for the home chef.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.600
And that to hopefully then
the sales of that will help

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.810
us do even more good work, and
I think my cause will always

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.870
be child related.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:20.700
It is unconscionable, as
I said, that our children

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.480
are required to suffer in
a country that throws away

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.850
40% of its food.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.202
I think we all should
be obsessed with this.

00:29:29.202 --> 00:29:30.660
AUDIENCE: So
something we've talked

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.630
about is the disconnect
between where food comes from

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.420
and how it's produced and
what we actually consume.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:40.120
And growing up, having
servants prepare for you

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.330
and then in the
United States maybe

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:45.120
having fast food
when you're young,

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.180
how did your thinking
and reaction to food

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.390
change once you started
preparing it for yourself

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:51.535
and understanding recipes?

00:29:51.535 --> 00:29:52.410
DEEPA THOMAS: Oh wow.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:53.850
That's a great question.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.430
JAN YANEHIRO: But if you
read the book-- and I have--

00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:00.060
I'm going to admit
this for Deepa.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.840
She came to US, and they did
order pizza and Kentucky Fried

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.370
Chicken and all those things.

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:10.380
And she actually learned
to cook here in USA.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.952
So there's a lead.

00:30:12.952 --> 00:30:13.910
DEEPA THOMAS: There is.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:18.000
And I think your question
is how do I view it now

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.120
that I'm more conscious
about how I shop,

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.940
what I keep in the fridge,
what I have in my pantry,

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.330
and there's a whole
chapter dedicated to that.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:31.190
From my own knowledge of
if you come home tired,

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.570
I can't imagine you guys
going home and deciding

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:36.180
to cook for yourself.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.760
It was a big challenge for
me when the kids were young

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.770
and I was running
my own business.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:45.060
Now therefore, I've given
a cheat list of things

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.980
to keep on hand so you
can whip up a meal,

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.220
even if you don't
go grocery shopping.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.160
So that's the first thing, to
get a little bit organized.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.360
And I love and I'm obsessed
with farmer's markets.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.172
So whenever I get a
chance on a Saturday

00:30:59.172 --> 00:31:00.630
go down to the
[INAUDIBLE] building

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:05.350
and elbow out the chefs
who are also shopping.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.230
JAN YANEHIRO: Dina, maybe you.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.470
DEEPA THOMAS: And so living
in California, we have access

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:14.440
to such incredible ingredients.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.880
I've been known to go a bit
crazy over specialty salts,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:24.300
but I collect things that catch
my attention, a beautiful fruit

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.230
vinegar.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.840
I know someday I'll use
it in a salad dressing

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.280
or in a marinade.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.870
So I'm looking at
the ingredients

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:34.380
from a sustainable
standpoint, whether it is just

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:38.040
the two of us eating
or friends drop by

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.900
or it's a big party suddenly.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.740
Will I be able to whip it
up without going berserk?

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.700
Which is another thing.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.230
The more organized
I am, the less crazy

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:50.160
I get with guests,
which I've been

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.560
known to be extremely crazy.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.022
But my whole theory is if I can
do this, anyone can do this.

00:31:57.022 --> 00:31:58.855
That's what I'm trying
to do with this book.

00:31:58.855 --> 00:32:02.130
It isn't a Michelin star chef--

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.720
well, somebody wrote
on the back of my book.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.330
He happens to be a
Michelin star chef.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.330
But for me, I wanted
to take the mystery out

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:12.114
of everyday cooking.

00:32:12.114 --> 00:32:14.280
JAN YANEHIRO: And by the
way, if you're lucky enough

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.760
to be invited,
Justin, to her home,

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.740
may I just say
it's a real treat.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.580
We enjoyed a fabulous dinner.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.820
She had lamb chops,
and she had eggplant

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.720
with corn and a fresh salad.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.280
If you're lucky
enough, anybody here.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.692
Maybe we could do a
drawing or something.

00:32:34.692 --> 00:32:36.750
So thank you for your question.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.250
Questions on that end.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.990
AUDIENCE: Do you
teach cooking classes?

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.800
JAN YANEHIRO: Do you teach?

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.910
AUDIENCE: Or would you like to.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.993
DEEPA THOMAS: That's a
very good question as well.

00:32:43.993 --> 00:32:45.910
I've barely finished this thing.

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:51.126
And in fact, Jan's daughter
Jenna who works with--

00:32:51.126 --> 00:32:52.250
JAN YANEHIRO: Food Network.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:53.041
DEEPA THOMAS: Yeah.

00:32:53.041 --> 00:32:56.070
I mean, I'm really
well-connected you can tell.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:59.640
So Jenna who is
adorable, she and I

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.290
were talking about maybe doing
little clips on as simple

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.952
as how do you peel a mango.

00:33:05.952 --> 00:33:07.410
I mean, there's a
mango salad here.

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:10.490
Well, maybe somebody doesn't
know how to peel a mango--

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:14.220
a 30 second clip of that and
then eventually leading into--

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.030
I don't think I'll do
full-on cooking lessons,

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.720
but there's a way to
draw in small groups who

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.870
have specific questions or
come to places like this

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:30.510
and have a little, I don't know,
prepare lunch session together

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.090
and share ideas and knowledge.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:34.680
I'd love to do
that kind of thing.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.554
JAN YANEHIRO: And we
also know, because there

00:33:36.554 --> 00:33:40.110
are a lot of millennials in this
room, you all want very quick,

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.650
short videos.

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:44.340
You don't want to stay for
the hour long documentary

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.590
on the history of spices.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:50.040
So that's the idea that it's
going to be short clips,

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:54.180
and you can find it on
YouTube and learn and do it

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.092
really quickly.

00:33:55.092 --> 00:33:56.550
AUDIENCE: What
would your advice be

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:00.060
to someone who is
somewhat intimidated

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.030
by the complexities
of Indian food,

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.690
who doesn't have
much time, who is--

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:08.580
I'm a little older than
the millennial age--

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:15.719
but at the same time want to
prepare dishes, meals quickly?

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.489
And where would you start?

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.530
How would you approach
it if you've never

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:20.760
cooked Indian food?

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.980
DEEPA THOMAS: Oh, that's
a terrific question.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:27.630
And then this is spot on
because I was that person.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.840
I didn't know how to cook.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.139
I scorched my first meal.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:35.550
And there weren't great teachers
who could have taught me.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:37.770
What I remembered of my
grandmother and mother's

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:39.960
cooking informed me.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.650
And I think I'd say,
approach Indian food--

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.437
now, do you cook generally?

00:34:45.437 --> 00:34:46.020
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:46.978
DEEPA THOMAS: Fabulous.

00:34:46.978 --> 00:34:48.120
Start there.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.820
Approach it with
the comfort you have

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.639
cooking the foods you know
how to cook because that's how

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:55.889
I approached Indian cuisine.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:58.860
I brought in the techniques
from other cuisines

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.900
that I was familiar with.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:05.550
And you can open up the
earlier pages of the book

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.820
and look at the recipes.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.390
They're really the ABC's.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.810
I recommend very
strongly, especially

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.150
with the focus of type 2
diabetes and just losing

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:18.420
weight and being healthy,
a protein breakfast.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.830
So I say, for instance, a stir
fry or a grilled vegetable

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:27.270
from the previous night
and I break an egg open

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.997
in a pan with onions under
it so it caramelizes it

00:35:30.997 --> 00:35:32.580
as it's cooking and
then put it on top

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.770
of the stirred vegetables.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.200
That's Indian food also.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.860
So now if you want to get into
a little more complicated stuff

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.050
I've got, for
instance, I think one

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.890
of Suneil's favorite things,
the new Indian cacciatore,

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:49.110
the chicken dish,
which is really

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.840
reminiscent of the
Italian technique.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.040
But there's just enough
Indian flavor and twist

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.810
to keep it familiar.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.220
So pick the recipes,
I would say.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.610
And if you're not going to
have this book, approach

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:07.870
Indian food from your comfort
level, not what you don't know.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.120
I mean, throw in some spice.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.070
How bad can it be?

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:15.090
Toasting cumin seeds-- if
there's one thing people

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.030
will try.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:19.680
Toast the cumin seeds until
it's got this nutty flavor

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.920
and short of going
black and burnt.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.760
So really a good
cinnamon char on it.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:31.170
And then when it's cool, powder
it and sprinkle it on stuff.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.870
I mean, make up your
own Indian recipes.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.730
I want to encourage
people to go off

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:40.380
because I learned exactly the
way you're asking the question.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.290
What is Indian food?

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:41.790
Oh, my god.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.380
Where are the servants?

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.470
JAN YANEHIRO: I'm
ringing the bell.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:50.530
So let's pass it around.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:53.461
Suneil, do you have a
question for your mother?

00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:54.590
SUNEIL THOMAS: Yeah.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:56.340
I guess my question
to you is that I think

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.580
it's so important to
get people to have

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.040
a new view on Indian
food in the US,

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.370
but I think it's also
important for Indians in India

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.940
to rediscover Indian food and
have a pride in their food

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:14.400
and not identify luxury and a
big night out with crappy food.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.534
And do you have any
plans around that?

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.450
DEEPA THOMAS: That's a
great question, Suneil.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.452
I can see you're
creating work for me.

00:37:21.452 --> 00:37:22.910
JAN YANEHIRO: As
a good son should.

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:24.368
DEEPA THOMAS: As
a good son should.

00:37:24.368 --> 00:37:26.610
But that is a big challenge.

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:31.470
At the moment, the book is
only sold in the US and Canada.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.810
But of course,
Amazon is everywhere.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:37.680
And so it's amazing
how much demand

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:41.710
has been created in India
for this kind of cooking.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:44.910
Now, what you're talking
about is a mindset,

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.516
how we view comfort food.

00:37:47.516 --> 00:37:48.890
And what's the
need for comfort--

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:51.600
what do we call comfort food?

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.120
The foods you're describing--

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.900
it's after a long day,
let's go have some drinks

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.672
and eat rubbish is the way to
mitigate the stress that we

00:38:01.672 --> 00:38:03.630
probably should have
handled in a different way

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.290
in the first place.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:07.380
I don't think it's
just India, but it's

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.390
all countries that
are struggling

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.770
with stress of
economic competition

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.840
and the fear of loss--

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.580
loss of a job, loss of
well-being, whatever it is.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:25.680
I don't think any one person can
change the ethos of a culture

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.820
like India or America or
any country, but all of us

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.060
together can ask the
question of ourselves.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.820
What are the tools we
have to handle threats?

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.290
Simple question.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:38.160
I had the worst.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.960
In fact, I didn't
have any tools.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.970
Today I have a few more tools.

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:44.730
And as I have more
tools to handle stress,

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:45.870
I pay more attention.

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.850
I'm more mindful.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:52.140
So until we as ordinary
citizens get mindful,

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.450
I don't think brands
or anyone else

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:57.660
is going to stop selling to--

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.760
it's like drugs.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.380
Why do people buy drugs?

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.580
They think it'll make
them feel better.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.510
Same thing-- junk
food and drugs are

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.110
in the same area of the brain.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:12.480
Sugar is registered in exactly
the same place in the brain

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.850
that cocaine is processed.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:20.640
Now we can go into neurology and
talk about the power of food.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.610
But I think it's an
ongoing discussion, Suneil,

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:27.270
and I'm getting
into this process

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:30.990
where there's a professor at
Stanford who is addressing

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:32.880
diabetes in India.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.500
And he's just asked
me to come over,

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.660
and we'll see where it goes.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.760
Anything to help.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.593
JAN YANEHIRO: Right.

00:39:38.593 --> 00:39:40.800
I could see it,
books all over India,

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.600
Deepa's books all over India.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.200
And I think that people would
discover the healthful benefits

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.210
and really use this.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.700
AUDIENCE: I think of
myself, and I cook

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.190
and I'm willing to
try some of the dishes

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:55.560
that you would have
highlighted, but then I

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.480
think back to my parents
who still live in India.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.800
And they're used to their
style of cooking and eating.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.980
I wonder if you have thoughts
on how I can sort of introduce

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.010
them to thinking about
food differently and sort

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:12.127
of adapting to this
style of cooking.

00:40:12.127 --> 00:40:13.710
DEEPA THOMAS: Where
are they in India?

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.085
AUDIENCE: They're
in Maharashtra.

00:40:15.085 --> 00:40:16.530
DEEPA THOMAS: OK.

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:19.380
Then that's good because
Maharashtra has healthier food,

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.650
I have to say, than several
of the Northern states.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:26.370
And the reason I
ask that is I don't

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:30.990
think you can change their
perspective until they

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:33.390
feel a need to be healthier.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:35.239
Are they in good health?

00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:36.780
AUDIENCE: Yes, so
far they're doing--

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.488
DEEPA THOMAS: OK.

00:40:37.488 --> 00:40:39.330
Well, then I wouldn't
mess with it.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:41.040
They probably
don't need my book.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.250
But the attitudes change
from, if you're curious,

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:47.160
as to what foods
cause inflammation.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.590
So say you meet
somebody with arthritis.

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:53.610
That's inflammation,
and it's food based.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:55.770
So you can go to
a Western doctor

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:58.500
and get medication,
which will guaranteed

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:03.300
make your gut bacteria die.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:07.710
So it's up to us to be curious,
and of all the places, Google.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:09.680
Come on guys.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.400
You can get all
the information you

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.160
need on how foods
affect inflammation

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.680
and what are the foods
that reduce inflammation.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.390
Just even having a
discussion on how they feel.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:27.900
Fatigue is a form
of inflammation.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:33.230
So I entered this arena
through that standpoint.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.030
I'm one of the
lucky human beings,

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.850
apparently in the
1% of my age group,

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:42.660
100 years old, who is
on zero medication.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.960
Now that's something to be in
a family with heart disease

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.140
and diabetes that I
come from, I think

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.810
it has something to do
with paying attention

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:53.970
to what goes in my mouth.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.025
And I'm not a good--

00:41:56.025 --> 00:42:00.570
I do all the wrong things, but
there's recovery to be had.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:03.860
Your body is dying to heal.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.310
It literally is dying to heal.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.740
So if you will help
it, it will heal.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.540
JAN YANEHIRO: If you can turn
to two recipes in the book that

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:18.060
you would say are your favorites
or maybe Thampy's favorite

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.800
or Suneil's favorite, what
recipe would you say--

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.470
so for all of you who would
like to see the book--

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.210
what page would you say?

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:28.540
Turn to this page.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.635
This is my favorite
dish, my favorite recipe

00:42:30.635 --> 00:42:31.510
or Thampy's favorite.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:32.350
What would you say?

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:32.550
DEEPA THOMAS: OK.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.225
First of all, it's like asking
me to choose a favorite child.

00:42:35.225 --> 00:42:36.350
JAN YANEHIRO: I know, but--

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.100
DEEPA THOMAS: And he's
sitting right there

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.310
because he showed up.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.310
OK.

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:45.382
How many eat fish or
meat in this room?

00:42:45.382 --> 00:42:46.090
JAN YANEHIRO: OK.

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.673
And there are a
couple of vegetarians.

00:42:47.673 --> 00:42:48.820
Bihan is a vegetarian.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.180
Any other vegetarians?

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:50.680
Oh.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.060
Two.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:51.560
Three.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.350
Three vegetarians.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:56.010
DEEPA THOMAS: So
let me start with--

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:57.082
you gave me two, right?

00:42:57.082 --> 00:42:58.040
JAN YANEHIRO: Yes, two.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.830
DEEPA THOMAS: OK.

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:02.480
Perhaps my favorite vegetable--

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.330
funny thing-- is cabbage.

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:08.560
And maybe because it was cooked
so badly in India, cooked

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.120
within one inch of death.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.000
JAN YANEHIRO: Bihan is not in
his name, in his head rather.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.200
DEEPA THOMAS: And the stink.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.450
I mean, you came in the
house, and you could smell it.

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:22.450
So I went on this tear to make
it more crunchy and salad-like

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:23.960
and yet flavorful.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.552
So I would say Hot and
Crispy Cabbage on page 150.

00:43:28.552 --> 00:43:29.260
JAN YANEHIRO: OK.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.725
So we are going to turn to 150.

00:43:31.725 --> 00:43:33.850
DEEPA THOMAS: Gosh, you're
really going to do this.

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.620
JAN YANEHIRO: Absolutely.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.790
Here we go.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:38.740
Yes.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.430
Here it is.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.690
OK.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:45.770
So the vegetarians in the
room, three of you, this

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.030
is your page.

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:48.020
Page 150.

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.150
DEEPA THOMAS: What's up on
top is yet another recipe,

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:57.320
Spicy Peanuts, which is one of
Suneil's favorites as a snack.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:02.420
And it's the kind of snack
I keep on hand at home

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:06.560
so that we are eating smaller
meals, four to five meals.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.410
Not three large ones
or two gigantic ones.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.180
And if you get
hungry, a quarter cup

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.780
of these spicy peanuts
or the [INAUDIBLE] nuts

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:18.880
will absolutely curb
the hunger back.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.970
And it's amazing.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.250
I like to say that
the stomach is not

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.750
behind the bellybutton, folks.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.400
It's a little higher.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.010
So you get full really easily.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:32.150
And paying attention to how much
food is going into this-- this

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.140
is the size of a
stomach, the fist.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:35.947
It should be.

00:44:35.947 --> 00:44:37.030
It should remain that way.

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.500
But as we get older, it's not.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.252
So, yes.

00:44:41.252 --> 00:44:43.210
I would say that's one
of the favorite recipes.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:43.918
JAN YANEHIRO: OK.

00:44:43.918 --> 00:44:45.470
And for the folks
in the audience,

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:47.740
they eat fish and meat,
what would you say?

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:48.550
DEEPA THOMAS: Oh.

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:56.590
I have to pick the Clay Pot
Fish, and that is page 164.

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:59.530
And you don't need
a clay pot for this

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.290
even though it's
called Clay Pot.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:06.490
It's such a simple
coconut sauce that if you

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:10.130
can nail this one, which
is very easy to make,

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:13.090
then you might even throw
in roasted vegetables

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:15.710
into the coconut sauce.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:17.800
So it's very versatile.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.110
I encourage people
to go off book

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:23.740
because these sauces
and techniques,

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.090
you can use whatever
ingredients you want.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:28.510
There's a mughlai
sauce in the book--

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:32.210
which mughlai sauce typically
is cream based and very heavy

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:35.830
and you need a wheelbarrow
to leave the restaurant.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:40.460
But this is made, I substituted
coconut milk for the cream.

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.940
And you can keep it
on hand in your fridge

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.180
and come home and put
anything into that thing.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.850
It'll make shoe
leather taste good.

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:52.070
JAN YANEHIRO: So there are
two tips from the book itself.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.640
So in closing,
what would you like

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.600
to say to this audience
about "Deepa's Secret?"

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.150
What is the biggest secret
you have, number one?

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:04.270
And what's the message you
want to give to everybody here

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:08.060
in this audience and to
all the Google campuses?

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.090
DEEPA THOMAS: Well
first of all, a huge

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:13.440
thank you to all of you for
taking the time to be here

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.492
and to the wonderful culinary
team that has prepared

00:46:18.492 --> 00:46:19.700
so many recipes from my book.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.491
JAN YANEHIRO: Yeah.

00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:23.152
Give it up for them
They worked today.

00:46:23.152 --> 00:46:25.610
DEEPA THOMAS: And so we're
going to try some of that stuff.

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:33.170
But really my request is
to be mindful around food.

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:36.130
It took me a great deal
of time to really focus

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:37.300
on what that means.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:42.220
And the more I
stabilize my spirit,

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:46.000
the better my cooking
got, funny thing.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.290
So does that make sense?

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:48.190
I hope it does.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:51.850
And so I'm sure you'll
all in your busy lives

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:53.500
figure out oasis.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:58.810
Make cooking a zen
experience, not a frenetic

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:00.850
get food on the table exercise.

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:04.060
If you're just using half an
hour of your time to cook,

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.050
put the music on.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.150
Pour yourself a glass of wine.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:08.500
Play some music.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.420
And get into the zone.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:11.750
And have fun with it.

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.000
JAN YANEHIRO: So there you go.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.390
Everybody, Deepa Thomas,
"Deepa's Secrets."

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:20.380
Again, I'm here because
Deepa is donating

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:24.664
her royalties to FoodCorps,
and I think that is important.

00:47:24.664 --> 00:47:25.830
So thank you all for coming.

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:27.610
DEEPA THOMAS: Can I tell a
quick story just two seconds.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:28.165
JAN YANEHIRO: OK, yes.

00:47:28.165 --> 00:47:29.331
DEEPA THOMAS: How I met Jan.

00:47:29.331 --> 00:47:34.320
I was buying a card at
Papyrus, and the manager there

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.810
had bought my book.

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:38.620
And she texted me and
said, would you sign it.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.137
I said, oh, I'm right next door.

00:47:40.137 --> 00:47:41.470
I'll just walk over and sign it.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:42.542
So I walk in.

00:47:42.542 --> 00:47:43.750
And she's a little excitable.

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.280
So she started
jumping up and down

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.870
that I'd physically present--

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.850
I started jumping up and down.

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:51.445
And we didn't know that there
was somebody at the counter,

00:47:51.445 --> 00:47:52.570
and I looked over and said.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:54.740
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:57.030
And I said, are
you Jan Yanehiro?

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:59.058
And she said, yes I am.

00:47:59.058 --> 00:47:59.974
JAN YANEHIRO: It's me.

00:47:59.974 --> 00:48:00.474
It's me.

00:48:00.474 --> 00:48:02.680
DEEPA THOMAS: And that
was just a few weeks ago.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:03.510
Can you imagine?

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:05.740
And we've become
like soul sisters.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.854
And here she is
supporting my journey.

00:48:07.854 --> 00:48:10.395
JAN YANEHIRO: And she asked me
to come and do this interview.

00:48:10.395 --> 00:48:12.129
DEEPA THOMAS: From
Jackie Speier who you

00:48:12.129 --> 00:48:13.420
were interviewing two days ago.

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:14.440
JAN YANEHIRO: On Monday.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.356
DEEPA THOMAS: To this.

00:48:15.356 --> 00:48:17.090
Am I lucky?

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:20.000
JAN YANEHIRO: So thank
you all for joining us.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.900
I think there's some
great secrets in this book

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.400
that we can all learn from.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.910
Thank you for having us
here at the Google campus.

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:30.160
I was excited coming to Google.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:30.900
I'm bragging.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:31.760
I'm going to Google.

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.860
I'm going to go to Google.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.210
I'm going to have
lunch at Google.

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:37.270
So thank you for having us.

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:39.460
Thank you Deepa for
creating this book.

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.925
One more time, thank
you to Deepa, everybody.

00:48:41.925 --> 00:48:43.810
DEEPA THOMAS: Oh, thank you.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.260
[APPLAUSE]
