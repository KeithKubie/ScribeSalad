00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.610
I have a very distinct memory of tv telling
me, "every hour the sun beams enough solar

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.230
energy to power our planet for a year."

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.219
Solar power, however, has yet to deliver on
this promise from my children's television.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:20.350
Why is it so hard????

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.900
The sun shines on us every day, it comes down
here we gather it up and we use it for energy

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.330
-- boom boom boom, done!

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.450
But it's slightly more complicated than that,
as you know.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.160
In 1873, electrical engineer Willoughby Smith
discovered the element selenium was photoconductive

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.570
-- when exposed to sunlight the metallic form
of selenium becomes a semiconductor!

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.810
Three years later, other scientists discovered
selenium could be used to create electricity

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.260
from sunlight -- dubbed the photoelectric
effect.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.440
When sunlight hits a metal like selenium the
electromagnetic radiation is absorbed into

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.579
it -- this fueled a whole HOST of physics
nerds who are still arguing whether light

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.000
is a particle or a wave to this day!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.390
It was such a big deal the 1921 Nobel Prize
in physics was awarded to Albert Einstein

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.500
for explaining the photoelectric effect, and
for his contributions to theoretical physicsâ€¦

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.500
or whatever.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.180
Eventually, scientists discovered that the
light energy causes the freeing of electrons

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.200
which, if captured, could be used to generate
electricity!.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.670
This photoelectric effect has since been cultivated
and researched and cultivated again, and the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.530
discovery that many different elements display
a photoelectric effect opened it up for use

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.260
in a number of inventions!

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.080
Photosensitive cells are used in televisions,
industrial processes, telecommunications,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.200
fiber optics, copy machines, spectroscopy
and telescopy, and to sense pollution or emphasize

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.510
other lights like in night vision or infrared
cameras; plus, of course, solar panels via

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.979
a photovoltaic cell.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.720
Photovoltaics were invented in the 1950s,
and were popularized by the space program

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.340
as a way to power satellites.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.380
In the 1970s, pushes were made to modernize
photovoltaics for use in commercial and residential

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.299
power -- but consumers mainly used them for
calculators, watches, radios and the like.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.240
Like a battery, a photovoltaic cell has a
positive and negative to guide the electrons

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240
into the system.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.560
Each cell uses a pair of silicon wafers -- one
doped with phosphorous (negative) and one

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.150
with boron (positive).

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.700
From 1995 to 2010 solar energy use grew 20
percent a year -- and now, new inventions

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.390
are making it even more affordable.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.480
Firstly, in 2009, China created way more solar
panels than the market needed, and the price

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.569
collapsed.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.030
And secondly, state and federal governments
in the United States, Germany, the United

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.230
Kingdom and Japan are all giving subsidies
to cultivate better renewable energy systems.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.620
This means more supply and demand for this
technology, and as money flows through renewables,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.819
they get better!

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.940
Recently the University of Queen Mary in London
revealed they can turn shrimp shells into

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.459
cheap solar panels.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.681
The shells of crustaceans contain chitin and
chitosan which can be extracted into CQD or

00:02:53.681 --> 00:03:00.040
carbon quantum dots -- CQD solar cells aren't
new, but usually use expensive ruthenium for

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.760
its photoelectric properties.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.150
Instead, the researchers found this biomass
byproduct of the shrimp industry can be used

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.050
to extract CQDs and create fully renewable,
cheap solar cells!

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.060
Pretty cool, huh?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.180
Fortunately solar cells aren't the only place
finding greener solutions for energy use -- Toyota

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.180
is, too!

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.959
The new Toyota Mirai is looking to the future
with sustainability in mind; fueled by hydrogen

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.260
and leaving zero emissions behind.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.239
Every year renewable energy is getting better,
but it's not yet as efficient as we'd hope.

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.099
For more on the efficiency of the most common
types of energy production, check out my video

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:44.060
about that here

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.959
What do YOU think is the most promising type
of energy?

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:47.959
Solar?

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:48.959
Wind?

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:49.959
Nuclear?

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:50.959
Or plain old coal, oil and gas?

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:51.959
Why?

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.650
Tell me your thoughts in the comments, and
thanks for watching.

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.470
Go do it!

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.989
We need you here!

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.519
Thanks again.
