00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:11.286
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Dude, I like what you built there.

00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:12.306
What's it do?

00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:14.246
&gt;&gt; Dude: Oh...hi Iz.

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:16.096
This is a cool bug.

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:20.046
I made it using an electronics
building kit that Sally got me.

00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:23.676
She wanted to get me a genetics
kit but nothing's available yet.

00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:25.716
Eesh! I don't get it.

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:30.266
Why is it so easy to turn on and off the
lights for this electronic bug but so hard

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.386
to turn things on and off in biology?

00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:33.866
&gt;&gt; Izzy: What do you mean Dude?

00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:38.446
The arsenic sensor that we built in
bacteria a few years ago works pretty well.

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:42.796
If there's arsenic in the water
being tested the sensor turns on.

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:46.136
And when arsenic isn't in
the water, the sensor is off.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:49.366
And we built that sensor with
natural biological parts!

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:51.606
&gt;&gt; Dude: So arsenic works like this switch?

00:00:51.976 --> 00:00:53.036
How is that possible?

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:54.996
How does the cell know?

00:00:55.416 --> 00:00:59.906
&gt;&gt; Izzy: We used parts from the ArsR operon
to program arsenic-inducible expression.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:00.706
&gt;&gt; Dude: Hold up!

00:01:01.316 --> 00:01:03.396
Arsenic-inducible expression?

00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:04.666
What's that mean??

00:01:05.256 --> 00:01:07.646
All I know is that arsenic is toxic.

00:01:08.386 --> 00:01:10.586
Don't the cells just die when you poison them?

00:01:11.276 --> 00:01:14.126
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Cells have come up with
a bunch of clever ways to survive.

00:01:14.656 --> 00:01:17.896
In the case of arsenic, the cells
make a pump to get the poison

00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:20.126
out as soon as any comes inside the cell.

00:01:20.386 --> 00:01:21.015
&gt;&gt; Dude: That makes sense.

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:22.186
So ass-er is the pump?

00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:23.706
And why did you call it inducible?

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:27.106
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Dude, be careful how you
say it: the protein is called ArsR

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:29.786
since it's the ARSenic Repressor protein.

00:01:30.196 --> 00:01:31.856
And ArsR isn't the pump.

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:34.515
It just tells the cell when to make the pump.

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:39.966
The operon has promoter, which is
where the cell's RNA polymerase binds.

00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:47.146
And at least three genes: the ArsR gene, which
encodes the repressor protein, the ArsB gene,

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:53.366
which encodes the pump, and the ArsC gene,
which encodes an enzyme that reduces arsenic

00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:56.656
in the cell so it can be pumped out.

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:04.156
Most of the time, the operon is turned "off"

00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:09.026
since the ArsR protein binds the DNA
near the promoter to stop transcription.

00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:14.156
But when arsenic comes into the
cell, it binds the ArsR protein.

00:02:14.806 --> 00:02:20.346
And when the repressor is bound to arsenic,
it can't bind the DNA so RNA polymerase can.

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:24.466
That way the cell makes more
of the repressor, the pump,

00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:27.016
and the enzyme only when there's arsenic around.

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:28.816
That's the inducible part.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:32.666
&gt;&gt; Dude: So why did you include the
whole operon in your arsenic sensor?

00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:35.296
It seems like you could just
include the ArsR gene

00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:37.736
and the promoter parts for
your arsenic sensor device?

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:38.916
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Nice work.

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:41.346
That's actually exactly what we did.

00:02:41.596 --> 00:02:45.186
We simplified the natural system
to only use the parts we wanted.

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:46.656
So it looks like this...

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:50.036
&gt;&gt; Dude: So you're arsenic
sensor works like this?

00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:54.696
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Dude, that's great but I
have two even simpler way to write it.

00:02:54.936 --> 00:02:58.776
This is called a truth table and
this is called a transfer curve.

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:03.506
Both tell you that when arsenic levels
are low, the operon is mostly off

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:08.916
and when arsenic levels are high, the operon
turns on and starts cranking out proteins.

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:15.056
Earth to Dude...what are you doing?

00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:17.146
&gt;&gt; Dude: Well here's the thing Iz.

00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:20.516
I'm always looking for some way
to get Buddy's gas-o-matic module

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:22.536
to turn off before he gets too big.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:27.456
I was hoping I could maybe switch this operon
around to get the truth table working like this.

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:30.746
And get the transfer curve looking like this.

00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:32.156
&gt;&gt; Izzy: No problem!

00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:35.506
You're looking for a simple
digital device called an inverter.

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:37.555
&gt;&gt; Dude: Oe-kaaay.

00:03:38.146 --> 00:03:42.786
Can we turn this operon into an inverter or do
I have to build something completely different?

00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:46.776
&gt;&gt; Izzy: There are already a few
transcription-based inverters in the registry,

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:50.766
but I don't know if anyone's built
one using the arsenic repressor.

00:03:51.326 --> 00:03:52.456
Maybe you can be the first.

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:53.616
Do you want to try?

00:03:54.096 --> 00:03:54.726
&gt;&gt; Dude: You bet!!

00:03:55.376 --> 00:04:01.816
But how?? What about this idea: lets take
this promoter that binds the "Ars R" protein

00:04:01.986 --> 00:04:03.986
and move it to the end of the operon.

00:04:04.206 --> 00:04:08.766
This way if I put my gas-o-matic device
after the promoter, then high production

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:12.246
of the arsenic operon gives low
production of the gas-o-matic device.

00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:18.446
Input 1 Output 0...I think I nailed it!

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:19.486
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Nice thinking Dude.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:25.736
Most of the Registry's transcriptional inverters
are of that form: DNA that encodes the repressor

00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:28.126
and then a promoter that's repressed by it.

00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:33.796
One thing to remember about transcriptional
inverters is that they're pretty slow to switch.

00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:38.326
It can take over an hour for the
inverter to change its output signal

00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:40.856
after it receives a change in input signal.

00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:42.406
&gt;&gt; Dude: Well that might be ok.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:44.516
It's not like Buddy grows super fast.

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:49.546
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Well then maybe for your application
a transcriptional inverter is just fine,

00:04:49.926 --> 00:04:52.366
or maybe the registry has
one that will work better.

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:53.966
&gt;&gt; Dude: Registry.

00:04:54.686 --> 00:04:58.066
Search Parts .Inverter.

00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:02.646
I like this number: Q04401.

00:05:02.646 --> 00:05:06.156
Hmm that's strange.

00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:12.756
The Registry says that BBa_Q04401 works

00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:15.736
but the transfer curve doesn't
look like what you've drawn.

00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:21.036
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Well, the transfer curve that I
drew is a perfect inverter transfer curve.

00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:25.796
But when you actually build the devices,
they aren't going to have perfect behavior.

00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:30.086
And that's as true in electrical
engineering and biological engineering.

00:05:30.486 --> 00:05:53.776
Devices won't switch from high to
low as sharply as what I've drawn.

00:05:34.276 --> 00:05:37.346
&gt;&gt; Dude: I'd really like a
sharper change than this though.

00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:40.796
Maybe I should just build the
ArsR inverter to try in Buddy?

00:05:40.976 --> 00:05:44.236
&gt;&gt; Izzy: I think it would be worth a
shot ...let's get the parts you'll need

00:05:44.236 --> 00:05:45.316
and we can start today...
