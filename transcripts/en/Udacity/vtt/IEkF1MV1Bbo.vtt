You know how to actually
write rules now, so

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.450
why don't you write a read rule for
the users node.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.260
The exact rule is, a user must be
logged in to see a list of users.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.500
Can you go ahead to write
the rule in your json rules now?

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.140
I'll send over the spec.
