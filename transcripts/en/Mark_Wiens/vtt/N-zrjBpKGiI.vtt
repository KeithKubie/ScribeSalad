00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:11.190
Seoul, South Korea.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.330
On immediate glance you'll probably notice
that shopping and dining are two of Seoul's

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.140
most prominent features, but after a little
more research and wandering around, you'll

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.401
notice that there's a rich history, mountains
and parks, countless neighborhoods, and an

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:26.880
interesting Korean culture.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.800
The list of attractions in Seoul could go
on and on, that's why instead of trying to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.770
tackle the entire city, I'd limit this list
to just twenty five of the coolest things

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.120
to do.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.569
This is an overview that includes a little
history, a little shopping, food and eating,

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:44.389
and everything entertaining.

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:49.230
If you want to add something, to this list,
please feel free to leave a comment below.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.850
Number one is the Gyeongbukgung Palace, originally
constructed at the end of the fourteenth century,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.249
during the Jeonsong dynasty.

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:01.670
And I just got my ticket, three thousand won
which is about three US dollars.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:11.870
The coolest part about this palace are these
giant earthenware clay pots, and they were

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.360
used once back in the day to store the chili
pastes, the soy bean, the fermented soy beans,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.360
maybe even kim chi.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.660
Ok, I'm at the Bukchon Hanok Village, which
is a traditional Korean village, nowadays

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.230
it's quite a tourist attraction, but you just
follow this map around, and you go to a number

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:43.000
of different viewpoints, and lets go check
out these buildings.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.460
The temple is one of the centers of Zen Buddhism
in Korea.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.610
One of the coolest things about visiting the
temple was the ancient trees on the compound,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.440
apparently over five hundred years old and
strung with brightly colored lanterns.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.280
The Hwaseong Fortress is now a UNESCO world
heritage site, and one of South Koreas most

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.800
important historical sites.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.320
Ok, I'm going to start the ascent up to the
fortress walls.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.730
So, I don't know how long this will take,
but it doesn't look that high.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:20.409
Korean war memorial monument right now.

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.109
It's a pretty cool place actually.

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:31.590
Although a communications tower, it doubles
as an observation tower as well.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.650
Number seven is the area of Myeongdong.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.999
Shopaholics will rejoice when they go to Myeongdong,
it's one of Seoul's busiest and most shopper

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:45.500
insane areas of town.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.159
One of Seoul's most touristy areas of town
is known as Insadong, If you're looking for

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.219
Korean souvenirs to bring back, this is a
great, yet kind of expensive place to buy

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:58.139
things.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.379
Coming in at number nine is the Namdaemun
Market, located in the central area of Seoul,

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.919
and it's one of the cities largest and oldest
markets.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:12.900
This is Seoul in its most thrilling local
flavor.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.060
Yet another wild shopping destination, Dongdaemun
is not really a single market, but rather

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.019
an entire area that is dedicated to shopping.

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.549
One of the international melting pots of Seoul
is Itaewon.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.150
There are lots of international restaurants,
stores, bars and clubs.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.849
Another popular area of Seoul is near Hongik
University, known as Hongdae for short.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.670
Lotte Mart has to be one of the coolest grocery
stores I've ever visited.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.569
Step inside and you'll be transported into
a world of thrilling rides and adventurous

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.569
activities.

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.890
After walking around for a while, I realized,
it's a giant green park, with not just cool

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.560
things for kids, but for just about everyone.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.880
I got to see my first ever polar bears at
the zoo within the park.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.290
Along the banks of the river, throughout most
of the city, is a lovely recreational area

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.120
set aside for exercising and sports.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.069
In an effort to renew the greenness in a seemingly
endless city sprawl, in central Seoul, the

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.790
Cheonggyecheon Stream and recreational area
was created.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.690
Namsan is located right in the middle of Seoul,
but there are also many places to hike near

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.690
the city.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.950
Without doubt, if you like to eat, indulging
in Korean street food at the Gwangjang Market

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.640
will be one of the top things to do in Seoul.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:33.590
For myself, it was probably the coolest thing
I did.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.010
Number twenty is Seoul's Noryangjin Fisheries
Market, a bedazzling display of the finest

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.010
and freshest seafood.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.940
The seafood is kept so fresh in water that
it's sometimes looks like you're in a pet

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.420
store instead of a food market, isn't that
awesome.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.460
Garak Market is the biggest and craziest distribution
wholesale food market in Seoul.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.820
Food comes to this market from around the
entire country to supply the city.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.490
One of the finest things to do in Seoul is
to explore with your stomach.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.170
Much of the street food in Seoul is made for
on the go eater who just have a few moments

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.650
to grab a quick snack.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.760
The food is served piping hot and is fresh
and extremely tasty.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.820
Deep fried items and hot dogs are popular
choices.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.690
Korean really know how to make ice cream well,
and not just fresh ice cream, but some of

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.600
the best ice cream packages I've ever had
are sold at Korean convenience stores.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.250
I don't think I've ever seen as many coffee
shops per block as in Seoul.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.000
The problem is, it happens to be way watered
down, and not nearly strong enough, but the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.090
coffee shops are still nice to sit in, and
normally include wifi.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.560
It all eventually comes down to the food,
and Seoul, South Korea, is literally a heaven

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560
on earth.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.000
At number twenty five is the Korea barbecue.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.500
Sitting at a table with your own personal
grill in front of you, ordering plates of

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.340
meat and grilling them right before your nose,
and devouring the meat along with Korean side

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.810
dishes, and leaves of lettuce and garlic,
is one of the world's most delicious ways

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.310
to feast.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.310
During my entire visit, I was enthralled and
confused at the same time, debating what to

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:07.980
eat and trying to eat as much South Korean
food as possible.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:19.170
So there you have twenty five exciting things
to do in Seoul.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.590
But like I said before, this is by no means
everything there is to do in Seoul, so if

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:43.880
you have any other suggestions, please leave
a comment below and let me know!
