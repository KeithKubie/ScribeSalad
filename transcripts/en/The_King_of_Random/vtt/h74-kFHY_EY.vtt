[Caption by Richmond M. at Y Translator]
Hey guys I'm Nate.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.580
Hey man, I'm Brian Brushwood
from The Modern Rogue.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.820
You watched The Modern Rogue, right?

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.140
Please watch The Modern Rogue.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.400
If you don't, you should.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.420
Brian is out here because he wanted
to know more about the hydro dipping

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.940
we showed you in a previous video.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.220
Yeah, specifically,
can you do it with electronics?

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.380
And how well does it work?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.260
We're gonna be trying that out today.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.800
DJI has sent us
a Mavic Air to use in our videos.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.900
And while it does look pretty cool
just the way it comes out of the box,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.980
we thought we could
spruce it up a little bit.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.780
All right.
So what's the first step, per se?

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.660
The first step is that we need to get a box

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.779
or some kind of container
that can hold water,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.720
and then, we need to fill it with water,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.560
which we've already done.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.380
We've got a big old tub full of water.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.760
You know water's heavy?

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.420
It turns out.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.620
It out turns out,
especially if you have a lot of it.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.540
That's the first step.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.399
All right, so we got a bunch of water
and I said we're gonna dip it in,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.160
and what you need a layer of paint on top
and it just wraps around like magic?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.260
Yes! Exactly.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.140
It is a lot like magic.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.760
You need to make sure that your surface
that you're trying to paint is well prepped.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.160
And then, you add paint into the water,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.680
It forms nice little sheet.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.559
And as slowly lower whatever you're 
painting down throught it into the water,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.580
all of that color gets added
on to whatever you're trying to color.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.299
In the last video, what we did is
we made sort of bull's-eyes with the paint.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.580
Always spraying one color
inside the other color.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.740
And it does make
a really cool marble pattern,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.700
but I think we wanted to try branching out,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.840
and see what happens
if we spray a little bit more haphazardly.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.900
Can we get a good
camo pattern that way?

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.540
That'll be good.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.581
Now, we're not going to go
for a camo pattern,

00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:28.100
that will perfectly blend
into the landscape around us.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.740
I think what we're going for is going to be

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.960
a combination of a couple
shades of blue, white, and black.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.620
So maybe a bit more
of a snow camo pattern?

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.260
Oh there we go.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.460
Yeah like an arctic Camo.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.200
Yeah.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.720
We don't have a
lot of snow around right now,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.040
but I still think it's going to look good.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.220
What we're actually going to try doing is 
removing just the top case from the Mavic Air.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.880
Of course.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.980
And then we'll paint that.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.580
Perfect.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.820
Now before we throw
paint on our Mavic Air,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.420
I do want to take it for a test flight,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.020
and just drive it around a bit.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.780
See how it works.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.760
You know what this reminds me of is uh,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.420
did you have
Transformers when you're a kid

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.740
and you gated the instructions
to know how to get it to like?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.000
I, I how do I make it a robot?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.840
Right there, it's turning into a,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.140
I hope it turns into Optimus Prime,
but I'm a little doubtful.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.520
These are the landing gear
and the antennas for the drone.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.340
That's clever.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.440
All right. So, the controller I assume, 
these are antennas that go up

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.300
and these things fold,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.200
[gasps]

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.580
There's attachable joysticks!
That's adorable!

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.020
That is awesome!

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.060
Much less likely to break off
while you're transporting it somewhere.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.220
Oh that's perfect.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.680
Uh, and these are handles.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.980
Oh! And of course if you have the DJI app.
DJI app as amazing, right?

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.400
So you connect into the camera view.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.480
There it is. There it is.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.400
Hello!

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.920
Hi!

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.260
Says ready to go.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.760
I'm ready.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.260
I'm going to press
the "Go up" button, take off. Hello.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.960
There we go.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.960
You're airborne.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.120
Look at that!

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.660
Dude, it's astonishingly intuitive.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.760
You wanna test-drive it?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.820
I give a shot.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.340
Can you get it into the dome?

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.780
This is so ominous!

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.360
This is straight from the future!

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.000
Man, even in the breeze.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does pretty well.
&gt;&gt; It's decently windy out here.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.500
But it's doing pretty good.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.760
It's got personality.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.980
I feel like it needs
a cute name like QV7.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.740
The design reminds me
a little bit of those portal centuries.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.680
I am, I trying to land on that?

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.420
Boo, boy.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.220
It's a little sketchy.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.300
I'm down.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.400
Pretty sure is to land well.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.540
That was like a scariest angry bees 
landing on my head,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.700
that I've never experienced.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.100
&gt;&gt; Oh my! That's amazing!
&gt;&gt; A swarm of one drone coming at you.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.980
That thing is,
that precision is awesome.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.140
That's pretty nut
especially with the amount of wind,

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.060
we've got out here.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.120
It was still able to
stabilize himself pretty well,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.540
and fly around just where we wanted it.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.160
Dude, that's great!

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.200
Love this thing.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.760
Let's potentially break it.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.320
I don't want to just start spraying willy-nilly
and then dip something in.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.900
I want to have at least an idea
of what we're going to be going for.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.400
So...

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.320
I think wanted to make it like, oh
you're saying do your tests?

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.820
Do tests!

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.180
Of course, of course! Yes. Yes.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.160
I got white bowls
that we can just hit these with primer.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.660
Yep.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.980
They should take the paint the same way
and then we can just try a whole different

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.240
spray patterns, until we figure out
something that'll work.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.760
Let's dig in.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.240
You have music for this part?

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.980
It's helpful.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.800
You didn't mention there would be 
an athletic component.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.120
Yeah I forgot.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.140
Oh my shoulders.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.220
Isn't that Dreamcast game
that you played the Maracas for?

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.840
Must have missed that one.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.020
I didn't play a lot of green caps.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.820
Most people didn't.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.040
Get ready in the comments.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.320
They'll remember.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.000
Let's give it a shot.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.140
It was not mixed up enough,
then we can just keep shaking them.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.240
Well, what do you want to do?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.160
Do you want to try
doing the rings that we did before?

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.020
And see how that goes?

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.840
Yeah, let's start with that.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.280
Um, white.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.340
See that pattern coming along?

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.160
Dude, that looks great!

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.040
Does it look cool?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.400
We just do this?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.760
Do we have to paint anything?

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.560
All right,
that's a pretty cool pattern.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.100
&gt;&gt; Now, it's going to close it a little bit.
&gt;&gt; Dude, that's great art!

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.640
&gt;&gt; But it collapses back on itself.
&gt;&gt; So, we can now take the bowl.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.580
Let's just lower this down
through this part over here. Oop.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.380
&gt;&gt; It's like a tie-dye.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.280
&gt;&gt; I kind of dropped the bowl a little bit,
but a little down,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.740
and then, just sort of shake it all off.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.640
So it doesn't stick to it
on the way back up.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.450
All right where I where I dropped it.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.900
We had a little bit of an issue
it hit too hard and fast

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.520
but all around the outside,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.440
Look at those swirl patterns
like isn't that pretty freaking cool?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.520
Yeah, it's almost I guess all we want
is it for it to be a little bit patchier, right?

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.020
All right.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.480
Let's try going less this time.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.500
So fewer Rings we'll just go with through
us.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.520
You know what we've got a few times
will have smaller amount of paint.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.320
Let's stop there.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.320
Let's see what happens.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.920
So there's definitely
a lot less going on.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.060
It's not so busy this time.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.470
Let's like a tie-dye more or like camel.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.480
We just shake it around in there,
separate it out.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.240
Oh, that looks great!

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.590
&gt;&gt; Look at that.
&gt;&gt; That looks like camouflage.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.340
How about we try
instead of just spraying it in circles.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.180
We get a little more fast and loose with it.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.020
We we just kind of spray around
in some snakes see what happens there.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.640
All right.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.300
I like snakes.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.120
Said no one ever.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.980
That looks neat.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.600
Yeah.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.760
Okay. So, this is having
just a couple of bands now.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.840
We have a lot more a lot more chaos in there.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.100
Definitely some chaos.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.100
I'm liking this.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.080
What do you think about using less of a black?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.300
&gt;&gt; I feel like that would give us more...
&gt;&gt; shorter shots with the black?

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.640
black can be overpowering.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.680
Oh, this feels right.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.600
Too much white.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.760
I don't know.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.420
I kind of like that.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.920
Yeah?

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.420
Yeah.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.480
I mean this is the most concentrated spot
and then it did hit a white patch.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.280
So what do you think,
you like the banding or do you like the chaos?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.840
I like the banding more.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.540
I like it a little bit more open.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.700
Maybe not quite so open.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.760
Is that one where you only
had like a few layers of rings.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.360
Yeah.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.640
But this is looking pretty good to me.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.580
Yeah.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.940
So here compare these,
these all feel like art.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.960
This one looks the most camouflage.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.840
It does look pretty good.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.400
Just sort of a natural chaos.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.720
Okay we've got a good strategy.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.200
So let's pop the top off,
add some tape to protect the inside,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.100
and then hit the outside with some primer.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.080
of these patterns, which one are we try
and closest to emulate?

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.200
I like this.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.020
Yeah.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.120
This one we do want
a little bit of the black.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.870
This one I really like
and I think we got some of this splattering

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.650
by getting down close to the water

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.270
and yeah it would spread out a little
so, I think that's going to be our goal

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.440
plenty of the light blue which I think I have,
light on the black

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.200
and medium of the other two,
of the white and the dark blue.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.060
All right, you ready?

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:54.760
Yes sir.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.360
All right.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.060
I think we're good.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.463
What looks like
the best spot to you?

00:08:05.463 --> 00:08:06.620
I want to see this Syria
right over there.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.120
That right there?

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.860
All right here goes.
We're going for that area right there.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.100
We get one shot.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.200
You got it! You got it!

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.580
Go dig, dig, dig!

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.840
So we can go
all the way under.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.040
The drama.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.640
The drama's killing me.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.380
Oh!! That looks fantastic!

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.360
We nailed it.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.640
Dude, that looks great!

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.900
That looks excellent.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.620
Oh, we got, we got not too much black,
plenty of the light blue, some of the splattering.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.500
That's what I was hoping for.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.720
You got like this ocean wave design.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.740
Yeah. Swirls of
the white coming in.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.760
I am loving it.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.160
It looks like
the surface of frozen Jupiter man.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:43.980
That's awesome.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.340
Let's just add a shot of clear coat,
let that dry a bit,

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.940
peel off the tape on the back,

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.120
and we should be good
to reinstall this bad boy.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.240
So we need in this studio
is a disembodied hand

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.200
that I can just stick tape to.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.740
this is officially
the coolest looking DJI Mavic Air.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.720
In production. Not even in production.
just custom made for us,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.400
by us.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.880
Brian,
how do you feel about our drone?

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.440
Better than we deserve! 
We're artists and didn't even know it.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.570
That looks so good.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.880
I love this color scheme.
It goes so well with the colors

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.320
already part of this
We've got the black and white,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.140
that make up the body and the propellers.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.740
The two different 
Hues of blue really make a difference as well

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.360
that little bit of splatter makes
it look other words.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.860
Everything just pops, super nice! Very cool.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.450
Brian, for those of our viewers not familiar,

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.200
Tell me about your channel,
The Modern Rogue.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.320
Dude, me
and my buddy Jason Murphy are at quest,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.090
to become the 
ultimate gentleman Warrior and scoundrel.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.300
We get up to the hijinks and shenanigans,

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.081
almost everything's
held together with duct tape.

00:09:50.081 --> 00:09:51.020
It's a lot of fun!

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.860
Guys, it's a great channel
go check it out new videos every Friday.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.360
Yeah!

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.774
Mad science to magic tricks.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.950
You ever notice that like airplanes
but they make them camouflaged?

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.410
It's like uh, you're supposed to think
those are trees up there?

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.760
You would think they
would paint them blue.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:04.900
Planes?

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.640
Yeah.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.176
Paint the bottom blue
and then the top you paint,

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.900
&gt;&gt; just sort of like the colors of the ground.
&gt;&gt; Camel.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.700
Maybe the top could be camel,
cases a higher plane.
