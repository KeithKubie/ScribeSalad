00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.490
So, I told you earlier that sometimes
you might be the end user of your

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.939
own documentation.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.900
I'm here with Art,
director of engineering here at Udacity.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.660
So Art, tell me a horror story.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.662
Tell me a time when you're
really kicking yourself for

00:00:11.662 --> 00:00:13.720
not writing documentation.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.900
&gt;&gt; That's a good question, Walter.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.656
Feedbacks, early in my career.

00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:20.147
I was doing a project for

00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:24.408
a very sort of conservative stuffy
investment bank on Wall Street.

00:00:24.408 --> 00:00:28.555
And I was doing the support
screen that comes up like,

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:32.409
if somebody that's using
the app needs help.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.990
They click help and
it comes up with a phone number.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.770
But we didn't yet have the phone number,
so like a placeholder phone number.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.367
But I forgot to put in the read me,

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:43.288
that somebody needed to update
that before they shipped it.

00:00:43.288 --> 00:00:46.778
So I just put in the first
thing that popped into my mind,

00:00:46.778 --> 00:00:51.556
which was 1-900 of the name of
the company, we'll say, ABC-4EVA.

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:53.476
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; 4EVA, right?

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:54.256
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:57.840
&gt;&gt; And I shipped it, I collect my fee,
don't think anything of it.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.680
Six months later, I get this frantic
call from the project manager.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.280
Freaking out because one of their
customers had called the number,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.872
nobody ever updated the help number.

00:01:05.872 --> 00:01:08.272
This guy calls me up and he's like,

00:01:08.272 --> 00:01:12.758
why did you put an adult 900 number
on the help screen of our app?

00:01:12.758 --> 00:01:16.180
Because I had forgotten to document
that it was just a placeholder and

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.657
somebody in Utah updated it.

00:01:17.657 --> 00:01:20.914
[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; No, God.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:26.893
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's not even a true story.

00:01:26.893 --> 00:01:31.090
[LAUGH] You'd never do
something like that, right?

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.030
&gt;&gt; I know, I know.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.730
Yeah, I would never.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.436
&gt;&gt; What is-

00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:38.636
[MUSIC]

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:39.910
&gt;&gt; I'm future Walter, and

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.828
I completely agree with
everything you just said, Art.

00:01:42.828 --> 00:01:45.417
Present Walter over here forgot
to document the code on some

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:47.189
of the projects we've been working on.

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.950
And now, we can't seem to
remember what we were thinking.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.801
&gt;&gt; Walter, I'm so disappointed.

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:55.681
[MUSIC]

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.450
&gt;&gt; Take a look at some of
your own older projects.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.280
Can you remember everything that you
were thinking when you were writing

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.480
that code.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.448
Wouldn't it be helpful to have a handy
reference of all the decisions that

00:02:05.448 --> 00:02:06.181
past you made.
