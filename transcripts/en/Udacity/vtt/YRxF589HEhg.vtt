00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.710
Well, we're really happy that you came here today. you

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.290
know that you're part of a group of five individuals who

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.950
are participating in our genomics course. And we're here to

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.190
sort of spotlight your personal stories. And you've been selected and agreed

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.340
to participate with us because you have a very interesting

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.330
story and background. Because you are adopted. So what I'd like

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.100
for you to do if you can is just walk us

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.490
through a little bit. Tell us tell us where you're from.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.530
What, what your name is? Where you're from? Where

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.880
you grew up? And you know when you found

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.159
out that you were adopted for the first time

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.790
and sort of how, how that made you feel?

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.790
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'm Sterling Tadlock and I grew

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.920
up in eastern North Carolina in a really

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.140
small rural community. About 50 minutes southeast of

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.780
Raleigh in a little town called Grantham. I

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.245
was raised as an only child, my dad was a sheriff's deputy, my mom was a

00:00:55.245 --> 00:01:00.640
stay-at-home mom. we lived a pretty country, rural life. you

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.720
know, we never really traveled outside of the state. and I grew

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.830
up as an only child thinking my parents were my real parents which I still

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.004
classify them as my real parents but yeah,

00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:19.510
I didn't really think, think anything about it until I got a little bit

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.830
older and sort of realized that, you know, I don't really look like my parents.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.845
&gt;&gt; How old were you when that happened?

00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:30.740
&gt;&gt; I was probably, you know, probably 11, 12, when

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.290
I sort of noticed, you know, my parents, have different body shapes than me,

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:43.820
I'm sort of tall, slender, they're not.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.646
&gt;&gt; hmm.

00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:48.700
&gt;&gt; And I always just sort of wondered, you know, why is

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.232
that? And sort of just put it to the back of my mind.

00:01:53.232 --> 00:01:53.624
&gt;&gt; hmm.

00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:57.980
&gt;&gt; Although I did notice that my friends, parents, and

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.490
their siblings looked more similar than I looked to my parents.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.214
&gt;&gt; hmm.

00:02:02.214 --> 00:02:03.475
&gt;&gt; But again, I didn't really question it,

00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:04.830
because I didn't really think anything of it.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.450
&gt;&gt; Did anyone else ever point that out to you?

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.090
&gt;&gt; You know, not that I remember I cannot, I can't remember

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.970
my parent, any one, any of my friends pointing that out. That I

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.070
looked a lot different than my parents. But, you know, there was

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.100
love and warmth in the family, and so. That sort of was secondary

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.260
&gt;&gt; Did you know of anyone else in

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.110
your family, extended or otherwise that had been adopted?

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.680
Or did you have any other kinds of interactions? Did you know

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.580
anyone else, either in or outside of your family that had been adopted?

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.560
&gt;&gt; actually I had a distant cousin that had.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.220
been adopted by their grandparents. so, it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.440
wasn't as far, you know, removed as I am from my real parents, biologically.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.880
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.210
&gt;&gt; but

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.960
that was really the only exposure I

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.920
had. I never really understood, you know, growing

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.280
up, what adopted meant, just because. Sex is

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.790
not talked about a lot in eastern North

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.580
Carolina and the understanding of you know.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.530
Where you come from from your biological parents

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.410
wasn't really ever brought up, so the concept

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.200
of being adopted also was never brought up.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.300
&gt;&gt; So, how old were you

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.350
when you finally actually sort of figured it

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.780
out or someone talked to you about it?

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.700
So it's a really investing story. I was 14 and like most people in eastern North

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.560
Carolina I was raised in the church. The

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.230
church was a big facet in everyone's life,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.280
and I went to sunday school one day.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.270
I was 14 and coincidentally it was father's day.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.470
&gt;&gt; Hmm.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.470
&gt;&gt; And,

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.170
in church that day, Sunday school lesson

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.320
the teacher was talking about how, whenever

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.010
you become adopted or whenever you become

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.410
a Christian, you become adopted into God's family.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.330
And, he then looked at me then said, so, why don't you tell the class

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.702
what it feels like to be adopted, Sterling. And that sort of struck me

00:04:09.702 --> 00:04:09.840
[LAUGH]

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.880
because I, I had never heard that I was

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.370
adopted before. Like I said, I thought that, you know.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.440
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.500
&gt;&gt; I look a little bit different than

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.390
my parents and but then I saw pictures of

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.340
me as a baby with my parents and so. You know? I just thought about it. And I

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.240
was, like, no. I can't be adopted. And I

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.810
remember there was a, a girl, a distant cousin

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.470
of mine. Who said, Sterling's not adopted. those are

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.230
his real parents. And so, I sort of squashed

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.240
it in church. Although there was this rumbling anxiety within me.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.100
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.740
&gt;&gt; And then I went to the sermon portion of church. And I sat between

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.870
my grandmother, whom I refer to as MeMaw. And, my mama on the other side.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.903
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:47.903 --> 00:04:50.827
&gt;&gt; And, I leaned over to my MeMaw, and I was

00:04:50.827 --> 00:04:54.220
like, so, am I adopted? And she didn't look at me.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.930
She looked, kept looking straight at the pulpit, and she's like,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.250
you're going to have to ask your mother about that. and so

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.250
then I turned to my mama and I was like, so, I heard in Sunday school that I'm

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.210
adopted. And she's like well you are, and I

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.703
just sort of froze right there in the pew. And

00:05:11.703 --> 00:05:14.582
[COUGH]

00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:17.400
I just was in shock. I, I didn't really react at

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.510
first, and then I just started tearing up and crying and stood

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.640
up and just sort of left the church. We, I ran out

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.780
into the kitchen and. My mother and grandmother followed me in there.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.500
&gt;&gt; What was going through your mind? Why, why, why were you upset?

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.450
What was, did you know what was making you upset about the time?

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.950
&gt;&gt;

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.290
It was mainly that, you know, my concept

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.820
of what, who my parents were, and their relatedness

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.600
to me. Was different than what I originally

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.960
had thought of, like they weren't my biological parents.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.165
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:52.410
&gt;&gt; And, then secondary to that, there, I

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.690
had biological parents out there that I didn't know.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.435
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:55.435 --> 00:05:57.640
&gt;&gt; And, then along with that was the whole like,

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.130
me not knowing until the age of 14 like having

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.350
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.330
&gt;&gt; This perception that, you know. The mother and father

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.470
that I grew up with were not my biological ones.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.020
&gt;&gt; So did you feel instantaneously more distant

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.820
from them, or was this more of a.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.030
&gt;&gt; It was a mixture, in that moment it was a mixture of shock, anxiety

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:22.300
sort of sadness I also felt. And felt this guilt,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.470
that my reaction would in some way make my mother and father

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.470
that I grew up with, whom I refer to as my

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.360
real parents, them. I would make them sad by being sad,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.680
which is something I think a lot of

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.840
adopted children go through. And it's a common

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.990
thing that I've had, like, emotionally, when I

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.540
sort of questioned who my biological parents are.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.843
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:47.843 --> 00:06:50.550
&gt;&gt; I think it's one of the, sort

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.035
of, disadvantages, in a way, of being adopted. Is,

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.720
this notion of survivor's guilt, where there's a big disaster,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.470
this is where the term came from originally, I believe. There's

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.810
a big disaster, and those that survive the disaster feel

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.940
guilty because they're not the ones that have been injured or

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.010
killed. And when you're adopted, you feel like, I was

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.350
chosen you know, by my parents, but there are plenty of

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.400
other people who are still in the foster care system

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.780
who weren't adopted. And you feel like you should be grateful,

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.500
you know, that you were adopted. And you should

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.170
be thankful everyday that you live, that you have a

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.360
family that, you know, raised you and supported you, and,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.810
and, I am thankful. But, you know anytime I question

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.710
being adopted. Who my biological parents are,

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.912
that's like a twinge of guilt, sort of.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.080
&gt;&gt; It sounds like a lot of pressure

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.900
to sort of have to feel. Especially, initially, I'm

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.100
sure you end up dealing with it. Everyone

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.220
deals with it in their own way over time.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and my own personal temperament probably plays

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.290
into it. Like I I, as you know, I'm a

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.130
psychiatrist and I sort of am really in touch,

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.550
or try to be with not only my own emotions,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.530
but other people's. Like, that's sort of what I do as my livelihood is

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.340
help people who are dealing with a

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.140
lot of psychological stress. And pathology and.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:14.215
&gt;&gt; hmm.

00:08:14.215 --> 00:08:17.425
&gt;&gt; and so I'm sort of sensitive to

00:08:17.425 --> 00:08:21.152
those sort of feelings of guilt and stress and

00:08:21.152 --> 00:08:23.326
&gt;&gt; Sure, you mentioned that this was

00:08:23.326 --> 00:08:25.810
sort of a disadvantage. You sort of discover

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.570
it and they're sort of this, this guilt you have to deal with, but can

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.740
you speak more about some of the other, are there any advantages

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.070
of being adopted and you know, is there, is there anything good that

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.580
comes from, sort of being in that scenario, did you find, where you

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:45.780
fortune, fortunate in any way or did you feel lucky in some sense?

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.180
&gt;&gt; I did, you know, probably, I don't know if it's

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.100
obvious or not but. Being adopted, you, you obviously were chosen

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:00.250
by two individuals, I guess it could be one, who want to raise

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:05.410
you, and, you know, who actively want to be, you to be a part of their lives,

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:10.000
and who want to, you know, surround you with their love, and their support and

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.110
their caring. Whereas not that biological parents

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:20.380
don't have that same feeling, but, sometimes you

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.200
know biological children just sort of happen I would imagine.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.685
And there's not this rigorous active progress, process, not that.

00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:33.164
You know, there's a very rigorous process in adopting an

00:09:33.164 --> 00:09:36.516
individual and you know, in the fact that I was chosen.

00:09:36.516 --> 00:09:37.148
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.

00:09:37.148 --> 00:09:41.090
&gt;&gt; And there's several other people who weren't you know, makes

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.420
me thankful that, that I was. obviously the advantage of being

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.700
able to be in a. Supportive, loving home.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.370
&gt;&gt; Sure. How did that make you think

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.590
about your biological parents once you discovered this

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.540
information? What was going through your mind about,

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.750
you know, the scenario in which you found yourself?

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.840
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.060
&gt;&gt; Did you have a lot of questions?

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.510
of fantasy that goes on with, you know, who

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:10.630
they could be, like are they like me? Do they act like me? Do they talk like me?

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.750
What are their professions? Like, what if it's

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.190
like, you know, I remember when I was a

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.660
teenager, like what if it's like some European like

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.490
royal family who like ships their child off to

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.200
North Carolina and was reared by, you know, some

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.930
really awesome southern parent. that obviously came to mind.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.630
Also, like what if they're in jail or, you

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.450
know, you know, not even alive? Like, you know,

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.950
that, that came into mind. So I was just

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.800
always curious as to what they were, what they were

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.620
like. and also, what was the situation that led

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.630
them to having to put up a child for adoption?

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.100
&gt;&gt; Okay. so, what kind of questions do you have

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.380
now as an adult? how interested are you in, you

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.890
know, the, the idea that you're adopted and you know

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.470
you have biological family. You may or may not know or

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.820
think that they are alive or anywhere close by, but,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.080
what kind of questions do you have about those ideas now?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.500
&gt;&gt; About my biological parents?

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt;

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.370
I still wonder like, what were the circumstances that

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.510
led them to, you know, you know, making the decision

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.290
to put me up for adoption. I'm also just

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.760
sort of curious about their lives, what are they like?

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.170
if I have any siblings or not, I mean, that's always

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:34.670
a question of mine. if there are any health considerations. You

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.750
know, there's a lot of health diseases, medical diseases have a

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:43.100
huge genetic component, and like, knowing that information is important to me,

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.810
And just sort of what their outlook on life is

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.930
now that they have an individual that's being raised by

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.540
other people. Like, do they ever think about me? Do

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.360
they ever wonder how I'm doing or what I'm up to?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.920
&gt;&gt; Sure. What do you know about your actual adoption story?

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.300
Do you, you have any information about what actually did happen?

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.270
&gt;&gt; So after I found out I was

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.610
adopted, I sort of dropped, dropped it for awhile,

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:15.590
because I had this incredible sense of guilt that I should be thankful,

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.320
and I should be happy with what I have. And that I shouldn't, you

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.310
know, pursue things that may hurt my parents' feelings. so, I sort of

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:28.230
left it alone until I went to college. When I was in college, I

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.010
thought well I should, you know, try to

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.880
find out some information because it might be interesting

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.380
to know sort of, what information is out

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.390
there, knowing that it's probably limited. So I contacted

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.960
the department of social services in Wayne county,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.460
and it took a month or two for me

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.510
to get these paper documents that basically set

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:55.270
the files close which means that the my biolo,

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.760
biological parents did not want to have

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.460
any communication with me after putting me up

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.830
for adoption. They wanted to sort of be a closed file, but they did have some

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.950
generic health information they entered in. And nothing about my biological

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:14.710
father. My biological mother was 19 she was in community college.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:20.848
She really liked art she liked swimming, she was like

00:13:20.848 --> 00:13:28.000
five four, had auburn hair. and it said that my, her great aunt

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.780
had breast cancer, I believe. And someone in the family had diabetes and

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.090
&gt;&gt; How did it make you feel to find that, even that little bit of information?

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:43.795
&gt;&gt; It, it you know just made me more curious.

00:13:43.795 --> 00:13:45.920
because I know that there's so much more of a.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.312
So many more facets of their story and their livelihood and

00:13:48.312 --> 00:13:51.340
those are just few answers, and then hair color and height.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:51.810
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.230
&gt;&gt; And it made me more curious about what they were like.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.730
&gt;&gt; Did you feel a connection to any

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.190
of the traits you discovered about your biological mom?

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.815
&gt;&gt; well, I have auburn hair.

00:14:00.815 --> 00:14:01.110
[LAUGH]

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:05.080
That's sort of the closest thing. I guess I'm into

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.080
art somewhat, I like music, but. that's really it. It,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.690
the document was sort of sterile in the information it

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.460
presented. So I didn't find that much of a connection.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.350
&gt;&gt; Sure. Have you ever thought about trying

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.410
to, to find a, a, a bigger connection?

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:26.720
&gt;&gt; I have. you know The

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.710
other avenues that I could pursue to

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.620
find out who my biological parents are right

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.720
now all I've known about was perusing

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.510
the adoption detective agencies. I'm not really sure

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.940
what the formal name of them are. But they're quite expensive and I just have

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.630
never had the. The time or the financial

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.930
resources to to pursue that. but, I'm sort

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.340
of open to going through that avenue later on in life.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.900
&gt;&gt; Sure, and of course, I know

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.610
because you're a, you're a medical doctor you're

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.730
a psychiatrist. You're familiar with what, you

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.950
know, modern technology can do as far as

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.800
DNA results. And, you know as part

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.340
of participation we've offered you an opportunity to

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:15.370
actually submit a DNA sample and find out

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.250
you know, if there, in the 23andMe program

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.160
if you might find any. Genetic relatives of

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.931
yours. What are your thoughts surrounding that? You've,

00:15:25.931 --> 00:15:29.058
you've submitted your DNA, you've submitted your sample,

00:15:29.058 --> 00:15:32.626
but you haven't seen your results yet. You

00:15:32.626 --> 00:15:34.498
know what are some thoughts going into that

00:15:34.498 --> 00:15:36.630
about participating in a program like that, and

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.346
what you expect to see, what you expect

00:15:38.346 --> 00:15:41.220
to find, and how that might make you feel?

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.470
&gt;&gt; You know, to be honest, I haven't thought about

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:46.490
it too much. Because, again that fantasy

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:50.670
play of, you know, finding my biological parents,

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.840
like finding the DNA that may match with

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.670
mine and seeing what percentage the similarities are.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:16:00.250
And, being able to contact them. I don't

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.840
want to disappoint myself, because I know that

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.940
the. The highest likelihood is that there's probably

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.525
going to be some distant, distant cousin that has

00:16:08.525 --> 00:16:13.400
similar DNA to me. So, I'm not really putting a whole lot of stock into it

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.440
as far as finding somebody. But I am

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.620
interesting in seeing, you know, the other facets of

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:24.060
my DNA that 23andMe will sort of elucidate, such as risk

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:29.500
for medical diseases and pharmacological sort of

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.650
ability to metabolize drugs and to respond to them, I think that's a part of it.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:39.860
And, just generic ancestry stuff, that's mainly what I'm looking

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:45.350
forward to seeing, but again, like, anything's possible, so. If, if something

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.230
were to come up it would shock me you know, and

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.310
I am sure I would have a, a variety of emotions.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.690
but I haven't really thought about it too much. I am

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.310
going to like go through and sort of see what all

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.620
information is there I'm not sort of block it because if

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.080
it's there it's there and I want to know about it but.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.140
&gt;&gt; Do you think in your current state of mind if

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.329
you were to find, let's say, you know, let's just say,

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:13.069
a cousin or more, you know? Third, second cousin or someone

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:18.060
even more related? Do you think you are interested in possibly making

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.640
a connection with that person and maybe reaching out

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.329
to explore more, and, and maybe even meet them.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:28.290
&gt;&gt; That's a tough one. I, I'm not

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:33.850
sure. I don't know what all I would gain from

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:38.230
contacting someone that's any more further out than grandparents

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:43.240
or first cousins. Just because. You know, I'm worried

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.750
that it would opens doors to, I'm

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.390
actually not sure. I haven't really thought about

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.010
it, of trying to contact those people. I

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.850
think if it were like my biological parents

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.590
or siblings or grandparents, I would. But I

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.140
don't know because. They may not know, because it would

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.640
sort of open a doorway to possibly some drama where I

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.910
said, hey I'm an adopted individual and I'm your second

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:14.300
cousin and then they try to like contact all their relatives

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.260
to figure out who in their family's put someone up

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.830
for adoption. And that person may not want their whole family

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.460
to know that they had a kid and had to put

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:25.803
him up for adoption. I don't know if I want to expose

00:18:25.803 --> 00:18:29.460
an unknown individual to that kind of sordid drama.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.240
&gt;&gt; Sure. what,

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.270
do you know anything about any blood relatives

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.980
at all? Do you have other, so, besides

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.530
your mom, there's no knowledge, you don't know

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.750
of anyone else that you're genetically related to currently?

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.720
&gt;&gt; I don't know of anything substantial. There's always been

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.600
speculation in the community that, this person in a far

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.850
off part of North Carolina may be related to me

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.080
because they look similar to me or act similar to me

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:08.460
but, nothing substantial, as far as blood relatives. it would be

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.390
interesting if they were in North Carolina but I'm not sure.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.440
&gt;&gt; And, sort of, just sort of wrap up pretty soon

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.460
here. let's say you participate in 23andMe and you do find

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.400
something and it's closer, you may find a relative that's closer

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.330
than second cousin, you may have whatever feelings you have about it.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.330
what are your thoughts around your adopted family, your,

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.400
as you call them your real parents What do you

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.250
think, how do you think they feel about this or

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.920
you connecting, or just what are your feelings surrounding that?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.560
&gt;&gt; I feel a little bit better about,

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.030
when, since, since the first time that I found

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.010
I was adopted to this current point in time,

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.340
we've talked about it here and there. And they've

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.780
sorted of openly admitted they would be fine with

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.580
me going out trying to find my biological parents,

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.210
they said if they were in my position they

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.090
would want to know. You know, if there was

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:06.020
someone that was biologically related to them, they said that that curiosity is

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:11.210
something that they don't think they could sort of push, push aside.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:18.570
and they don't feel you know at all, like they're less

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.990
appreciated for what they've done for me or

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.970
feel like I love them any less. which

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.880
I don't because they did raise me. So,

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.570
but you know, there's always going to be a tinge

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:34.600
of that sort of survivor guilt or whatever.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.480
that I'm always going to have. But I don't think

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.980
it'll impede me from trying to contact. Or,

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.660
pursue some sort of connection, if there is one.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.910
&gt;&gt; Are

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.810
you excited to see your 23andMe resuts?

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.530
&gt;&gt; I am, I am. I've been holding out, they've

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.820
actually been available for a little bit now, but, for the

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:56.280
purposes of the interview I've, sort of held back. I'm waiting

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.975
on the edge of my seat to see what they say.

00:20:57.975 --> 00:20:58.975
&gt;&gt;

00:20:57.975 --> 00:20:59.060
[LAUGH]

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.620
Well, I hope that they're good results, no matter what

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.090
that may be, and. We'll see what kinds of, you

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.370
know, feelings and emotions, and where you are, we'll give

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.080
you a chance to look at those results and see what

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.120
they are and we'll let you come back hopefully and

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.480
talk to us a bit about what you found out. And

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.990
at the very least, you know, we'll talk about deep

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.800
ancestry and lineages, some of the health risks, but also hopefully,

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.660
maybe even some relative connections.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.620
&gt;&gt; We'll see. We'll see, I'll stay hopeful
