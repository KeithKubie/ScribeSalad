00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.860
they grab a fly and they're like yeah
this was six years ago because of the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870
this was six years ago because of the
 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.000
this was six years ago because of the
juices on the wings

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010
juices on the wings
 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.430
juices on the wings
I think it's B there's like a bunch of

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440
I think it's B there's like a bunch of
 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.170
I think it's B there's like a bunch of
factors like one of them is the dirt

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180
factors like one of them is the dirt
 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.539
factors like one of them is the dirt
that's around where they fry it like if

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549
that's around where they fry it like if
 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.979
that's around where they fry it like if
they find it on the ground then it's

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989
they find it on the ground then it's
 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.390
they find it on the ground then it's
covered with dirt over hundreds and

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400
covered with dirt over hundreds and
 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.949
covered with dirt over hundreds and
hundreds of years they could take some

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959
hundreds of years they could take some
 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.550
hundreds of years they could take some
of that dirt and test it yeah it's in it

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560
of that dirt and test it yeah it's in it
 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.900
of that dirt and test it yeah it's in it
they they're trying to test

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910
they they're trying to test
 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.539
they they're trying to test
I think whoa that's crazy I want those

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549
I think whoa that's crazy I want those
 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.550
I think whoa that's crazy I want those
as earrings is that a fish hook yeah

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560
as earrings is that a fish hook yeah
 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.470
as earrings is that a fish hook yeah
that click do that's how the showers yo

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480
that click do that's how the showers yo
 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.620
that click do that's how the showers yo
those are fresh those are really nice I

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630
those are fresh those are really nice I
 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.500
those are fresh those are really nice I
would rock those would you yeah a story

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510
would rock those would you yeah a story
 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.599
would rock those would you yeah a story
oldest fishhook found in Okinawa Wow

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609
oldest fishhook found in Okinawa Wow
 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.759
oldest fishhook found in Okinawa Wow
twenty-three thousand years ago that's

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769
twenty-three thousand years ago that's
 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:18.390
twenty-three thousand years ago that's
crazy

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400
crazy
 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.680
crazy
and so they're saying that the oldest

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690
and so they're saying that the oldest
 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.719
and so they're saying that the oldest
fish hook is linked to the Norwegians I

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729
fish hook is linked to the Norwegians I
 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.790
fish hook is linked to the Norwegians I
would say Japanese this says Okinawa

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800
would say Japanese this says Okinawa
 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.330
would say Japanese this says Okinawa
yeah

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340
yeah
 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.980
yeah
Norwegian thing was saying that and up

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990
Norwegian thing was saying that and up
 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.779
Norwegian thing was saying that and up
until the 1950 is their word they were

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789
until the 1950 is their word they were
 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.679
until the 1950 is their word they were
still using wood and Oh

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:29.689
still using wood and Oh
 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.019
still using wood and Oh
like a added fact yeah japanese makes

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:32.029
like a added fact yeah japanese makes
 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:33.759
like a added fact yeah japanese makes
sense when if they all figured it out

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:33.769
sense when if they all figured it out
 

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:35.619
sense when if they all figured it out
the same time different spots in the

world you know whether it's one of those

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:37.279
world you know whether it's one of those
 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:39.459
world you know whether it's one of those
things like you know I think there's

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:39.469
things like you know I think there's
 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:41.319
things like you know I think there's
this some weird thing who's that is that

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:41.329
this some weird thing who's that is that
 

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:42.789
this some weird thing who's that is that
Rupert Sheldrake it's the morphic

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:42.799
Rupert Sheldrake it's the morphic
 

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.409
Rupert Sheldrake it's the morphic
resonance theory he's got this weird

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419
resonance theory he's got this weird
 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.839
resonance theory he's got this weird
theory that I think the idea is that if

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849
theory that I think the idea is that if
 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.839

some rat learns a maze on the East Coast

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849
some rat learns a maze on the East Coast
 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.209
some rat learns a maze on the East Coast
rats on the West Coast will learn that

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:52.219
rats on the West Coast will learn that
 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.499
rats on the West Coast will learn that
maze quicker what Wow like a like a they

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509
maze quicker what Wow like a like a they
 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.359
maze quicker what Wow like a like a they
don't know the collective consciousness

00:04:58.359 --> 00:04:58.369
don't know the collective consciousness
 

00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:00.639
don't know the collective consciousness
amongst the rats as weird as it sounds

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:00.649
amongst the rats as weird as it sounds
 

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:02.889
amongst the rats as weird as it sounds
there might be some sort of strange

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:02.899
there might be some sort of strange
 

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:05.499
there might be some sort of strange
connection that all rats share and not

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509
connection that all rats share and not
 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.929

just all rats but all living beings his
argument was that if this is

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:09.529
argument was that if this is
 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.299
argument was that if this is
demonstratable with a rat in a maze that

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:13.309
demonstratable with a rat in a maze that
 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:15.459

if they did something like with human

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:15.469
if they did something like with human
 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.759
if they did something like with human
beings if they could figure out a way to

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:17.769
beings if they could figure out a way to
 

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:20.109
beings if they could figure out a way to
to prove this that's likely what's

00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:20.119
to prove this that's likely what's
 

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.089
to prove this that's likely what's
happening is that like he brought up a

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099
happening is that like he brought up a
 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:23.729
happening is that like he brought up a
bunch of different factors like

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:23.739
bunch of different factors like
 

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:25.799
bunch of different factors like

00:05:25.799 --> 00:05:25.809
inventions that are simultaneously
 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:28.419
inventions that are simultaneously
taking place like all over the world

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:28.429
taking place like all over the world
 

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:30.639
taking place like all over the world
like what and strange you should

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:30.649
like what and strange you should
 

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:32.289
like what and strange you should
attribute some of that's education right

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:32.299
attribute some of that's education right
 

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:33.729
attribute some of that's education right
like yeah definitely education what's

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:33.739
like yeah definitely education what's
 

00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:35.769
like yeah definitely education what's
going on like that the the trends that

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:35.779
going on like that the the trends that
 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.989
going on like that the the trends that
are happening in education but like but

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:37.999
are happening in education but like but

like on a different realm like if you

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979
like on a different realm like if you
 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.939
like on a different realm like if you
learn if we're all a species and you're

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949
learn if we're all a species and you're
 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:47.229

of the world have like greater access to

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:49.999
of the world have like greater access to
 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.239
of the world have like greater access to
it in some weird way that's really

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:52.249
it in some weird way that's really
 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:54.759
it in some weird way that's really
bizarre
