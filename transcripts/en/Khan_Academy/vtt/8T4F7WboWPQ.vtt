00:00:00.521 --> 00:00:02.919
- [Voiceover] What I would
like to do in this video is

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.843
explore the connection between
the binary number system

00:00:06.843 --> 00:00:08.866
which is clearly, or we've already

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.475
talked about this, is base two.

00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:14.838
Explore the quotient between
that and the hexadecimal,

00:00:14.838 --> 00:00:19.838
hexadecimal number
system, which is base 16.

00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:22.251
The reason why this is interesting is

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:26.408
because 16 is a power of two.

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:28.163
What we'll see is you could always view

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:29.651
the hexadecimal number system.

00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:32.318
It's almost condensed representation

00:00:32.318 --> 00:00:33.788
of the binary number system.

00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:35.503
This is actually why you will actually,

00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:37.609
we've already talked
about the binary system

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.191
is used extensively in computer science

00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:41.905
and in even computer engineering.

00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:44.935
It's the underlying
things that are happening

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:46.969
or it's the representation
used when we talk

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.918
about logic gates and
transistors and things like that.

00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:52.570
But hexadecimal also shows up a lot

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.342
because it's kind of a condensed
representation of base two.

00:00:56.342 --> 00:00:58.181
What do I mean by that?

00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:03.181
Let's write out a arbitrary
number in base two.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.329
Let's say I have one, zero, one, one,

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.329
zero, one, one, one, zero.

00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:16.100
This right over here is in binary

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.759
and I can even write in parenthesis .

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.980
This is a binary representation.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.790
I want to convert this to
hexadecimal representation.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.772
I encourage you to pause the
video and try out in your own.

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:30.756
I'll give you a clue
on how you could think

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:34.066
about converting directly
from base two to base 16.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.437
Think about which one over
here is in the 16s place

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:41.137
and what is the 256 place over here.

00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:44.689
Then that might help you convert directly.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.468
Assuming you had a go at it.

00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:49.970
The really fun thing about
between base two and base 16 is

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.971
you don't have to, well for any
bases, you really don't have

00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:55.852
to go through base 10
but these in particular,

00:01:55.852 --> 00:02:00.114
it's especially easy to go
convert between these two bases.

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:02.258
The realization that you have to make is,

00:02:02.258 --> 00:02:05.923
what are the powers, which
places here are powers of 16?

00:02:05.923 --> 00:02:09.067
This right over here,
that is the ones place.

00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:11.093
One way to think about it
is all of these is going

00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:13.023
to tell you how many ones we have.

00:02:13.023 --> 00:02:16.029
Ones, twos, fours, and eights,

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.302
but another way to think
about it is this is a count

00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:23.302
of ones, all the way up
to a potential of 15 ones.

00:02:25.324 --> 00:02:29.803
This could count, this is
going to be between zero,

00:02:29.803 --> 00:02:32.096
and I'm going to write it down.

00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:34.714
Actually, let me write it down in base 16.

00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:37.019
It's going to be between zero and F.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.988
It's going to be between zero and 15.

00:02:39.988 --> 00:02:42.462
It's kind of a count between the number

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.474
of ones, I guess you could say.

00:02:45.474 --> 00:02:47.202
Then this is the 16s place.

00:02:47.202 --> 00:02:49.939
I'm going to do that in different color.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.914
This right over here is the 16s place.

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:58.479
You could have between zero and 15s, 16s.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.517
This is also going to
be between zero and F,

00:03:01.517 --> 00:03:04.827
when you look at this
four digit binary numbers.

00:03:04.827 --> 00:03:07.005
Once again, this whole
thing right over here is

00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:09.755
essentially going to tell
you how many 16s you have.

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:10.707
This whole thing is going to tell you

00:03:10.707 --> 00:03:13.258
how many ones you have.

00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:15.578
Then the next four, we could keep going,

00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:17.079
although there is only one place here.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.079
We could go, this right
over here is the 256s place.

00:03:22.128 --> 00:03:24.818
This is going to be the next four digits.

00:03:24.818 --> 00:03:26.360
They really have one right over here,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.128
but one, two, three,
and then the fourth one.

00:03:29.128 --> 00:03:34.128
This is also going to be
between zero and 15, 256s.

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:35.584
Hopefully, that helps you a little bit.

00:03:35.584 --> 00:03:37.713
Actually, if this was
a clue, I encourage you

00:03:37.713 --> 00:03:39.157
to pause the video again (laughs) and see

00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:42.173
if you can represent this in hexadecimal.

00:03:42.173 --> 00:03:46.321
Let's try to work this thing together.

00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:47.746
How many ones do we have?

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:48.681
What number is this?

00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:50.458
These four digits right over here.

00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:54.857
This is eight plus four plus two.

00:03:54.857 --> 00:03:59.453
So eight plus four is 12, plus two is 14.

00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:01.916
This right over here is 14.

00:04:01.916 --> 00:04:04.130
How do we represent that in hexadecimal?

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.411
Well, 14 is one less than
15 so it's going to be E.

00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:10.864
This is going to be E.

00:04:10.864 --> 00:04:13.363
This is E.

00:04:13.363 --> 00:04:18.041
E is our hexadecimal
representation of the number 14

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:22.264
comes right before our
representation of the number 15 F.

00:04:22.264 --> 00:04:25.593
Alright, now, how many 16s do we have?

00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:27.028
Let's see, I have no eights.

00:04:27.028 --> 00:04:28.972
I have a four, and I have a two.

00:04:28.972 --> 00:04:31.902
We're going to have six 16s.

00:04:31.902 --> 00:04:35.397
So we're going to have six 16s.

00:04:35.397 --> 00:04:38.075
Then, how many 256s do I have?

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:40.959
I only have one 256.

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:44.268
One 256.

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:47.695
This number in hexadecimal,
and I could write that.

00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:52.695
This is in hexadecimal right
over here, is one, six, E.

00:04:53.514 --> 00:04:56.111
One, six, E.

00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:01.111
I guess you could call this 256 E,

00:05:01.188 --> 00:05:05.639
16 E.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.562
I guess 14.

00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:10.883
I (laughs) finally have to
come up with a better way

00:05:10.883 --> 00:05:12.880
of reading this hexadecimal number.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.293
If you're not curious what
number is this, because you don't

00:05:16.293 --> 00:05:18.356
have to go through decimal
just so you could comprehend it

00:05:18.356 --> 00:05:21.046
in the number system that
you're used to operating in.

00:05:21.046 --> 00:05:23.611
One that's based off from the
number of fingers you have.

00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:26.279
Feel free to do so.
