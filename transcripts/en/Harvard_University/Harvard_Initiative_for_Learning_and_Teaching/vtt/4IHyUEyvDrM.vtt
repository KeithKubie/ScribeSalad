00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.170
Welcome to Emerging Approaches
to Evaluating Learning.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.750
My name is Evan Sanders.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.090
I am the associate director
of curriculum services

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.070
for teaching and
learning technologies

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.630
at Harvard Medical School.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.220
And with me is--

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.970
Josh Bookin.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.830
I'm the associate director--

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.033
assistant director-- I just
gave myself a promotion.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:22.780
Yeah.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.260
The assistant director
of instructional support

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.220
and development at the Teaching
and Learning Lab at HGSE.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.030
So we're really excited
to have this hour

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.280
to think about how
evaluating learning

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.340
is really a critical part
of the feedback loop,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.320
during a day where
we're mostly talking

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.420
about evaluating teaching.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.760
But of course, when we think
about the efficacy of what

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.340
we're doing, we have
to keep evaluating

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.020
learning very much in mind.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.030
And so when Josh and
I thought about how

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.770
we were going to
approach this session,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.820
we were thinking about,
well, what really

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.710
qualifies as an
emerging approach?

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.900
What's sort of inventive
in this context?

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.780
Is it high technology?

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.040
Is it big data?

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.810
Is it novel pedagogy?

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.360
And so, of course, it
can be all of the above.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.490
But rather than have
us stand up here and do

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.054
some boring literature review
about all of those things,

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:16.470
we thought the
best approach would

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.400
be to highlight a couple
people who are here

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.160
at the University, who
are really wrestling

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.180
with a lot of the things that
you were just reflecting upon

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.710
on that intro polling slide.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.960
So with that, I think it
would be good to actually

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.530
just reflect a bit together
on what some of those things

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.720
were that you said.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.030
Can we see that?

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.410
We cannot.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.850
I think it'll pop up.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.558
There.

00:01:42.558 --> 00:01:43.058
OK.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.330
It would be pretty
hard to summarize this,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.120
or to pick specific
themes, but I

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.610
think general themes
that you can see just

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.070
by glancing at this
quickly is that these are

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.450
higher-order considerations.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.260
These are things that we
want to assess about efficacy

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.110
of teaching and learning
that are definitely

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.880
hard to do with what
we might consider

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.630
to be classical
methods of assessment.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.490
And so that's precisely
why we're here today.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.520
So we didn't want to spend
much time on the intro,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.190
so we could get into
the case studies, which

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.220
we have found individually very
rich and thought provoking,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.900
and we hope you will as well.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.240
But we did want to do
two things in this intro.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.960
And one was to think a little
bit about the landscape

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.970
of evaluating learning.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.880
And the other one is to
give a bit of a framework

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.034
with an idea of, we have
these specific cases

00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:43.450
and we want to be
able to abstract

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.970
some general principles
that can be applicable

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.640
to our own context and
to our own practice.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.960
And so that's what we're going
to hope to do in short order.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.550
And so first we wanted to
start with terminology.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.620
And the idea of
evaluation, we were

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.240
trying to figure out, how does
that translate into assessment?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.520
And so for us, we're
thinking about it

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.710
in the session of
evaluating learning

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.160
as similar or synonymous
to summative assessments.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.680
And a common definition
of summative assessment

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.280
is evaluating student
learning at the end

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.720
of some instructional unit.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.520
And so we feel like that's a
good, bite-sizable chunk for us

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.740
to think about here
in our hour together.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.240
We're not, thus,
going to be talking

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.070
about formative
assessment, also very

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.040
important-- ongoing
understanding and checks

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.270
for understanding of
what your students know

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.480
and are able to do.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.760
So with this idea of thinking
about summative assessment,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.920
understanding by
design is a framework

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.810
that we felt as we
talked about these cases,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.710
and I in my own experience
as an instructor,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.940
an instructional coach, have
found to be foundational in how

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.740
I think about designing
and how people

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.490
think about designing units of
study, whole courses, or even

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.350
entire programs.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.070
And so understanding by
design is a simple framework,

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.690
but it's not simplistic.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.480
And it has three main steps.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.520
And so the idea is,
you start at the end.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.370
It's backwards planning of,
identify your desired results,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.670
then move to determining
what's the acceptable evidence,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.850
and then, only then,
going to the idea of,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.600
what are the learning
experiences that I'm

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.270
going to engage my learners in?

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.180
And for the focus of
our time together, we're

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.800
going to be on the second
step of determining

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.200
acceptable evidence.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.720
And in doing this, in
thinking like an assessor,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.850
there's some
foundational questions

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.130
that we all need to consider.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.320
And so we're going to
throw them out there.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.950
And I invite you to think about
them throughout these case

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.250
studies, and think about how
these three steps and the three

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.800
questions I'm about
to do have informed

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.890
what these two different
groups of folks

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.980
have thought through, as they've
tried to figure out something

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.570
that can really
fit their context

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.830
and their student needs.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.240
So in terms of thinking
like an assessor,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.800
one is, what kind
of evidence do we

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.280
need to actually see that our
goals are being accomplished?

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.460
A second is, what
specific characteristics

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.550
in student responses,
products, and performances

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.760
should we examine?

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.077
So this one stood out
to me as the idea of,

00:05:24.077 --> 00:05:25.910
it's not just-- if we
have rich assessments,

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.400
there's a lot of data
that is being produced.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.150
And we need to think about
what parts of that picture

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.930
are important for us to be
able to take stock of it

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.504
and be able to evaluate
it against some criteria.

00:05:39.504 --> 00:05:41.170
And then the third
one we can drill down

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.086
to the individual students
producing this data

00:05:43.086 --> 00:05:45.040
and think about, does
this proposed evidence

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.334
enable us to infer the
knowledge, the skill,

00:05:48.334 --> 00:05:49.750
or understanding
that we're hoping

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.041
to instantiate in our students?

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.390
So with these questions
sort of taking forward

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.960
as a light framework
into the case studies,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.330
the one other thing we wanted
to accomplish in the intro

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.790
was some typologies
of emerging approaches

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.990
to evaluating learning.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.520
So there's a lot
of different ways

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.150
in which we can and
do evaluate learning.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.370
And what we tried
to sample from here

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.020
were things in the
higher ed context

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.390
that are gaining
importance and that

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.180
are in line with research-based
best practices of what we know

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.420
from the learning sciences.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.620
And so the first one that
I wanted to highlight

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.930
was portfolio-based assessment.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.320
And the idea is not
just a single artifact,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.690
but compiling a set of artifacts
from a given student or group

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.890
of students.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.150
And often, it allows us to get
a more holistic picture of what

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.620
that student knows, and you can
see a progression over time.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.780
And this type of assessment
started, primarily, in the arts

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.940
and in design schools, but
it's used much more widespread

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.740
in a variety of disciplines,
especially with the advent

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.490
of electronic portfolios
or e-portfolios

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.070
where it's a lot easier
to compile student work.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.220
A second emerging approach
that is gaining significance

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.260
is competency-based assessment.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.560
And this idea is about
mastery and divorcing mastery

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.290
from sort of seat
time, if you will.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.290
And for those of you familiar
with Boy Scout merit badges,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.040
that's sort of an original type
of competency-based assessment.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.239
If I'm doing knot
tying, it's not

00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:26.030
that I have to go
through an entire course.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.030
Whenever I think that I am
proficient in tying knots,

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.270
I can go for an evaluation
and get my badge.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.510
And there are similar types of
things like that in higher ed,

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.500
especially with online courses.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.500
You can go through the
material at your own pace

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.410
or even skip over the material,
and see whether or not

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.530
you actually have mastery.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.780
The third of the four
that I'm going to touch on

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.390
is peer- and self-assessment.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.440
And the idea-- this has
been growing in uptake

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.860
in higher education for at
least two significant reasons.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.020
One, the learning sciences
is showing how important

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.390
metacognition is, having
students know what they know

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.070
and know what they
don't know, and be

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.400
able to build those skills
in them as lifelong learners,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.400
with the rapid rate of change
and learning that they'll

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.110
need to do as professionals.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.390
And the second is the
growth of group work

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.430
and being able to,
as an instructor,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.100
disaggregate all these
different folks who came

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.750
together and created a product.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.270
You know, who-- we still
have individual grades--

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:29.100
who was responsible for
what part of the experience?

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.850
And then the last one
I want to talk about

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.210
is performance assessment.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.000
It's also known as
authentic assessment.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.890
And this is the idea of having
some problem-based task that's

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.100
usually approximating
a real-world skill.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.310
And in this type
of setting, when

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.900
we looked over the
Harvard landscape

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.649
about case studies we
wanted to highlight,

00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:52.390
we saw a wide variety of
performance assessments being

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.042
used.

00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:54.750
And so actually, both
of our case studies

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.950
focus on performance
assessments.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.320
And we think it's
particularly important here,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.210
as we look at the types
of students we have

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.300
and our goals in higher ed
as undergrad and graduate

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.970
education, to be able,
not just to get people

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.550
to know and understand
things, but to use it

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.280
flexibly and creatively
out in the world.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.380
And so our idea with
performance assessment

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.894
is with two different stories,
different contexts, and really

00:09:18.894 --> 00:09:20.560
interesting adventures
about how they've

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.184
gotten to where
they've gotten to,

00:09:22.184 --> 00:09:24.100
we can learn some things
that we can take away

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.700
for our own practice.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.330
So with that, I
will hand it over.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.590
My name's Teddy Svoronos.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.690
I'm a lecturer of public
policy at the Kennedy

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.580
School of Government,
where I teach

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.160
statistics and econometrics
and the core curriculum

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.720
to our Masters students.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.080
So the people I teach are not
going to become statisticians,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.810
as much as I'd like
them to, but instead,

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.600
are going to hopefully use
the tools of data analysis

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.476
in their sort of policy
careers down the road.

00:09:49.476 --> 00:09:51.850
This is some work that I did
with Mae Klinger, who is not

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.360
currently here, and
Dan Levy, who is here,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.800
on the use of two-stage
exams in a classroom setting

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.125
for this quantitative course.

00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:03.250
Those of you that don't
teach quantitative courses,

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.450
I think that
there's still plenty

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.866
here, so please
don't write me off

00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:07.620
just because I said
I do statistics.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.180
But hopefully there's
plenty that, I think,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.430
can lead to some
interesting discussions.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.420
I'm going to start
with the punch line,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.920
so if you want to be
surprised, eyes closed,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.610
ears closed, for like
the next 30 seconds.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.520
This started as an effort
to promote learning,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.010
not evaluate learning.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.460
And in the process, we
came across a metric

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.540
to use that actually helps
us understand the ability

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.890
of our students to collaborate.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.130
So in the process of looking
for a way to promote learning,

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.990
we came across the
way to evaluate it.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.950
And in the process, this has led
me to question my own teaching

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.735
methods, and to
evaluate my own teaching

00:10:46.735 --> 00:10:49.120
and understand the extent
to which I can improve it

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.177
over time.

00:10:50.177 --> 00:10:51.760
So before I get into
the nitty gritty,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.980
I want to thank the
inspiration for this--

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.924
Eric Mazur and Carl Wieman
are in the physics departments

00:10:56.924 --> 00:10:59.590
of Harvard and Stanford, and are
kind of the originators of this

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.380
two-stage exam concept that
I'll explain in a second--

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.054
funding from V Pell,
excellent research assistants,

00:11:05.054 --> 00:11:06.970
and excellent colleagues
at the Kennedy School

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.172
that provided some guidance.

00:11:09.172 --> 00:11:11.130
So I'm going to start by
explaining why I think

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.690
two-stage exams are important.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.702
Then I'm going to talk
about how they work.

00:11:14.702 --> 00:11:16.410
I'm going to give you
a sense of the data

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.330
that we have, and
sort of the process we

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.780
did of analyzing the data, and
then what I think this implies.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.640
So first, why two-stage
exams even matter.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.430
The thing that has
always bothered me

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.490
is, if you think about a
student's experience in most

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.910
classrooms, they work
with the course material

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.120
throughout the semester in
class, out of class, together.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.540
They spend a bunch of time
studying for the exam.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.900
They take the exam and
then they get their grades.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.560
Hopefully this is a
non-controversial sequence.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.350
The thing that frustrated me
is that if I thought about when

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.230
students were
actually learning, it

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.000
felt like it happened
throughout the semester,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.270
it happened while
they were studying,

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.670
but then the exam was
basically just an assessment.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.010
The exam was, can
you do the things

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.420
that you've been
studying for or not?

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.800
And then we posted solutions,
and very few students

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.670
look at them.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.270
How few?

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.380
Very few-- 38% in
a midterm exam.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.210
We tracked how many
people actually

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.190
looked at the solutions,
downloaded them.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.820
38% for a midterm, in which
how well you did matters

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.310
for the final because
it's cumulative-- still,

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.350
less than half of people
even looked at it.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.470
So part of this was
to try to figure out

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.570
how we could bring learning
into these other two

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.160
parts of the process.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.200
And that's what
two-stage exams do so.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.230
The idea is that a
standard exam, let's say,

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.540
is three hours long,
from 9:00 to noon.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.680
It's an individual exam.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.670
You take it, that's it.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.960
In a two-stage exam,
we instead divide it

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.530
into a two-hour individual
exam, and then we

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.440
add an additional
hour of group work.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.960
And when I say
group work, I mean

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.800
we take the questions
from the individual exam,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.430
we take the most challenging
or complex ones that we think

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.650
could benefit from
group interaction,

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.670
and then the students redo
a subset of those questions

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.830
together in this
group of four or five.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.280
And we structure it so that
it can only help their grade,

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.820
it can't hurt their grade,
so people don't freak out.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.880
But essentially
what we're doing is

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.470
trying to force
students, when they

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.650
hand in their first-stage exam,
don't just walk out of the room

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.300
and never think
about this again.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.270
Instead, engage with your peers,
talk through what's happening,

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.380
and see what you
can get from it.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:36.400
So in the process, we hope
that using two-stage exams

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.430
integrates active learning
into the exam setting.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.740
It forces people to
instruct one another.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.350
It forces people to be critical
about how they're thinking.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.110
It forces them to engage
with the material,

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.270
even after the initial
assessment, which hopefully

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.030
leads to longer-term
gains, and it

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.340
develops skills of debate
and collaboration related

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.390
to course topics.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.910
There's maybe a
specific set of skills

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.210
related to working in a group
on a quantitative question that

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.270
isn't captured in a
single-stage exam.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.970
So what that looks
like is, the stage 1

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.500
looks like kind
of a normal exam--

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.150
sorry for the lighting--

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.850
and the second
stage is this kind

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:17.327
of cacophonous group of people
working in little groups,

00:14:17.327 --> 00:14:19.660
talking through different
questions and issues they had,

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.910
dividing up work sometimes,
and really working together

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.560
to submit a second
stage that represents

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.240
their sort of
collective knowledge.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.920
There are some
groans and sadness

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.650
in the room when people realize
that they did a question wrong,

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.720
but that's part of--
it's sort of by design.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.670
It's a feature, not a bug.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.240
So generally, people
seem to like it.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.880
84% of the learners that
we've done this with

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.410
reported that a
two-stage exam was

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.680
more helpful for their learning
than a traditional exam.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.620
But now I hear people
grumbling under their breath

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.280
that this is not a measure
of actual learning.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.374
I didn't actually hear
you guys grumbling, but--

00:14:57.374 --> 00:14:58.790
this is not a
measure of learning,

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.640
this is a self-report,
a self-assessment,

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.200
of whether or not learning
is actually happening.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.440
So we are trying to take
the data that we had

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.390
and parse through it and figure
out what we can do with it.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.590
So just so you know, this
data is from three statistics

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.370
courses from 2013
to 2017, taught

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.430
multiple times, 11 total
exams, about 900 students

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.320
in five different cohorts.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.210
And when we had
the second stage,

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.480
they were randomized into
225 groups of four to five.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.977
So there's quite a bit
of data to work with.

00:15:27.977 --> 00:15:30.310
And the question that we kept
sort of hitting up against

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.400
is, what metrics do we use
to try to evaluate this data

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.260
and see what it can tell us?

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.127
So here are the ones
we came up with.

00:15:37.127 --> 00:15:39.460
If you imagine, let's say,
just three people in a group,

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:44.980
instead of four to five, and in
stage 1, this is how they did.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.870
There were three
questions, let's say.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.610
They each got this grade.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.910
Afterwards, they were randomized
into the stage 2 group,

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:56.950
and they did the same subset
of three questions and got 25.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.800
So on one hand, we
have the stage 2 grade

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.150
to compare things to.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.440
We could also just take the
average of each of the three

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.520
and compare that to
their stage 2 grade.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.990
Sure, straightforward.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.400
We could also say, well, what
about the highest performing

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.570
student?

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.690
How did the group do relative
to that high performing student?

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.690
I'm going to call that
the top student grade,

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.630
so that's 25 here.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.840
And then there is this
third one, or fourth one,

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.880
I guess, that we thought was
an interesting thing to do,

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.890
which is to say, take the best
grade that any student did

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.300
on any question.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.120
So for question 1, the
first student did the best.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.180
They got nine, whereas the
other two got eight and seven.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.520
And the second one, the second
student did it the best.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.800
And the third one, the third
student did it the best.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.620
So what we have here
is a synthetic--

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.660
what we call a super student.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.160
The super student is as
well as anyone in the group

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.280
could do on a single one of
the questions pooled together.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.030
So if we look at these four
metrics that we came up with,

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.550
the stage 1 averages just the
average student performance

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.560
in the group.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.834
The stage 2 is the
collective performance

00:17:04.834 --> 00:17:06.250
of the group after
collaboration--

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.140
what they were able
to do together.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.160
The top student is the
highest student performance

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.060
in the group.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.329
And the super student is
the collective performance

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.650
before collaboration.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:23.319
And one way to think of this
is sort of the raw knowledge

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.359
that the group had
before they even

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:29.140
interacted with each
other is the most that all

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.820
the people in the group knew
about each question, pooled

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.350
together, and then they tried
to go into stage 2 together.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.270
So these are the
four metrics we used.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:42.210
I'm going to show you results
standardized around the stage 1

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:47.680
result. So here is the
distribution of stage

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.445
1 groups centered around zero.

00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:50.820
That's the stage
1 group average,

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.170
just to give you a
sense of the spread.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:57.070
In the stage 2, they
did quite a bit better.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.430
In fact, they did about one
standard deviation better

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.600
in a group, in group 2, than
they did in the first group 1.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.270
Now, I'm not trying to make
causal claims that we improved

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.800
learning by one
standard deviation,

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.639
because they did have extra
time to work and all of that.

00:18:11.639 --> 00:18:13.930
But it is worth noting that
this one standard deviation

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.017
change is a huge change.

00:18:16.017 --> 00:18:18.100
We're usually excited in
educational interventions

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.730
if we can get 0.2, 0.3
standard deviation increases,

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.160
and here we have 1.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.530
If we compare that
to the top student,

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:27.980
it's actually quite similar.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.850
So the top student distribution
is also about one standard

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.250
deviation better.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.740
And the super student,
the distribution

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.980
is like this, which is about
1 and 1/2 standard deviations.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.220
So the super student,
the maybe maximum amount

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.620
of knowledge before
collaboration in the group,

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.010
is 1 and 1/2 standard deviations
over the stage 1 average.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.820
So here is the metric that I
think is quite interesting.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.780
If we take these two
gains and figure out

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.280
what percentage of
the super student

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.850
was reclaimed by
the stage 2 group,

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.760
we get this measure of the
extent to which the group was

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.500
able to sort of harvest the
knowledge from one another

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.080
and contribute it to
their stage 2 group.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.790
So the 66% number we're calling
collaborative efficiency.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.070
This is in contrast to a
term used in psychology

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.050
called collaborative
inhibition, which

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.027
is how much knowledge is lost
when people work together.

00:19:26.027 --> 00:19:27.610
But we're trying to
be positive, so we

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.160
did collaborative efficiency.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.034
And the question
is, how efficient

00:19:32.034 --> 00:19:32.950
did these groups work?

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.434
How much were they able to
reclaim the maximum amount

00:19:35.434 --> 00:19:37.600
of knowledge that was pooled
across them before they

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.740
interacted?

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.120
And here's what the
distribution looks like.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:46.030
So a 1 means 100% efficiency,
means that the stage 2

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:50.710
group did as well as
the collective knowledge

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:51.450
going into it.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.560
So they were able
to reclaim 100%

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.540
of the knowledge in the group.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.100
What's kind of
interesting about this

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.180
is that there are people
in which, as a group,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.270
they did collectively better
than the pooled amount

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.980
of knowledge in the group.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.960
So that's at least
evidence for the suggestion

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.770
that collaborating
actually helped

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.934
to generate knowledge,
not just kind of spread

00:20:11.934 --> 00:20:13.850
the knowledge around in
a way that was useful.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.780
So the thing about
collaborative efficiency

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.510
that I think is really worth
doing is that, in the Kennedy

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.880
School, and I think in a
lot of professional schools,

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.270
a thing we actually want to
stimulate in our students

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.655
is the ability to reclaim this
information in a group context.

00:20:31.655 --> 00:20:33.030
Usually in the
Kennedy School, we

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.354
say, well, if you work in a
group, that's negotiations.

00:20:36.354 --> 00:20:38.520
If you're trying to lead a
group, that's leadership.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.560
But we teach quantitative
classes, Dan and I,

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.750
in the Kennedy
School, and we want

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.790
people to be able to
collaborate and interact

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.120
on quantitative questions
just as much as they do when

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.140
trying to negotiate something.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.740
And so that's a skill that
I want to actually develop--

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.800
articulating the reason
why you have that position,

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.190
understanding the position
of your other group members,

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.890
and being able to assess the
strengths and shortcomings

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.870
of your colleagues'
positions, and then

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.090
trying to convince
them otherwise.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.165
Knowing when you're
wrong, understanding

00:21:08.165 --> 00:21:09.540
why they might be
right or wrong,

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.910
trying to communicate that--
that's a crucial skill

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.390
that we hope that graduates of
the Kennedy School will have.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.860
And that's something
that I think

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.640
we're getting toward measuring
using this two-stage exam.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.210
So reaching this collective
position led to these lessons

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.780
that I want to talk about, which
is, trying to improve learning,

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.720
just experimenting with ways
to make learning better,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.680
has led us to find a way to
measure a skill that I didn't

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.224
even sort of realize
I really cared about,

00:21:37.224 --> 00:21:38.640
and I didn't even
sort of realized

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.880
that I was trying very hard
to generate with my students.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.770
And the experience
has led me to think--

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.200
we do a lot of active
learning in our classes,

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.400
we do group work, we
do things like that.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.610
But I had sort of
treated that as a means

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.530
to get more knowledge,
not necessarily

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.211
as an end in and of itself.

00:21:54.211 --> 00:21:55.710
And I'm starting
to think maybe this

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.850
is the thing that I actually
want to foster in my students,

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.310
develop, and maybe
even evaluate--

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.000
evaluate the extent to which
they're able to collaborate.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.472
And so that has been our sort
of process with two-stage exams.

00:22:09.472 --> 00:22:11.680
We've gotten to this new
measure, and in the process,

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.500
it's had quite a
bit of an effect

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.930
on how I approach teaching.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.430
Thanks.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.780
