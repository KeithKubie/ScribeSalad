00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.075
As you know from earlier in the course, you can find the y-intercept by

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:10.113
substituting in x equals 0. So, the y-intercept is simply f of 0 which as you

00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:16.315
can see gives us 1 over 12. Are there any x-intercepts? We have to solve f of x

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:20.515
equals 0 as you can see here and when we solve that we get 1 is equal to 0

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:26.890
which is not possible, so that there are no x-intercepts.
