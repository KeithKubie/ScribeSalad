BRENDON HARRINGTON:
Hey, everyone.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.140
Thanks for coming.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.970
Thanks for joining us today.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.015
I'm Brendan from the
transportation team.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:10.750
It's my very big
privilege and honor

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.750
to introduce Stana Katic today.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.170
She's here from LA.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.250
You know her as the
TV and film actress.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.060
One of her big hits, of course,
is the TV show "Castle."

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.020
Beyond that, though,
she's a strong advocate

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.290
for the environment
and for transportation.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.380
Having lived
throughout the world,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.650
she's often observed
transportation issues

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.630
in many different places.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.300
She's very passionate about
not accepting this car centric

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.380
fate, and so she's
dedicated her time

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.250
to a new organization called
the Alternative Travel Project,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.292
just a few years old now.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.833
She's going to share a little
bit more about her experiences,

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:46.034
so join me in welcoming her.

[PIANO MUSIC]

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.590
-In the early 1900s,
Henry Ford set out

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.970
to make an automobile
anyone could afford.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.595
The Model T became so affordable
that a worker could buy it

00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:51.750
in only four months' pay.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.840
By the 1920s, the market
had reached saturation.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.730
Those who desired a car already
owned one, as 90% of all trips

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.490
were made by rail car.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.430
Around the 1950s, things
started to change.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.910
"The Street Car
Conspiracy" by the author

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.340
and former US and antitrust
attorney Bradford Snell

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.970
refers to the allegations
that GM and other companies

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.810
like Firestone, through
subsidiaries, purchased

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.680
and dismantled trams,
trolleys, and electric trains

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.890
in many cities across the
United States in order

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.790
to eliminate the car industry's
number one competitor.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.367
Others argue that the fall
of public transportation

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:27.200
was due to the culmination
of other factors,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.050
such as the Depression,
labor unrest, market forces,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.030
urban sprawl, and other causes
favoring private vehicle

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.960
ownership.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.120
One author was quoted as
saying, clearly, GM waged

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.690
a war on electric traction.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.340
It was, indeed,
an all out assault

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.660
but by no means the single
reason for the failure

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.120
of rapid transit.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.480
Also, it is just as clear
that the actions and inactions

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.330
by government
contributed significantly

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.830
to the elimination
of electric traction.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.160
Americans had a wake up call
with the oil crisis of 1973,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.680
and since then, alternative
forms of travel have been

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.350
on the rise, most notably
again in the 2000s with the US

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.160
involvement in the Middle East
and people's realizations that

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.020
we as a country cannot be
dependent on fossil fuels.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.400
Then again, for
others, it was simply

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.640
just an idea one morning.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.470
-You know, one summer day,
I just said, you know what?

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.440
It's time for me to just find
a new way to get to work.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.650
I was just so tired
of being in a car,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.077
and literally, within a
week, I had my bicycle.

STANA KATIC: Hi.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.650
My name is Stana Katic.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.430
I am here to talk with
you today about ATP.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:52.070
Many of you know ATP to
be adenosine triphosphate,

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.530
the energy carrying shuttle
service molecule found

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.450
in the cells of
all living things.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.080
Not a very big deal,
but to me, it's

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.760
the acronym for one of
my favorite non-profits,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.040
the Alternative Travel Project.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.070
Oddly enough, it also happens to
be a nonprofit that I founded.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.840
So what is ATP?

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.670
Well, it's a global
initiative that

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.829
encourages people to go
car free for just one day.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.890
We ask people to
volunteer days outside

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.000
of the bubble of their cars
by finding new ways to travel.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.260
And by new ways, I
mean the ancient art

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:38.510
of pedestrian travel, cycling,
public transit, and new tech.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.830
That being said, I promise
you this presentation

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.970
isn't going to
end with me asking

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.470
you to throw away your Teslas.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.129
Cars are great.

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:48.420
They're part of our modern day.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.810
They just don't need to be
a part of our every day.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.810
So why bother?

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.180
Why does transit--
or what does transit

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.570
have to do with your
average Joe other than being

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.250
a royal nuisance at 8 AM
and 5 PM, five days a week?

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.230
I have a huge list
of stats and stories

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.400
that say traveling alternatively
has reverberating effects

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.504
on so many parts of our lives--
our health, our environment,

00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:14.170
and here's the one
that really motivates

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.460
people-- our pocketbooks.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.910
But we have to
start somewhere, so

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.850
why don't we just start
by looking at our future?

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.773
Let's see where we
are going globally.

00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:26.272
At the current pace
of urbanization,

00:05:26.272 --> 00:05:31.080
the world's cities will
add 65 million inhabitants

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.720
every year-- every single
year-- for the next 10 years.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.150
So if we break that
down, and let's

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.320
say we just look at India-- we
look at the cities of India--

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.830
they're going to have to
add as much floor space

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.030
as exists in all of Chicago.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.980
China is going to have to
add twice that every year.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.050
This means that traffic is
not going to get better.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.370
It's going to get
more complicated.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.650
I lived in Los Angeles.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.870
Traffic already sucks.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.720
People joke in LA about
how dating someone

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.500
on the other side of town
can be a deal breaker,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.650
because who wants
to do long distance?

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.830
Can you guys imagine what a
population surge in that city

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.820
is going to look like?

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.240
I just got married.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.780
I'm good.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.230
The love of my life
lives in my zip code.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.950
But I'm worried about my
single sisters out there.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.660
There is a study that came
out this past February, March.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.880
Scientists at California's
Office of Environmental Health

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.580
Hazard Assessment,
the Cancer Prevention

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.660
Institute of
California, UC Davis,

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.260
and other prestigious
science centers

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.680
linked chronic exposure
to ultra fine particles

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.800
in vehicle exhaust to
deaths from heart disease.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.220
So ultra fine particles,
according to the study,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.590
are a key contributor
to health problems

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.050
amongst people
living near traffic.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.610
The study ran from 2001 to 2007.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.170
It took a look at
100,000 middle-aged women

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.010
across California.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.050
These women were teachers
and administrators, so people

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.440
that we need and that
we want to stick around.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.870
So let's think about it again.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.340
What happens when we have a
population surge in our cities?

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.200
Traffic isn't just
a health hazard.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.100
There's a financial
cost to getting people

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.760
around a city inefficiently.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.450
According to recent
research, congestions cost,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.370
partly from wasting time and
the patience of commuters,

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.430
equals anywhere from 1.5% to
4% of gross domestic product.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.450
So getting people from
one part of the city

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.840
to another efficiently and
stress free has monetary value.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.910
So as our cities' populations
grow, what's the plan?

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.470
Where are we going?

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.100
Leaving the roadways as they
are has an economic cost,

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.380
but data also suggests
that building more roadways

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.570
isn't the answer, as well,
because that has human health

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.980
costs.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.890
This is where we come in.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.830
The city of Los Angeles is
one of the media capitals

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:15.900
of the world, as is
the city of Google.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.590
We export lifestyle
through our stories,

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.650
through film, television,
internet content, et cetera.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.730
And at ATP, we believe that
places like Google and Los

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.850
Angeles or
Hollywood-- we believe

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.370
we're unique on the global
stage because we have

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.700
an unparalleled
potential to effect

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:39.480
the vision of what an ideal
lifestyle would and could be.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.659
Our media, our film
and television tales,

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:46.270
reach even the most remote
international villages

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.380
and yurts.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.570
What kind of tales
and lifestyles

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.580
are we going to
be able to export

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.520
when the majority
of storytellers

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.110
are bound to driving as
a main mode of transit?

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.580
Transit is a
secondary thought when

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.540
it comes to much of
entertainment media content,

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.741
but driving storytellers lead
to driving scenes in movies.

00:09:08.741 --> 00:09:09.240
I know.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.670
I have to do them all the time.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.760
Our lives affect our
inspiration and imagination,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.930
and that has
reverberating effects.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.620
That has global effects.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.880
The messages that we plant
in global consciousness

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.820
now will dictate
where we all go.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.930
With the extraordinary
amount of creative talent

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.892
and financial power
that circulates

00:09:34.892 --> 00:09:36.350
through this part
of the US, we can

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.110
be at the forefront of
technological breakthroughs

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.770
and municipal services
in an unprecedented way.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.260
And if we took a quick
moment to improve something

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.420
as simple as the
way we get around,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.910
the benefits to health,
the benefits to business

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.330
and the environment
would be astronomical.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.340
So I figure a city
that draws some

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.090
of the most creative
people on the planet

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.030
would be a fertile ground
for problem solving

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.340
the next generation's ideas of
what metropolitan travel has

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:04.940
to look like.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.850
There is a way to make it
fun, inspiring, and safe.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.770
And at ATP, we are
trying to be a part

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.000
of disseminating that vision.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.060
Our first year, we asked
people across the globe

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.810
to volunteer days car free, and
the response was overwhelming.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.230
Stories came in from everywhere,
from France, Belgium, South

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.260
Africa, Argentina, Minnesota.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.280
I mean, everywhere.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.860
I have shared this one often.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.210
It's a good story, so bear with
me if you've heard it before.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.520
There was a school
in Romania that,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.240
as a result of this
initiative, decided

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.400
to take on the challenge
and create car free Fridays.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.010
What happened was
that people that

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.700
were connected to
the school started

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.090
meeting each other on buses,
on sidewalks, and so on.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.630
And a little over
a year and a half

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.190
later, there were two
weddings as a direct result

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.910
of the Alternative Travel
Project initiative.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:58.540
Here's a photo.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.470
They now have children.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.840
So ATP isn't just about
making a love connection.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.430
The other benefits of
engaging in an ATP lifestyle

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.910
extend beyond health
and economics.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.990
There's something
called agglomeration.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.640
Agglomeration essentially
means a heap or cluster

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.700
of usually disparate elements.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.380
There is monetary value
to agglomerating people

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.190
through expanded transit.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.250
Planning scholars from
UC Berkeley and Rutgers

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:36.150
believe the numbers run anywhere
from $1.5 million to $1.8

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.730
billion, depending
on a city's size.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.600
And at Google, you guys
are doing a fantastic job

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.057
of re-envisioning transit.

00:11:44.057 --> 00:11:46.140
I know, because I read
your Bike Vision Statement,

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.300
and if anyone here hasn't
seen it, you should.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.560
It's very, very impressive.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.260
In Google's vision
plan, you're part

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.650
of creating new infrastructure
in which residents

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.340
of all abilities,
from ages 8 to 80,

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.650
will feel safe and comfortable
doing things like riding around

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.250
on a bicycle here.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.580
For a company that is at
the forefront of making

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:13.020
the imagined manifest,
how many more moments

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.020
of eureka, how many more ideas
will you foster into reality

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.370
by building the transit
infrastructure that

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.660
allows for agglomeration?

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.660
ATP is working to inform
and empower individuals

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.120
to choose alternative
means of transit.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.140
We see a future where, as
cities all over the world grow,

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.250
pedestrian travel, cyclists,
cars, and public transit

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.410
hold equal value for those
building infrastructure.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.430
We are working to arm
businesses and governments

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.890
with the data necessary
to comfortably justify

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.870
building those facilities
for the betterment

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.620
of their economies and for
the health and happiness

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.110
of their citizens.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.720
That's where we want to go.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.440
And if we can-- or if I
can convince one of you

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.970
in this room to use your
molecular energy ATP

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.390
to do some alternative
travel ATP, and if,

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.910
therefore, a part of
a reverberating effect

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.835
that reduces a person's risk
of heart disease or results

00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:14.220
in you saving money so you
can take your loved one out

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.472
to dinner, or spurs a chance
meeting on a bike trail that

00:13:17.472 --> 00:13:19.180
figures out a way to
save the polar bear,

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.020
cure cancer, protect
the Galapagos,

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.410
or build that high speed
electric party train that gets

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:27.870
us from San Francisco to LA,
in no time, then the places

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:33.220
that we are going is going to
be where everyone wants to be.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.510
So thank you.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.960
[APPLAUSE]
