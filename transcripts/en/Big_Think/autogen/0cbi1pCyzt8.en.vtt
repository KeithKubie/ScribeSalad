not for a few but for for most people
 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.089
not for a few but for for most people
and eventually all people so there is a

sometimes masked over by that that

flourishing element is definitely a big

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750
flourishing element is definitely a big
 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.510
flourishing element is definitely a big
aspect of I think of the motivational

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520
aspect of I think of the motivational
 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.610

structure of many many libertarians

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620
structure of many many libertarians
 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.040
structure of many many libertarians
certainly it is for me

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050
 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.180
I think the zero-sum worldview is the

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190
I think the zero-sum worldview is the
 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.000
I think the zero-sum worldview is the
predominant one I think it's it's

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010
predominant one I think it's it's
 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.060
predominant one I think it's it's
something we've we've evolved with or

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070
something we've we've evolved with or
 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.790
something we've we've evolved with or
this idea that there's a limited fixed

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800
this idea that there's a limited fixed
 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.550
this idea that there's a limited fixed
PI and we have to distribute that PI in

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560
PI and we have to distribute that PI in
 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.090
PI and we have to distribute that PI in
an equal fair way that no one should get

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100
an equal fair way that no one should get
 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.090
an equal fair way that no one should get
unfair large pieces of that pie and if

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100
unfair large pieces of that pie and if
 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.970
unfair large pieces of that pie and if
someone is getting a bigger piece

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980
someone is getting a bigger piece
 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.050
someone is getting a bigger piece
necessarily someone else may be getting

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060
necessarily someone else may be getting
 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.060
necessarily someone else may be getting
a smaller piece since there's a finite

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070
a smaller piece since there's a finite
 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.730
a smaller piece since there's a finite
amount of pie to go around I also think

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740
amount of pie to go around I also think
 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.250
amount of pie to go around I also think
it comes from our our competitive sports

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260
it comes from our our competitive sports
 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.630
it comes from our our competitive sports
and that in competitive sports there's

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640
and that in competitive sports there's
 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.250
and that in competitive sports there's
there's a winner and there's a loser and

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260
there's a winner and there's a loser and
 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.850
there's a winner and there's a loser and
so we play games we play sports all our

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860
so we play games we play sports all our
 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.360
so we play games we play sports all our
lives so we come to believe that that in

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370
lives so we come to believe that that in
 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.930
lives so we come to believe that that in
the zero-sum world view that some are

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940
the zero-sum world view that some are
 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.820
the zero-sum world view that some are
winners and some are losers and in it

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830
winners and some are losers and in it
 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.640
winners and some are losers and in it
and then we can adjust society that

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650
and then we can adjust society that
 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.410
and then we can adjust society that
there should be no losers there should

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420
there should be no losers there should
 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.320
there should be no losers there should
be so we need to to to limit the pieces

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330
be so we need to to to limit the pieces
 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.970
be so we need to to to limit the pieces
of the pie anyone gets so that everyone

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980
of the pie anyone gets so that everyone
 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.340
of the pie anyone gets so that everyone
can have a fair and just piece of the

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350
can have a fair and just piece of the
 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.580
can have a fair and just piece of the
pie and I so I reject that I don't think

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590
pie and I so I reject that I don't think
 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.210
pie and I so I reject that I don't think
there is a necessarily a fixed pie the

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220
there is a necessarily a fixed pie the
 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.190
there is a necessarily a fixed pie the
beauty of capitalism and the beauty of

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.200
beauty of capitalism and the beauty of
 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.400
beauty of capitalism and the beauty of
conscious capitalism is the realization

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.410
conscious capitalism is the realization
 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.270
conscious capitalism is the realization
that the pie can grow that that through

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280
that the pie can grow that that through
 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.690
that the pie can grow that that through
voluntary exchange and through the value

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:14.700
voluntary exchange and through the value
 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.280
voluntary exchange and through the value
creation that happens when the

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.290
creation that happens when the
 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.160
creation that happens when the
stakeholders voluntarily cooperate and

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.170
stakeholders voluntarily cooperate and
 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.200
stakeholders voluntarily cooperate and
voluntary exchange with each other is

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210
voluntary exchange with each other is
 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.460
voluntary exchange with each other is
that that the pie grows larger and so

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470
that that the pie grows larger and so
 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.410
that that the pie grows larger and so
there is more to distribute and that

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:27.420
there is more to distribute and that
 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.270
there is more to distribute and that
distribution takes place through the

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280
distribution takes place through the
 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.150
distribution takes place through the
market through the market processes

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160

each of the traders of course wants to
get a bigger piece from themselves and

get a bigger piece from themselves and
 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.700
get a bigger piece from themselves and
competition sort of ultimately

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:40.710
competition sort of ultimately
 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.030
competition sort of ultimately
determines the the percentages that each

that's a growing pie and it's a win win

in game and that turns me on
 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.339
in game and that turns me on
I'm very fired up and excited about that

I'm very fired up and excited about that
 

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:02.279
I'm very fired up and excited about that

spiral I mean a great example of this is

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:03.670
spiral I mean a great example of this is
 

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.199
spiral I mean a great example of this is
is people are very focused oftentimes on

first three principles you have to

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360
first three principles you have to
 

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.030
first three principles you have to
create a culture a conscious culture

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.040
create a culture a conscious culture
 

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.630
create a culture a conscious culture

achieve its highest potential so when
you add those four principles together

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:42.730
you add those four principles together
 

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:44.970
you add those four principles together
you have a conscious business when you

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:44.980
you have a conscious business when you
 

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.180
you have a conscious business when you
add the conscious business with the key

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:48.190
add the conscious business with the key
 

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.420
add the conscious business with the key
principles of the conscious of the

principles of the conscious of the
conscious capitalism you truly have the

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940
conscious capitalism you truly have the
 

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:58.440

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:13.510
 

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.000
you've just articulated what I call the

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.010
you've just articulated what I call the
 

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:20.620
you've just articulated what I call the
trade-off myth the belief that all this

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:20.630
trade-off myth the belief that all this
 

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.410
trade-off myth the belief that all this
sounds very good very idealistic but it

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:23.420
sounds very good very idealistic but it
 

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.910
sounds very good very idealistic but it
won't compete well in the marketplace

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:24.920
won't compete well in the marketplace
 

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.820
won't compete well in the marketplace
and when it runs up against a a business

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:27.830
and when it runs up against a a business
 

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:31.290
and when it runs up against a a business
that's not handicapped with this

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:31.300
that's not handicapped with this
 

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.720
that's not handicapped with this
idealism then it'll be in trouble

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:33.730
idealism then it'll be in trouble
 

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.740
idealism then it'll be in trouble
nothing could be further from the truth

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:35.750
nothing could be further from the truth
 

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.320
nothing could be further from the truth
it's the exact opposite that in fact the

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:38.330
it's the exact opposite that in fact the
 

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.930
it's the exact opposite that in fact the
conscious business has competitive

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:48.160
advantage when you work from a higher
purpose you you unleash greater degrees

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.170
purpose you you unleash greater degrees
 

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.669
purpose you you unleash greater degrees
of commitment greater degrees of loyalty

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679

and that gives competitive advantage

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:56.630
and that gives competitive advantage
 

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.980
and that gives competitive advantage
when you work from the stakeholder model

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:58.990
when you work from the stakeholder model

in such a way as when you optimize the
entire system you also optimize the the
