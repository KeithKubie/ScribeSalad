greater fool theory that you make money
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.310
greater fool theory that you make money
from greater fools and you hope you're

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
from greater fools and you hope you're
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.760
from greater fools and you hope you're
the lesser fool but obviously there are

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770
the lesser fool but obviously there are
 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.870
the lesser fool but obviously there are
just as many people who fail on that

technology the idea this is very
 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.620

what bitcoin creates is a ledger that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620
what bitcoin creates is a ledger that
 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.490
what bitcoin creates is a ledger that
needs no bank and that's actually pretty

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
needs no bank and that's actually pretty
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.869
needs no bank and that's actually pretty
important because if you think about

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879
important because if you think about
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.810
important because if you think about
what is a bank at least as far as the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
what is a bank at least as far as the
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.880
what is a bank at least as far as the
the money transfer on that checking the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
the money transfer on that checking the
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.979
the money transfer on that checking the
savings not the loan part but the you

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
savings not the loan part but the you
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.810
savings not the loan part but the you
know the financial the moving money part

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
know the financial the moving money part
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.270
know the financial the moving money part
of a bank it's really it's a secure

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
of a bank it's really it's a secure
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.479
of a bank it's really it's a secure
ledger there the bank does not just have

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
ledger there the bank does not just have
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.670
ledger there the bank does not just have
a little file that says your account is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
a little file that says your account is
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.900
a little file that says your account is
three thousand dollars in it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
three thousand dollars in it
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.270
three thousand dollars in it
they insist that when you write

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
they insist that when you write
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.290
they insist that when you write
something they make a note in their

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
something they make a note in their
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.400
something they make a note in their
ledger that one thousand dollars was

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
ledger that one thousand dollars was
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.510
ledger that one thousand dollars was
transferred from your account someone

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
transferred from your account someone
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.490
transferred from your account someone
else's account and so on and that's

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
else's account and so on and that's
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859
else's account and so on and that's
important to make it secure well what

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
important to make it secure well what
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.899
important to make it secure well what
the designers of bitcoin created was a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909
the designers of bitcoin created was a
 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.090
the designers of bitcoin created was a
way to make a ledger that's secure and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
way to make a ledger that's secure and
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.520
way to make a ledger that's secure and
that everyone can trust but that no one

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
that everyone can trust but that no one
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.179
that everyone can trust but that no one
owns or controls and this allows people

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189
owns or controls and this allows people
 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.359
owns or controls and this allows people
to have money that can be free of the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
to have money that can be free of the
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.399
to have money that can be free of the
influence of governments which is both

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
influence of governments which is both
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.499
influence of governments which is both
bad if you're a government and great if

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509
bad if you're a government and great if
 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.270
bad if you're a government and great if
you're don't like what governments do

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
you're don't like what governments do
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.300
you're don't like what governments do
with their monetary policies it lets the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
with their monetary policies it lets the
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.609
with their monetary policies it lets the
policy be set by consensus and software

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
policy be set by consensus and software
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.219
policy be set by consensus and software
so Bitcoin basically has found a way to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
so Bitcoin basically has found a way to
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590
so Bitcoin basically has found a way to
always know what the majority thinks and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
always know what the majority thinks and
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.850
always know what the majority thinks and
by always knowing what the majority

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
by always knowing what the majority
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.830
by always knowing what the majority
thinks you get something you you hope

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
thinks you get something you you hope
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.710
thinks you get something you you hope
you can trust in theory if someone

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
you can trust in theory if someone
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.850
you can trust in theory if someone
controlled more than half of the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
controlled more than half of the
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.020
controlled more than half of the
computers in the world they could take

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
computers in the world they could take
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.600
computers in the world they could take
over Bitcoin but that's pretty unlikely

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610
over Bitcoin but that's pretty unlikely
 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.410
over Bitcoin but that's pretty unlikely
so why is that exciting well I grew up

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
so why is that exciting well I grew up
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.660
so why is that exciting well I grew up
with the internet and I'm old because

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
with the internet and I'm old because
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.859
with the internet and I'm old because
the Internet's actually been around for

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
the Internet's actually been around for
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.069
the Internet's actually been around for
a while

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
a while
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.450
a while
and the things that I think gave us the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
and the things that I think gave us the
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.520
and the things that I think gave us the
revolution of the internet that that

revolution of the internet that that
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.300
revolution of the internet that that
made it change the world so much are

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310
made it change the world so much are
 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.219
made it change the world so much are
things like the fact that it's open and

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
things like the fact that it's open and
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.919
things like the fact that it's open and
anyone can innovate on it and things

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
anyone can innovate on it and things
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.680
anyone can innovate on it and things
like the fact that the smarts in the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690
like the fact that the smarts in the
 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.590
like the fact that the smarts in the
internet are not in

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600
internet are not in
