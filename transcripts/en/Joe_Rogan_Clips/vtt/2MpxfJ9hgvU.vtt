1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.290
Did you see her a video on the moon landing?
No.
Oh,

2
00:00:02.291 --> 00:00:05.470
this is one of my favorite videos we ever did.
So,
uh,
you know,

3
00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:06.960
it's about how the moon land,
the,

4
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.340
the thesis is the moon landing could not have been faked.

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.420
It would've been harder to fake the moon landing then it would have been to,
uh,

6
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.220
actually go to the moon because the technology to fake it did not exist.

7
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.200
Like when we talked to a,
uh,
forensic film Guy,
right.
And was like,
spends,

8
00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:27.670
he's got like,
he's got a fucking Oscar for,
um,
you know,
analyzing old films.

9
00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:32.560
Right.
And he walked us through it.
He's like,
look,
the shadows are parallel.
Right.

10
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.890
They're not diverging.
You know,
a close light source.
The shadows would,

11
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.960
would diverge.
Right.
Um,

12
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.690
<v 1>so wait a minute.
You know that that's like,</v>

13
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.780
one of the big arguments for the moon hoax is that the shadows intersect.

14
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:48.370
The shadows indicate multiple light sources.
Well,
that is because,
uh,

15
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.980
when the main argument,

16
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.530
<v 0>that's that,
that is a,
I believe that's reflected light.
Okay.</v>

17
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm getting past my memory of the segment.

18
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.010
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
but I used to be a full on moon hoaxer.</v>

19
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:01.920
I fully believed we never went to,
I shouldn't have brought this up.

20
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.670
Watch the documentary that was on Fox TV while I was on news radio.

21
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:08.840
I was like 1995 or something like that.
I was fucking convince

22
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.610
<v 0>these radios on my fee.
My favorite sitcoms ever by the way,</v>

23
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.320
is a unacknowledged classic.
Uh,
I have watched the whole series like three times.

24
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.410
Um,
that show is so,
I'm sorry,
just go ahead and set this up.

25
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.810
<v 1>Well,
anyway,
um,</v>

26
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.080
back then Fox News actually aired a full one hour show calling co called

27
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.510
conspiracy theory.
Did we land on the moon?

28
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.890
And it had me fully convinced there was all this shit that they showed,

29
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:39.360
like the same background being used in multiple moon missions that were supposed

30
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:42.570
to be on completely different parts of the moon.
Like how is this possible?

31
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.460
It's supposed to be like nowhere near each other,

32
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:47.250
but they have the same background and that is a,

33
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:51.030
it looks like the astronauts are on wires and it looks like the light sources

34
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:54.990
are there,
multiple light sources and that the shadows are intersecting.

35
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:59.940
And you know,
all the fucking astronauts,
when they came back,
they did this,
uh,

36
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.500
Apollo 11 post flight,
uh,
press conference.

37
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.200
They look like they're completely full of shit.
I was all in dude,
all in,

38
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.190
all in and now you're all out.
No.
I realized,

39
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.540
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking.
That's one of the,

40
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:16.020
we all deal with being all in with them and with anything.

41
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.180
But we also found that they did fake some things for publicity purposes.

42
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:24.040
Photographs that were used that were,
uh,

43
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.530
photographs from tests that they did inside a warehouse with all safety

44
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:31.410
equipment,
and then they blacked out all the safety equipment in the background.

45
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:34.830
And s pawn those photos off as spacewalk photos.

46
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.000
But I think that's overzealous publicist.
It doesn't mean no one went to space.

47
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.800
Right.
It's like making leaps is the public.
Well,
what's the simplest explanation?

48
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:47.910
If it did fake some footage.
Well,
it's probably a bunch of simple explanations,

49
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:49.720
but overzealous publicists,

50
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:53.270
people wanting to show people video that they didn't have video of.
Maybe the,

51
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:55.890
the photos didn't come out so well,
so they fake some of them.

52
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.150
<v 0>Well,
let me let,
let the,
the thing about shadows diverging,
my memory of this is,</v>

53
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:04.060
we don't talk about that.
When people say they see the shadows diverge,
right?

54
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.070
If you actually go outside on a sunny day,

55
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:08.740
when you have a single point of light like that with light reflecting,

56
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:10.750
you will see two shadows of yourself going in different,

57
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.810
there's one dominant shadow and then there's a,
there's a secondary one,
right?

58
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:17.050
Yeah.
But if the shadow,
if the sun is actually far away,
right?

59
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.080
For the main shadow,
you will see the same shadows be parallel,
right?

60
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:22.540
If you had a close light source,
like on a film,
on a film set,

61
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.090
you see the shadows diverge,
right?
So at this film,
Forensic Guy,

62
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:26.530
come on and tell us,
look,

63
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.700
if you wanted to get perfectly straight light like that,
you would need lasers.

64
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:31.780
You would,
and you would also,

65
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:35.080
but you'd also need multicolored lasers because at the time all that existed

66
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.220
were red lasers.
Right.
They had not existed.

67
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.640
They're not an invented anything other than red lasers.
Right.

68
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.880
So NASA would have had to have multi like multi decade advanced laser light

69
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:48.550
technology in order to fake this.

70
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.470
Another part of it is just hard Kubrick he'd figured out,
I mean,
no,

71
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:56.710
I mean this is,
this is what we demonstrated in our segment.
You know,

72
00:03:56.711 --> 00:04:00.040
another part of it is people forget the moon broadcast.

73
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:03.610
The moon landing broadcast was something like a six hour live broadcast with no

74
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:08.020
cuts,
you know,
and at the time,
that was something you could do with TV,

75
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.060
but you literally couldn't do it with film.
Right.

76
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:12.160
There was no way to record film as there's,
sorry,

77
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:15.700
there's no way to record TV at the time you had live TV and you had recorded

78
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:19.210
film.
Right.
So if they were going to record it in advance,
right.

79
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:23.680
And then play it back,
they would have needed a six hour long reel of tape.

80
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.330
So commercials and they're,
uh,
I don't believe so.
Um,
and so,
uh,

81
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.200
they would've had to,
should,

82
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.820
we should probably know if there was commercials cause that's fair point game.

83
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.641
But you know,

84
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:37.360
you would have needed like an enormous film canister that also didn't exist at

85
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:37.810
the time,

86
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.490
<v 1>but he's going to have an enormous film canister.</v>

87
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:41.680
It'd be those fucking hoaxers at NASA.

88
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.840
<v 0>Well done.
Well part of the premise of the,
part of the premise of the,</v>

89
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.110
we didn't go to the moon argument is that we didn't have the technology to go to

90
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:52.180
the moon.
So they faked it.
Right,
right.
But it's like,
okay,

91
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:55.270
well if you have to postulate that they had decades ahead of its time filmmaking

92
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.450
technology,
why can't you accept that they just went to the fucking moon,

93
00:04:58.451 --> 00:04:58.601
you know?

94
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:01.900
So at the end when you go through all the things that would have to happen,

95
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.100
right,
in order to make it,

96
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:05.650
have you really go through it and look at what is the simplest explanation.

97
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.840
The simplest explanation is that we went to the moon because it would have been

98
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:10.810
fucking easier.
I don't know if it would've been easier.

99
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.940
<v 1>If it was impossible to go to the moon,
it would be insanely difficult to fake,</v>

100
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.863
no doubt.

101
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.050
But if you had an incredible budget and if you had someone who really had the

102
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:26.850
very top of the food chain knowledge,
terms of special effects,

103
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.160
what Kubrick did in 2001 one one was,
when was that?

104
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.980
When to 2001 come out and want to sell at 71 or some shit.
Yeah,

105
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:39.390
something like that.
When did that come out?
Let's see.
Yeah,
look it up.

106
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.320
I think it was earlier than that.
Maybe 68 68 okay,

107
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:46.230
so we're talking about before the moon landings,

108
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.970
Cooper cats and pretty astonishing special effects in 2001

109
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.300
<v 0>yeah,
but the,
the,
I mean,
the argument is that like even given,
again,</v>

110
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:59.060
this is like a filmmaker sang this,
given the film technology of the time,

111
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.320
the specific features that we see in the moon footage are not favorable.

112
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.410
You know,
another part of it is,
for instance,
the slow jumping,
right?

113
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:09.560
The slow boom,
boom.
You know,
you're on the moon,
right?

114
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.820
The big argument that the moon true Thurs make is that it was regular speed

115
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:17.240
footage and it was slowed down.
Right,
right.
And there's this dude on,

116
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.800
I can't remember the name of it.
Um,

117
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.920
but if you assume he's a filmmaker on youtube,
right.
And he just breaks down.

118
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:26.570
Why like the ability to overcrank and like shooting slow mo like that,

119
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:30.980
like didn't,
that wasn't how film cameras worked at the time,
you know.
Um,
uh,

120
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:34.850
and so,
you know,
couldn't air things in slow mo back then.
Um,

121
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.800
look you're good at,

122
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:39.020
you're good at asking questions cause you asked me to get into details that I

123
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:42.250
don't have a off the top of my head.
Um,
but that's the,
that's the argument that,

124
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.720
that the dude makes.
Um,

125
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.800
it's not one of the arguments that we make specifically on our show because we

126
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:47.380
only had six minutes,
so we did the best ones.

127
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.720
So always an interesting argument when you're talking about the moon learning.

128
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.930
I also know about how much your audience do you think is going to be fucking

129
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:56.300
furious at me for talking about this because they believe the moon landing was

130
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.380
faked to like 15% I was exactly going to be my guess.
