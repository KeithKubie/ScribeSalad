00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.899
You know when you're minding your own business,
swimming in a lake or ocean and that green

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.950
blob touches you and you're NOT DOWN.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.959
That stuff could power your house, your car,
and it could even stop global warming.

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:18.240
Hey there muckrakers, thanks for watching
DNews, I'm Trace.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.240
Algae is plural.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.529
It encompasses a large number of stemless,
rootless, leafless usually monocellular plants

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.839
that get energy from photosynthesis.

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:33.390
Algae exist in many colors, red, yellow, purple,
brown, black, and of course, green and blue-green.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.280
All of these absorb light and turn it into
energy.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.940
Algae are a basic food source for both salt
and freshwater animals and birds, their decomposition

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.320
releases minerals into the water, and their
mass provides a refuge for small fish and

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.320
invertebrates.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.600
If nature loves it so much, why don't humans?

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.640
"it's a completely renewable source, and it's
made from sunlight and carbon dioxide and

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.850
water.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.510
It's a very sustainable, renewable fuel."

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.690
That's Dave Hazleback, founder of Global Algae
Innovations.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.640
He thinks these tiny plants can be way more
valuable than they are already.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.200
Steve Woods is a mechanical engineer and he
works with Dave, turning algae into fuel for

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.680
cars, trucks, and airplanes….

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.310
The ones that we deal with are micro algae,
so it's a little single-cell and you could

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.630
start with just a single cell and grow it
all the way out and just have it multiply

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.460
and everything, just growing plants.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.310
You just feed them what they need, carbon,
hydrogen and nitrogen and stuff.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.329
They just grow and they multiply like crazy.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.720
For some DNews episodes that's a bad thing,
but for this?

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.800
You WANT it to multiply.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.700
Eventually, it will fill up these pools they
call raceways, and Steve will pull them out,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.660
drain the water, and dry it all out.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.000
That’s actually really hard by the way.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.370
The dry algae can be turned into food for
animals (or people), but…

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.290
When you feed them certain things or stress
them in certain ways they can produce oils

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.259
and different things that are beneficial for
nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals stuff and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.259
everything, so it's cool.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.600
There are over 100,000 different types of
algae, and they store energy in the form of

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600
oil.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.880
...the oil can be easily converted into drop-in
fuels which means it can be converted into

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.920
gasoline, diesel, and jet that can be used
directly in current engines.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.270
You don't need any special modifications or
anything to run an algae biofuel.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.500
The fuel that we're producing is equivalent,
is exactly the same in terms of performance

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.150
as gasoline or diesel or jet.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.540
Renewable diesel actually performs better
than petroleum-based diesels.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.970
Biofuels, like these, are energy sources that
come from living matter.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.050
They stand apart from fossil fuels (which,
by the way, also come from living matter)

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.130
because biofuels are made now, and not over
millions of years.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.800
You've probably heard of ethanol, a fuel made
from corn; it's easy to make with the industry

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.450
we already have, but it's not the best biofuel…

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.680
It takes a lot of time to grow a whole field
of corn, but to grow-out a lot of algae is

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.630
a lot faster and it's just a plant.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.070
On top of that, the U.S. Department of Energy
believes algae could be 10 or 100 times more

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.640
productive than other bioenergies!

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.980
Biofuels aren't new; Henry Ford's Model-T
was designed to run on ethanol, but ethanol

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.270
only packs half the punch of gasoline.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.880
As people recognize the issues with global
warming and climate change, biofuel technology

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.610
has only gotten better.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.610
Fossil fuels crelease carbon that was trapped
inside of our planet for millions of years,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.750
but because biofuels are plants...

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.360
"... you're capturing the carbon dioxide,
so it's not being released and that's part

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.360
of it.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.590
// You can grow algae 40 times more algae
per acre than you can with terrestrial crops

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.010
and as a result you don't have all the deforestation.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.070
On top of that, these biofuel farmers only
need the oil.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.390
Algae can be used for industrial applications
and in food and drugs.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.260
The algae even contains omega-3 and omega-6
fatty acids that are required for healthy

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.400
humans, but difficult to find in the food
chain.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.190
Algae are pretty incredible little organisms,
but this process isn't perfect yet.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.660
In the past, biofuel has been very expensive.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.920
Though, according to Dave, they're down to
two or three dollars a gallon to make it now,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.090
but they still can't make enough to compete
with larger petrogas companies.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.160
Hopefully, someday in the future, algae raceways
could replace oil fields, and gas stations

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.300
will pump out biofuel!

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.430
Algae could also stop global warming in it's
tracks!

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.900
Seeker Stories got to actually GO to the plant
in Hawaii where this biofuel is made, they

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.930
learned about how algae plants plus power
plants equal a healthier Earth.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:40.580
Check 
it out here.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.540
Would you put algae in your tank?

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.540
How about in your mouth?

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.950
I mean t is a food source after all!

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.250
