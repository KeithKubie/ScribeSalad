Hello and welcome to
YouTube Behind the Scenes

00:00:11.165 --> 00:00:13.825
My name is Matias Molinas,

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:15.627
and I am a Google Developer
Expert for YouTube APIs.

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:18.198
In this lesson you will learn

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:19.957
how to use
the YouTube Data API

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:22.924
to manage and optimize
your YouTube channels

00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:24.429
from your application.

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.594
As we saw in the first lesson,

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:29.099
the YouTube Data API
allows you to do

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.165
all the same operations you can

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:33.198
from your YouTube page,

00:00:33.198 --> 00:00:35.033
but from your application.

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:38.264
For example,
you can manage playlists,

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:40.693
upload videos,
and search.

00:00:40.693 --> 00:00:44.099
Today we will see an example
of how to use the Data API

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:47.165
to improve the performance
of your YouTube channels.

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:51.660
The API also allows you to manage
advanced features,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.033
such as InVideo Programming,

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.099
which is one of the subjects
of today's lesson.

00:00:56.099 --> 00:01:00.066
In this lesson we will see
the following subjects:

00:01:00.957 --> 00:01:03.462
tricks and strategies
for optimizing your channel,

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:05.924
how to use Channel IDs,

00:01:05.924 --> 00:01:07.924
how to manage lists,

00:01:07.924 --> 00:01:09.462
InVideo Programming,

00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:11.396
and the YouTube
Subscribe Button.

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:13.561
Are you ready?
Let's begin!

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:18.825
TRICKS AND STRATEGIES
FOR IMPROVING YOUR CHANNEL

00:01:19.627 --> 00:01:21.825
Do you know
what YouTube users do?

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:23.792
They watch and share videos.

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:26.924
As mentioned in one of
the Google I/O sessions,

00:01:26.924 --> 00:01:29.495
YouTube has more than a billion
individual users

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:32.627
that share
more than 700 videos per minute.

00:01:32.627 --> 00:01:36.858
In the U. S., there are more men
between the ages of 18 and 34

00:01:36.858 --> 00:01:39.924
participating than any
television channel.

00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:41.759
This is why
your YouTube channel

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.924
is an excellent
means of communication

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:45.693
to reach a large audience.

00:01:45.693 --> 00:01:49.726
Let's see some advice
as to how we can achieve this.

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.132
One way to do this is by
using titles, descriptions,

00:01:54.132 --> 00:01:55.792
and Tags in your videos

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:58.099
that answer user questions

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:00.066
while using
the YouTube search engine.

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:03.231
An excellent strategy
is by making tutorial videos

00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:05.759
that answer a question.

00:02:06.297 --> 00:02:08.132
Let's look at a simple example:

00:02:08.132 --> 00:02:11.627
a store that sells scarves
for your hair

00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:15.462
with a video of techniques
of how to tie up your hair.

00:02:15.462 --> 00:02:17.759
Maybe, for example,

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:19.396
for a store that sells
motorcycle helmets,

00:02:19.396 --> 00:02:22.693
it would be a good idea
to upload a video

00:02:22.693 --> 00:02:24.759
on how to choose a helmet size.

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:28.396
If you answer questions
that users might ask,

00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:31.495
like "How to tie hair?,"

00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:34.858
or, "How to choose
moto helmet?,"

00:02:34.858 --> 00:02:37.594
then your videos will come up
in a good position

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:39.660
in the search results,
and new users

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.726
will discover your channel.

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:44.594
Then you need to convince them
to subscribe,

00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:46.825
continue watching your videos,

00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:49.363
and recommend them
to new users.

00:02:49.363 --> 00:02:52.132
How do we do this first part?

00:02:52.132 --> 00:02:55.726
Well, in the first lesson
we saw how to upload videos

00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:58.363
to the channel
with the Data API.

00:02:58.363 --> 00:03:01.627
In this case, we need
to carefully decide on

00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:05.231
the title, the description,
and the Tags for the video,

00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:08.627
so that they answer
the question the user

00:03:08.627 --> 00:03:11.132
searches with.

00:03:11.132 --> 00:03:15.231
When new users arrive
at your channel through a search

00:03:15.231 --> 00:03:17.330
or because another user
shared a video with them

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.924
through a social network,

00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:21.891
try to present them with content

00:03:21.891 --> 00:03:24.957
that interests them
in subscribing to your channel.

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:28.561
One strategy you can use
to do this

00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:30.693
is buy selecting and treating

00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:32.429
the videos that appear
on your channel,

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:36.099
so that they are the most
popular to your audience.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.429
In this lesson
we will see an example

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:41.627
of how we can do this
automatically.

00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:46.132
We will see how to manage
your playlists

00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:48.462
using the YouTube Data API.

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.627
In order to get audience
interest,

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:54.726
and get new users
to subscribe to your channel,

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:56.825
you can also use tools like

00:03:56.825 --> 00:03:58.858
InVideo Programming,

00:03:58.858 --> 00:04:01.924
which is another subject
we will look at in this lesson.

00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:05.033
Finally, since what we want
is for users to subscribe

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:07.792
to your channel
so they can regularly watch

00:04:07.792 --> 00:04:10.561
your content and share it
with people they know,

00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:13.297
in the last subject
of this lesson we will see

00:04:13.297 --> 00:04:15.990
what the YouTube
Subscribe Button is.

00:04:16.825 --> 00:04:19.033
Before diving
into today's lesson,

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:21.528
I would like to give
some additional advice

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:24.495
that does not require you
to develop your own tools.

00:04:25.528 --> 00:04:27.825
Post videos by chapter

00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:30.363
and mention the chapter
in the video.

00:04:30.363 --> 00:04:32.495
This way users
may get interested

00:04:32.495 --> 00:04:35.891
and subscribe to your channel
to see the next chapters.

00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:37.825
Remember that
the business owner

00:04:37.825 --> 00:04:40.099
knows more than anyone
about their product.

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.693
This is a good strategy.

00:04:43.693 --> 00:04:46.693
To take advantage of this,
make tutorials.

00:04:46.693 --> 00:04:49.363
Users will find this content
very interesting.

00:04:49.363 --> 00:04:51.825
Respond to the questions
and the comments

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:55.429
on your video and your channel.
Build a community.

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:58.957
Use Hangouts to interact
with your audience,

00:04:58.957 --> 00:05:01.990
and to create and post videos
on your channel.

00:05:02.627 --> 00:05:05.627
HOW TO USE CHANNEL IDs

00:05:06.528 --> 00:05:08.825
On YouTube,
channels can be related

00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:11.429
to YouTube user accounts

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:13.462
or Google+ profiles.

00:05:13.462 --> 00:05:15.198
In the last example,

00:05:15.198 --> 00:05:18.429
a profile can be a Google+ page.

00:05:19.594 --> 00:05:21.924
We will see how to work
with channels

00:05:21.924 --> 00:05:24.594
from our application code

00:05:24.594 --> 00:05:26.759
considering these scenarios

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.462
where the channels
are not necessarily

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:31.594
related to a YouTube account.

00:05:31.594 --> 00:05:33.660
Remember that all the operations

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.858
done with channels
with the Data API

00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:39.561
use a Channel ID

00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:41.726
to identify the channel.

00:05:42.957 --> 00:05:46.165
STEP 1
WAYS TO OBTAIN THE CHANNEL ID

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.990
This is how you can obtain
the ID for the channel

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.033
that corresponds
to the user account.

00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:57.198
If you are sure that the channel
is related to

00:05:57.198 --> 00:05:59.363
a YouTube user account,

00:05:59.363 --> 00:06:01.363
such as with
accounts prior to

00:06:01.363 --> 00:06:03.132
Google+ integration,

00:06:03.132 --> 00:06:06.297
then you can make
the following call

00:06:06.297 --> 00:06:09.198
to the Data API
to obtain the Channel ID.

00:06:10.165 --> 00:06:13.132
If you only know the name
of the channel shown on YouTube,

00:06:13.132 --> 00:06:15.825
then you can obtain
the Channel ID

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:18.957
with the following search
through the Data API.

00:06:19.957 --> 00:06:23.693
But, in this case,
you should be prepared

00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:27.264
to deal with cases
when the search turns up

00:06:27.264 --> 00:06:30.099
more than one result,
since the name of the channel

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.132
on YouTube
isn't necessarily unique.

00:06:33.165 --> 00:06:36.330
STEP 2
OBTAIN DATA ABOUT CHANNEL

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.462
Once you obtain
the Channel ID,

00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:41.330
you can obtain
all your channel data

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.759
using the Data API,

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.132
such as statistics
and brandingSettings.

00:06:48.132 --> 00:06:50.924
To obtain the resource
for brandingSettings

00:06:50.924 --> 00:06:53.759
for your channel,
and following prior examples,

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.528
you could use the following call
to the Data API.

00:06:57.528 --> 00:06:58.990
These channel resources

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.924
include the following
useful data

00:07:00.924 --> 00:07:03.594
to monitor channel performance

00:07:03.594 --> 00:07:05.429
or change its appearance.

00:07:05.594 --> 00:07:08.792
STEP 3
ACTUALIZE CHANNEL APPEARANCE

00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:11.792
One feature that you
can actualize automatically

00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:13.594
from the application

00:07:13.594 --> 00:07:15.627
is the Channel Banner.

00:07:15.627 --> 00:07:19.231
This image is used as an identity

00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:22.594
and YouTube adapts it
to different devices for you.

00:07:22.594 --> 00:07:25.297
You can use different criteria
to actualize and optimize

00:07:25.297 --> 00:07:27.693
your Channel Banner.

00:07:27.693 --> 00:07:30.297
I recommend you look at

00:07:30.297 --> 00:07:31.891
the Google Analytics experiments,

00:07:31.891 --> 00:07:34.363
which are an excellent resource

00:07:34.363 --> 00:07:37.462
for presenting various
Banner options

00:07:37.462 --> 00:07:38.957
to your users on a web page,

00:07:38.957 --> 00:07:40.759
and by experiment results

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:43.561
through Google Analytics,

00:07:43.561 --> 00:07:45.198
decide which is the best option
for your Banner.

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.231
Once you have
an optimal mechanism

00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:49.528
for your Banner,
such as, for example,

00:07:49.528 --> 00:07:51.825
the Google Analytics
experiments,

00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:54.891
we will we how
you can use the results

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:58.495
to actualize
your Channel Banner.

00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:01.792
There are only three steps.

00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:05.627
Call channelBanners, then Insert.

00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:08.066
This allows you to upload
binary data to YouTube

00:08:08.066 --> 00:08:11.264
for a new image.

00:08:11.264 --> 00:08:14.858
Be sure to check that this image
has an aspect ratio of 16:9

00:08:14.858 --> 00:08:20.594
and at least 2048 x 1152 pixels.

00:08:20.594 --> 00:08:25.231
Obtain the URL property
from the API reply

00:08:25.231 --> 00:08:28.033
from the call made
during the last Step.

00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:31.693
Call the channelUpdate method

00:08:31.693 --> 00:08:35.891
to specify the corresponding URL
for the new banner

00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:37.792
that you obtained in Step 2

00:08:37.792 --> 00:08:39.792
in the brandingSettings property

00:08:39.792 --> 00:08:42.858
Image, bannerExternalURL.

00:08:44.792 --> 00:08:48.792
HOW TO MANAGE
PLAYLISTS

00:08:48.792 --> 00:08:51.363
When new users
arrive at your channel,

00:08:51.363 --> 00:08:53.957
you should try to show them
appealing content

00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:57.660
That is, you should try to treat
your channel content,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.825
playlists, and videos.

00:08:59.825 --> 00:09:02.198
To do this, you need to
highlight and add

00:09:02.198 --> 00:09:03.792
the videos with the most votes,

00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:06.495
and remove the videos
with less activity.

00:09:06.495 --> 00:09:08.396
This is a situation
where we can use

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:11.660
the YouTube Analytics Data API.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.957
But, to make it easier,
we will only use the Data API

00:09:14.957 --> 00:09:18.429
to organize the videos
from a list with the "likes."

00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:20.693
Before seeing an example,

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:22.627
let's look at real examples
of channels

00:09:22.627 --> 00:09:25.396
that treat their content,
and, thanks to this,

00:09:25.396 --> 00:09:27.495
achieve excellent results.

00:09:27.495 --> 00:09:29.528
We have the Gaturro channel,

00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:32.330
PopartDiscos Argentina
or María Elena Walsh.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.462
If you also want your channel
to present appealing content,

00:09:35.462 --> 00:09:38.297
I suggest an example
where we can select

00:09:38.297 --> 00:09:40.264
what videos to add
and what videos to remove

00:09:40.264 --> 00:09:42.363
from a playlist

00:09:42.363 --> 00:09:45.594
thereby making your channel
a lot more interesting.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.495
STEP 1
CREATE A PLAYLIST

00:09:49.495 --> 00:09:52.495
In the first step
we create a playlist

00:09:52.495 --> 00:09:54.429
about a particular subject.

00:09:54.429 --> 00:09:56.165
We are going to choose,
for example,

00:09:56.165 --> 00:09:58.627
the Google Developers
Live videos,

00:09:58.627 --> 00:10:00.726
but you can do the same
with your content,

00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:02.396
that is, with your videos.

00:10:02.396 --> 00:10:05.429
We are going
to create a playlist

00:10:05.429 --> 00:10:07.297
about Google Developers
Live videos

00:10:07.297 --> 00:10:09.363
on our channel.

00:10:11.924 --> 00:10:15.099
STEP 2
ADD A VIDEO TO YOUR LIST

00:10:15.957 --> 00:10:17.330
For the second step,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.429
we are going to use
the Universal Search

00:10:19.429 --> 00:10:21.165
to find videos on this subject

00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:23.429
and add and organize them
by their number of "likes"

00:10:23.429 --> 00:10:25.330
on our playlist.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.759
Let's look at the code.

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:34.264
CHOOSE THE MOST POPULAR
AND ADD THEM TO YOUR LISTS

00:10:34.858 --> 00:10:38.726
INVIDEO
PROGRAMMING

00:10:38.726 --> 00:10:41.462
You have seen how to make
your channel more appealing

00:10:41.462 --> 00:10:44.198
by treating the content
you present to your audience.

00:10:44.198 --> 00:10:46.693
Now let's see how you can
promote your channel

00:10:46.693 --> 00:10:50.033
by including appealing content
in each video.

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:52.858
This means, in the videos
shown on your channel

00:10:52.858 --> 00:10:55.099
that are embedded
in a web page

00:10:55.099 --> 00:10:58.165
or those shared in a post
on a social network.

00:10:58.165 --> 00:11:00.792
In order to do this,
YouTube provides us

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:03.495
with a tool called:
InVideo programming.

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:05.429
This tool allows us to specify

00:11:05.429 --> 00:11:07.594
a Watermark or a Miniature

00:11:07.594 --> 00:11:09.660
with a link to a video.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.099
This video should be appealing
and represent your channel.

00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:17.363
You can program it to be seen

00:11:17.363 --> 00:11:18.891
in all your videos

00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:21.495
such as with annotations,

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:24.033
while checking that
it will be seen correctly

00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:25.858
on all devices.

00:11:25.858 --> 00:11:28.594
InVideo Programming also allows
you to create a link

00:11:28.594 --> 00:11:30.726
to your social network pages

00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:32.792
with a personalized message.

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:35.726
This way you can communicate
with your audience

00:11:35.726 --> 00:11:37.759
through various
different ways.

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:40.726
You can actualize the watermark
or the video you use

00:11:40.726 --> 00:11:42.561
with InVideo Programming,
and it will actualize

00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:45.363
automatically
in all your videos,

00:11:45.363 --> 00:11:48.297
without needing to actualize
or upload them again.

00:11:48.297 --> 00:11:51.066
It's incredible,

00:11:51.066 --> 00:11:52.825
but can we use this
from the Data API?

00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:54.561
Yes, of course.

00:11:54.561 --> 00:11:57.165
Let's look at some scenarios
where we will use these tools

00:11:57.165 --> 00:11:59.693
from you application.

00:12:00.957 --> 00:12:04.132
STEP 1
ACTUALIZE HIGHLIGHTED VIDEO

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:08.330
If your YouTube channel
is related to one on TV,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.462
you can rotate the video you use
with InVideo Programming

00:12:11.462 --> 00:12:13.957
so it changes
every day of the week,

00:12:13.957 --> 00:12:17.099
on the weekends,
or according to the hour,

00:12:17.099 --> 00:12:20.363
so it lines up
with your TV channel guide.

00:12:20.627 --> 00:12:23.792
STEP 2
INTEGRATE OTHER CHANNELS

00:12:24.726 --> 00:12:26.858
For the second step,
we will see

00:12:26.858 --> 00:12:29.198
how to add a link
to your Twitter account

00:12:29.198 --> 00:12:30.891
with InVideo Programming

00:12:30.891 --> 00:12:33.429
to allow your audience to click

00:12:33.429 --> 00:12:35.825
and continue the conversation
on another channel.

00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:40.627
STEP 3
SIGN YOUR VIDEOS

00:12:41.495 --> 00:12:43.594
You can use
InVideo Programming

00:12:43.594 --> 00:12:45.792
to actualize the watermark.

00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:48.495
The ideal way to do this,
and to optimize your channel,

00:12:48.495 --> 00:12:51.462
is by doing it through
a Google Analytics experiment,

00:12:51.462 --> 00:12:54.495
or with YouTube Analytics
experiments.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.363
YOUTUBE SUSCRIBE BUTTON

00:12:59.363 --> 00:13:02.495
We have seen tricks and advice
for creating content

00:13:02.495 --> 00:13:05.858
that can be found
through searching on YouTube.

00:13:05.858 --> 00:13:09.957
Then we saw how to treat
your playlists

00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:12.099
to make your channel
more appealing.

00:13:12.099 --> 00:13:14.759
Also, we saw how to use
InVideo Programming

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:17.429
to highlight your best content

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:21.099
and invite people
to subscribe to your channel.

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:23.462
Now let's see
how to use a Widget that,

00:13:23.462 --> 00:13:26.792
from your web page,
allows them to subscribe.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.264
The YouTube Subscribe Button
allows you to add a button

00:13:31.264 --> 00:13:34.957
to subscribe to your channel
from any web page.

00:13:34.957 --> 00:13:38.495
It also allows users
to subscribe to the channel

00:13:38.495 --> 00:13:40.792
without having to leave
your web page.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.132
STEP 1
ADD THE JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY

00:13:45.165 --> 00:13:47.297
To add the button
on your web page,

00:13:47.297 --> 00:13:49.132
include the following javascript

00:13:49.132 --> 00:13:53.231
on the web page where you want
to add the subscription button.

00:13:53.429 --> 00:13:56.594
STEP 2
CREATE YOUR BUTTON

00:13:57.396 --> 00:14:01.297
You can add a button
with an element such as Div

00:14:01.297 --> 00:14:03.660
and specifying a special class.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.660
If you want, for example,
to create a subscription button

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.627
for the Google Developers
channel,

00:14:08.627 --> 00:14:11.165
the necessary code
would be the following.

00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:19.693
STEP 3
PERSONALIZE IT

00:14:20.429 --> 00:14:22.990
You can personalize the button
by including a display

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.264
or by changing the theme.

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:27.033
You can also choose

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:30.330
by the number of
subscribers to your channel.

00:14:32.297 --> 00:14:34.561
I hope you enjoyed this lesson.

00:14:34.561 --> 00:14:37.957
We learned how to use
the Data API to,

00:14:37.957 --> 00:14:40.495
from your application
or from your web page,

00:14:40.495 --> 00:14:42.825
improve the performance
of your YouTube channel.

00:14:42.825 --> 00:14:45.759
The goal is that new users
find your channel

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:47.825
through YouTube searches,

00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:50.231
or through videos embedded
on a web page,

00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:52.858
or videos shared
on social networks,

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:54.990
and then visit your channel
and find

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.330
treated and appealing content.
And, finally,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.759
subscribe and become
part of your audience.

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:03.957
See you in the next lesson!
