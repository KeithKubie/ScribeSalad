00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.340
A typical resistance spot welder like this
can range in price from around $200 to over

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.180
$800! That's a little out of my price range,
so for this project let's make this one from

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.080
common materials, and for just a few bucks!

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.680
This modified transformer is the heart of
the Spot Welder, and you might remember it

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.030
as the "Metal Melter". If this doesn't look
familiar, check out how this was made, and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.310
what it can do, in some of my other videos.
I found a practical application for it in

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.040
making a spot welder like this one. To get
started, I'm going to measure the base of

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.930
the transformer, and it looks like it's about
4-1/4" wide. I found a 6' piece of 1x6" common

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.829
board that will be perfect for this. Using
my chop saw, I'll cut two pieces of the board

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.520
so that they're both 12" long, then another
piece gets cut at 42". I'm trimming this piece

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.100
down with my table saw, so that it's about
1/4" wider than the transformer base, and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.499
in this case that measures out at 4-1/2".
Then it gets chopped into 3 different lengths

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:24.350
measuring 24", 12", and 4". Next, I found
a 2x2 and am cutting the nicest parts of the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.880
beam into two pieces measuring 13-1/2" long.
2 other pieces are cut at 4" and everything

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.149
can be placed together to see how it fits.
That's the rough idea right there, and I'd

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.700
like to knock down the sharp edges, so I've
found a 3/4" rounding bit and routed the appropriate

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.659
edges to give it a smoother feel. These front
pieces are going to be my electrode holders.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.229
The edge of this scrap piece of wood works
as a template to draw a 90ยบ angle into the

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.479
top piece about an inch from the end. I don't
have a bandsaw, so I'm improvising with my

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.240
bench vise and a jigsaw to cut this piece
out, and it worked. You'll see what this groove

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.850
is for in a bit. The next part is to cut out
the pattern I drew onto the back panel, so

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.420
I'm going to utilize my vise once again, and
use an 11/32 drill bit to cut holes in all

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.610
the corners so I can get back in there with
my jigsaw. These holes will be for a switch

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.900
and a power cord, and all this panel needs
now are two pilot holes drilled in the appropriate

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.280
places for the switch. I'm thinking I should
give this a paint job, so all the panels get

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.870
sanded with an orbital sander, then laid out
for priming and painting. I'm thinking black

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.780
and yellow. With the paint drying, I've gathered
up a few components that were saved from the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.320
same microwave I got the transformer from.
To see all the amazing things I got from that

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.630
project, make sure you check out my video
on salvaging a microwave I found in my neighbors

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.750
trashcan. I'm going to use the power cord,
these wired spade connectors, the door handle,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.560
and this contact switch. Aside from the wood,
the only parts I needed to buy were a single-pole

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.850
light switch, with matching cover, copper
offset terminal lugs, a couple of 1/4 thick

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.250
screws, 2 small nails and a length of 6 gauge
solid copper wire. The copper wire gets marked

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.210
off in 1" increments, and two pieces are cut
off using the wire cutter on my pliers. These

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.530
are going to work as my welding tips. The
copper lugs have an adjustable screw that

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.580
can be loosened to insert the solid copper
wire. When it's tightened back up it looks

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.280
like this. Alright the paint on the wood panels
is dry, and I've added the switch to the back

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.410
panel to make sure it fits, so the next step
is to flip it over and press the power cord

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.270
down into the hole at the bottom. The thick
piece at the end of the cord prevents it from

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.160
pulling back through the hole. I'm ready to
piece this back together, so I'm drilling

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.000
a couple of pilot holes into the bottom, and
securing the back panel with a couple of screws.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.280
Now the front 2x2 supports are added and the
Metal Melter is placed on the base about an

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.600
inch back from the supports. I'll add a screw
to one of the corners to help keep it in place,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.230
and at this point I'm ready to rig up the
electrical system. Taking the green wire from

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.900
the power cord, I'm stripping open a gap in
the plastic to expose the bare cord. This

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.230
will wrap around the grounding screw on the
power switch. The end of the wire has a hole

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.350
I can use to insert another short screw, and
work that down into the opposite corner of

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.450
the transformer base. Not only does this secure
the Metal Melter in place, it also grounds

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.740
out the transformer core at the same time.
Ok, I've exposed the copper on the black wire,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.590
and that will get connected to the bottom
terminal of the power switch and screwed down

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.720
tight. This salvaged spade connector still
fits onto one of the transformers primary

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.759
terminals, so with that on, the other end
of the wire can be connected to the top terminal

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.970
of the power switch. Now the switch can be
screwed down permanently, and a cover plate

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.550
added to protect from electric shock and make
it look nice. The other spade connector that

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.530
was salvaged goes on the left terminal of
the primary coil, and we could finish the

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.880
electrical here, but I want to add one more
switch, for convenience. This switch still

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.650
has the original wires and connectors from
the microwave, and I've just added a wrap

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.350
of electrical tape to make sure I don't get
shocked while touching it. I'll strip the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.520
end of the white wire, and twist it together
with the other white wire coming off the primary,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.680
then use a wire nut to cover the connection.
Now the black wire is joined with the white

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.910
wire coming from the power cable, and the
electrical system is complete. I added this

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.230
microwave door handle to the top panel and
am screwing it on to see how it holds up.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.540
The alignment looks good, and when I pick
it up it seems to support the weight without

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.930
any problem. Alright, with the cables laying
out the front, it's time to close up the side

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.910
panels, and I'm doing that by drilling holes
and adding six screws on each panel, to make

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.000
sure it's held securely. The next step is
to construct these electrode holders. I chose

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.130
to use a 3/16th bit to drill a hole into both
tips of the 2x2's, which you can see got painted

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.740
yellow. The hole is big enough to prevent
the wood from splitting when these screws

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.120
go in, yet small enough to hold them secure.
This is the top piece and I'm going to add

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.610
the switch to the side, about 1/2" from the
tip. It gets set at a slight angle and the

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.910
two small nails are hammered down into the
holes already in the switch. Now the 2 beams

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.419
can be slid into the front of the casing,
with one under the wire, and the other overtop.

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.750
To secure them in place, I'm using some scrap
wood to keep them an equal distance apart

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.700
as I drill a hole through the side of the
casing, and into the beam. I've pushed a nail

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.850
into the hole, and now you can see this top
piece is able to pivot freely. It should be

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.160
obvious now why we needed that notch near
the base. The bottom beam also gets a hole

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.900
drilled on either side, as well as it's own
set of nails to keep it from sliding around.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.910
The welding tips can be attached now, so we
push one of the hex screws through the hole

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.250
in the lug, and then join it to the right
side cable. That gets tightened securely into

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.910
our pilot hole, and all that gets repeated
on the top. The misalignments can be fixed

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.850
by bending the lugs slightly inward, and now
we've got perfect contact. To finish this

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.419
off, I'd like a way for the top beam to stay
suspended on it's own. So to address the challenge,

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:34.330
I'll add a couple of screws and a thick rubber
band. This system is finished! My very own

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:40.060
spot welder, and for less than $10 in materials.
Let's see if it works. Power cord plugs in,

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.860
and with the electrode tips touching, I'll
press the button to engage. But nothing's

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.400
happening. That's because the safety switch
is still off. Let's try it again. This time

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.370
when I press the button, the system hums,
and when the tips touch, I see the high-amp

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.699
sparks I was hoping for. I don't have any
sheet metal handy, so I decided to try using

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.000
these washers for my first experiment. The
pressure holds them I'm place hands free,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.620
and with the system energized, it only takes
about 3 seconds to fuse them together. I'm

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.260
trying it again with a third washer, being
careful not to touch these, because they're

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.190
extremely hot. Surprisingly, it even worked
on thicker welds like melting a washer to

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:19.370
this steel spike. Trying to break them apart
by hand was a fruitless effort, so I tried

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.790
using pliers and even that was a bit of a
challenge, but I got it. That just goes to

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.370
show the welds are pretty strong. A feature
I really like about this design, is that the

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.040
electrode holders can be removed, allowing
the user to extend the welders reach, and

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.400
access difficult angles. They go back in as
easily as they came out, and all it takes

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.120
to secure them back in place is a little wiggle
and the replacement of the locking nails.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.990
The elastic band is easy to replace, and is
doing a great job providing back tension after

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:52.130
I make a connection. I tried welding a couple
of iron nails in an "X" pattern, and since

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.759
the heat was concentrated in the center, it
didn't burn my fingers. The power of the Metal

00:07:56.759 --> 00:08:01.479
Melter is still evident in the way the iron
is boiling on this nail, and if allowed to

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:06.270
continue, the nail melts down into a little
ball of liquid metal. When it's time to replace

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.740
the electrode tips, just loosen the tensioner,
remove the spent electrode, and replace with

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.300
a fresh piece of your copper wire. If you
do it this way, you can get 12 tips for a

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.220
buck! Because the wires not that expensive.
Well now you know how to make my version of

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.380
a spot welder from easily accessible, and
low-cost parts. If you liked this project,
