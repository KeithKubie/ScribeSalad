00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.929
The answer is none of the above actually work. Well, if we did the close here,

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.816
that would work as long as there's no exceptions. The problem is, what happens

00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:13.908
if we had an exception on the writing. Well, that would jump to the except

00:00:13.908 --> 00:00:18.348
handler. We'd never close the file. So, maybe it's better to do the close here.

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:21.850
Well, then that would close the file in the case where there's an exception, but

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.380
if we didn't also close it here, it wouldn't close it when there's no exception.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.644
We could try to do it here. And for this code, this may be the best answer other

00:00:31.644 --> 00:00:37.042
than none of the above. Where we go into trouble if we close the code here, if

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:41.820
say inside the exception block we exited. Which would be a fairly common thing

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.756
to do, if we don't want the program to proceed if it can't write to file. It

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:48.780
would also be a problem if we weren't able to open the file, which is probably

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.298
the most common reason for the exception. Well, then there's no file to close.

00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:55.413
So, we've got a problem, none of these work.
