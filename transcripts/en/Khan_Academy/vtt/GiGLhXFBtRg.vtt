00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.360
I want to do a quick refresher
on medians of triangles,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.440
and also explore an interesting
property of them that

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.960
will be useful, I think,
in future problems.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.030
So let me just draw an
arbitrary triangle over here.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.620
Now that's good enough.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.620
Now a median of the
triangle-- and we'll

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.540
see a triangle has
three of them--

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.320
is just a line that
connects a vertex

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.790
of the triangle with the
midpoint of the opposite side.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.660
So the opposite side's midpoint
looks right about there.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.460
This length is equal
to that length.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.280
And so this is a median.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.437
Close enough.

00:00:36.437 --> 00:00:38.020
And of course, we
have three vertices,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.930
so we'll have three medians.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.388
If we start at this
vertex, we want

00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:42.910
to go to the midpoint
of the opposite side.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.890
It looks right about there.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.480
So this blue line right
over here is another median.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.980
It's not a completely
straight line,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.188
but I think you get the idea.

00:00:51.188 --> 00:00:53.870
Then we could also do it from
this point right over here.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.920
Draw a line from this
vertex to the midpoint

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.970
of the opposite side.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.350
Let's see, the midpoint of
the opposite side is there.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.810
And we draw a line.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.313
Each of these-- I could draw
a straighter line than that.

00:01:05.313 --> 00:01:06.550
Let me draw it.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.710
There.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.001
Well, I think you get the idea.

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.860
These are all medians
of this triangle.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.040
And what's neat about medians
is that all three medians always

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.780
intersect in one point.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.730
And that by itself is
a pretty neat property.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.490
And that one point
that they intersect in

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.448
is called the centroid.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.590
And if this was actually
a physical triangle,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.170
let's say you made
it out of iron,

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.717
and if you were to toss it--
well, even before you toss it,

00:01:35.717 --> 00:01:37.800
the centroid would actually
be the center of mass.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.240
So let's say this
is an iron triangle.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.930
Let's say that this right
here is an iron triangle that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.940
has its centroid
right over here,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.670
then this iron
triangle's center of mass

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.570
would be where the
centroid is, assuming

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.240
it has a uniform density.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.020
And if you were to throw
that iron triangle,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.910
it would rotate
around this point.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.330
Assuming that it had
some rotational motion,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.200
it would rotate
around that centroid,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.632
or around the center of mass.

00:02:07.632 --> 00:02:09.090
But anyway, the
point of this video

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.360
is not to focus on physics
and throwing iron triangles.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.660
The point here is I want to show
you a neat property of medians.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.620
And the property is that
if you pick any median,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.980
the distance from the centroid
to the midpoint of the opposite

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.800
side-- so this
distance-- is going

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.820
to be half of this distance.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.990
So if this distance
right here is a,

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.440
then this distance
right here is 2a.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.750
Or another way to think
about it is this distance

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.630
is 2/3 of the length
of the entire median,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.170
and this distance
right here is 1/3

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.440
of the length of
the entire median.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.090
And let's just prove
it for ourselves

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.120
just so you don't have
to take things on faith.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.750
And to do that, I'll draw
an arbitrary triangle.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.340
I'll do a
two-dimensional triangle,

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.756
and I'll do it in
three dimensions

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.210
because at least in
my mind, it makes

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.040
the math a little bit easier.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.070
In general, whenever you
have an n-dimensional figure

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.230
and you embed it in
n plus 1 dimensions,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.140
it makes the math a
little bit easier.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.204
The actual tetrahedron
problem that we did,

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:10.120
you could actually embed
it in four dimensions

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.140
and it would make
the math easier.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.750
It's just much
harder to visualize,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.080
so I didn't do it that way.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.530
But let's just have
an arbitrary triangle.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.600
And let's say it has
a vertex and there,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.692
a vertex there,
and a vertex there.

00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:22.900
So I'm not making any
assumptions about the triangle.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.316
I'm not saying it's isosceles,
or equilateral or anything.

00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:27.150
It's just an arbitrary triangle.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.180
And so let's say this
coordinate right over here

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.660
is-- I'll call this the x-axis.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.975
So, this is the x-axis,
the y-axis, and the z-axis.

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:40.350
I know some of y'all are used
to swapping these two axes,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.730
but it doesn't
make a difference.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.470
So let's call this coordinate
right here a, 0, 0.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.840
So it's a along the x-axis.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.960
Let's call this
coordinate 0, b, 0.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.299
And let's call this
coordinate up here, 0, 0, c.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.840
And if you connect
the points, you're

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.940
going to have a
triangle just like that.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.145
Now, the centroid of a triangle,
especially in three dimensions.

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:12.620
The centroid of a
triangle is just

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.829
going to be the average of the
coordinates of the vertices.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.170
Or the coordinate
of the centroid

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.280
here is just going
to be the average

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.914
of the coordinates
of the vertices.

00:04:25.914 --> 00:04:27.330
So this coordinate
right over here

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.560
is going to be-- so
for the x-coordinate,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.830
we have 0 plus 0 plus a.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.330
So we have three coordinates.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.380
They add up to a, and
we have to divide by 3.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.550
So it's a over 3.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.160
The y-coordinate is
going to b plus 0 plus 0.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.090
They add up to b, but
we have three of them,

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.144
so the average is b over 3.

00:04:45.144 --> 00:04:47.310
And then same thing-- we
do it for the z-coordinate.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.282
The average is going
to be c, is c over 3.

00:04:50.282 --> 00:04:51.990
And I'm not proving
it to you right here.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.900
You could verify
it for yourself.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.690
But it's going to
be the average,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.970
that if you were to figure
out what this line is,

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.450
this line is, and this line is,
this centroid, or this center

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.060
of mass of this triangle,
if it had some mass,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.660
is just the average
of these coordinates.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.480
Now, what we want to do
is use this information.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.530
Let's just use this
coordinate right here

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.710
and then compare just
using the distance formula.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:23.120
Let's compare this distance up
here in orange to this distance

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.180
down here in yellow.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.740
And remember, this
point right over here--

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.490
this is the median of this
bottom side right over here.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.880
It's just going to be the
average of these two points.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.270
And so the x-coordinate--
0 plus a over 2

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.080
is going to be a over 2.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.380
b plus 0 over 2 is
going to be b over 2.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.815
And then it has
no z-coordinates,

00:05:45.815 --> 00:05:47.430
so it's just going to be 0.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.294
0 plus 0 over 2 is 0.

00:05:49.294 --> 00:05:51.460
So we know the coordinates
for this point that point

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.145
and that point.

00:05:52.145 --> 00:05:53.770
So we can calculate
the yellow distance

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.800
and we can calculate
the orange distance.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.800
So let's calculate
the orange distance.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:06.870
So that is going to be equal
to the square root of--

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.640
and we just take the
difference of each

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.850
of these points squared.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.890
So it's a over 3
minus 0 squared.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.010
So that's going to
be a squared over 9,

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.870
plus b over 3 minus 0 squared.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.770
So that's b squared over 9.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:28.413
Plus c over 3 minus c,
which is negative 2/3.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.680
And we want to square that.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:40.750
So we're going to have
positive 4 over 9c squared.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.860
Did I do that right? c over 3,
so 1/3 minus 1 is negative 2/3.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.090
So this is negative 2/3 c.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.940
You square it.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.590
You're going to
get 4/9 c squared.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.630
So that's the orange distance.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.370
Now, let's calculate--
and if we want to do it,

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.214
we can express
this-- let me express

00:06:58.214 --> 00:06:59.630
it a little bit
simpler than this.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.210
This is the same thing as the
square root of a squared plus b

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.850
squared plus 4c squared over
the square root of 9, which

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:15.200
is just equal to 3.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.410
Now let's do the same thing
with the yellow distance.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.490
So it's going to be equal
to the square root of-- so

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.440
if we have a over
2 minus a over 3.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.560
So 1/2 minus 1/3-- that's the
same thing as 3/6 minus 2/6,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.437
so it's 1/6 a.

00:07:33.437 --> 00:07:39.880
1/6 a squared is
a squared over 36.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.430
b over 2 minus b
over 3 is b over 6.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.590
You square it.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.370
You get plus b squared over 36.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.660
And then finally you have
0 minus c over 3 squared.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.510
That's going to be
c squared over 9.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.560
But just so we get a common
denominator, c squared over 9

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.720
is the same thing as
plus 4c squared over 36.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.910
And we can rewrite this as the
square root of a squared plus b

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:15.100
squared plus 4c squared over 6.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.760
So you can see,
this distance right

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.880
here, if you multiply this
orange distance by 1/2,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.380
you're going to get-- so if you
multiply the orange distance

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:28.290
by 1/2 or if you divide it by
2, you get the yellow distance.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.740
So this is always going to
be twice the distance as this

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.159
because we did this in the
most general possible way.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.890
We assumed nothing
about this triangle.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.450
So remember that little
property that the centroid,

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.470
the intersection of the
medians-- the intersection

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:49.010
happens 2/3 away from the vertex
or 1/3 the length of the median

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.600
away from the midpoint
of the opposite side.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.474
And we can use that
property in-- well,

00:08:54.474 --> 00:08:56.390
we'lll probably use it
in a bunch of problems.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.527
But anyway, hopefully you
found that interesting.
