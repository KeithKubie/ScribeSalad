00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.580
I just received this drug
calculation problem from a

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.250
nursing student, and I think
it's essential that the nursing

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.890
students out there are able to
do this, just in case I'm the

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.360
patient receiving the drug.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.890
So let's do it.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.450
And I think it's an interesting
unit conversion problem for

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.020
pretty much anyone who wants
practice with unit conversion.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.570
So the question is that
we have a doctor.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.750
The doctor orders drug x.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.790
And this is the dosage that
the doctor's requesting.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:39.540
They're saying 5 milligrams per
pound of patient weight-- I'll

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.800
just write per pound of patient
weight-- every 12 hours.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.710
This is what we're
supposed to do.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:58.140
But our supply of the drug--
it isn't just, you know, not

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.440
just nuggets and milligrams.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.350
It's a solution.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.210
There's a certain amount of
grams for every milliliter

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.340
that we have of the solution.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.190
It's dissolved in some water.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.035
So this is our
supply of drug x.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.070
We have 0.9-- I'll
write a 0 in front.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.600
My wife, who is a doctor, says
it's essential to write the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.990
0 in front of the decimal.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.920
We have 0.9 grams per
milliliter of solution.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.830
So if I were to take 1
milliliter out of my solution

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.420
and give it to someone, I'm
essentially giving them

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.900
0.9 grams of this drug.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.960
And the final piece of
information we're given is that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.320
the patient-- they weigh-- and
maybe we should say they mass,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.730
because kilograms is mass,
but we get the idea.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.790
The patient is 72.7 kilograms.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.090
So there's a couple
interesting things here.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.050
We have to figure out the
dosage in terms of milliliters.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.760
We have to-- oh, actually,
I didn't even tell

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.580
you the question.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.070
The question is, how many
milliliters of solution

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.500
do we have to give to
the patient per dose?

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.420
So milliliters of
solution per dose.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.750
That's our question.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.430
And there's a couple of things.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.010
We have to go from
milligrams to grams.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.290
And then convert that
to milliliters.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.530
And then they tell us per
pound, but then they gave us

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.480
the patient's weight, or
their mass, in kilograms.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.830
So we have to do some
conversion there.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.250
So I definitely can appreciate
how this can be a little

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.900
daunting and maybe
confusing at times.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.100
So let's just do
it step by step.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.450
So the first interesting
thing-- and this is just

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.210
something that you might need
to know, or you might have

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.250
written down on paper, or you
might have a calculator that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.610
does this-- is just how to
convert kilograms to pounds.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.760
And it's good to know in
general, if you're converting

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.570
between the metric and
the English systems.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.520
So 1 kilogram is approximately
equal to 2.2 pounds.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
Not exactly, but that's a
pretty good approximation.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.870
And 1 pound-- if you just take
1 over that-- 1 pound is

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.550
approximately equal
to 0.45 kilograms.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.960
So we'll just put
this in a box.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.250
This is the only kind of
outside conversion information

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.640
we'll need to do this problem.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.900
Everything else, we'll just
need a calculator, unless we

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.570
just want to spend a lot of
time doing some arithmetic.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.210
So the first thing.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.500
Let's figure out our dosage
in terms of per kilogram.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.970
This is per pound, and
we really don't need to

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.210
know every 12 hours.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.330
Because they're saying, how
many milliliters of solution

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.960
do we do per dose?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.240
A dose is every 12 hours.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.700
So we just really, you know--
the every 12 hours is kind

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.740
of extra information.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.730
So we want to figure out this
5 milligrams per pound.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.105
How do we convert that to how
many milligrams per kilogram?

00:03:57.105 --> 00:04:01.180
So let's do 5-- I'll write
it down here in magenta--

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.180
5 milligrams per pound.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.905
And then we want to convert
this to per kilogram.

00:04:08.905 --> 00:04:12.600
So we can multiply this times
the number of pounds per

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.830
kilogram-- I'll do it
in yellow-- times this

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.550
information up here.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:25.300
Times 2.2 pounds per kilogram.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.760
And if you ever get confused--
you know, gee, how did Sal know

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.790
to multiply by 2.2 instead
of dividing by 2.2?

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.360
Which is the same thing
as multiplying by 0.5.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.300
You can pay very close
attention to the units.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.230
Notice, I wrote 2.2
pounds per kilogram.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.910
2.2 pounds per 1 kilogram.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.820
And you know this'll work out,
because you have a pound in

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.190
the numerator and you have
a pound in the denominator.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.430
It's called
dimensional analysis.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.500
If you ever get confused with
these things-- and I think,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.560
once you do enough practice,
you'll find that you won't

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.900
have to pay too much
attention to this.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.250
But at first, when you're
getting started, just to make

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.360
sure you're not multiplying
or dividing by the wrong

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.260
thing, just make sure the
dimensions cancel out.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.320
Pounds in the numerator,
pounds in the denominator.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.360
So let's do that.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.110
Pounds in the numerator, pounds
in the denominator cancel out.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.540
And you multiply 5 times 2.2.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.290
This is equal to-- let's see.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.850
5 times 2 is 10.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.845
5 times 0.2 is 1.

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:27.140
So this is equal to 11.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.340
And then in our numerator,
we have milligrams.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.300
11 milligrams per kilogram.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.160
So we just converted our
dosage information to

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.890
a pure metric system.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.770
It was actually a mix
between the metric and the

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.180
English system before.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.200
Now let's see what we can do.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.140
Well, let's see if we can get
it in terms of how many

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.460
milliliters we have to
deliver per pound.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.660
So once again, we want this--
well, actually, let's

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.000
go to grams first.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.190
Because we have
milligrams here.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.310
We have grams up here.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.580
So let's see if we can
convert this thing to grams.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.780
So just like we did before,
we want a milligrams

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.742
in the denominator.

00:06:04.742 --> 00:06:06.030
I'll do it in orange.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.480
We want a milligrams in the
denominator and we want

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.230
a gram in the numerator.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.120
Why did I say that?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.180
Because I want this
and this to cancel.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.050
And I want a grams
in the numerator.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.280
So how many grams are
there per milligram?

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.180
You can just think it through.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.510
There's 1 gram per
1,000 milligrams.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.160
Or 1,000 milligrams per gram.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.330
And you just multiply it out.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.160
So the milligrams cancels with
the milligrams, and then

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.335
we get-- this is equal to
11/1,000 grams per kilogram.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.790
So now we have everything in
terms of grams, but we want

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.060
it in terms of milliliters.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.200
The question is, how
many milliliters of

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.780
solution per dose?

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.880
So let me go down here on
this line right here.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.390
So we had this result.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:01.640
We have 11/1,000-- I won't do
the division just yet-- grams

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.930
of drug x per kilogram.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.250
This is really just a re--
we've just rewritten

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.105
this dosage information
in different units.

00:07:11.105 --> 00:07:14.830
And let's see how much solution
we need per kilogram.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.900
So I want to cancel out
the grams here and have

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.920
a milliliters there.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.790
So to cancel out that grams,
I'm going to have to have a

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.980
gram in the denominator and a
milliliter in the numerator.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.450
So in our solution, how many
grams are there per milliliter?

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.080
Well, they told us.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.280
There are 0.9 grams
per milliliter.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:44.570
Or for every 1 milliliter,
there are 0.9 grams.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.950
Notice, I just took
the inverse of that.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.510
Because we want a milliliter
in the numerator, grams in

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.790
the denominator, so that
these two cancel out.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.810
And let's do this
multiplication now.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.370
So our grams cancel out.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.815
We have milliliters
per kilogram.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.910
And then we multiply it out.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.790
11/1,000 times 1 over 0.9.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.100
So I'll just keep-- let me
just write it like this.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:17.400
So there's going to be 11/1,000
times 0.9 milliliters of

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.850
our solution per kilogram.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.410
So we've gotten this far.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.250
So this is per kilogram
of patient body weight.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.080
And then finally, they tell
us how many kilograms

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.030
our patient weighs.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.200
So let's do that last
multiplication, and then we can

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.230
actually get our calculator out
and do it all at once.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.140
So let's multiply this times--
we want to know how many

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.320
milliliters per patient.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.290
We want the kilograms
to cancel out.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:44.330
So we want kilograms
per patient.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.150
Now we're talking about
this particular patient.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.250
Not every patient is
going to be the same

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.400
number of kilograms.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.720
But if we do this,
kilograms will cancel out.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.630
We'll have milliliters per
patient-- milliliters of

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.370
solution per patient-- which
is exactly what we want.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.850
We want milliliters of solution
per dose per patient.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.960
But everything we've assumed
so far has been per dose.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.650
So how many kilograms
does the patient weigh?

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:12.090
Well, there's 72.7
kilograms per patient.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.670
That's how much the
patient weighs.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.710
So we just do this final
multiplication and

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:16.300
we'll be done.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.970
So our answer-- and as these
two things are going to cancel

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:24.720
out-- so our final answer is
going to be 11 times 72.7

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.730
divided by 100 times--
actually, 100 times 0.9 is

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:29.800
pretty easy to figure out.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.080
That's 900.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.160
Divided by 900
milliliters per patient.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.590
Or you can just say
milliliters per dose.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.510
However you want to say it.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.470
Per dose per patient.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.720
Let's get our calculator
out and do this.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:54.920
So we have 11 times 72.7 is
equal to 799 divided by 900.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.080
Is equal to 0.88-- well,
we could round up.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.370
0.889.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.690
Hopefully the
doctor won't mind.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.450
So that is equal to-- I'll
write it in a nice, vibrant

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:14.840
color-- 0.889 milliliters
of solution per dose.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.140
So this is what we're going
to give every 12 hours.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.540
If they ask, how many total
milliliters over the

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.020
course of 2 days?

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.550
We would have to say,
oh, there's 48 hours.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.920
We'd multiply it by 4.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.260
But that 12 hours was extra
information in this problem.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:32.760
But anyway, hopefully this is
useful, and it'll ensure that

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.720
any nurses serving me in the
future are giving me

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.040
my proper dosage.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.490
And hopefully, the doctor even
got the right dosage to begin

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.060
with, because otherwise
it's all for naught.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.360
Anyway.
