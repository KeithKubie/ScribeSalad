00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
This might be the last video
if I can squeeze in three

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.676
problems. So problem 14.

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:07.650
The last video at least
for SAT prep.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.915
Hopefully I will keep
doing videos.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.630
OK, it looks something
like this.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.145
And then it comes back
down like this.

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:18.640
And what are they telling us?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.500
They're saying that this
is line l, line m.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.110
This is x.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.820
This is z degrees, this
is y degrees.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.100
Looks like we're going to have
to play the angle game.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.760
In the figure above, line
l is parallel to line m.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.620
What does z equal in
terms of x and y?

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.930
OK.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.270
So these two lines
are parallel.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.510
If this is y degrees,
what other

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.810
angles are also y degrees?

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.840
Well, what's the corresponding
angle?

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.630
Right here.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.540
Well, this is also going
to be y degrees, right?

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.530
These lines are parallel.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.790
This is a transversal.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.030
These are corresponding
angles.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.840
This is going to be y.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.740
And it makes sense too.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.230
I mean, if you tilted this
angle, you would visually see

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.770
that these angles would
be the same.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.850
If this is y, what
is this angle?

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.870
Well, they're opposite, so this
is also going to be y.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.460
And then we have z plus x
plus y has to equal 180.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.150
Because they're all in
the same triangle.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.860
z plus x plus y is
equal to 180.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.105
We want to solve for z.

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:21.320
So subtract x and y from both
sides, and you get z is equal

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.000
to 180 minus x minus y.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.380
And that is choice E.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.420
Next problem.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.650
Problem 15.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:49.180
If n over n minus 1 times
1/n times n over n plus

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.420
1 is equal to 5/k.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.290
For positive integers n and
k, what is the value of k?

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.050
So these are positive
integers.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.140
So before multiplying all of
this out, we can simplify a

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.570
little bit.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.620
This n can cancel
out with this n.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.660
And now let's see if we can.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.020
What does the top-- what does
this left-hand side become?

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.169
And the numerator always left--
this is just a 1 now.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.180
This is a 1.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.030
So we're left with 1
times 1 times n.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.190
So that's n over n minus 1,
times 1-- I can ignore that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.440
1-- times n plus 1.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.570
Is equal to 5 over k.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.540
So what are they asking?

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.010
Well, what is the value of k?

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.330
Well, we can say that
n is equal to 5.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.520
Or let's assume that
n is equal to 5.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.950
Because we don't know
definitely that

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.710
n is equal to 5.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.860
It could be some multiple--
I'll show you.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.260
Let's assume that
n is equal to 5.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.560
If n is equal to 5,
then what is k?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.000
Well, then k would be
this denominator.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.420
Right?

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.710
If n is 5, then k is this.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:04.700
Then k would be-- so this could
be 5 over 5 minus 1

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.900
times 5 plus 1.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.720
And that equals 5 over
4 times 6, which is

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.160
equal to 5 over 24.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.150
So this could be 5 over 24.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.240
And they're all positive
integers so k is 24.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.120
k is 24.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.710
And that's choice C.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.900
So the trick here is really once
again-- simplify a little

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.440
bit, multiply it out and
then pattern matching.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.146
Let me just set n
is equal to 5.

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:32.490
If n is equal to 5,
then what is k?

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.980
It's 5 minus 1 times 5 plus 1.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.850
It's just pattern matching.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.290
Next problem.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.010
Problem 6.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.530
I will do it in magenta because
this is the last

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.270
problem in the book.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.170
To celebrate a colleague's
graduation the m coworkers in

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.530
an office agreed to contribute
equally to a catered lunch

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.810
that cost a total
of y dollars.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.070
So there's m workers, and
the total price is y

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.410
dollars for the lunch.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.770
If p of the workers fail to
contribute, which of the

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.260
following represents the
additional amount in dollars

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.490
that each of the remaining
coworkers must contribute to

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.050
pay for the lunch?

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.620
The additional amount
in dollars.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.670
So if everyone paid, how much
would we have to pay?

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.850
Well, the total lunch
is y, right?

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.730
So if everyone was a good
coworker, we would each have

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.820
to pay y divided by the
number of coworkers.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.680
This is the ideal situation.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.340
But we know some of the
coworkers didn't pay.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.200
p didn't pay.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.500
So how many are we going to have
to divvy it up by now?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.260
So then that means only
m minus p paid.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.120
These are the deadbeats that
did not pay for the lunch.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.520
So only the m minus p paid.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.320
So now we have to actually
divide the y dollars between a

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.610
smaller group of people
who actually paid.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.140
And the smaller group of
people who actually

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.420
paid is m minus p.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.220
So if you wanted to figure out--
and this is going to be

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.930
a larger number.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.250
Why?

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.750
Because its denominator
is smaller.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.140
When the denominator is smaller
and you have the same

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.180
numerator, there's going
to be a larger number.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.120
So if you want to know what is
the additional amount you have

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.240
to pay-- well, this is how
much we're having to pay,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.080
which is a larger amount than
how much we would have paid if

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.400
everyone paid.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.750
So how much are we
paying extra?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.000
Well, we subtract
this from this.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.110
This is how much we
end up paying.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.200
And we subtract how much
we should have paid.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.560
And we'll get the additional
amount.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.410
Let me draw a line so we
don't get confused.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.390
That doesn't look like one of
the choices, so let's actually

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.400
get a common denominator.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.580
Common denominator would
be m times m minus p.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.720
I just multiply the
denominators.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.140
So y over m minus p.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.110
That's the same thing as m
y over m times m minus p.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.040
I just multiply the numerator
and the denominator by m.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.600
And this is minus--
m minus p times y.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.100
For this one I just multiplied
the numerator and the

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.250
denominator by m minus p.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.066
I just found a common
denominator and added the

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:09.090
fractions, or subtracted
the fractions.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.240
And so, the denominator stays.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.810
m times m minus p.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.970
Let me see if I can simplify
the numerator.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:25.250
That becomes m y minus
m y plus py.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.270
Minus times a minus
here is a plus.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.280
Plus py.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.600
These cancel out.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.800
So you get py over m
times m minus p.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.680
And that is choice E.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.470
py over m times m minus p.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.240
And we have now done something
like, what, 8 tests.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.170
8 tests and 54 problems per
test. So that's 54 times 8.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.940
54 times 8.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.300
That's, what?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.180
432 SAT problems. And I think
you're ready to go take the

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.200
SAT and get a perfect score.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.760
And let me know if you do.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.100
That would be very exciting.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.870
All right.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.070
I'll see you in, I guess,
other videos

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.240
that are not SAT related.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.820
Or maybe when a new book
comes out I'll

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.530
have to do this again.
