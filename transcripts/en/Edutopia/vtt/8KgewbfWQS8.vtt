00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.320
- We recognize that
students walk in the door

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.550
of this classroom with
issues of status behind them.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.570
That they recognize
themselves as being a science

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.150
person or a non-science person

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.900
and that it's through student discourse

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.613
and group work that they
will start to dispel those

00:00:21.613 --> 00:00:25.450
beliefs about not only
themselves but about their peers.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.450
As we think about our equity
goal around science education,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.090
that is central to it.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.160
- We do go through a
process of teaching kids

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.830
what it is to actually work in group.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.530
We get the kids to
understand some of the basic

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.140
behavior norms about group
roles and group work in general.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.593
We start with a unit that's
all about group work.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.320
- Students get that experience
for sure at the beginning

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.300
but we really recommend that teachers

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.610
come back to it when issues arise.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.570
So there are times where they can just,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.550
maybe just completely stop the lesson

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.710
and then it might go back to
some of the skill builders

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.200
and say let's do this one again.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.180
We also really advise teachers
and I see them doing it

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.390
all the time, just reminding the students

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.390
what is their role?

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.630
What does it mean to play that role?

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.760
- As a group remember reporters, recorders

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.480
not only are you recording the information

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.430
and making sure that you
should have this specific

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.340
information that your group talked about,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.090
but I'm gonna call on
you guys to give me your

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.000
answers 'cause I'm gonna
put them up on the board.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.600
Each group member has a role.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.680
They have to actually participate
in order for the group

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.620
to achieve whatever it is
they're trying to achieve.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.550
- My job is the recorder-reporter.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.880
So with that job I have to
write down all our notes

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.150
and all our step-by-step stuff.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.030
- My job is the harmonizer.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.070
If they're like arguing over a project,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.100
I'll say well you don't need to argue.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.920
It's just that we have to figure out who

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.990
can do which one or we can change roles.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.600
- I am facilitator and I'm supposed

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.280
to keep everybody on task.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.890
- I'm a materials manager.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.030
So basically what I do,
if we're making a poster

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.680
I get the poster paper and the materials.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.251
- They understand that they
all have a role to play.

00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:16.399
And that I think is the biggest part of it

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.549
and that they take
agency over their group.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.580
- [Holthuis] It is
absolutely critical for us

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.300
to help address issues of
equity in the classroom.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.930
If I don't speak English
well I might have some other

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.230
tremendous skill that
is gonna come into play.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.900
The curriculum provides students who might

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.100
traditionally not have
succeeded well in school

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.603
a lot of ins into the content.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.310
- [Ryan] Each of those
students is bringing

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.250
an aspect of smarts into
the problem that they're

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.640
trying to solve around science.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.720
- When a group is working well together,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.911
it sort of just hums with the
discussion, the interactions.

00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:05.620
(students talking)

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.030
- The whole year or like one day?

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.250
- [Holthuis] And see students
building off each other.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.010
Not just talking at each other.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.700
But there's something happening where the,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.470
some of the whole is much
bigger than the parts.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.640
- And it's only through making sure that

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.230
that group work is productive,
is useful, is respectful

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.070
and is targeted at learning
not only for themselves

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.010
but as a community that we will get there.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.350
- [Allen-Sanchez] One of the
things that I like to say

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.648
as a part of one of our norms,

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:38.103
if one person is not done, no one's done.
