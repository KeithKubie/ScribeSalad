00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:11.006
&gt;&gt;Student: Playing games in
school is helping me learn better

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:15.996
than I ever had before
in any other subject

00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:18.976
in other schools I've
been to in my entire life.

00:00:21.376 --> 00:00:22.466
&gt;&gt;Student: Do we have any more green?

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.616
&gt;&gt;Student: Where's the key?

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:26.756
&gt;&gt;Student: Wait, so how
about the top is right here?

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:27.676
I'll start like--

00:00:27.676 --> 00:00:31.676
&gt;&gt;Student: Wait, are we
supposed to do it on this side

00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:32.886
or do we do it on the back?

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:35.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The only
thing you're making

00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:37.686
in this round is a good continent.

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:41.286
Possibly an isthmus, if you
earn it, islands and peninsulas.

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:44.276
So it will be very blank
except for your continent name.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:46.546
&gt;&gt;To somebody who's never
seen Galactic Mappers before,

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:52.146
basically it looks like a class-wide
map making slash art project,

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:55.616
where students are working in
teams to build different sections

00:00:55.616 --> 00:00:58.136
of a gigantic map of the world.

00:00:58.376 --> 00:01:02.266
The better the students do, the more
complex their continent can get,

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.766
because they will keep earning.

00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:07.016
And then the more they earn, the
more challenging the game becomes.

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:09.806
And if they want to have a
really fully developed continent,

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:12.106
that need to know within them
is going to start to seek

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.000
out this additional information.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.500
&gt;&gt;Teacher: North,

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.000
&gt;&gt;Students: South,

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.250
&gt;&gt;Teacher: East,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.250
&gt;&gt;Students: West.

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:20.250
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You have a land mass?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
&gt;&gt;We have one, and then
we can make this into another one.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.266
&gt;&gt;Well, that would
make you have two continents,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.000
Is there another way--

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.500
&gt;&gt;Yes we have another--
we have different people around.
33

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.286
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, group number one

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.676
and group number five
you guys have an isthmus.

00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:36.406
You need to somehow share that
isthmus between the two of you,

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:40.956
you guys can communicate amongst
yourselves to make that isthmus work.

00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:42.716
&gt;&gt;An embedded assessment is a form

00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:45.806
of assessing students'
knowledge while they're engaged

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:46.856
in the learning process.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:50.536
So rather than giving them a
test at the end of the unit,

00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:54.846
we try to find ways of assessing
them while the learning is

00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:55.786
actually happening.

00:01:57.356 --> 00:01:58.586
&gt;&gt;Student: Rubric: your
group will be graded

00:01:58.676 --> 00:02:00.946
on the following qualities,
map skills.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:03.766
&gt;&gt;Student: It demonstrates
clear knowledge of the category

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:06.076
and physical geography
while playing the game.

00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:09.096
Being positive in the
group, it's up ten points.

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.656
Yeah, be positive.

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:12.956
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, so now what?

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:15.436
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So what I do in
advance is I create a rubric

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:17.306
with certain things
I'm going to look for.

00:02:17.306 --> 00:02:20.616
Part of what I'm assessing them
does include content knowledge.

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:24.116
It includes application
of that content knowledge.

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:27.546
It also looks at systems
thinking and design thinking.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:30.826
And I assess them just by either
listening to the types of things

00:02:30.826 --> 00:02:33.956
that they're saying about
the different pieces.

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:38.746
So if I can hear a student explain
to another student why they want

00:02:38.746 --> 00:02:42.516
to put certain things in a particular
spot or correcting students

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:45.836
on certain map technique
or something, you know,

00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:49.976
those are good clues as to that
student's depth of knowledge.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:54.606
&gt;&gt;Student: Sunny Bacon is
a continent where aliens

00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:57.356
like Kay and Kodos eat a lot.

00:02:57.356 --> 00:03:00.976
So that's why it's called Sunny
Bacon, it's based on breakfast.

00:03:02.246 --> 00:03:08.676
&gt;&gt;Student: Sunny Bacon has a
lot of vegetation and hills

00:03:08.676 --> 00:03:09.976
and a lot of mesas, yeah.

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:13.126
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Galactic Mappers forces
students to use their knowledge

00:03:13.356 --> 00:03:17.826
of maps to apply it to something
that hasn't been created before.

00:03:17.826 --> 00:03:21.316
So they're designing a map from
the ground up, and the maps some

00:03:21.316 --> 00:03:27.206
of these groups design, they get this
done in twenty minutes, you know,

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.886
in a group of four or five.

00:03:29.196 --> 00:03:31.526
So it allows them to really make sure

00:03:31.526 --> 00:03:36.856
that they're properly designing a
good map with sensible map components

00:03:36.856 --> 00:03:40.216
and also incorporating
physical geography

00:03:40.216 --> 00:03:41.776
as well as cartography skills.

00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:45.166
So Galactic Mappers tests that.

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:48.706
&gt;&gt;There is a peninsula
on this continent.

00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:51.136
Can you show me where
the peninsula is?

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:55.496
Excellent job, and you
have one other card.

00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:56.906
I see you have an isthmus card.

00:03:56.906 --> 00:03:59.346
Where is your isthmus leading to?

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:01.366
Where's the isthmus?

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:02.846
Very good, excellent.

00:04:02.846 --> 00:04:06.846
&gt;&gt;In the discussion phase of Galactic
Mappers, it really gets them to think

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:09.426
about maps in a collaborative
space and sort

00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:14.546
of imagine the possibilities
of a spot on earth.

00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:18.306
So it becomes more than just making
a map, it's also designing a living,

00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:21.346
breathing planet, and it gets them to
start thinking about the components

00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:25.056
of that planet in a different way,
and the possibilities if we were

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:25.956
to put people on this planet.
