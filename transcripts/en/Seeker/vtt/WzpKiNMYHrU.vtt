00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.480
They say you need a brain to get ahead, but
I already have a head!

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.170
Hey brain dead chickens, Jules here for Dnews!

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.379
There’s an old urban legend that a farmer
in Colorado cut the head off a chicken with

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.710
an axe, but instead of bleeding to death and
being ground into chicken nuggets, the chicken

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.720
survived, headless, and just kept running
around.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.779
It sounds pretty crazy, but it’s just crazy
enough to true, and it actually did happen

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.110
at least once, in 1945.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.600
Not only did the chicken survive, it went
on to live another, very famous, 18 months.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.260
So, do chickens not actually need their heads?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.230
Well, frankly, not most of it.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.620
When Mike the chicken had his head lopped
off, the axe missed two very vital parts:

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.700
the jugular vein, and the brain stem.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.809
It also missed one of his ears but that wasn’t
particularly important to his survival.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.879
So while Mike was missing pretty much every
part of his higher brain centers; the lower

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.610
part, which regulates things like breathing
and heart rate, was still mostly intact.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.140
And with a blood supply to keep it going.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.629
There were some things Mike wouldn’t be
able to do, like math, but since the brain

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.400
stem attached directly to the spine, in both
chickens and humans, it could react to stimuli

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.130
and keep the body in homeostasis, and well…
not dead.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.930
In fact, a human can technically survive without
most of their brain.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.930
In 2001, a boy named Trevor Judge Waltrip
was born with a rare condition called “hydranencephaly”.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.090
This is where the skull is filled with sacs
of cerebrospinal fluid instead of the brain’s

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.740
cerebral hemispheres, which is the vast majority
of what we think of as “brain”.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.070
But despite effectively only having a brain-stem,
Trevor lived to the age of 12.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.070
Just like with Mike, Trevor was able to breathe,
maintain a heartbeat, and respond to basic

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.070
stimuli.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.190
And on an aside, simply not having a head
doesn’t mean you’re immediately dead.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.460
Back when people got their heads cut off by
guillotines, when France was cool, there were

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.860
anecdotal stories about body-less heads able
to move their eyes, open their mouths as if

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.170
to speak, and blink for up to 30 seconds.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.750
But today, scientists think that the brain
really only has a few seconds after being

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.250
removed from the body, and thus a source blood
and oxygen, before falling into a coma and

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.250
dying.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.690
Any action after those few seconds is most
likely a muscular reaction.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.320
The same happens in chickens.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.360
It’s not uncommon for a headless chicken,
even one missing its brainstem, to run around

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.240
for a little while after decapitation.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.190
The headless chicken’s muscles can continue
to contract for a short while without a brain

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.580
telling them to do so.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.220
And humans and chickens are not the only animals
technically able to survive without a head.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.520
Cockroaches can also cheat death, because
they’re designed differently from us.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.430
When a human or chicken heart beats, it pumps
blood around the body to give it the energy

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.030
and oxygen it needs.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.690
And one of the many things that happens when
you're decapitated is you lose a lot of blood,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.410
and your blood pressure drops, and your heart
can’t keep up.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.090
But cockroaches don’t rely on blood pressure.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.890
Cockroaches and many other invertebrates have
something called an open circulatory system,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.940
where instead of going through blood vessels,
the blood floats just around in the body cavities

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.360
and makes direct contact with the internal
tissues and organs.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.250
That means that when a cockroach is decapitated,
the threat of the loss of blood pressure is

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.300
not that big of a deal.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.120
Moreover, the roach can keep breathing with
the brain entirely.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.630
Roach breath comes in through holes along
the body segment called called spiracles,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.730
that send air to the cells that need it.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.560
And because they don’t need to eat as often
as humans, roaches they can survive weeks

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.560
without a head.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.010
This gives you a living, breathing, headless
cockroach.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.340
Ok, I think my nightmares are set for the
week.

So back to cockroaches -- why do they even
exist?

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.420
Do they actually have a benefit to nature?

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.290
We have that answer right here.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.540
So do you have any other general science questions?
