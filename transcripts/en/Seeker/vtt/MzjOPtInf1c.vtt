00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.779
*blinking rapidly* Why blink we?

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.530
*eeeehadhgdadh*

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.170
We only blink for one-tenth of a second, but
if you add up all those tenths, our eyes are

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.210
closed for 10 percent of all our waking hours;
10-20 blinks per minute on average!

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.779
And chances are you don't even notice when
it happens…

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.019
Though, you might be thinking about it now.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.349
The eyelid is some of the thinnest skin on
the human body, at less than 1 millimeter

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.349
thick.

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:36.820
The act of blinking cleans and moisturizes
the eye, everyone knows that, but that is

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.110
not all it does.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.100
Over time, scientists realized we blink WAY
more than we have to, and how we blink changes

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.769
depending on what activities we're participating
in.

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:52.179
A study in the Annals of Neurology found babies
blinked far less than adults, less than twice

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:53.179
every minute!

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:59.260
As babies age, they blink more peaking around
15 years old.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.319
Why adults blink more, now that's the mind-blowing
thing about blinks…

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:08.549
When reading, watching, or listening to something
interesting, we naturally blink LESS -- three

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.680
to eight times a minute, or less than half
of normal.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.350
Often, we blink when we reach the end of a
page or line of text, or other break in the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.399
flow of information.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.829
A study released in 2012 from the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences found

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.950
out why we blink in this weird way, and they
believe the act of blinking helps us focus

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.530
our thoughts and keep attention.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.850
It's a tiny rest period for your brain that
you didn't even know you had.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.130
Researchers had participants watch the British
comedy "Mr. Bean" while in a functional magnetic

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.130
resonance imager.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.250
// That is a sentence I never thought I'd
utter.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.200
// They used the fMRI to watch a live-view
of the brain activity of the volunteers and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.460
whenever a blink occurred, brain activity
in certain regions spiked…

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.939
So, they added breaks in the video the length
of a single blink to see if that ALSO spiked

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.770
the activity, and it didn't.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.420
The area of the brain being activated, called
the default mode network, told the researchers

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.710
the brain was briefly entering a period of
wakeful rest and focusing internally and not

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.720
externally.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.360
Blinking was doing way more than just refreshing
the eyes, it seemed to be refreshing attention!

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.970
But, if all these blinks are happening, and
every time I blink I get a spike in brain

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.840
activity and a millisecond of rest -- why
don't I NOTICE?!

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.740
Because, like usual, your brain is lying to
you.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.290
Your unconscious brain doesn't tell your conscious
brain that you're going through wakeful rest;

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.460
that way instead of the world plunging into
momentary darkness every few seconds, you

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.390
experience an uninterrupted stream!

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.390
Yay for brains!

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:50.060
Do you want to know things about science?
