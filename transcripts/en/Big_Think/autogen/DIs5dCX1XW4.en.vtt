only real measure of clear communication
and successful communication is a change

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329
and successful communication is a change
 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.339
and successful communication is a change
of behavior of the listener if all they

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349
of behavior of the listener if all they
 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.920
of behavior of the listener if all they
did was go uh-huh then you have no

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930
