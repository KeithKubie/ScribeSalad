[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.071
DANA SHULTZ: Thank
you, thank you.

00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:08.312
SPEAKER: First time
at Google, so welcome.

00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:09.270
DANA SHULTZ: Thank you.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.005
This is amazing.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.610
SPEAKER: So tell
us a little bit how

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.762
you got started on your blog.

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:15.850
DANA SHULTZ: Well,
my husband John and I

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.950
started the blog in 2012.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.600
I had been blogging
in another space

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.560
or on another website
for a couple of years

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.616
and it just never
really did well.

00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:27.240
It was kind of a
lifestyle blog, and it

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.531
was kind of my training wheels.

00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:31.320
And I started to post my
recipes and people really

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.350
started to resonate with that.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.020
And so once we figured
out what was working

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.130
and what wasn't
working with that blog,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.150
I just came up with
the idea to make

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.740
a blog that represented the
way that I cooked at home,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.010
which is extremely simple.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.870
I'm kind of lazy, kind of
impatient, as most people are.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.540
And most times I would
go to a food blog

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.760
and I would love the
photo, love the idea.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.310
And I would see ingredients
that I could never find

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.050
and it took two hours and I
just was never going to make it.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.560
And so that's the
heart of our blog.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.421
That's where it came from.

00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:07.920
And the reason that we decided
to call it "Minimalist Baker"

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.900
is because we were also getting
really into simple living

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.790
and minimalism at the time.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.720
And I have a sweet
tooth, so that's kind

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.310
of where the name came from.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.180
And I think that people
are drawn to websites

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.110
that they know what the message
is right away when they come.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.320
You don't want to have to search
to find out what this person is

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.630
about, which is why we decided
to make all the recipes

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.260
10 ingredients or less, 30
minutes or less, or one bowl.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.820
And that's--

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.470
SPEAKER: Huge.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.040
DANA SHULTZ: --truly how I
cook when I make us dinners.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.700
So we've been doing it now for
four years, full time for three

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.584
years, and John does all the
techie, design, Google things.

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:47.250
SPEAKER: John's here
with us today, too.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.180
Say hi, John.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.870
Welcome.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.015
So your new book is specifically
focused in that space.

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:56.252
DANA SHULTZ: Yes.

00:01:56.252 --> 00:01:58.460
Basically our readers started
asking us for something

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.400
that they could get
food on, cook from that

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.620
didn't require an iPad
or their iPhone out.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.930
And so we've been doing
that for-- we started

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.370
working on that in early 2015.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.240
And it's called "Minimalist
Baker's Everyday Cooking."

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.020
And I wanted it to be a
collection of breakfast, lunch,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.570
dinner, sides, desserts,
so that it truly

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.217
covers all the bases
in terms of what

00:02:23.217 --> 00:02:25.800
you would want to cook from your
kitchen on an everyday basis.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.470
SPEAKER: Great.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.300
And we're going to try a
couple of those recipes today.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.130
So what are we going to have?

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.170
DANA SHULTZ: We're going
to try two recipes.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.262
The first one is a Southwest
sweet potato black bean dip.

00:02:37.262 --> 00:02:38.720
It's good for--
you guys do sports.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.530
Do you guys watch
sporting events?

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.410
Be really great for that.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.506
We don't watch sports,
but we like dips.

00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:48.285
SPEAKER: Sports not required.

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:50.020
DANA SHULTZ: And
that one, I believe,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.150
comes together in
30 minutes, yes.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.840
And it's gluten free,
very, very simple.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.820
And then the other one is
a butternut squash pasta.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.270
There are so many ways that
you can make alternative sauces

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.610
if you're dairy free,
if you're vegan.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.020
I have lactose intolerance.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.030
So that's kind of why
I started experimenting

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.210
with alternative sauces.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.540
And I didn't write
the book on that.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.210
This is my inspired version.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.760
And I actually have since
created more sauce recipes

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.080
that I gravitate more
toward, but this one

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.600
is excellent for fall.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.720
And you get a whole serving
of vegetables with your pasta,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.071
so it's kind of nice space.

00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:29.445
SPEAKER: And you do quite a
bit of vegan cooking as well.

00:03:29.445 --> 00:03:32.020
DANA SHULTZ: Yeah, that's
become the focus for the blog,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.690
because I'm lactose
intolerant and I was mostly

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.480
eating vegetarian anyways.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.000
And I love experimenting with
egg free and dairy free baking.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.390
That has become the
focus for the blog,

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.132
and most people know us for
vegan, gluten free things.

00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:46.100
SPEAKER: Fabulous.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.734
Well, let's go.

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:47.400
DANA SHULTZ: OK.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.260
Let's do it.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.580
So we're going to
start with a dip.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.664
And the first thing
you want to do,

00:03:52.664 --> 00:03:54.830
make sure you've rinsed off
your sweet potato, which

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.686
I assume they have.

00:03:56.686 --> 00:04:01.471
SPEAKER: Absolutely can
confirm sweet potato is clean.

00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:04.220
DANA SHULTZ: Yeah, and
you're just going to-- you

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.880
don't have to remove
the skin or anything.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.330
Just chop it up.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.960
You're just going to want to
cut it into bit-sized cubes,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.940
being very careful, obviously.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.604
I have accidentally
cut myself before.

00:04:19.604 --> 00:04:22.210
SPEAKER: I think if you haven't
accidentally cut yourself,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.220
you're not cooking enough.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.820
DANA SHULTZ: You're
not the real deal.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.236
SPEAKER: My chef
teammates tell me

00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:32.330
a good cut is your first real
badge of honor in a kitchen.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.157
Quite a chicken.

00:04:33.157 --> 00:04:34.615
I try to avoid it,
but they tell me

00:04:34.615 --> 00:04:37.540
it makes you really super
legit, so [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.040
DANA SHULTZ: John
usually comes down

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.740
to check on all my
injuries during the day.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.950
Like, I burned myself again.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.670
He's like, stop doing that.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.710
It's part of the game.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.250
SPEAKER: Badges of honor.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.430
DANA SHULTZ: So I think I
learned early on that there

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.910
is a big difference, especially
with sweet potatoes when

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.710
it comes to organic
and non-organic.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.170
The flavor and the texture
of organic sweet potatoes

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.300
is immeasurably better
than non-organic.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.690
And I'm sure you're all very
smart, intelligent people

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.950
and you probably know that
organic produce is better.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.740
But just for the
sheer sake of flavor,

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.630
organic sweet potatoes
are so, so much better.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.651
And you don't have to add as
much oil and salt and sweetener

00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:21.900
to them because they're just
naturally already tasting

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.615
a lot better.

00:05:22.615 --> 00:05:26.230
SPEAKER: Are there other
produce items you feel strongly

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.035
are significantly better from a
taste perspective when organic?

00:05:29.035 --> 00:05:32.122
DANA SHULTZ: I think most of
the squashes are, actually.

00:05:32.122 --> 00:05:33.580
I can usually tell
a big difference

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.830
with apples and
strawberries, especially.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.720
Just things that
are in season are

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.160
going to taste better as well.

00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:44.690
But mostly, I think the biggest
one has been sweet potatoes,

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.110
actually.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.120
So all you're going to do is
just drizzle on a little bit

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.960
of cooking oil.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.380
I usually use melted
coconut oil at home,

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.060
because it's a really nice
source of healthy fats.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.630
And then all you're
going to season

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.900
these with is a little bit
of salt and maple syrup

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.150
just to bring out their
sweetness a little bit more.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.945
Just drizzle that on.

00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:16.061
SPEAKER: Our flat top just wants
to talk to you for a second.

00:06:16.061 --> 00:06:17.900
It's supposed to be
a safety feature.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.710
It's most often an
annoyance feature,

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.430
I can say from
persona; experience.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.320
DANA SHULTZ: And then this
is just cumin, chili powder

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.396
and cinnamon, which enhances
the flavor even more,

00:06:28.396 --> 00:06:29.520
adds a little bit of spice.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.050
SPEAKER: So a little bit of
salty, sweet, savory spice

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.380
mixed-- love it.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.110
DANA SHULTZ: You
don't really have

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.443
to add a lot to sweet potatoes,
because they are already

00:06:37.443 --> 00:06:38.419
so delicious.

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.210
But this just kind of
enhances their flavor

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.290
and makes some pop
in the actual dip.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.007
So you're going to roast these
for about 20 minutes at 375,

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.215
or just until they're tender.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.310
Because we don't
have that much time,

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.540
we already have some roasted.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.950
SPEAKER: Through the
magic of preparation.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.160
Ta-da.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.980
DANA SHULTZ: Sweet potatoes.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.165
Wow, we did it, you guys.

00:07:04.165 --> 00:07:05.640
SPEAKER: It came out perfectly.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.360
I'm so impressed.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.170
DANA SHULTZ: I mean,
I didn't even do this,

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.000
so I can't take the credit.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.550
But essentially, the rest
of the dip is very simple.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.842
I'm going to go ahead and
put these ingredients in here

00:07:15.842 --> 00:07:17.216
and then we'll
whip up the sauce.

00:07:17.216 --> 00:07:18.350
This is just fresh corn.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.600
You can also use canned
corn if you can't

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.840
find a whole corn on the cob.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.540
And then this is just diced
red onion, black beans.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.020
You could also use pinto
beans or other beans.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.920
Or if you don't
like beans, quinoa

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.659
would actually be an excellent
substitution and then just

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:36.950
a little bit of fresh cilantro.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.567
So that makes up the bulk
of-- can I set things on here?

00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:44.150
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.816
DANA SHULTZ: OK.

00:07:47.345 --> 00:07:49.220
SPEAKER: The beeps will
just tell it to stop.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.150
DANA SHULTZ: Yeah.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.970
I think I will actually use
this bowl for the sauce.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:58.340
So we are going to--
essentially the sauce is just

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.030
a slightly saucier guacamole.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:08.720
And I like to have the avocado
and then cut it in cubes

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.858
so it smashes up a lot easier.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.410
Usually if you knock
it, it comes off.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.860
Make sure you don't
cut your hand.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.420
That would not be good.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.420
I don't think I want that
another badge of honor

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.980
on Google today on camera.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.074
So once it's cubed, you can
just scoop it out like so.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.620
You can be fancy and
use a potato masher.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.920
I like just using a fork,
because I think it's faster.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.310
And you can usually tell
if the avocado is ripe.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.410
Obviously it's soft, but
also when you buy it,

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.520
there's usually a little-- I
don't know what it's called,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.299
stem at the top.

00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:57.840
And if you take it
off and it's green

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.784
that means it's still fresh
and it's going to be good.

00:09:00.784 --> 00:09:02.950
Because sometimes you open
an avocado and it's brown

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.340
and it just ruins your day.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.860
SPEAKER: And that can also
help you avoid squeezing them

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.320
so everyone else
who comes through

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.530
doesn't get bruised up avocados.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.640
DANA SHULTZ: So you're just
going to mash up your avocado.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.440
It doesn't have to be perfect.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.896
You can actually-- if you like
the chunkier guacamole texture,

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.520
you could just leave
a lot of it whole.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.890
We're also going to be
adding some lime juice.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.650
I have a fancy juicer at home.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.420
But before I had a juicer,
I just stuck a fork in there

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.718
and juiced it out like this.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.177
It just adds a little bit
of acidity to the dip,

00:09:46.177 --> 00:09:47.760
since we have quite
a bit of sweetness

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.760
going on with the
sweet potatoes.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.295
It also helps keep the
avocado from browning.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:06.690
And then we're also just
going to add a pinch of salt

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.758
and a little bit of olive
oil just to thin it out.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.120
If you try and avoid
fats, that's optional.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.980
You don't have to.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.280
And then just a tiny
bit more of-- you

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.530
can use agave nectar
here or just maple syrup.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.880
I think it just-- I don't know.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.296
In most of the
sauces that I make,

00:10:26.296 --> 00:10:31.864
I like to have an acidity and
saltiness and a little bit

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:33.530
of sweetness, which
is why I like adding

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.571
the maple syrup in there.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.110
So you can just taste as you go.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.690
But this is looking
just about right.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:51.251
And now we're just going
to-- I lost my mixing spoons.

00:10:54.478 --> 00:10:57.338
SPEAKER: I'm certain
we have more.

00:10:57.338 --> 00:10:58.250
DANA SHULTZ: Perfect.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.000
Thank you so much.

00:11:04.124 --> 00:11:05.790
And you can make this
dip ahead of time.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.790
It would actually be--
I think the flavor gets

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.895
better the longer it marinates.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.780
Once it's mixed together,
you can taste it

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.760
and see if it needs
more lime juice, more

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.670
salt, more maple syrup.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.690
I'm usually adding more of
all these things, because I

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.187
like big, flavorful dishes.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.770
And then we're just
going to finish it

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.050
with a little bit more
fresh cilantro, just

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.390
for some more color.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.130
And that's essentially it.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.025
I'm just going to use some
in my serving dish here.

00:11:41.025 --> 00:11:44.050
SPEAKER: Cilantro is sometimes
a controversial ingredient

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.410
here at Google, as many
people I think in general

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.400
have a reaction in a
bad way to the taste.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.110
Is there another herb
you might recommend

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.590
or another garnish you might
play with if you, say, wanted

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.320
to avoid cilantro?

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.970
DANA SHULTZ: Yeah, John doesn't
like cilantro, so I know.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.031
The struggle is
real in our house.

00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:06.585
SPEAKER: It's real real here.

00:12:06.585 --> 00:12:09.880
DANA SHULTZ: How many people
don't like cilantro here?

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.750
OK.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.700
Know who to throw
food out later.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.997
You could easily just leave
out cilantro to be honest.

00:12:16.997 --> 00:12:18.080
It's not a key ingredient.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.730
You could also use parsley.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.680
Mint might actually
add a nice flavor--

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.430
really kind of whatever
you have on hand--

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.670
but if you have an
adversity to cilantro,

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.180
you might not like the taste
of other herbs as well.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.750
Maybe parsley would
be too similar.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.550
So maybe just leave it
out if it's not for you.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.060
SPEAKER: Feel free
to leave it out.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.840
Or as we try to do here, you
could put it on the side.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.240
And then your guests could
perhaps add it themselves.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.330
DANA SHULTZ: Well, it's in the
dip, so sorry about that, guys.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.850
We already mixed it.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.040
SPEAKER: Totally fine.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.560
DANA SHULTZ: So you can serve
that-- actually I just made

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.710
this for a friend
yesterday and she just

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.450
ate it like a burrito
bowl with a fork,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.680
but usually I serve
it with chips.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.050
That's our first recipe.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.330

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.190
DANA SHULTZ: So
pasta-- shall we?

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:08.815

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:09.648 --> 00:13:10.820
SPEAKER: Experts, all.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.778
DANA SHULTZ: I know what
I'm working with here.

00:13:12.778 --> 00:13:17.122
So personally, I like to
use the cheaper almond milk

00:13:17.122 --> 00:13:18.830
that you get at the
store, because if you

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.580
get too high of
quality of almond milk,

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.800
the flavor of the almonds
is way too strong.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.160
I like using the cheapo ones
that are, like, $1 a carton,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.250
because they're mostly water.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.950
But for the sake
of showing you guys

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.910
what a nut milk looks like, I
sometimes make my own at home.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.340
It is quite simple.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.240
You basically can just
make your own at home,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.220
and that way you can control
how much water is in it

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.845
and you can control
the flavor, and you

00:13:47.845 --> 00:13:51.340
don't have to add sweeteners,
which oftentimes brands do.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.790
So this is just one
cup of soaked almonds.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.650
You can soak them
overnight in cold water,

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.520
or if you're in a hurry, which
I usually am because I forget,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.650
you can just pour really
hot water over them.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.880
Let them soak for an hour
and they're good to go.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.720
And this is five cups
of filtered water.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.370
It's going to get very loud.

[MACHINE GRINDS ALMONDS]

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.800
So normally I would let that
go for about a minute or two.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.110
Really, the longer you
blend your nut milks,

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.300
the more meat you're
going to get out of it

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.780
and the creamier your
sauces are going to be.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.690
And so but for the
sake of time, I

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.220
will go ahead and pour it out.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.260
Usually what I do is, you
can buy nut milk bags.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.000
Do you guys know what those are?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.551
You guys are so cool.

00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:04.050
I don't actually have a nut
milk bag, so I'm not that fancy.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:09.400
I just put a really thin,
clean towel over a mixing bowl

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.400
and just pour it over.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.944
But today, we're going to use
this sieve contraption here.

00:15:14.944 --> 00:15:16.360
And you're essentially
just trying

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:22.080
to get out any of the
extra bits of almonds that

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.300
may be left behind, because
that makes your nut milk taste

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.350
gritty and that's
not what we want.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.770
So you can at this stage
or when you're blending,

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.430
you can add dates to sweeten
or maple syrup or add vanilla

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.870
if you want to have
vanilla almond milk.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.840
But since we're going to be
making a savory sauce today,

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.976
you don't really want any
of that extra sweetness.

00:15:45.976 --> 00:15:47.850
And of course you can
use other nuts as well.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.290
I think hazelnuts
would be great.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.070
You can make oat milk.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.270
You can make hemp seed milk.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.705
It's the same general principle.

00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:59.748
SPEAKER: So similar methodology,
different root ingredient.

00:15:59.748 --> 00:16:01.530
DANA SHULTZ: You don't
need to soak things

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.030
like oats for as long as
nuts, just because nuts

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.340
are kind of hard
and you need to soak

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.670
them to open them up and
get the flavor out of them.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.550
And then you have about four
to five cups of almond milk,

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.050
and that will keep in the
fridge for a few days.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.800
I think I'm going to
set this over here.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.240
SPEAKER: I feel incredibly
lazy for purchasing almond milk

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.175
if it's really that easy.

00:16:21.175 --> 00:16:23.258
DANA SHULTZ: I mean, I
still purchase almond milk.

00:16:23.258 --> 00:16:25.600
I just think that it's nice
to know how to make it,

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.010
because I honestly think
the taste is better.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.570
But for the average person
who's working all day and you

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.710
go home at night, you
don't need to be making

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.040
your own if you don't want to.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.550
So do you guys know how to
cut up butternut squashes?

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.190
Yes?

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:42.940
Have you guys done that?

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.565
It's dangerous.

00:16:43.565 --> 00:16:46.130
SPEAKER: It's super dangerous.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.800
If you have tips,
I would love it.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.174
DANA SHULTZ: I watched the
YouTube video like three times

00:16:50.174 --> 00:16:52.590
before I attempted it
so I didn't hurt myself.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.100
Butternut squash is
just pretty firm,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.220
and so they're kind
of difficult to peel.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.380
But essentially,
all you want to do

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.500
is cut off the
top and the bottom

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.930
so you have a stable base.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.849
And then I also like
to cut off the bulb

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:08.810
from the skinny top part.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.900
And then you want to
peel it, which you

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.359
can do with a vegetable peeler.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:21.760
I've never used this one,
so we'll see how this goes.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.677
I actually just prefer
using the knife.

00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:24.760
I think it's a lot easier.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.676
You have more control.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.960
Butternut squash I think
is the most difficult,

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.810
but I think it's also
equally difficult

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.170
to do pumpkin sometimes.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:42.170
But the more you do
it, the easier it gets.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:47.480
And it's not that difficult.
And I use butternut squash a lot

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:53.230
during the fall, when it's
in season and really fresh.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.140
And then you just
want to scoop out

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.184
the seeds, which I will
attempt to do with a spoon.

00:17:58.184 --> 00:18:02.600
But you can also do this
with a melon baller.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.175
That might actually be easier.

00:18:06.175 --> 00:18:07.665
SPEAKER: Perhaps more robust.

00:18:07.665 --> 00:18:10.207
DANA SHULTZ: That might
work a little bit better.

00:18:10.207 --> 00:18:12.540
You're essentially just trying
to get all the seeds out.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.380
And there's a lot of seeds, so
I might actually just do half.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.860
You actually only need two
cups of cubed butternut

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.750
squash for this.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.600
If you're in a super big
hurry, like I was yesterday,

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.600
you can just buy cubed
butternut squash at the store.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.610
But for those of you
who might get CSA boxes

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.330
or if you just want
to how to do it,

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.190
it is nice to know that
it's very easy to do.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.091
And you probably save
money that way as well.

00:18:47.405 --> 00:18:49.780
SPEAKER: Does anybody have
any questions for Dana

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.660
while she's diligently
skinning the squash?

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.320
So for our TV
audience the question

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.706
is, what do you do with the
almond pulp once it's strained?

00:19:05.706 --> 00:19:10.380
DANA SHULTZ: You can do a lot
of things with the almond pulp.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.380
You can dry it out in the oven
and then add it to baked goods,

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.910
for instance, like banana bread.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.220
It's really easy to
make gluten free.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.090
So that's what I end
up doing a lot of times

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.730
is just drying it out
and keeping it on hand.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:31.070
You can also add it just like
it is to things like, say,

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.870
date-based desserts, which
are some of my favorite vegan

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:34.420
desserts.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.230
Just blend up some dates,
throw in the almond pulp,

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.099
throw in some nuts and
roll them into balls,

00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:40.640
and they're like
little energy bites.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.210
That way, you're
not wasting any part

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:46.150
of the almond, which is nice.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:49.250
If you just dry it out in the
oven, I think at just like 350

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.130
for, I don't know,
15-20 minutes.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.340
You want to start
looking burnt or brown.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.720
You just want to basically
remove the moisture from it.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.240
And then you have kind
of like the almond meal

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.980
that you buy at the store.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.890
It has been processed
slightly differently,

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.340
but it's the same exact texture.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.180
And then I think
that's the easiest

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.930
thing you can do with it.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.240
And then you can just-- the way
that I make things gluten free

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:21.680
is sub in oat flour, almond
meal, and a gluten free blend.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.982
And that usually takes the
place of the all purpose flour.

00:20:25.982 --> 00:20:28.480
SPEAKER: And your favorite
gluten free blend,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.985
because there's a lot of them?

00:20:30.985 --> 00:20:34.580
DANA SHULTZ: I have my own
blend that I use on the blog.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.880
But in terms of store bought,
I really like Bob's Red Mill,

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.230
their new One to One Gluten Free
Baking Blend is pretty spot on.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.390
It has a really nice,
light, airy texture

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.420
and it has a nice
blend of ingredients.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.500
And that tends to be my go-to.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.830
Does anybody else have any
favorite gluten free blends?

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.585
There's always more
that I haven't tried.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.642
Bob's.

00:21:04.642 --> 00:21:05.350
It's pretty good.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.100
They have it figured out.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.315
I've also heard
good things about,

00:21:09.315 --> 00:21:11.160
I think it's called Cup for Cup.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.160
SPEAKER: Yeah, I've used
that one to great effect

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.840
but certainly selectively
in terms of what I'm making.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.140
DANA SHULTZ: Right.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.325
And I think that one is a
little bit more pricey too.

00:21:22.325 --> 00:21:23.950
SPEAKER: Likely so.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.100
DANA SHULTZ: There's
so many great blogs now

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.310
that are just strictly gluten
free in terms of like baking.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:34.460
And you can go and try a
million different blends.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.059
The one that I have is a
pretty good all purpose blend.

00:21:38.059 --> 00:21:40.350
But I've been trying new ones
from other sites as well,

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.391
and there's just a lot of
really beautiful blends

00:21:42.391 --> 00:21:45.100
out there for
different purposes.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.850
So we have most-- we'll
just call it good.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.600
We have most of
the squash cubed.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.020
And you're going to add
a little bit of oil.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.250
Again, I would probably
use coconut oil or avocado

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.320
at home, a little bit
of salt. And we're

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.040
going to throw it in there right
alongside the sweet potatoes.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.380
And butternut squash doesn't
take that long to bake, usually

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.890
only like 15 or 20 minutes.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.870
And you're just looking
for a soft texture.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.360
Like, when you poke a fork
in, it should fall out.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.420
Which we have here.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.830
Isn't that just magical?

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.540
So I'm just going to
saute up some garlic

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.040
to add some kick to the sauce.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.794
And because we're
going to be blending

00:22:25.794 --> 00:22:27.960
and it doesn't have to be
finely minced or anything,

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:33.020
just kind of a loose chop
so it gets evenly cooked.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.690
And we're just going to add
a little bit of olive oil

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.130
to the pan, I believe
a few tablespoons.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.610
Going off of memory here.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:46.950
There we are.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.950
I haven't tried this
recipe with roasted garlic,

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.020
but I would think it
would pair really well

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:56.526
with the flavors of the squash.

00:22:56.526 --> 00:23:00.010
Going to rinse this off.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.800
So as I'm sure most
of you guys know,

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.009
you aren't looking
for burnt garlic,

00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:05.300
because that's an awful flavor.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.755
You're just looking for
it to be slightly browned.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.710
That should only take
a couple of minutes.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.520
While that's happening, I
think I will go ahead and add

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.629
my squash to the blender.

00:23:19.629 --> 00:23:21.670
You don't have to have a
nice high speed blender.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.628
You could probably do
this in a food processor,

00:23:23.628 --> 00:23:28.160
but I just like the texture
that high speed blenders give

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.850
sauces, because there's
zero grittiness, which

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.900
can be a problem sometimes
with vegan sauces.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.070
We're also going to
add nutritional yeast.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.930
Actually, I don't even know
what nutritional yeast is.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.950
I know that it has B12 in it
and it tastes like cheese.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.750
And I call it fairy
dust for vegans.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:56.150
We're also going to be
adding some salt to the sauce

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.950
and a bit of pepper.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:04.210
And I also like to add in some
vegan Parmesan cheese, which

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.230
is basically just raw
cashews, nutritional yeast,

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.550
garlic powder, and
sea salt. And it

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.620
ends up tasting an
incredible amount

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.430
like real Parmesan cheese.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.730
And I basically put
it on everything.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:21.070
We're also going to add a
little bit of vegetable broth.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.270
If you don't have broth, you
can just sub all almond milk

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.130
and unsweetened
plain almond milk.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:31.360
If you have a nut allergy,
you could also sub rice milk.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.490
I would probably stay
away from soy milk,

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:38.130
because it has kind
of an intense labor.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:42.036
And let's just pretend
that this is perfectly--

00:24:42.036 --> 00:24:44.805
SPEAKER: It looks really
brown from up here.

00:24:44.805 --> 00:24:45.680
You have to be close.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.120
It is really, really brown.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.495
DANA SHULTZ: I
would probably let

00:24:48.495 --> 00:24:50.770
it go a couple more
minutes, but I kind of

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.660
like the flavor of raw garlic
as well, so that's fine.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.780
Depending on how much
you like spicy food--

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.592
I guess we'll turn
this baby off.

00:25:02.236 --> 00:25:03.420
We're good.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.290
You can also throw in
a little red pepper

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.340
flake, which I usually prefer.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.590
You can also add
chili garlic sauce.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:15.770
You don't need much of this
because it's quite strong.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.400
But because the butternut
squash when it roasts up gets

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.020
a tiny bit sweet,
I just feel that it

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.349
needs to be offset with
something a little bit spicier.

00:25:23.349 --> 00:25:27.181
[MACHINE BLENDS]

00:25:34.292 --> 00:25:35.750
And when you're
blending it, you'll

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.650
be able to tell how thick
the sauce is getting.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.170
Right now, it's looking
more of like a puree.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:45.200
So I'm just going to add in
the rest of my almond milk

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.980
and a little bit more broth.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.980
You're looking for a thick
but pourable consistency.

00:25:53.344 --> 00:25:57.216
[MACHINE BLENDS]

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.660
That's looking just about right.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:11.180
And I just realized I
need the cooktop again.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.020
We're just trying to put it
back on the stove to warm it up.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.900
It's ready as it is, but just
to heat it up and develop

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.340
the flavors a little bit more.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.020
It is still looking
a little bit thick,

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.150
so I might add in just a
tiny bit more of my water.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.700
Or almond milk is fine too.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.270
SPEAKER: The color is beautiful.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:36.152
It's very reminiscent of
beloved mac and cheese color.

00:26:36.152 --> 00:26:37.720
DANA SHULTZ: That's
the great thing

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.150
about using fresh
vegetable purees

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.250
as a base for your
sauces, because they

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.970
add such a beautiful color that
looks like there's actually

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.650
cheese in it when there is not.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.240
So I think I'm just going to
grab a little bit more water

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.500
and thin it down a little bit.

00:26:59.457 --> 00:27:01.040
And you're just going
to warm that up.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.380
I'm looking for a whisk.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.910
So you're just
going to heat it up.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:09.710
And while this is happening,
cooking some pasta,

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.360
I'm eating gluten
free at the moment

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.560
so I usually am going for a
gluten free pasta, which I've

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.010
actually been very
impressed with the quality

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:21.180
of gluten free pastas that
you can find at the store now.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.727
It's like they're undetectably
gluten free, which is great.

00:27:23.727 --> 00:27:24.935
SPEAKER: That's big progress.

00:27:24.935 --> 00:27:26.100
DANA SHULTZ: It is big progress.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.475
SPEAKER: Do you have a favorite
specifically from a brand

00:27:28.475 --> 00:27:29.200
perspective?

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.960
DANA SHULTZ: Trader Joe's has
a great organic brown rice

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.500
and quinoa pasta,
which I really think

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.570
it doesn't taste like--
I don't think it tastes

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.080
much different than regular.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.100
SPEAKER: Has anybody
else tried that?

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.679
Yeah, do you like it?

00:27:44.679 --> 00:27:45.970
DANA SHULTZ: I think it's good.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:50.470
If you let it sit too long,
it can get a little bit gummy.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.270
That's true of
regular pasta too.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:57.210
Then you're just going to
add in your cooked pasta

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.890
and give it a toss.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.770
And you're basically good to go.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.090
The only other things I
would add as a garnish

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.250
here would be more
vegan Parmesan cheese,

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.169
because I always put more vegan
Parmesan cheese on my pastas.

00:28:10.169 --> 00:28:11.460
It just adds a lot more flavor.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.916
But that's essentially it.

00:28:18.866 --> 00:28:20.170
SPEAKER: It smells amazing.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.437
If you can't smell it
where you're sitting,

00:28:22.437 --> 00:28:24.480
I can tell you it
smells amazing.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.180
DANA SHULTZ: And the
sauce to pasta ratio

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.400
is probably a little bit heavy,
but I personally like that.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:38.110
And then just finish it off
with some garnishes just

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.280
to make it look a
little bit more pretty.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.810
If you are interested
in another more,

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:49.740
I guess-- I have developed more
pasta sauces since this recipe

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.360
that I almost like
a little bit more.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.521
SPEAKER: Don't tell that pasta.

00:28:55.521 --> 00:28:57.770
DANA SHULTZ: This pasta is
wonderful and beautiful and

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:58.060
special.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.760
SPEAKER: But if you
had other pastas,

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.835
you might like them also.

00:29:00.835 --> 00:29:02.767
DANA SHULTZ: Yes.

00:29:02.767 --> 00:29:04.350
I have a lot of mac
and cheese recipes

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:05.808
on the site using
different things.

00:29:05.808 --> 00:29:08.530
So you can experiment with
a lot of different bases.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.030
But this is great
for fall, and it's

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:12.825
great to get a serving of
vegetables with your pasta.

00:29:12.825 --> 00:29:13.870
SPEAKER: I love it.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:14.810
Thank you so much.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:15.655
DANA SHULTZ: Yeah.

00:29:15.655 --> 00:29:18.385
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:18.385 --> 00:29:20.980
SPEAKER: Does anybody have
any questions for Dana?

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.480
How do you balance
your love of food

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.420
and having to maintain a blog
to promote it and really,

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.290
the upkeep aspect of running
a blog professionally?

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:29.600
DANA SHULTZ: Sure.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.340
Well, I genuinely do love
cooking and developing recipes

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.750
and eating all day.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:39.890
And so I think that you
have to have a heart for it,

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.540
as I'm sure most people who do
it would be able to confirm.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.130
But I also make sure
that-- and John always

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.130
encourages me-- just to
make the things that I'm

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.130
interested in making and
the things that I love.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:53.040
Otherwise it can feel
really constraining.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.472
You want to make a recipe
that gets good search traffic.

00:29:56.472 --> 00:29:57.930
Well, is that
actually what you get

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.380
excited about in the morning?

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.515
So generally, the
things that I am

00:30:01.515 --> 00:30:03.890
making during the week or the
recipes that I schedule out

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.720
are ones that I am really
interested in trying.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.360
Like, I love mac and cheese, so
how can I make that for vegans,

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.870
or how can I make that taste
just as good as the real thing?

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.350
SPEAKER: So sounds like
authenticity is key,

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.540
like you have to really
love what you're doing

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:21.580
and not get too worried
about forcing it to make

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.679
it successful from a blog.

00:30:22.679 --> 00:30:24.470
DANA SHULTZ: And the
further you get along,

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.720
like we've been doing
it for four years,

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.360
it is sometimes hard
to remember that.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.401
And it can be a struggle.

00:30:28.401 --> 00:30:30.530
Some days, like, oh,
this is a business.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:31.540
It's not fun anymore.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.259
But it's just the two of us.

00:30:33.259 --> 00:30:34.300
And we have a lot of fun.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.940
We love working at home,
and I love cooking.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.894
So it's usually pretty
easy to keep that in mind.

00:30:40.894 --> 00:30:42.810
SPEAKER: Do you have
formal culinary training,

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.268
and how would you
more specifically

00:30:44.268 --> 00:30:47.440
recommend vegan culinary
training so you don't have to,

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.510
to your point, compromise
your principles

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.180
to get traditional
culinary training?

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.513
DANA SHULTZ: I don't have
traditional culinary training.

00:30:53.513 --> 00:30:56.670
I've worked in a humorous
number of restaurants,

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.270
like probably 20 restaurants.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:03.060
I've been a server and a host,
and I've also prepared food.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.690
So I did get a really good
handle on cooking that way.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.740
And then watching
the Food Network,

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.037
honestly just learning,
like, how does Emeril Lagasse

00:31:11.037 --> 00:31:11.620
chop an onion?

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.560
And then I would try it.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.990
And then just a lot
of experimentation.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.137
I have wondered about
going to culinary school.

00:31:19.137 --> 00:31:21.470
But like you said, I don't
know if I would want to do it

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.887
the traditional route of having
to learn how to make butter

00:31:24.887 --> 00:31:26.720
sauces, because I
personally couldn't try it

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.310
or if I'm gluten free, I don't
know if I could try, like,

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.990
a souffle.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.350
SPEAKER: Or even the
butchering aspect, I imagine,

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.530
would be a huge turnoff.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:35.280
DANA SHULTZ: Yeah.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.980
But I think that more
and more programs

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.145
are understanding that.

00:31:38.145 --> 00:31:40.160
And I actually just
spoke with a friend

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.290
who went to a culinary
program in New York City

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:44.310
that was fused with nutrition.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.060
And she's a vegan,
and at the time

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.059
she was vegan when she
went through the program.

00:31:48.059 --> 00:31:50.650
And they were able
to accommodate

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:52.690
for all the different
students' diets

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.579
which was very encouraging
to me, because prior to that,

00:31:55.579 --> 00:31:57.620
I didn't think that you
can go to culinary school

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.380
without doing the
traditional French methods

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.287
of the butchering and the
cheese sauces souffles

00:32:04.287 --> 00:32:05.370
and those types of things.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:08.040
So I think that if
you do some research,

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.791
there are definitely options.

00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:11.790
And even in a city like
Portland, where we live,

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.310
there are a number
of restaurants

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.410
that do cooking classes.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.040
And there's businesses
that are solely based

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.570
around teaching people cooking.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.600
So I haven't done any research
on if there's vegan options,

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.850
but I'm sure there are.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:28.370
SPEAKER: Yeah, like tips for
the experimentation process

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.210
and any guardrails that
can help abort fails.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.450
And then how do you
manage your fails?

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.740
DANA SHULTZ: Yeah.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.239
John is good to remind me
that it's all experimentation.

00:32:38.239 --> 00:32:39.030
So he'll come down.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:40.910
I'm like, all my
recipes failed today

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.350
and I had to throw them away.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:44.820
SPEAKER: Compost
them, hopefully.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.220
DANA SHULTZ: Yeah,
definitely composting them.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.990
It's just a part of the process.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:56.220
I see what I do as learning
what doesn't work so you

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.140
don't have to do that at home.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.500
But I would say for
every recipe I try,

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.917
I'm testing it two
to three times.

00:33:03.917 --> 00:33:06.458
And that means that the first
two times just aren't-- it just

00:33:06.458 --> 00:33:07.210
didn't go well.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.590
Or maybe I have
something in mind

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.750
and I just can't figure it out.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.500
And so I just set it
aside for the day,

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.050
because I've tried it five
times and it didn't work.

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:17.390
So it's just part
of the process.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:20.130
And hopefully, you can
find reliable blogs

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:23.050
out there that steer you
in the right direction.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.540
And there are more and
more blogs all the time

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.370
specifically focusing on
gluten free cooking, plant

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:29.190
based cooking.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.600
So I think it's getting
easier to become

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.544
vegan and gluten free.

00:33:32.544 --> 00:33:34.210
SPEAKER: Maybe use
that as a jumping off

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.720
point for experimentation.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.080
That's what I do, frankly.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.880
I look at five
different ways somebody

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.430
has said to do something,
and core elements

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.192
that can be combined I
figure must be important.

00:33:46.192 --> 00:33:47.770
I use those.

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:48.524
Yeah, exactly.

00:33:48.524 --> 00:33:49.940
Because I always
like to-- I don't

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.990
want to feel constrained
by it, but I also

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:56.030
know people like Dana are
failing for us in that regard,

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.655
so I try to acknowledge that
and use that to my benefit.

00:33:58.655 --> 00:34:00.363
DANA SHULTZ: And I
think it's helpful too

00:34:00.363 --> 00:34:02.970
when you're trying to attempt
something, say, like a cheese

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:03.679
sauce.

00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:05.220
This one isn't a
great example of it,

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.239
but the newest
one on the blog, I

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.489
think it's called the best
gluten free mac and cheese,

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:11.850
or even mac and cheese.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:14.730
I just went and looked at,
how does the best French chef

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:15.852
make a cheese sauce?

00:34:15.852 --> 00:34:17.310
And then I just
tried to mock that,

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:18.434
but with vegan ingredients.

00:34:18.434 --> 00:34:21.770
I think that it's really
helpful on recipes like that

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:24.719
where you want to know
what the basics are.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.510
You want to know what the
foundational principles are so

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.989
that when you go to attempt
it, you have some frame of mind

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:32.489
and you're not just throwing a
bunch of stuff in the blender

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:33.870
and hoping it turns out.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:37.770
SPEAKER: So you can at
least follow a methodology.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.909
DANA SHULTZ: I usually go to
Ina Garten and Alton Brown,

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:44.230
because they know and they've
tested and they've tried,

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.340
and they're seasoned chefs.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.480
That way I have
some type of path

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.050
to go off of when I'm trying
to veganize something or make

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.675
it gluten free.

00:34:51.675 --> 00:34:53.889
SPEAKER: Kenji
Lopez-Alt is great too,

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:57.139
because he speaks really
about the why behind why

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.290
recipes work.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.090
You can use that
for experimentation,

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:03.340
because you won't take out
those core elements that

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.540
are make or break.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.670
Best recommendations for someone
transitioning off of dairy?

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.240
DANA SHULTZ: Yes.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.960
Vegan Parmesan cheese, I
think, is a huge lifesaver,

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.834
because I used to put
Parmesan cheese on everything

00:35:15.834 --> 00:35:17.250
and then it was
just stripped away

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.508
and my life was incomplete.

00:35:19.508 --> 00:35:20.758
SPEAKER: Life was in shambles.

00:35:20.758 --> 00:35:21.507
DANA SHULTZ: Yeah.

00:35:21.507 --> 00:35:23.890
So once I realized, oh, I
can still make cheese sauces.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:25.020
I can still have pizza.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.630
Like, I bring my Parmesan
shaker to the restaurants.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.090
It's very tacky.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.410
Like, oh, no waiter,
I have my own.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.260
I have my own.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.530
SPEAKER: I think in
Portland and the Bay Area,

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.175
you can get away
with that for sure.

00:35:35.175 --> 00:35:37.460
DANA SHULTZ: And in Portland,
sometimes you go to pizza shops

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.418
and they have nutritional
yeast on the counter.

00:35:39.418 --> 00:35:40.595
So it makes it a lot easier.

00:35:40.595 --> 00:35:41.782
SPEAKER: You are not alone.

00:35:41.782 --> 00:35:43.910
DANA SHULTZ: Testing out
a lot of-- just trying out

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:47.220
a lot of the different
dairy alternatives-- diet

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.350
cheese is great.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:50.369
I know some people
don't love it,

00:35:50.369 --> 00:35:52.160
but I think it's kind
of an acquired taste.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.990
And then the further I get away
from having had cheese, I kind

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.160
of forget what it was like.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.520
SPEAKER: It just takes
time, like any breakup.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.520
DANA SHULTZ: But the good thing
is that a lot of companies

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.140
are putting more and more plant
based items on the market.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.740
And there's amazing
vegan cheeses

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.930
now that-- or soft
cheeses and hard cheeses

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.880
that genuinely do taste
like the real thing.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.950
And of course, all the different
nut milks you can make.

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:21.630
I don't miss dairy because
there's coconut milk ice cream

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:24.230
and I can put the Parmesan
cheese on my pizza.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.810
There's definitely some
things that I miss,

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:32.860
but I think that there
are so many alternatives.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.680
So I think just finding out
what are the things that you

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.700
miss most about it and then
trying to find substitutions.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.690
I really missed ice
cream, so that's

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.740
why I have so many ice
cream recipes on the blog.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.610
There's 15 or something.

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:49.640
SPEAKER: Sounds good to me.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.334
Well, thank you so
much for joining us.

00:36:51.334 --> 00:36:53.000
I'm glad you were
able to come to Google

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.420
and especially to share
this with all of us today.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.100
DANA SHULTZ: Yeah,
thanks for having me.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.750
