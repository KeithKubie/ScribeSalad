talk about inequality

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.970
it all starts if people turn off your

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.930
water

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:24.160

a country that allows breed and allows

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.270
money two separate people for being able

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.990

let's be very careful about making a

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.520
doctrinaire statement about whether or

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.190
not water is a human right because it

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.190
may well be but how do you pay for it
