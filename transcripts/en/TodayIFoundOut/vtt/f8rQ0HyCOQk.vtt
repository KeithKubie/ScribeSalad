00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.620
The Truth About Prepositions and the End of
Sentences

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.910
A great man once said, “This is the sort
of English up with which I will not put.”

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.820
Eloquently highlighting the ridiculousness
of strictly adhering to the rule against ending

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.369
a sentence with a preposition, Winston Churchill
may not have realized that his defiance is

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:25.869
supported by history.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.279
As it turns out, there was never any such
generally recognized rule.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.550
So where did the idea that you shouldn’t
end a sentence with a preposition start?

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.750
Many writers in Restoration Era England (1660-1689),
and in particular “Glorious John” Dryden

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.710
(one of the greatest poets, dramatists and
literary critics of the 17th century), believed

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.109
they had vastly improved the quality of English
literature over their “Tudor and Elizabethan

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:50.109
ancestors:”

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.039
The language, wit, and conversation of our
age, are improved and refined above the last

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.530
. . . these absurdities, which those poets
[e.g. Shakespeare] committed [were due to]

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.440
the want of education and learning.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.610
The additional education and learning that
Dryden claimed included a mastery of Latin,

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.880
a language he revered.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.490
And, since in Latin one cannot end a sentence
with a preposition, Dryden contended that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.440
it shouldn’t be allowed in English either.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.320
(This is the exact same reasoning behind why,
for a very brief time, it was considered incorrect

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.340
in some circles to split an infinitive.)

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.300
Influential, many listened to him including
Bishop Robert Lowth, a fellow of the Royal

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.840
Society of London and author of A Short Introduction
to English Grammar (1762).

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.200
An extremely popular textbook on the subject,
the Short Introduction included what came

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.180
to be known as “Dryden’s rule,” although
even Lowth acknowledged that ending a sentence

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.810
with a preposition was not only dominant “in
common conversation [but also that it] suits

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.170
very well with the familiar style in writing.”

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.200
Nonetheless, since Lowth, like Dryden, felt
that “placing the preposition before the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.740
relative is more graceful,” and since those
two literary giants were in favor of it, many

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.820
adopted the style.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.980
By the dawn of the 20th century, it had taken
on the characteristics of a rule – particularly

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.670
among grammar school teachers.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.880
However, literary scholars knew better (but
no one was listening to them).

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.780
As late as 1926, when Henry Fowler published
a Dictionary of Modern English Usage, he described

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.710
the “rule” as a “cherished superstition.”

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.190
As for today, according to the Oxford Dictionaries,
there are four primary types of sentences

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.720
where it sounds more natural to end a sentence
with a preposition:

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.050
Infinitive: Joe had no one to go with.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.580
Who, what, where type questions: What song
were you listening to?

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.250
Passive: The cat was let in.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.670
Relative clauses: That’s the man she lived
with.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.070
The Oxford Dictionaries website also recommend
a joke to really drive the point home:

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.819
A snobbish English teacher was sitting in
an Atlanta airport coffee shop waiting for

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.230
her flight back to Connecticut when a friendly
Southern Belle sat down next to her.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.190
“Where y’all goin’ to?” asked the
Southern Belle.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.170
Turning her nose in the air, the snob replied,
“I don’t answer people who end their sentences

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.790
with prepositions.”

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:09.060
The Southern Belle thought a moment, and tried
again.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.410
“Where y’all going’ to, BITCH?”
