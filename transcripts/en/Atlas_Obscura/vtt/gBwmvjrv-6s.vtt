00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.667
 In Crossville, Tennessee

00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:06.542
God has his very own treehouse

00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:12.583
God told Noah to build an ark

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:16.250
He told Horace Burgess to build a treehouse

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.583
God’s treehouse 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.125
In 1993 Minister Horace Burgess heard the word of God

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.625
and God said to him

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:30.041
“if you build a treehouse"

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:32.625
“you will never run out of materials”

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.083
which is kind of a pretty minimal promise

00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:38.375
but Horace started building

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:41.708
piece by piece, out of scrap wood

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.166
and leftover building materials

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.625
supported by six different trees

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:50.125
mainly supported by one giant white oak

00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:52.250
it’s 97 feet tall

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.417
or a better way to put that is ten stories tall

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:58.750
it took over 285,000 nails

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.417
when you walk into it, you have no idea where you are going to end up

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:04.458
this treehouse includes

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:06.417
secret hallways

00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:07.750
some hidden rooms

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.583
spiral staircases

00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:12.500
at the heart of this is the sanctuary

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.333
slash basketball court

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.208
slash dance floor

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.291
slash whatever else you need it to be

00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:20.250
and when you get to the top

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.417
and you look down at the fields below

00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:26.208
you will see the word Jesus written out in flowers

00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:27.583
planted by Burgess

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:29.542
because as Burgess himself says

00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:32.750
from up there the view is heavenly

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.458
so he spent the last 14 years crafting this incredible treehouse

00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:41.000
but sadly, while God doesn’t have a fire code

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.083
Crossville, Tennessee does

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:46.333
in 2012 the Minister’s Treehous

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.250
the greatest treehouse ever built

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.708
was closed down

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:54.417
you can, in fact, call the Crossville, Tennessee fire marshall

00:01:54.417 --> 00:01:56.291
and politely ask them

00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:59.041
that they reopen the treehouse

00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:01.291
and in Horace Burgess’s own words

00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:03.250
It’s not for him

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.375
it’s for everybody and God keeps watch

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:08.750
the treehouse also inspires it’s visitors

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.250
one such visitor was so taken

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.417
that he went and created stained glass windows

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:16.708
which were then installed into the treehouse as well.

00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:18.417
the bells of the treehouse

00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:21.708
are a set of empty acetylene gas tanks

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.750
that have been strung up by rope

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.125
and when pulled chime together

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:30.625
in a kind of lo-fi DIY heavenly harmony
