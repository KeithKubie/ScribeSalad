00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.055
So other than the description, hm, it
looks like you changed style1 to style!

00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:08.250
.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Huh, oh, yeah, I did do that.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.330
That wasn't intentional.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.630
I was going to change my stylesheet, but

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.090
then at the last minute,
I decided not to.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.202
I think I made a mistake.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:15.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sounds like a typo.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.560
So what happens if you fix that?

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.060
&gt;&gt; Let's try it.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.150
Cool, it worked.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.260
&gt;&gt; Great.
&gt;&gt; You know,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.950
it's kind of annoying doing it manually.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.750
Is there any way to get
the computer to help me?

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are some built in tools
that can automatically compare files.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.820
I'll go over how to
use these in a minute.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.220
&gt;&gt; Good thing I saved the old one then.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm glad you did.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.420
In a bigger project, having an old
version saved can mean that you

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.740
spend a few minutes finding
your mistake instead of hours.
