00:00:00.153 --> 00:00:02.243
- [Instructor] Before applying
to law school in the US,

00:00:02.243 --> 00:00:05.254
students need to take
an exam called the LSAT.

00:00:05.254 --> 00:00:07.114
Before applying to medical school,

00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:09.923
students need to take
an exam called the MCAT.

00:00:09.923 --> 00:00:12.597
Here are some summary
statistics for each exam.

00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:15.571
So the LSAT, the mean score is 151

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.673
with a standard deviation of 10.

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:20.294
And the MCAT, the mean score is 25.1

00:00:20.294 --> 00:00:23.183
with a standard deviation of 6.4

00:00:23.183 --> 00:00:25.439
Juwan took both exams.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.944
He scored 172 on the
LSAT and 37 on the MCAT.

00:00:29.944 --> 00:00:33.119
Which exam did he do relatively better on?

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:36.539
So pause this video, and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.501
So the way I would think about it is

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:40.634
you can't just look at the absolute score

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:42.395
because they are on different scales

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:44.571
and they have different distributions.

00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:46.037
But we can use this information.

00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:48.002
If we assume it's a normal distribution

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.720
or relatively close to
a normal distribution

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.912
with a meet, centered at this mean,

00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:55.716
we can think about, well,
how many standard deviations

00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:59.004
from the mean did he score
in each of these situations?

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:01.203
In both cases, he scored above the mean.

00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:03.483
But how many standard
deviations above the mean?

00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:05.289
So let's see if we can figure that out.

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.937
So on the LSAT, let's see,
let me write this down,

00:01:07.937 --> 00:01:09.515
on the LSAT,

00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:10.682
he scored 172.

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:14.306
So how many standard
deviations is that going to be?

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:17.944
Well, let's take 172, his
score, minus the mean,

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:19.399
so this is the absolute number

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.275
that he scored above the mean,

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:24.555
and now let's divide that
by the standard deviation.

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:26.139
So on the LSAT, this is what?

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:27.972
This is going to be 21

00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:30.563
divided by 10.

00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:34.281
So this is 2.1 standard deviations,

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:35.872
deviations

00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:37.656
above the mean,

00:01:37.656 --> 00:01:38.986
above

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:39.819
the mean.

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.199
You could view this as a z-score.

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:43.033
It's a z-score of 2.1.

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:47.513
We are 2.1 above the
mean in this situation.

00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:50.499
Now, let's think about
how he did on the MCAT.

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:51.499
On the MCAT,

00:01:52.553 --> 00:01:53.803
he scored a 37.

00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:57.704
The mean is a 25.1,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.017
and there is a standard deviation of 6.4.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:07.361
So let's see, 37.1

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:08.778
minus 25 would be

00:02:09.924 --> 00:02:12.507
12, but now it's gonna be 11.9,

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:15.001
11.9

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.251
divided by 6.4.

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:21.421
So without even looking at this,

00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:24.766
so this is going to be approximately,

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:27.321
well, this is gonna be a
little bit less than two.

00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:30.137
This is going to be less than two.

00:02:30.137 --> 00:02:31.600
So based on this information,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.971
and we could figure out
the exact number here.

00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:36.356
In fact, let me get my calculator out.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.907
So you get the calculator.

00:02:38.907 --> 00:02:40.240
So if we do 11.9

00:02:42.943 --> 00:02:44.193
divided by 6.4,

00:02:45.657 --> 00:02:47.871
that's gonna get us to one
point, I'll just say one point,

00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:50.619
I'll just say approximately 1.86,

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.137
so approximately 1.86.

00:02:53.137 --> 00:02:57.978
So relatively speaking, he did
slightly better on the LSAT.

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:00.159
He did more standard deviations,
although this is close.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.927
I would say they're comparable.

00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:04.170
He did roughly two standard deviations

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.730
if we were to round to the
nearest standard deviation.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.412
But if you wanted to get precise,

00:03:08.412 --> 00:03:09.656
he did a little bit better,

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.526
relatively speaking, on the LSAT.

00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:13.665
He did 2.1 standard deviations here

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:17.722
while over here he did 1.86
or 1.9 standard deviations.

00:03:17.722 --> 00:03:18.970
But in everyday language,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.245
you would probably say,
well, this is comparable.

00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:23.115
If this was three standard deviations

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:25.259
and this is one standard
deviation, then you'd be like,

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.676
oh, he definitely did better on the LSAT.
