well thats spurry there's a very good

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100
well thats spurry there's a very good
 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.520
well thats spurry there's a very good
question is very debatable I personally

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
question is very debatable I personally
 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.320
question is very debatable I personally
think it's got something to do with

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330
think it's got something to do with

think it's got something to do with
embodiment its robustness and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840
embodiment its robustness and
 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.690
embodiment its robustness and
flexibility and what these managed to do

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700
flexibility and what these managed to do
 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.440
flexibility and what these managed to do
somehow is confer this system with the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
somehow is confer this system with the
 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.590
somehow is confer this system with the
ability to respond in real time to

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600
ability to respond in real time to
 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.860
ability to respond in real time to
environmental changes and therefore it

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
environmental changes and therefore it
 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.400
environmental changes and therefore it
maintains its contingency in its

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
maintains its contingency in its
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.210
maintains its contingency in its
surroundings now obviously associated

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
surroundings now obviously associated
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.190
surroundings now obviously associated
with this strategy is a lot of drop off

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
with this strategy is a lot of drop off
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.979
with this strategy is a lot of drop off
so there are mass extinctions many

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989
so there are mass extinctions many
 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.610
so there are mass extinctions many
organisms die but actually that is part

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620
organisms die but actually that is part
 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.150
organisms die but actually that is part
of life strategy and it's a totally

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
of life strategy and it's a totally
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.850
of life strategy and it's a totally
different kind of strategy to other

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860
different kind of strategy to other
 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.809
different kind of strategy to other
persistent systems take for example the

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819
persistent systems take for example the
 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.990
persistent systems take for example the
city of Venice itself which is in

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
city of Venice itself which is in
 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.320
city of Venice itself which is in
northern Italy situated on the shores of

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330
northern Italy situated on the shores of
 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.240
northern Italy situated on the shores of
a lagoon on the a Adriatic Sea and

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250
a lagoon on the a Adriatic Sea and
 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.660
a lagoon on the a Adriatic Sea and
Venice seems to stand seemingly in

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670
Venice seems to stand seemingly in
 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.940
Venice seems to stand seemingly in
defiance of all the elements and the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950
defiance of all the elements and the
 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.759
defiance of all the elements and the
climate and the changing forces of

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769
climate and the changing forces of
 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.940

I do know that I'm personifying quite

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049
I do know that I'm personifying quite

dramatically here but this is in order
 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.000
dramatically here but this is in order
to make my point so the time that the

to make my point so the time that the
city-state of Venice was being founded

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530
city-state of Venice was being founded
 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.530
city-state of Venice was being founded
between the ninth of the 12th century

the dominant technologies were agrarian
in other words land drainage the

in other words land drainage the
 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.819
in other words land drainage the
creation of canals and the use of wood

piles to shore up the foundations of the
developing settlement and these actually

developing settlement and these actually
 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.150

we have a new set of technologies ones
that bring great power and wealth

that bring great power and wealth
 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.219
that bring great power and wealth
although through the excessive use of

this laboratory in this rather
 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.840
this laboratory in this rather
interesting tower it looks incredibly

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850
interesting tower it looks incredibly
 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.050

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:30.750
already been debates that come out of
 

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:32.720
already been debates that come out of
this about you know of cities basically

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:32.730
this about you know of cities basically
 

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:34.190
this about you know of cities basically
selling off their citizens aggregate

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200
selling off their citizens aggregate
 

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.470
selling off their citizens aggregate
data to corporations and also sort of

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480
data to corporations and also sort of
 

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.420
data to corporations and also sort of
basically sort of you know forcing our

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:38.430
basically sort of you know forcing our
 

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.579
basically sort of you know forcing our
cities to develop in the sort of logic

00:39:40.579 --> 00:39:40.589
cities to develop in the sort of logic
 

00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:43.279
cities to develop in the sort of logic
and scale of software of how quickly we

00:39:43.279 --> 00:39:43.289
and scale of software of how quickly we
 

00:39:43.289 --> 00:39:45.650
and scale of software of how quickly we
can build these I don't know there's

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660
can build these I don't know there's
 

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.880
can build these I don't know there's
interesting applications and I don't

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:46.890
interesting applications and I don't
 

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:48.319
interesting applications and I don't
have any answers to that but it is

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:48.329
have any answers to that but it is
 

00:39:48.329 --> 00:39:50.059
have any answers to that but it is
fascinating that the notion of a smarter

building a functional city for people
 

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.880
building a functional city for people
but building really a sort of functional

00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:58.890
but building really a sort of functional
 

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:00.380

local and it's one of the things I'll

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:35.210
local and it's one of the things I'll
 

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.790
local and it's one of the things I'll
make reference to in some of the

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800
make reference to in some of the
 

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.520
make reference to in some of the
projects i want to show and so i'll

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:39.530
projects i want to show and so i'll
 

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.240
projects i want to show and so i'll
start with a bit of a global perspective

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:42.250
start with a bit of a global perspective
 

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:44.560
start with a bit of a global perspective
leading to the relevance of the built

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:44.570
leading to the relevance of the built
 

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:47.760
leading to the relevance of the built
environment on different scales and

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:47.770
environment on different scales and
 

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:49.540
environment on different scales and
there is certainly a lot to be said

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:49.550
there is certainly a lot to be said
 

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.310
there is certainly a lot to be said
about the contribution of the build

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:51.320
about the contribution of the build
 

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.060
about the contribution of the build
environment to our climate problems I

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:55.070
environment to our climate problems I
 

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.040
environment to our climate problems I
think that's pretty much established at

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:57.050
think that's pretty much established at
 

00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:00.190
think that's pretty much established at
this point and I really want to focus on

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200
this point and I really want to focus on
 

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.560
this point and I really want to focus on
energy and how wind integration or the

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:02.570
energy and how wind integration or the
 

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.690
energy and how wind integration or the
use of natural resources can help us to

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:04.700
use of natural resources can help us to
 

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:08.560
use of natural resources can help us to
probably help to solve these problems

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:08.570
probably help to solve these problems
 

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:12.150
probably help to solve these problems
and so I'd like to just start off with

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160
and so I'd like to just start off with
 

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.190
and so I'd like to just start off with
this and this is from the national

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200
this and this is from the national
 

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.120

living in urban centers so obviously

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:25.840
living in urban centers so obviously
 

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.150
living in urban centers so obviously
there is various effects that come with

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160
there is various effects that come with
 

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.300
there is various effects that come with
that and if we now look at the energy

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:31.310
that and if we now look at the energy
 

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:36.910
that and if we now look at the energy

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.560
consumption by sector in the last set of
decades from 52 to 10 we see a

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:41.570
decades from 52 to 10 we see a
 

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:43.720
decades from 52 to 10 we see a
significant contribution of the building

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:43.730
significant contribution of the building
 

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.150
significant contribution of the building
sector which is considered in the

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160
sector which is considered in the
 

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.980
sector which is considered in the
developed world to take about fifty

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:47.990
developed world to take about fifty
 

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.840
developed world to take about fifty
percent of our energy consumption and

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:51.850
percent of our energy consumption and
 

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:54.550
percent of our energy consumption and
then we have about a quarter from the

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560
then we have about a quarter from the
 

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.690
then we have about a quarter from the
industry but a quarter flow of

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:55.700
industry but a quarter flow of
 

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.130
industry but a quarter flow of
transportation if you look at this from

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:57.140
transportation if you look at this from
 

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.170
transportation if you look at this from
an architectural standpoint we're also

00:41:59.170 --> 00:41:59.180
an architectural standpoint we're also
 

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.240
an architectural standpoint we're also
involved in designing transportation by

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:01.250
involved in designing transportation by
 

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:03.070
involved in designing transportation by
being part of the urban planning we

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:03.080
being part of the urban planning we
 

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.690
being part of the urban planning we
certainly draw from the industry by

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:04.700
certainly draw from the industry by
 

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.850
certainly draw from the industry by
specifying products materials all the

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:06.860
specifying products materials all the
 

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.650
specifying products materials all the
things we use in our building so it's

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:08.660
things we use in our building so it's
 

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.830
things we use in our building so it's
not quite clear where we are and it

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:11.840
not quite clear where we are and it
 

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.000
not quite clear where we are and it
certainly isn't quite clear what it

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:13.010
certainly isn't quite clear what it
 

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:14.560
certainly isn't quite clear what it
means to consume energy because there's

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:14.570
means to consume energy because there's
 

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:17.590
means to consume energy because there's
many forms of energy so if we look at

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:17.600
many forms of energy so if we look at
 

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.630
many forms of energy so if we look at
the world electricity generation just

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640
the world electricity generation just
 

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.430
the world electricity generation just
like to speak about that and focus on

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440
like to speak about that and focus on
 

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.700
like to speak about that and focus on
this for a second by fuel we certainly

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:24.710
this for a second by fuel we certainly
 

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.700
this for a second by fuel we certainly
see a massive increase according to our

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:27.710
see a massive increase according to our
 

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:28.740
see a massive increase according to our
use

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:28.750
use
 

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.950
use
and we have various energy resources to

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960
and we have various energy resources to
 

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.380
and we have various energy resources to
make that happen now if we look at

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:34.390
make that happen now if we look at
 

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.390
make that happen now if we look at
electricity generation related to co2

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400
electricity generation related to co2
 

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.520
electricity generation related to co2
emissions from fossil fuel sources we

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:38.530
emissions from fossil fuel sources we
 

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:41.940
emissions from fossil fuel sources we
see a significant contribution primarily

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:41.950
see a significant contribution primarily
 

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:47.130
see a significant contribution primarily
based on coal combustion which is here

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:47.140
based on coal combustion which is here
 

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.210
based on coal combustion which is here
in the US the the leading source for the

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:50.220
in the US the the leading source for the
 

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.040
in the US the the leading source for the
generation of electricity now however is

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:53.050
generation of electricity now however is
 

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.420

that to do with buildings well it has a

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:54.430
that to do with buildings well it has a
 

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:56.070
that to do with buildings well it has a
lot to do with buildings because if we

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:56.080
lot to do with buildings because if we
 

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.370
lot to do with buildings because if we
look at the apologize some nodes went

00:42:59.370 --> 00:42:59.380
look at the apologize some nodes went
 

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:00.420
look at the apologize some nodes went
missing here I think there were font

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:00.430
missing here I think there were font
 

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:04.400

agency information agency for energy and
 

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.810
agency information agency for energy and
VOE and you see the relevance of the

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:09.820
VOE and you see the relevance of the
 

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.970
VOE and you see the relevance of the
building factor with having a

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:11.980
building factor with having a
 

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.520
building factor with having a
seventy-six percent share in this so

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:14.530
seventy-six percent share in this so
 

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.400
seventy-six percent share in this so
obviously we as architects participate

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:17.410
obviously we as architects participate
 

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:19.850
obviously we as architects participate

talking about different scales I'd like

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:22.450
talking about different scales I'd like
 

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:24.600
talking about different scales I'd like
to briefly touch on the reaction that we

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:24.610
to briefly touch on the reaction that we
 

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.540
to briefly touch on the reaction that we
see if we propose the use of these kinds

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:27.550
see if we propose the use of these kinds
 

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.000
see if we propose the use of these kinds
of technologies which is wind turbines

this is a project that touches on

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:35.050
this is a project that touches on
 

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.080
this is a project that touches on
various scales and has a lot to do not

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:37.090
various scales and has a lot to do not
 

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:38.250
various scales and has a lot to do not
only with the city but how we

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:38.260
only with the city but how we
 

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.590
only with the city but how we
participate as consumers within a

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:40.600
participate as consumers within a
 

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.530
participate as consumers within a
community and so this is the proposal

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:43.540
community and so this is the proposal
 

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:44.970
community and so this is the proposal
and you probably heard the news a couple

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:44.980
and you probably heard the news a couple
 

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.490
and you probably heard the news a couple
of month ago that it's going ahead the

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:47.500
of month ago that it's going ahead the
 

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.440
of month ago that it's going ahead the
design for the first offshore wind farm

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:49.450
design for the first offshore wind farm
 

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:54.060
design for the first offshore wind farm
in the u.s. in Cape Cod and this is the

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:54.070
in the u.s. in Cape Cod and this is the
 

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:57.870
in the u.s. in Cape Cod and this is the
proposal that was just signed off on and

00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.880
proposal that was just signed off on and
 

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.810
proposal that was just signed off on and
the Boston society of Architects in

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:04.440
the Boston society of Architects in
response to a huge amount of protest was

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:04.450
response to a huge amount of protest was
 

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.270
response to a huge amount of protest was
challenging this and was questioning

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.280
challenging this and was questioning
 

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.920
challenging this and was questioning
designers from all over the world to

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:07.930
designers from all over the world to
 

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:09.870
designers from all over the world to
answer the question how do we deal with

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:09.880
answer the question how do we deal with
 

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.170
answer the question how do we deal with
this right and it's not just a social

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:13.180
this right and it's not just a social
 

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.670
this right and it's not just a social
economical problem because certain

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680
economical problem because certain
 

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.230
economical problem because certain
people on their private beaches really

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240
people on their private beaches really
 

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.070
people on their private beaches really
don't like this view it's also you know

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:20.080
don't like this view it's also you know
 

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.600
don't like this view it's also you know
ordinary people not only heavy

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:21.610
ordinary people not only heavy
 

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:24.420
ordinary people not only heavy
industrial that have the money and the

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:24.430
industrial that have the money and the
 

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.060
industrial that have the money and the
lawyers to defend this but it's pretty

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:27.070
lawyers to defend this but it's pretty
 

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.070
lawyers to defend this but it's pretty
much everybody in the community that is

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:29.080
much everybody in the community that is
 

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.560
much everybody in the community that is
producing this right the goal is to

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:31.570
producing this right the goal is to
 

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.490
producing this right the goal is to
generate 70 75 percent of clean and

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:35.500
generate 70 75 percent of clean and
 

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.680
generate 70 75 percent of clean and
renewable energy for the community this

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:37.690
renewable energy for the community this
 

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.090
renewable energy for the community this
is what they get so the question is what

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:39.100
is what they get so the question is what
 

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.380
is what they get so the question is what
do you do with that BSA asks us to

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:41.390
do you do with that BSA asks us to
 

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:43.390
do you do with that BSA asks us to
to make this a different experience

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400
to make this a different experience
 

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.520
to make this a different experience
right could be a water park would be

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:45.530
right could be a water park would be
 

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:48.220
right could be a water park would be
educational could be fantastic as an

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:48.230
educational could be fantastic as an
 

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:49.720
educational could be fantastic as an
environment to learn to live with this

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:49.730
environment to learn to live with this
 

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:53.980
environment to learn to live with this
and we won that competition by basically

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:53.990
and we won that competition by basically
 

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:55.360
and we won that competition by basically
saying guess what it's not good enough

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:55.370
saying guess what it's not good enough
 

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.490
saying guess what it's not good enough
we we need to do something very

00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:57.500
we we need to do something very
 

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:58.390
we we need to do something very
different here and we basically

00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400
different here and we basically
 

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.570
different here and we basically
redesigned the entire brief in three

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:01.580
redesigned the entire brief in three
 

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.030
redesigned the entire brief in three
distinct steps so the first was just

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:04.040
distinct steps so the first was just
 

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.160
distinct steps so the first was just
look at what we have why do we need all

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:06.170
look at what we have why do we need all
 

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:09.400
look at what we have why do we need all
this in the first place then we started

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:09.410
this in the first place then we started
 

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.050
this in the first place then we started
to really find the parameters by looking

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:11.060
to really find the parameters by looking
 

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.730
to really find the parameters by looking
at various studies that were done in

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:12.740
at various studies that were done in
 

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.530
at various studies that were done in
Germany and Denmark on community

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:14.540
Germany and Denmark on community
 

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.270
Germany and Denmark on community
upgrades and how we could use

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:16.280
upgrades and how we could use
 

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.250
upgrades and how we could use
contemporary technologies to minimize

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:18.260
contemporary technologies to minimize
 

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.040
contemporary technologies to minimize
energy conjunction then we looked at

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:21.050
energy conjunction then we looked at
 

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:22.900
energy conjunction then we looked at
more efficient technologies for the use

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:22.910
more efficient technologies for the use
 

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:25.090
more efficient technologies for the use
in exchange the winter event types

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:25.100
in exchange the winter event types
 

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.660
in exchange the winter event types
according to what are available then and

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:27.670
according to what are available then and
 

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:30.280
according to what are available then and
then we said this is really not just a

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:30.290
then we said this is really not just a
 

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:31.750
then we said this is really not just a
local political problem this is a

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760
local political problem this is a
 

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.720
local political problem this is a
national problem and obviously if the

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:34.730
national problem and obviously if the
 

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.400
national problem and obviously if the
states as a whole don't change the

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:36.410
states as a whole don't change the
 

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:38.560
states as a whole don't change the
attitudes then that is a bit of a

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:38.570
attitudes then that is a bit of a
 

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.150
attitudes then that is a bit of a
problem too so can we do something to

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160
problem too so can we do something to
 

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.700
problem too so can we do something to
bring us to a national level and I don't

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:42.710
bring us to a national level and I don't
 

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:43.810
bring us to a national level and I don't
really want to go into too much detail

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:43.820
really want to go into too much detail
 

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.540
really want to go into too much detail
but the point on the studies that we

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:46.550
but the point on the studies that we
 

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.910
but the point on the studies that we
found was that we find a lot of

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920
found was that we find a lot of
 

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.300
found was that we find a lot of
household equipment from 60 70 s 80s and

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:52.310
household equipment from 60 70 s 80s and
 

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:55.420
household equipment from 60 70 s 80s and
compared to contemporary devices those

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:55.430
compared to contemporary devices those
 

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:56.890
compared to contemporary devices those
are just not very efficient so upgrading

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:56.900
are just not very efficient so upgrading
 

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.500
are just not very efficient so upgrading
an average community could significantly

00:45:59.500 --> 00:45:59.510
an average community could significantly
 

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:03.490
an average community could significantly
help to change the way that community

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:03.500
help to change the way that community
 

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.470
help to change the way that community
consumes and that would really attached

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480
consumes and that would really attached
 

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.270
consumes and that would really attached
to every single household and the

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280
to every single household and the
 

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.540
to every single household and the
individual that lives there leading to

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:09.550
individual that lives there leading to
 

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:12.220
individual that lives there leading to
potentially average fifty fifty two

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:12.230
potentially average fifty fifty two
 

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:13.900
potentially average fifty fifty two
percent savings in energy consumption

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:13.910
percent savings in energy consumption
 

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.840
percent savings in energy consumption
and then respectively co2 emissions so

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:16.850
and then respectively co2 emissions so
 

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:19.750
and then respectively co2 emissions so
then exchanging the turbines to a more

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760
then exchanging the turbines to a more
 

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.520
then exchanging the turbines to a more
powerful device that helped us to

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:21.530
powerful device that helped us to
 

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:24.660
powerful device that helped us to
further reduce the required turbines and

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:24.670
further reduce the required turbines and
 

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:27.070
further reduce the required turbines and
summing up we found that we can really

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:27.080
summing up we found that we can really
 

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.830
summing up we found that we can really
significantly reduce energy consumption

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:29.840
significantly reduce energy consumption
 

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.660
significantly reduce energy consumption
and then respectively the turbines that

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:31.670
and then respectively the turbines that
 

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:33.160
and then respectively the turbines that
are needed to generate the electricity

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:33.170
are needed to generate the electricity
 

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:37.120
are needed to generate the electricity
for that community ending up with 50 now

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:37.130
for that community ending up with 50 now
 

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.620
for that community ending up with 50 now
that's obviously a very beautiful number

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:38.630
that's obviously a very beautiful number
 

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:40.440
that's obviously a very beautiful number
when you think of the national scale and

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:40.450
when you think of the national scale and
 

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.820
when you think of the national scale and
so the next step was done in designing

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:42.830
so the next step was done in designing
 

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:44.860
so the next step was done in designing
this wind farm to say can we do this in

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:44.870
this wind farm to say can we do this in
 

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.360
this wind farm to say can we do this in
a way that people take pride and

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:46.370
a way that people take pride and
 

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.640
a way that people take pride and
participating in this rather than being

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:48.650
participating in this rather than being
 

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:51.400
participating in this rather than being
fearful and rejected and this is the

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:51.410
fearful and rejected and this is the
 

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.160
fearful and rejected and this is the
plan of this wind farm and you see it

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:54.170
plan of this wind farm and you see it
 

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:55.059
plan of this wind farm and you see it
here from the air

00:46:55.059 --> 00:46:55.069
here from the air
 

00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:57.609
here from the air
obviously much more compact and it's

00:46:57.609 --> 00:46:57.619
obviously much more compact and it's
 

00:46:57.619 --> 00:47:00.099
obviously much more compact and it's
starting to be what we call the energy

00:47:00.099 --> 00:47:00.109
starting to be what we call the energy
 

00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:02.289
starting to be what we call the energy
island so rather than seeing this as a

00:47:02.289 --> 00:47:02.299
island so rather than seeing this as a
 

00:47:02.299 --> 00:47:04.569
island so rather than seeing this as a
power plant that no one really likes we

00:47:04.569 --> 00:47:04.579
power plant that no one really likes we
 

00:47:04.579 --> 00:47:05.799
power plant that no one really likes we
wanted this to make an exciting

00:47:05.799 --> 00:47:05.809
wanted this to make an exciting
 

00:47:05.809 --> 00:47:08.769
wanted this to make an exciting
environment for people to go to the next

00:47:08.769 --> 00:47:08.779
environment for people to go to the next
 

00:47:08.779 --> 00:47:10.749
environment for people to go to the next
step then looking at the turbines was to

00:47:10.749 --> 00:47:10.759
step then looking at the turbines was to
 

00:47:10.759 --> 00:47:12.459
step then looking at the turbines was to
understand these structures are

00:47:12.459 --> 00:47:12.469
understand these structures are
 

00:47:12.469 --> 00:47:13.930
understand these structures are
incredibly elaborate they take

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:13.940
incredibly elaborate they take
 

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:17.469
incredibly elaborate they take
incredible wind loads and can we do

00:47:17.469 --> 00:47:17.479
incredible wind loads and can we do
 

00:47:17.479 --> 00:47:20.849
incredible wind loads and can we do
something to generate the park with

00:47:20.849 --> 00:47:20.859
something to generate the park with
 

00:47:20.859 --> 00:47:25.120
something to generate the park with
minimal means and by basically reducing

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:25.130
minimal means and by basically reducing
 

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:27.549
minimal means and by basically reducing
embodied energy consumption by adding

00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:27.559
embodied energy consumption by adding
 

00:47:27.559 --> 00:47:29.680
embodied energy consumption by adding
very very little to the elaborate

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:29.690
very very little to the elaborate
 

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.120
very very little to the elaborate
structures that are ready and this is

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:31.130
structures that are ready and this is
 

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:33.969
structures that are ready and this is
what we had it it's a very spider web

00:47:33.969 --> 00:47:33.979
what we had it it's a very spider web
 

00:47:33.979 --> 00:47:37.420
what we had it it's a very spider web
delicate suspension system that works

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:37.430
delicate suspension system that works
 

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:41.769
delicate suspension system that works
structurally in a way that it also

00:47:41.769 --> 00:47:41.779
structurally in a way that it also
 

00:47:41.779 --> 00:47:43.509
structurally in a way that it also
represents the political power behind

00:47:43.509 --> 00:47:43.519
represents the political power behind
 

00:47:43.519 --> 00:47:45.609
represents the political power behind
this it's a it's a very delicate system

00:47:45.609 --> 00:47:45.619
this it's a it's a very delicate system
 

00:47:45.619 --> 00:47:47.769
this it's a it's a very delicate system
in many ways but it essentially means

00:47:47.769 --> 00:47:47.779
in many ways but it essentially means
 

00:47:47.779 --> 00:47:50.109
in many ways but it essentially means
that if one of the turbines representing

00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:50.119
that if one of the turbines representing
 

00:47:50.119 --> 00:47:52.319
that if one of the turbines representing
one of the state's doesn't hold up

00:47:52.319 --> 00:47:52.329
one of the state's doesn't hold up
 

00:47:52.329 --> 00:47:54.640
one of the state's doesn't hold up
doesn't contribute doesn't exist then

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:54.650
doesn't contribute doesn't exist then
 

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:56.109
doesn't contribute doesn't exist then
the whole system becomes weak and

00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119
the whole system becomes weak and
 

00:47:56.119 --> 00:47:58.479
the whole system becomes weak and
eventually fails so it's a structured

00:47:58.479 --> 00:47:58.489
eventually fails so it's a structured
 

00:47:58.489 --> 00:48:01.209
eventually fails so it's a structured
interpretation of a political idea now

00:48:01.209 --> 00:48:01.219
interpretation of a political idea now
 

00:48:01.219 --> 00:48:03.400
interpretation of a political idea now
then we said in this wind park we would

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:03.410
then we said in this wind park we would
 

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:05.890
then we said in this wind park we would
like to have every state to participate

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:05.900
like to have every state to participate
 

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.689
like to have every state to participate
on what we call the deck section which

00:48:07.689 --> 00:48:07.699
on what we call the deck section which
 

00:48:07.699 --> 00:48:10.839
on what we call the deck section which
is essentially an outside pavilion where

00:48:10.839 --> 00:48:10.849
is essentially an outside pavilion where
 

00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:12.279
is essentially an outside pavilion where
they could talk about the initiatives

00:48:12.279 --> 00:48:12.289
they could talk about the initiatives
 

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:13.900
they could talk about the initiatives
that could change throughout the seasons

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:13.910
that could change throughout the seasons
 

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:14.650
that could change throughout the seasons
could make it a very exciting

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:14.660
could make it a very exciting
 

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:17.459
could make it a very exciting
environment that is ever-changing and

00:48:17.459 --> 00:48:17.469
environment that is ever-changing and
 

00:48:17.469 --> 00:48:20.199
environment that is ever-changing and
then obviously it would be also a pretty

00:48:20.199 --> 00:48:20.209
then obviously it would be also a pretty
 

00:48:20.209 --> 00:48:21.699
then obviously it would be also a pretty
embarrassing spot to have a blank

00:48:21.699 --> 00:48:21.709
embarrassing spot to have a blank
 

00:48:21.709 --> 00:48:22.989
embarrassing spot to have a blank
pavilion because we're not doing

00:48:22.989 --> 00:48:22.999
pavilion because we're not doing
 

00:48:22.999 --> 00:48:26.709
pavilion because we're not doing
anything now this is main that they're

00:48:26.709 --> 00:48:26.719
anything now this is main that they're
 

00:48:26.719 --> 00:48:28.349
anything now this is main that they're
doing pretty good so we picked them well

00:48:28.349 --> 00:48:28.359
doing pretty good so we picked them well
 

00:48:28.359 --> 00:48:32.680
doing pretty good so we picked them well
so this is the the idea where you would

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:32.690
so this is the the idea where you would
 

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:34.209
so this is the the idea where you would
really have some sort of export

00:48:34.209 --> 00:48:34.219
really have some sort of export
 

00:48:34.219 --> 00:48:36.130
really have some sort of export
arrangement representing these different

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:36.140
arrangement representing these different
 

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.739
arrangement representing these different
states and just giving you a bit of an

00:48:38.739 --> 00:48:38.749
states and just giving you a bit of an
 

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:41.319
states and just giving you a bit of an
idea where we envisioned this to be what

00:48:41.319 --> 00:48:41.329
idea where we envisioned this to be what
 

00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:43.499
idea where we envisioned this to be what
we call the e50 arena which is a

00:48:43.499 --> 00:48:43.509
we call the e50 arena which is a
 

00:48:43.509 --> 00:48:45.640
we call the e50 arena which is a
environment for sports activities all

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:45.650
environment for sports activities all
 

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:47.140
environment for sports activities all
sorts of cultural activities that could

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:47.150
sorts of cultural activities that could
 

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.579
sorts of cultural activities that could
be sports competitions there could be

00:48:48.579 --> 00:48:48.589
be sports competitions there could be
 

00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:50.739
be sports competitions there could be
concerts all sorts of cultural events

00:48:50.739 --> 00:48:50.749
concerts all sorts of cultural events
 

00:48:50.749 --> 00:48:52.749
concerts all sorts of cultural events
because one of the biggest fears there

00:48:52.749 --> 00:48:52.759
because one of the biggest fears there
 

00:48:52.759 --> 00:48:57.430
because one of the biggest fears there
are is to threaten the tourism in the

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440
are is to threaten the tourism in the
 

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.949
are is to threaten the tourism in the
state which is one of the major sources

00:48:59.949 --> 00:48:59.959
state which is one of the major sources
 

00:48:59.959 --> 00:49:00.580
state which is one of the major sources

community so then we started to add

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:02.360
community so then we started to add
 

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.170
community so then we started to add
buildings that would house all the

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:05.180
buildings that would house all the
 

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.640
buildings that would house all the
required functions technological

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:06.650
required functions technological
 

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:08.140
required functions technological
functions programmatic functions so

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:08.150
functions programmatic functions so
 

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:10.800
functions programmatic functions so
there could be cafes exhibition spaces

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:10.810
there could be cafes exhibition spaces
 

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:12.670
there could be cafes exhibition spaces
that could be all the technical

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.680
that could be all the technical
 

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.680
that could be all the technical
equipment that would negotiate that ring

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:14.690
equipment that would negotiate that ring
 

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:18.760
equipment that would negotiate that ring
park as you see here as a diagram with

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:18.770
park as you see here as a diagram with
 

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:20.740
park as you see here as a diagram with
that suspended portion and the building

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:20.750
that suspended portion and the building
 

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:23.080
that suspended portion and the building
would negotiate with the water level it

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:23.090
would negotiate with the water level it
 

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:24.760
would negotiate with the water level it
would also allow for water access and

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:24.770
would also allow for water access and
 

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:27.240
would also allow for water access and
activities on these different levels and

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:27.250
activities on these different levels and
 

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:30.970
activities on these different levels and
this is what it would look like from the

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:30.980
this is what it would look like from the
 

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:36.120
this is what it would look like from the
water and then we edit more functions to

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:36.130
water and then we edit more functions to
 

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.560
water and then we edit more functions to
second building where we said isn't it a

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:38.570
second building where we said isn't it a
 

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:41.170
second building where we said isn't it a
nice opportunity to I love for different

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:41.180
nice opportunity to I love for different
 

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.870
nice opportunity to I love for different
forms of access but to also allow for

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880
forms of access but to also allow for
 

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.840
forms of access but to also allow for
different programmatic needs to be

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:46.850
different programmatic needs to be
 

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:49.060
different programmatic needs to be
accommodated for and eventually bring

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:49.070
accommodated for and eventually bring
 

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:51.100
accommodated for and eventually bring
people from the community so they could

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:51.110
people from the community so they could
 

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:52.570
people from the community so they could
really learn to live with these kinds of

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:52.580
really learn to live with these kinds of
 

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.400
really learn to live with these kinds of
technologies this is what we call the

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:54.410
technologies this is what we call the
 

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:56.170
technologies this is what we call the
multi-purpose Piazza I could house all

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:56.180
multi-purpose Piazza I could house all
 

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.760
multi-purpose Piazza I could house all
sorts of different events hopefully

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:57.770
sorts of different events hopefully
 

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:00.820
sorts of different events hopefully
celebrating the reduced amount of

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:00.830
celebrating the reduced amount of
 

00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:02.950
celebrating the reduced amount of
turbines and the increased efficiency in

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960
turbines and the increased efficiency in
 

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.490
turbines and the increased efficiency in
the community and then also bring in

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:06.500
the community and then also bring in
 

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:10.150
the community and then also bring in
people of different ages looking at this

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160
people of different ages looking at this
 

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.280
people of different ages looking at this
edition which would be a platform for

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:12.290
edition which would be a platform for
 

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:14.610
edition which would be a platform for
public use for instance driving schools

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:14.620
public use for instance driving schools
 

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.230
public use for instance driving schools
surfing schools etc so again bring in

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240
surfing schools etc so again bring in
 

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:20.620
surfing schools etc so again bring in
the community into this or making it a

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:20.630
the community into this or making it a
 

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:24.820
the community into this or making it a
public pool during the summer so this is

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:24.830
public pool during the summer so this is
 

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:26.770
public pool during the summer so this is
where we started with 130 large-scale

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:26.780
where we started with 130 large-scale
 

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.110
where we started with 130 large-scale
turbines basically placed entirely on

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:29.120
turbines basically placed entirely on
 

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.240
turbines basically placed entirely on
engineering and financial concerns and

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:31.250
engineering and financial concerns and
 

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.750
engineering and financial concerns and
this is what we ended up with and really

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760
this is what we ended up with and really
 

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.340
this is what we ended up with and really
starting to address the community the

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:36.350
starting to address the community the
 

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:39.280
starting to address the community the
city environment behind this so this is

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:39.290
city environment behind this so this is
 

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:41.020
city environment behind this so this is
a comparison between an animation that

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:41.030
a comparison between an animation that
 

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:44.860
a comparison between an animation that
cable is still putting forward and this

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:44.870
cable is still putting forward and this
 

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:46.780
cable is still putting forward and this
is the comparison so the wind for much

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:46.790
is the comparison so the wind for much
 

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:48.430
is the comparison so the wind for much
more remote from the coast much more a

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.440
more remote from the coast much more a
 

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:51.220
more remote from the coast much more a
destination point and then certainly a

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:51.230
destination point and then certainly a
 

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:52.960
destination point and then certainly a
very different programmatic idea behind

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:52.970
very different programmatic idea behind
 

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:55.990
very different programmatic idea behind
all this and we were hoping that that

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000
all this and we were hoping that that
 

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.610
all this and we were hoping that that
would be appreciated by all inhabitants

00:50:57.610 --> 00:50:57.620
would be appreciated by all inhabitants
 

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.859
would be appreciated by all inhabitants
of the bank

00:50:59.859 --> 00:50:59.869
of the bank
 

00:50:59.869 --> 00:51:03.559
of the bank
so that little guy there and so again

this is what we started with and this is

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400
this is what we started with and this is
 

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:08.299
this is what we started with and this is
what we ended up with so that's looking

00:51:08.299 --> 00:51:08.309
what we ended up with so that's looking
 

00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:09.979
what we ended up with so that's looking
at the community engagement related to

00:51:09.979 --> 00:51:09.989
at the community engagement related to
 

00:51:09.989 --> 00:51:12.829
at the community engagement related to
these technologies and how you know you

00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839
these technologies and how you know you
 

00:51:12.839 --> 00:51:16.009
these technologies and how you know you
can really engage every single one in

00:51:16.009 --> 00:51:16.019
can really engage every single one in
 

00:51:16.019 --> 00:51:17.989
can really engage every single one in
understanding that you know whatever we

00:51:17.989 --> 00:51:17.999
understanding that you know whatever we
 

00:51:17.999 --> 00:51:19.789
understanding that you know whatever we
do it has consequences and sometimes we

00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:19.799
do it has consequences and sometimes we
 

00:51:19.799 --> 00:51:22.999
do it has consequences and sometimes we
don't like them going into research I'd

00:51:22.999 --> 00:51:23.009
don't like them going into research I'd
 

00:51:23.009 --> 00:51:25.190
don't like them going into research I'd
like to very briefly introduce a couple

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200
like to very briefly introduce a couple
 

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.660
like to very briefly introduce a couple
of projects and this is really more to

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:26.670
of projects and this is really more to
 

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:28.370
of projects and this is really more to
be seen as a string of thoughts it's

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:28.380
be seen as a string of thoughts it's
 

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.870
be seen as a string of thoughts it's
impossible to explain all this in a few

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880
impossible to explain all this in a few
 

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.759
impossible to explain all this in a few
minutes but so I'll just touch on a

00:51:31.759 --> 00:51:31.769
minutes but so I'll just touch on a
 

00:51:31.769 --> 00:51:33.319
minutes but so I'll just touch on a
couple of things one is that we really

00:51:33.319 --> 00:51:33.329
couple of things one is that we really
 

00:51:33.329 --> 00:51:34.999
couple of things one is that we really
need and most of the people that have

00:51:34.999 --> 00:51:35.009
need and most of the people that have
 

00:51:35.009 --> 00:51:36.950

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.829
spoken already represented also an
interdisciplinary working load and I'm

00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839
interdisciplinary working load and I'm
 

00:51:39.839 --> 00:51:43.130

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:42.700
can understand the impact on reduced
 

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.280
can understand the impact on reduced
stress loads in the structure which also

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:44.290
stress loads in the structure which also
 

00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:47.010
stress loads in the structure which also
helps to save materials and we

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:47.020
helps to save materials and we
 

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:48.420
helps to save materials and we
understand the different means of

understand the different means of
controlling the environment outside and

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:50.350
controlling the environment outside and
 

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:53.880
controlling the environment outside and
inside the building obviously we have a

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:53.890
inside the building obviously we have a
 

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.349
inside the building obviously we have a
lot of existing buildings and the

00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359
lot of existing buildings and the
 

00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:57.210
lot of existing buildings and the
question is we not want to design all of

question is we not want to design all of
 

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.010
question is we not want to design all of
them because they will be sticking

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.359
them because they will be sticking
around for a while so is there anything

00:55:00.359 --> 00:55:00.369
around for a while so is there anything

the significant increase going up to the
 

00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:13.650
the significant increase going up to the
highest scale and that provides

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:13.660
highest scale and that provides
 

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:15.599
highest scale and that provides
increased velocity and pressure and the

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:15.609
increased velocity and pressure and the
 

00:57:15.609 --> 00:57:17.599
increased velocity and pressure and the
center that's where the turbine is and

00:57:17.599 --> 00:57:17.609
center that's where the turbine is and
 

00:57:17.609 --> 00:57:20.519

we see an increase of that efficiency up

00:57:20.519 --> 00:57:20.529
we see an increase of that efficiency up
 

00:57:20.529 --> 00:57:22.739
we see an increase of that efficiency up
to three hundred percent it also helps

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:22.749
to three hundred percent it also helps
 

00:57:22.749 --> 00:57:24.660
to three hundred percent it also helps
to reduce the startup time of the

to reduce the startup time of the
 

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.729
to reduce the startup time of the
turbine which means that it kicks in

much earlier with low winds then we

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920
much earlier with low winds then we

00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:27.670
towards commercialization building the
 

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:31.290
towards commercialization building the
prototype and this is it i just wanted

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:31.300
prototype and this is it i just wanted
 

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:34.290
prototype and this is it i just wanted
to show a 30 second sequence and then

00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:34.300
to show a 30 second sequence and then
 

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:37.200
to show a 30 second sequence and then
i'm going to be wrapping up could you

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:37.210
i'm going to be wrapping up could you
 

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.359
i'm going to be wrapping up could you
start that or should i start that from

00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:39.369
start that or should i start that from
 

00:58:39.369 --> 00:58:52.590
start that or should i start that from
here

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:52.600
 
 

00:58:52.600 --> 00:59:01.140
 
oh I'm recording Oh what oh I'm

we got excited so we're really at a

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:16.990
we got excited so we're really at a
 

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:18.660
we got excited so we're really at a
point where we have the confirmation and

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:18.670
point where we have the confirmation and
 

00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:21.900
point where we have the confirmation and
now take this a step further and I want

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:21.910
now take this a step further and I want
 

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:28.980
now take this a step further and I want
to close with two things one is showing

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:28.990
to close with two things one is showing
 

00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:31.730

how this could be implemented in a

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740
how this could be implemented in a
 

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:33.720
how this could be implemented in a
certainly rural environment but we're

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:33.730
certainly rural environment but we're
 

00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:35.070
certainly rural environment but we're
working with an industry partner that's

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:35.080
working with an industry partner that's
 

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.230
working with an industry partner that's
working and we have the patent on this

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:37.240
working and we have the patent on this
 

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.880
working and we have the patent on this
but they are working with the

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:38.890
but they are working with the
 

00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:40.260
but they are working with the
provisional patent on a turbine that

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:40.270
provisional patent on a turbine that
 

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:44.130
provisional patent on a turbine that
works with turbulent flow in environment

00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:44.140

like a city where you have a lot of

00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:45.340
like a city where you have a lot of
 

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.550

different conditions at different times
 

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.960
different conditions at different times
so that would hopefully allow us to

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:48.970
so that would hopefully allow us to
 

00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:50.130
so that would hopefully allow us to
really bring this on to the city

00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:50.140
really bring this on to the city
 

00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:54.990
really bring this on to the city
environment as well just two quick

things in terms of architecture can we
 

00:59:57.550 --> 00:59:59.670
things in terms of architecture can we
now use this and the intention was from

00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680
now use this and the intention was from
 

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.050
now use this and the intention was from
the start to test something on a fairly

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:01.060
the start to test something on a fairly
 

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.700
the start to test something on a fairly
small scale to then bring it into the

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:02.710
small scale to then bring it into the
 

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:04.800
small scale to then bring it into the
building environment and this is the

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:04.810
building environment and this is the
 

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:07.860
building environment and this is the
design for a residence or I call the

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:07.870
design for a residence or I call the
 

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.080
design for a residence or I call the
turbine house and that would work really

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:10.090
turbine house and that would work really
 

01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:13.290
turbine house and that would work really
with the same kind of principles and so

01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:13.300
with the same kind of principles and so
 

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.690
with the same kind of principles and so
that would then determine the design of

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:15.700
that would then determine the design of
 

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:18.480
that would then determine the design of

defined you get a different list of who
 

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:24.310
defined you get a different list of who
is in and who is out here but we see of

01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320
is in and who is out here but we see of
 

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:31.230
is in and who is out here but we see of
course all that these are just the

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:31.240
course all that these are just the
 

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:43.310

01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159
so they will have to deal with sea level
 

01:17:47.159 --> 01:17:51.580

just a few years so what does this mean
in terms of this growth of cities you

01:21:55.899 --> 01:21:55.909
in terms of this growth of cities you
 

01:21:55.909 --> 01:21:59.589
in terms of this growth of cities you
can make a plot in which you plot the

01:21:59.589 --> 01:21:59.599
can make a plot in which you plot the
 

01:21:59.599 --> 01:22:03.299
can make a plot in which you plot the
cumulative number of fatal earthquakes

01:22:03.299 --> 01:22:03.309
cumulative number of fatal earthquakes
 

01:22:03.309 --> 01:22:08.109
cumulative number of fatal earthquakes
against the fatalities then you get this

against the fatalities then you get this
 

01:22:08.119 --> 01:22:11.620
against the fatalities then you get this
gruesome plot and you see that there are
