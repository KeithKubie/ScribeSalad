00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.240
So where we left off I was
attempting to give you the

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.420
intuition of divergence and
then I ran out of time.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.330
But anyway, I had defined this
fairly straightforward vector

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.460
field that tells us the
velocity of particles in a

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.755
fluid at any given point.

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:15.580
And let me clean it
up a little bit.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.900
This one half I had all
these scratch offs.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.100
The velocity, I'm just going to
rewrite it, is equal to 1/2xi.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.750
So at any given point
has no y component.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.720
So all of the velocity is only
in the x direction -- there is

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.340
no upwards movement
in the xy plane.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.530
And I was drawing it out.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.360
I said OK, when x is equal
to 1, the magnitude of the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.690
velocity is 1/2 maybe meters
per second, if that's our unit.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.430
When x is equal to 2, the
velocity to the right will

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.250
be 1 meter per second,
right -- 1/2 times 2.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.580
So the further we go to the
right, or the more we go to the

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.730
right, the faster the particles
are moving to the right.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.230
So now let's try to get
our handle on what

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.130
divergence means.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.250
So first of all, let's
take that the divergence

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.200
of this function.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:09.550
So that divergence of v, of our
velocity vector field -- you

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.860
could also view that if you
want to abuse some notation,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.340
is our del vector, dot v.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.940
But if we only have one
dimension, so it's the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.390
partial derivative of the x
magnitude with respect to x.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.400
So what's the
partial derivative?

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.470
So it's equal to the
partial derivative with

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.860
respect to x, of 1/2x.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.460
So it's equal to -- well the
derivative of this with respect

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.140
to x is just equal to 1/2 .

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.000
So that divergence of
this vector field at

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.300
any point is 1/2.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.600
Now what does that tell us?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.030
Well, if you just look at the
definition, right, we

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.460
essentially just took the --
how much does the magnitude

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.690
of the field increase
in the x direction?

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.530
And we see it visually.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.550
As we go, increase in the x
direction, the field gets

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.510
stronger and stronger.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.130
Or since we know that this is
the velocity of particles, as

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.910
we go in the x direction, the
particles go faster and

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.230
faster to the right.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.690
Now what this tells us, what
this positive divergence tells

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.610
us is if we were to take
-- let's just take an

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.500
arbitrarily small circle.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.310
I think it'll start to make
sense once I draw the circle.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.850
If I take an arbitrarily -- I'm
going to draw it in a different

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.620
color -- and this circle could
be arbitrarily small, but I'm

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.430
drawing it pretty large so
it can include some of our

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.410
vectors that I've drawn.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.030
What's happening?

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.640
On the right hand side, I have
particles exiting really,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.640
really fast, right?

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.660
And let's say in a given amount
of time, let's say in one

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.420
second, in one second out of
the right side, since the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.450
particles are moving really
fast, I'm going to have a

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.630
bunch of particles leave
the right hand side, right?

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.820
And in the same amount of time,
I will have some particles

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.860
come in through the left hand
side, but it's going to be a

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.470
fewer number of particles.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.290
So the way you could think
about it is in any given amount

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.290
of time, what's happening?

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.060
In this space, I have a few
particles entering in through

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.990
the left, and I have a much
larger number of particle

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.500
leaving through the right.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.110
So what's going to
happen in this space?

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.660
It's going to become
less dense, right?

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.850
Because in that space is going
to be fewer particles after

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.750
a certain amount of time.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.200
More are leaving
than are coming in.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.700
So this positive divergence
tells us that at that point, or

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.480
really at any point in this
vector field since the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.640
divergence is 1/2 everywhere,
at any point in this vector

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.440
field, the field is
becoming less dense.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.100
Or you could say that more
is flowing out of any

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.630
point than flowing in.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.530
It makes sense, right?

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.990
Because if as we move to the
right, and it kind of gets

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.950
funky if you go into the other
quadrant, so we'll stick to the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.320
first quadrant while we're
trying to get our intuition.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.140
But it makes sense, because
as we move to the right

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.240
our particles are getting
faster and faster.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.630
And that kind of just falls out
of the fact that our derivative

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.390
with respect to x is positive.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.520
The slope of how much
our x component is

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.660
increasing is positive.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.190
So as we go to the right, our
velocities are going getting

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.270
faster and faster, which means
if we were to draw a circle

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.210
anywhere, we're always going to
have more exiting the right

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.420
than entering through the left.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.750
So we're going to be getting
less dense at any given point.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.500
Or you could almost view it as
any given point is almost a

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.790
source of particles, or if you
have a sphere, more particles

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.000
are going to be coming out of
the sphere through the right,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.070
than coming in through
the sphere to the left.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.960
So you could view a positive
divergence as you could kind of

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.130
say well, the field is becoming
less dense at that point, or

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.270
the point is a source of the
field, or it's a source of

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.130
particles, depending on what
model you want to use.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.956
Now, with that said, let's
take the opposite situation.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.650
Let's say that the vector
field is equal to is

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.170
minus 1/2x times i.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.120
And so the divergence -- I'll
use this notation -- the

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.190
divergence of our vector field
is just a partial derivative

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.570
with respect to x, which
is just minus 1/2.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.242
If I were to graph it
-- this is my y-axis,

00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:22.170
this is my x-axis.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.620
So here at like, say, the
point 1, my velocity is

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.320
going to be the left 1/2.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.390
At the point 2, my velocity
is going to be the left

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.080
1 meter per second.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.960
At the velocity 3,
it's going to be 3/2.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.930
You know it doesn't
depend on y.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.660
It only depends on x.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.830
So now let's draw a
little circle and see

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.050
what's happening.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.945
Let's draw it here.

00:05:58.945 --> 00:05:59.820
It could be anywhere.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.540
It's infinitely small,
but we're just trying

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.840
to get some intuition.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.610
So after a certain amount
of time what's happening?

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.850
Let's say after a second.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.520
Well, I'm having a few
particles leave through the

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.350
left hand side, right, but I
have many more particles

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.790
entering this little region
that I've defined, this little

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.130
circle, I'm having many more
particles enter through the

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.950
right in a given
amount of time.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.690
So in any given amount of time,
in my defined space, it's going

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.640
to get denser and denser.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.180
There's going to be more
and more particles in

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.180
that space over time.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.690
So it's getting denser or you
could almost view it as this

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.125
space is sucking up particles.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.580
In the previous example it was
a source of particles -- more

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.420
were coming out than going in.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.170
Now more going in through
the right than coming out.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.570
And that's what a
negative divergence.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.000
You could almost say --
let's think about the

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.140
word, divergence.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.520
When it's positive, if I have
a positive divergence, the

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.880
particles or the field is
diverting out of that point.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.240
If I have a negative
divergence -- maybe

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.140
let's define a new term.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.210
I've never actually heard it
this way, but maybe a negative

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.340
divergence we view as
a convergence, right?

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.500
Converge is the
opposite of diverge.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.370
So here, even though some
particles are leaving through

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.480
the left, many more particles
are coming through the

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.340
right, so it's getting
denser and denser.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.040
And that's this example here.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.470
And actually at every point
in this field we have

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.470
a negative divergence.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.660
So every point is getting
denser and denser actually

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.370
everywhere in this field.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.880
And then the classic example of
a divergence, although I wanted

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.750
to show you that what matters
is the net that's coming

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.060
in to a certain area.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.790
But the classic example of a
divergence is a field that

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.860
looks something like this.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.955
Where maybe that's the x --
that's the y, this is the x.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.150
If you have a field that looks
something like this, this is

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.170
the classical example of a
negative divergence, right?

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.210
Where from every direction
you have particles entering,

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.020
nothing's leaving.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.980
So obviously, in any given
amount of time, that point is

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.140
getting more and more dense.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:12.120
And the classic example of a
positive divergence is a point

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.970
where from every direction
things are leaving it.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.160
So clearly this area is
going to become less dense.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.660
If we're talking about velocity
of particles, after any moment

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.690
in time, more particles are
leaving than coming in because

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.500
no particles are coming in.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:36.580
Now what does it mean if
we have a 0 divergence?

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:43.500
So let's try to create a vector
field that has a 0 divergence.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.210
And we'll just stay at
a one-dimension just

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:45.890
for the intuition.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.270
So that means that the
partial derivative with

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.960
respect to x is 0.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.880
So let's say my
vector field is 5i.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.350
So the magnitude is always
5 in the i direction.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.420
So let me draw that.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.660
Vector field is always 5.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.750
Another way to think of it
if you have a constant

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.580
vector field.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.230
So the magnitude of the
vectors, no matter what

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.140
my value of x, is always
going to be the same.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.330
It's always going to be 5.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:36.590
So if I were to draw a region,
what's happening here?

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.150
Are more particles
entering than leaving or

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.010
leaving than entering?

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:40.270
No.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.220
For any amount that's coming
in, an equal amount are coming

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.820
out in a certain amount of
time, if we use velocity

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.010
as our example.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.960
So when you have a divergence
of 0, that means that that part

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.950
of the field is not becoming
any more or less dense.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.930
And you could have done it
-- let me show you another.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:03.580
If my function was, let's
say it equals 2i plus 2j.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.910
It's still a constant, right?

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.370
So this velocity field or
vector field will look

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.270
something like this.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:14.020
All the points would
be, the vectors would

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.050
have a slope of 1.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.770
But I just wanted you to see
something in two dimensions.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.680
I'll do a fancier example
in the next video.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.270
But even here, if I were to
draw some region, the same

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.650
amount is entering as exiting.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.690
So it's not getting any
denser at any point.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.510
And that makes sense because
the divergence of this vector

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.980
field -- well, both of them
actually, the divergence

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.820
of that vector field.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.685
The partial derivative
of 2 with respect to

00:10:39.685 --> 00:10:41.320
x, well that's 0.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.120
Plus the partial derivative
of 2 with respect to y.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.500
Well, that's also 0.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.180
Anyway, I've run
out of time again.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.170
I will see you in
the next video.
