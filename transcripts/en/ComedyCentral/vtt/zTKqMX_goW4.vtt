NOW, CARLY FIORINA ISN'T THE
ONLY CANDIDATE WHOSE CAMPAIGN

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.171 align:start position:0% line:85%
SEEMS TO BE COLLAPSING.

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:09.909 size:88% position:44% line:91%
JEB EXCLAMATION POINT -- WHO
PROBABLY NEEDS TO BECOME JEB

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:17.650 line:91%
QUESTION MARK -- WAS ASKED "UNA
PREGUNTA MUY DIFICIL ON HOW HE

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:20.186 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS GOING TO GET BLACK PEOPLE TO
VOTE FOR HIM.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:24.690 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OUR MESSAGE IS ONE OF HOPE
AND ASPIRATION.

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:25.391 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HOPE AND ASPIRATION!

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.126 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.329 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT AS CATCHY AS HOPE AND
CHANGE.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.298 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT ASPIRATION, IRONICALLY, IS A
VERY POPULAR BLACK NAME.

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:33.800 line:85%
LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:34.434 align:start position:0% line:85%
TRUE.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.802 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
YO, ASPIRATION!

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:40.606 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU COMING?

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:42.175 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DON'T MAKE THIS UP.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.776 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL RIGHT, SO HE'S SORT OF ON
POINT.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:44.977 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, HE CONTINUED
TO TALK.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.581 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OUR MESSAGE IS ONE OF HOPE
AND ASPIRATION.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:52.351 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT ISN'T ONE OF DIVISION AND
"GET IN LINE AND WE'LL TAKE CARE

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:56.122 size:75% position:38% line:85%
OF YOU WITH FREE STUFF."

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:58.591 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHAT?

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.426 align:start position:0% line:91%
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
BLACK PEOPLE VOTE SO THEY CAN

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.428 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET FREE STUFF?

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.363 line:91%
THE ONLY TIME BLACK PEOPLE WOULD
HAVE VOTED FOR FREE STUFF WOULD

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.365 line:85%
HAVE BEEN FOR ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:09.502 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN THE STUFF THEY WANTED TO BE
FREE WAS THEMSELVES.

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:14.040 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT MAKES SENSE!

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.041 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:15.775 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:16.275 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:16.742 align:start position:0% line:85%
LOOK -- ALL RIGHT.

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:17.876 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAYBE HE MISSPOKE.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.513 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT HE GOT A CHANCE FOR A
DO-OVER WITH CHRIS WALLACE ON

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:22.115 line:91%
HIS SUNDAY SHOW -- OR AS WE SAY
IN THE FAKE NEWS BUSINESS, A

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.816 align:start position:0% line:85%
"FOX MULLIGAN."

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:28.888 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE NEED TO MAKE OUR CASE TO
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS AND TO

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.757 line:91%
ALL VOTERS THAT AN ASPIRATIONAL
MESSAGE FIXING A FEW BIG COMPLEX

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.326 align:start position:0% line:91%
THINGS WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO RISE
UP.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.160 size:75% position:38% line:85%
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT.

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:35.628 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THEY DON'T WANT FREE STUFF.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:39.599 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU JUST SAID IT
AGAIN!

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:42.301 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT IS THIS WEIRD
RACIST WORD ASSOCIATION THAT'S

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:44.237 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.439 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU HEAR "BLACK VOTERS" AND YOU
JUST THINK "FREE STUFF"?

00:01:46.472 --> 00:02:00.186 size:88% position:44% line:91%
IT'S LIKE HE'S PLAYING HEADS
UP -- HE HOLDS UP HIS PHONE,

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.558 line:91%
SOMEBODY YELLS "BLACK VOTERS,"
AND HE GUESSES "FREE STUFF!"

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.994 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, THIS GUY HAS A LOT OF

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.829 line:91%
NERVE ACCUSING BLACK VOTERS OF
DEMANDING FREE STUFF WHEN THIS

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:13.666 align:start position:0% line:91%
COUNTRY WAS BUILT ON THE BACKS
OF FREE BLACK LABOR.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:18.538 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT?

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.774 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF MEMORY SERVES, WHITE
SOUTHERNERS HAD QUITE AN

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:23.276 line:85%
APPETITE FOR FREE STUFF, TOO.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.846 line:85%
BUT FORGET SLAVERY, OR DON'T.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.348 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION,
JEB EXCLAMATION POINT.

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:31.817 line:91%
I DON'T WANT TO SAY YOU'RE OUT
OF TOUCH, BUT DO YOU THINK IT'S

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.921 align:start position:0% line:91%
POSSIBLE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A
HUGE COLOR BLINDSPOT?

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.056 align:start position:0% line:91%
TELL ME -- WHAT IS YOUR OPINION
ON RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY?

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:42.094 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE
INHERENTLY RACIST IN THIS

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:43.328 align:start position:0% line:85%
COUNTRY.

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:44.063 line:91%
IN FACT, I THINK THAT WE HAVE A
PRETTY NOBLE TRADITION OF THE

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:46.599 align:start position:0% line:85%
OPPOSITE.

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:49.302 align:start position:0% line:91%
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
&gt;&gt; Larry: NOBLE TRADITION OF

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.870 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE OPPOSITE?

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:53.639 line:91%
THAT'S LIKE GETTING A POSITIVE
HERPES TEST BUT TELLING YOUR

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:56.776 line:91%
GIRLFRIEND, "DON'T WORRY, BABY,
I HAVE A NOBLE TRADITION OF THE

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:01.113 align:start position:0% line:85%
OPPOSITE."

00:03:01.146 --> 00:03:03.216 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
NO, YOU HAVE A NOBLE S.T.D., AND

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.420 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU SHOULD REALLY GET SOME
VALTREX.

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.422 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THESE ARE ALL OFF THE CUFF
REMARKS.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.457 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THOSE CAN BE TAKEN OUT OF
CONTEXT.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.960 line:91%
SO WHAT ARE JEB BUSH'S THOUGHTS
ON RACE WHEN HE'S HAD A MINUTE

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:17.129 line:91%
TO THINK ABOUT IT, TAKEN THE
TIME TO WRITE SOMETHING DOWN,

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:21.867 align:start position:0% line:91%
RE-READ IT, SENT IT TO A
PUBLISHER, DONE TWO ROUNDS OF

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.504 align:start position:0% line:91%
COPY-EDITING, THEN PUBLISHED IT
IN, SAY, A 1996 BOOK CALLED

00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:27.807 size:75% position:38% line:85%
"PROFILES IN CHARACTER"?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.142 line:91%
"SINCE THE 1960s, THE POLITICS
OF VICTIMIZATION HAS STEADILY

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:32.078 align:start position:0% line:85%
INTENSIFIED.

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:35.147 line:91%
BEING A VICTIM GIVES RISE TO
CERTAIN ENTITLEMENTS, BENEFITS,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.949 line:85%
AND PREFERENCES IN SOCIETY...

00:03:36.982 --> 00:03:38.951 size:84% position:42% line:91%
MANY OF THE MODERN VICTIM
MOVEMENTS -- THE GAY RIGHTS

00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:41.020 align:start position:0% line:91%
MOVEMENT, THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT,
THE BLACK EMPOWERMENT

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:43.155 align:start position:0% line:91%
MOVEMENT -- HAVE ATTEMPTED TO
GET PEOPLE TO VIEW THEMSELVES AS

00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:46.926 align:start position:0% line:91%
PART OF A SMALLER GROUP
DESERVING OF SOMETHING FROM

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.363 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOCIETY ."

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.764 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS NOT A GAFFE.

00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:54.967 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS HOW JEB BUSH REALLY
FEELS.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.603 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE THINKS THE SYSTEMIC
OPPRESSION OF BLACK PEOPLE BY

00:03:57.636 --> 00:04:02.141 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHITE AMERICA IS A "BLACK"
STRATEGY.

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:06.612 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT IN THE 1950s, BLACK
PEOPLE HAD MEETINGS TO TRY TO BE

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:13.452 align:start position:0% line:91%
MORE VICTIM-Y --
LIKE "WE ARE NOT GETTING NEARLY

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:16.122 align:start position:0% line:91%
SEGREGATED ENOUGH OUT THERE!"
AND "HOW DO WE GET THE POLICE TO

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:18.491 align:start position:0% line:85%
BEAT US MORE?

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:19.792 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE NEED IDEAS, PEOPLE!

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:23.462 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHO SAID DOGS?

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:24.864 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHO SAID DOGS?

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:26.098 align:start position:0% line:85%
WATER HOSES!

00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:28.301 align:start position:0% line:85%
VERY GOOD!

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:32.004 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS HOW WE ENTER THE
1960s, PEOPLE!"

00:04:32.037 --> 00:04:33.372 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOOK, I HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD
MY WHOLE LIFE.

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:36.809 line:91%
MY PARENTS TOLD ME I HAD TO WORK
TWICE AS HARD FOR HALF AS MUCH.

00:04:36.842 --> 00:04:40.279 line:91%
THAT'S BEEN MY MENTALITY, AND
THAT IS THE MENTALITY FOR MANY

00:04:40.312 --> 00:04:41.447 align:start position:0% line:85%
BLACK AMERICANS.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.948 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT IS NOT THAT WE THINK OF
OURSELVES AS VICTIMS WHO DESERVE

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:45.584 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOUR HANDOUTS.

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:47.453 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE TO
WORK OUR ASSES OFF TO OVERCOME A

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:49.955 align:start position:0% line:91%
SYSTEM THAT FOR DECADES HAS
INSTITUTIONALIZED WAYS TO KEEP

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:52.224 align:start position:0% line:85%
US OUT OF SOCIETY.

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:55.061 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO THE IDEA THAT BLACK PEOPLE
ARE STRATEGIZING TO GET ANYTHING

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:57.129 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOR FREE OUT OF THIS COUNTRY IS
INSULTING.

00:04:57.162 --> 00:04:58.362 align:start position:0% line:85%
EXCLAMATION POINT.
