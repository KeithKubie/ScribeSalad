00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
 . 

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.270
 Let us solve more of the issues that are gathered 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.950
 The concepts we learned in the last two presentations 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.140
 So let's assume that we have 4x + 3 variance 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.850
 -1 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.440
 Let's find all the x values ​​that you achieve 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.880
 If the first thing I would do better is get rid of this 3 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.430
 So let's subtract 3 from both ends of this equation 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.980
 If the left side becomes 4x 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.320
 This is deleted 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.060
 This ends up being zero 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.200
 There is no reason for us to change the disparate yet 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.630
 We only combine and subtract from both sides 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.375
 In this case, we ask 

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.780
 This will not change the difference as long as we 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.460
 We offer the same value 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.300
 We have -1-3 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.680
 This equals -4 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.610
 -1 - 3 = -4 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.380
 And then will - let us see, we can divide the two ends 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.375
 This equation is on 4 

00:00:55.375 --> 00:01:00.390
 Divide the ends of this equation to 4 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.760
 Again, when we multiply or divide the ends 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.190
 Mixed on a positive number, this does not change 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.990
 Differentiated 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.255
 If we have an x ​​in the left side 

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:15.070
 x &lt;-4 4 4 = -1 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.960
 x &lt;-1 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.210
 Or we can write it in the period format 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.080
 All x values ​​are negative from infinity to -1, but 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.900
 Not include -1, so we put 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.900
 Quotations here 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.980
 Let's solve a harder example 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.500
 Suppose we have 5x&gt; = 8x + 27 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.620
 So let's put all the x expressions on the left side, and 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.360
 The best way to do this is to subtract-8x from both ends 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.360
 If 8x is offered by both parties 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.640
 The left side becomes 5x - 8x 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.040
 This equals -3x 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.520
 We still have a bigger signal than 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.560
 We are adding or subtracting the same 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.040
 Quantities on both sides 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.960
 These 8x are deleted and we have 27 left 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.180
 If we have 3x&gt; 27- 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.320
 Now, all we turn this into x, we have to divide both 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.900
 The parties on -3 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.450
 But remember, when we hit or split the ends 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.140
 Mixed on negative number, reflect 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.550
 Differentiated 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:29.140
 If we divide both sides on -3, we will have to 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.760
 We reflect these disparities 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.800
 I will go from a larger signal than 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.410
 To signal less than 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.090
 The way I remember the elder of 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.410
 Is that the left side seems bigger 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.550
 This is the biggest of 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.800
 If you imagine this rise, this rise is greater 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.170
 From that height, it is a point 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.970
 I do not know if this is bothering you or not 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.830
 These are less than 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.090
 This point is less than 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.160
 The distance of that great opening 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.490
 So I remember her 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.550
 But anyway, 3x / -3 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.280
 So now we have divided both parties on a negative number, ie on 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.410
 -3, reflect the variance of the larger than 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.870
 To less than 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.490
 On the left side, the 3 is deleted 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.430
 We get x &lt;/ 3 -3 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.820
 Which equals -9 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.600
 Or a period code, will be all about 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.720
 Endless to 9, not including 9 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.350
 If you want to represent them on the setup line 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.530
 It will look like this 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.080
 These will be -9, maybe it's going to be 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.350
 -8, and this -10 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.770
 It will start from -9, and will not include it, because it is not 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.190
 We have a signal of equality here, and we take everything less than 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.860
 So, down, as we see, to infinitely negative 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.540
 Let us solve a complex issue 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:05.930
 Let's assume that we have (8x-5 (4x + 1&gt; 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.290
 = -1 + 2 (4x - 3) 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.330
 Now, maybe it looks tough, but if 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.240
 We simplified it step by step, you will see it is no more difficult than 

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.269
 Any of the issues we have solved 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.519
 So let's simplify it 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.990
 We get 8x - - let's distribute this 5 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.590
 Let me say 8x, and then distribute the 5 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.560
 -5 × 4x = -20x 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.760
 5. When I say -5, I am talking about 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.650
 that's all 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.510
 -5 × 1 = -5, then this will be 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.660
 Greater than or equal to -1 + 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.210
 2 x 4x = 8x 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.940
 2 x -3 = -6 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.490
 Now we can combine these two expressions, 8x - 20x = 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:04.120
 -12x - 5&gt; = 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.040
 - We can incorporate constants, -1-6 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.070
 = -7, and then we have + 8x 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.620
 Now, I'd better get all the x expressions in the left side 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.255
 So let's subtract 8x from both ends of this equation 

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:30.670
 We subtract 8x from both ends of this equation 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.700
 I am subtracting 8x 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.900
 This left side, -12-8 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.900
 = -20 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.270
 -20x-5 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.710
 Again, there is no reason to change 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.380
 Different yet 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.910
 All we are doing is simplifying the parties, or gathering and 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.740
 We ask them 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.220
 The right side becomes - this is deleted, 8x 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.600
 - 8x = 0-- 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.690
 If we have 7 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.690
 Now I want to get rid of this 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.910
 So let's add 5 sides to this equation 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.860
 Add 5 to the ends of this equation 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.540
 We have left-side left-20x 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.600
 These 5 are deleted 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.300
 There is no reason for us to change the disparate yet 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.330
 -7 + 5 = -2 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.710
 Now, we got to an interesting point 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.810
 We have -20x&gt; = 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.460
 2 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.000
 If this is an equation, or really any kind of 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.740
 Equations, we will divide both sides on -20 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.520
 But we must remember, that when we multiply or divide 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.370
 The two sides are different on the negative number, we have to 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.810
 Differing reflectors 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.250
 Let us remember that 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.761
 If we divide this aspect on -20 and this division 

00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:50.900
 On the 20th side, all I did was take these two sides 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.350
 And divide them by 20, we have to reverse the disparities 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.560
 Greater than or equal to become smaller than or 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.990
 Equal 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.380
 Of course, these are deleted, and we get x &lt; 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.550
 = - Negative signs are deleted - 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.590
 2/20 = 1/10 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.490
 If we want to write it with a period code, the 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.440
 The upper limit will be 1/10 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.670
 They noted, we will complement it, because we have a signal of equality 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.220
 Less than or equal to, so we will include 1/10, and 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.210
 We will go down to the minus endlessly 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.260
 Anything less than or equal to 1/10 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.600
 This is another way to write 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.670
 For fun, let's draw the line of preparation 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.380
 Let's draw a line here 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.520
 Maybe this will be zero, this is the 1 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.610
 Maybe 1/10 is located here 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.090
 Anything less than or equal to 1/10 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:51.620
 If we include 1/10 and everything less than it 

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.010
 It will be within the solution set 

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.900
 You can try any value less than 1/10 and 

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.400
 Verify that they will achieve this disparity 

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.333
 .
