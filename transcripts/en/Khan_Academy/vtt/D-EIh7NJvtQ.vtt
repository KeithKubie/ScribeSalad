00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.410
We already know that
an angle is formed

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.440
when two rays share
a common endpoint.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.650
So, for example, let's say
that this is one ray right

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.000
over here, and then this is one
another ray right over here,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.264
and then they would
form an angle.

00:00:13.264 --> 00:00:14.680
And at this point
right over here,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.660
their common endpoint is called
the vertex of that angle.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.750
Now, we also know that not
all angles seem the same.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.720
For example, this
is one angle here,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.850
and then we could
have another angle

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.733
that looks something like this.

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:36.040
And viewed this way,
it looks like this one

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.410
is much more open.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.070
So I'll say more open.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.800
And this one right over
here seems less open.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.049
So to avoid having to just say,
oh, more open and less open

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.340
and actually becoming a little
bit more exact about it,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.830
we'd actually want to
measure how open an angle is,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.330
or we'd want to have a
measure of the angle.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.590
Now, the most typical way
that angles are measured,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.610
there's actually two major
ways of that they're measured.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.570
The most typical
unit is in degrees,

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.290
but later on in
high school, you'll

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.610
also see the unit of radians
being used, especially when you

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.340
learn trigonometry.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.749
But the degrees convention
really comes from a circle.

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:20.790
So let's draw ourselves
a circle right over here,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.830
so that's a circle.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.250
And the convention is that--
when I say convention,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.310
it's just kind of what
everyone has been doing.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.370
The convention is that you
have 360 degrees in a circle.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.720
So let me explain that.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.340
So if that's the
center of the circle,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.070
and if we make this ray our
starting point or one side

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.600
of our angle, if you go all
the way around the circle,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.505
that represents 360 degrees.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.810
And the notation is 360, and
then this little superscript

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.980
circle represents degrees.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.090
This could be read
as 360 degrees.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.500
Now, you might be saying, where
did this 360 number come from?

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.790
And no one knows for sure,
but there's hints in history,

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.310
and there's hints in just the
way that the universe works,

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.780
or at least the Earth's
rotation around the sun.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.650
You might recognize
or you might already

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.520
realize that there are 365
days in a non-leap year, 366

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.810
in a leap year.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.420
And so you can imagine ancient
astronomers might have said,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:38.780
well, you know, that's
pretty close to 360.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.940
And in fact, several
ancient calendars,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.010
including the Persians
and the Mayans,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.360
had 360 days in their year.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.730
And 360 is also a much
neater number than 365.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.100
It has many, many more factors.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.570
It's another way of saying it's
divisible by a bunch of things.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.290
But anyway, this has just been
the convention, once again,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.950
what history has handed
us, that a circle is

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.800
viewed to have 360 degrees.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.070
And so one way we
could measure an angle

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.090
is you could put one of the
rays of an angle right over here

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.220
at this part of the circle, and
then the other ray of the angle

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.200
will look something like this.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.580
And then the fraction of
the circle circumference

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.260
that is intersected by these two
rays, the measure of this angle

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.010
would be that
fraction of degrees.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.900
So, for example, let's say that
this length right over here

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.253
is 1/6 of the circle's
circumference.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.260
So it's 1/6 of the
way around the circle.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.290
Then this angle
right over here is

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.010
going to be 1/6 of 360 degrees.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.200
So in this case, this
would be 60 degrees.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.920
I could do another example.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.970
So let's say I had a circle like
this, and I'll draw an angle.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.540
I'll put the vertex at
the center of the angle.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.330
I'll put one of the
rays right over here.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.100
You could consider
that to be 0 degrees.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.790
Or if the other ray was also
here, it would be 0 degrees.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.540
And then I'll make the
other ray of this angle,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.910
let's say it went straight up.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.490
Let's say it went
straight up like this.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.390
Well, in this
situation, the arc that

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.110
connects these two
endpoints just like this,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.940
this represents 1/4 of the
circumference of the circle.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.916
This is, right over here,
1/4 of the circumference.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.400
So this angle right over here is
going to be 1/4 of 360 degrees.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.210
360 degrees divided by 4
is going to be 90 degrees.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.680
At an angle like this, one where
one ray is straight up and down

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.200
and the other one goes to
the right/left direction,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.760
we would say these two
rays are perpendicular,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.940
or we would call
this a right angle.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.650
And the way that we
oftentimes will denote that

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.360
is by a symbol like this.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.930
But this literally
means a 90-degree angle.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.355
Let's do one more example.

00:05:24.355 --> 00:05:25.980
Let's do one more
example of this, just

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.550
to make sure that we
understand what's going on.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.810
Actually, at least
one more example.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.930
Maybe one more if we have time.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.300
So let's say that we have an
angle that looks like this.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.750
Once more, I'm going
to put its vertex

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.150
at the center of the circle.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.020
That's one ray of the angle.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.110
And let's say that
this is the other ray.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.110
This right over here is
the other ray of the angle.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.300
I encourage you to
pause this video

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.710
and try to figure out what
the measure of this angle

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.900
right over here is.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.400
Well, let's think about where
the rays intersect the circle.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.090
They intersect there and there.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.490
The arc that connects
them on the circle

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.380
is that arc right over there.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.850
That is literally half of the
circumference of the circle.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.730
That is half of the
circumference, half of the way

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.010
around of the circle,
circumference of the circle.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.570
So this angle is going to
be half of 360 degrees.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.006
And half of 360 is 180 degrees.

00:06:26.006 --> 00:06:27.880
And when you view it
this way, these two rays

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.970
share a common endpoint.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.572
And together, they're
really forming a line here.

00:06:32.572 --> 00:06:34.030
And let's just do
one more example,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.716
because I said I would.

00:06:36.716 --> 00:06:39.580
Let me paste another circle.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.100
Let me draw another angle.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.040
Let me draw another angle.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.540
So let's say that's
one ray of the angle,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.360
and this is the other ray.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.720
This is the other ray of
the angle right over here.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.221
And we care.

00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:55.053
There's actually two
angles that are formed.

00:06:55.053 --> 00:06:57.290
There's actually two angles
formed in all of these.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.330
There's one angle that's
formed right over here,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.970
and you might recognize that
to be a 90-degree angle.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.580
But what we really care
about in this example

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.180
is this angle right over here.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.690
So once again, where does
it intersect the circle?

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.580
We care about this
arc right over here,

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.720
because that's the
arc that corresponds

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.670
to this angle right over here.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.770
And it looks like we've
gone 3/4 around the circle.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:28.510
So this angle is going
to be 3/4 of 360 degrees.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.340
1/4 of 360 degrees is
90, so three of those

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.142
is going to be 270 degrees.
