asking for more scopes we also need to
set our language and this we can usually

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290
set our language and this we can usually
 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.640
set our language and this we can usually
get by going to NS locale preferred

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650

to need the users ID you'll recall back
in our earlier presentation when we got

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799
in our earlier presentation when we got
 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.399
in our earlier presentation when we got
our access token back from the system we

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409
our access token back from the system we
 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.170

then use that to make another call

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180
then use that to make another call
 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.330
then use that to make another call
saying okay now that I have this Oh auth

signing an object so you probably

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370
signing an object so you probably
 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.980
signing an object so you probably
haven't used this setting before but it

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990
haven't used this setting before but it

now you'll notice that at this point

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789
now you'll notice that at this point
 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.370
now you'll notice that at this point
we're getting a warning and this is

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380
we're getting a warning and this is
 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.020
we're getting a warning and this is
because we've set signed in delegate to

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.480
minute this class is in a GPP sign-in

next to this interface line we're going

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160
next to this interface line we're going
 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.969
next to this interface line we're going
to say that this class conforms to the

to say that this class conforms to the
 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.820
to say that this class conforms to the
GPP sign-in delegate at this point we

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830
GPP sign-in delegate at this point we
 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.740
GPP sign-in delegate at this point we
get out another warning saying well okay

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750
get out another warning saying well okay
 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.779
get out another warning saying well okay
you said that it conforms to the GPP

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789
you said that it conforms to the GPP
 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.730
you said that it conforms to the GPP
sign-in delegate protocol but you

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740
sign-in delegate protocol but you
 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.089
sign-in delegate protocol but you
haven't implemented this required

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099
haven't implemented this required
 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.360
haven't implemented this required
finished with auth error method which is

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370
finished with auth error method which is
 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.399
finished with auth error method which is
required in this GPP sign-in delegate

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409
required in this GPP sign-in delegate
 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.879
required in this GPP sign-in delegate
protocol so we can do that as well so

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889
protocol so we can do that as well so
 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.350
protocol so we can do that as well so
we'll add finished with auth error and

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360
we'll add finished with auth error and
 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.260
we'll add finished with auth error and
basically this is the call that our sign

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270
basically this is the call that our sign
 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.230
basically this is the call that our sign
an object is going to make it's part of

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240
an object is going to make it's part of
 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.230
an object is going to make it's part of
the delegate protocol that says hey the

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240
the delegate protocol that says hey the
 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.149
the delegate protocol that says hey the
user is finished signing in hopefully

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159
user is finished signing in hopefully
 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.520
user is finished signing in hopefully
there is an auth object attached to it

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530
there is an auth object attached to it
 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.460
there is an auth object attached to it
and if not here's an error object that

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470
and if not here's an error object that
 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.040
and if not here's an error object that
explains what went wrong so for right

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050
explains what went wrong so for right
 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.670
explains what went wrong so for right
now let's just print something out to

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680
now let's just print something out to
 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.270
now let's just print something out to
our log file so NS log I am finished

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280
our log file so NS log I am finished
 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:19.770
our log file so NS log I am finished
with off off is this object and error is

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780
with off off is this object and error is
 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.730
with off off is this object and error is
this and we'll add our oath and error

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740
this and we'll add our oath and error
 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.860
this and we'll add our oath and error
objects so that hopefully we get

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870
objects so that hopefully we get
 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.510
objects so that hopefully we get
something interesting in the debug

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520
something interesting in the debug
 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:34.660
something interesting in the debug
output so now we can run this

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670
 
 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.680
 
and nothing interesting happens well

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690
and nothing interesting happens well
 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.570
and nothing interesting happens well
that's because I didn't actually sign

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580
that's because I didn't actually sign
 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.550
that's because I didn't actually sign
the user in anywhere we've initialized

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560
the user in anywhere we've initialized
 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.070
the user in anywhere we've initialized
our GPP sign-in object but then we

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080
our GPP sign-in object but then we
 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.780
our GPP sign-in object but then we
haven't actually done anything with it

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790
haven't actually done anything with it
 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.480
haven't actually done anything with it
luckily this is an easy fix and we will

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490
luckily this is an easy fix and we will
 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:58.839
luckily this is an easy fix and we will
tackle that in our next lesson

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:58.849
 
 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:00.460
 
hahaha

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470
hahaha
 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.860
hahaha
haha
