00:00:00.164 --> 00:00:02.033
So I’ve just told you the difference between

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:04.534
revenue streams and pricing models, but let’s

00:00:04.534 --> 00:00:07.652
take a look at an example. So imagine I have

00:00:07.652 --> 00:00:10.833
15 sales reps and they cover 27 cities in the

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:12.735
United States, and they are traveling all the

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:15.102
time and they work for me. And by the way,

00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:19.101
my product, its material cost is $99 and I

00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:22.504
decided I’m going to add $30 gross margin

00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:25.730
on top of it, so I sell the product for $129.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.803
So why don’t you think about this for a second

00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:30.868
and tell me, which part was the revenue

00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:34.617
stream and which part was the pricing tactic.

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.821
Are the sales reps in 27 cities the revenue stream,

00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:41.704
or are the cost plus $30 the revenue stream.

00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:44.371
Was the pricing tactics the sales rep or

00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:48.000
was it the cost plus the gross margin.
