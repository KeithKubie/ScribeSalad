00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:03.545
- Bladesmiths, this

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:05.255
To see how sharp
your weapons are,

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:08.466
I will attempt to cut open
these heavy-duty leather bags.

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.759
Alex, you're up first.
You ready?

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:10.635
No.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:12.679
Let's do this anyway.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.473
ALEX: I'm the first one to
have their blade tested,

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:17.559
so I'm also the first
one to freak out.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.978
My heart is really pounding.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:24.733
[music playing]

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.572
OK, Alex.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:35.118
It has the edge that definitely
will cut through the bag.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.830
You've got the mass that
definitely dug in to the apron.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.876
Overall, I think
your blade will cut.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:43.626
Good job.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:44.544
Thank you.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:45.670
Mike, let's do this.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.380
Let's do it.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.673
I'm quite nervous.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:51.342
I didn't get a good edge on it.

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:54.137
I'm just afraid the blade
will bounce off the bag.

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:54.971
[sighs]

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.809
[music playing]

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:06.816
OK, Mike, you
have the right edge

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.444
geometry to slash into the bag.

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.280
My only issue is the way
the handle feels in my hand.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.826
It's really comfortable to hold
a blade this way, not this way.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.913
Otherwise, your blade will cut.
- Thank you.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:20.747
Good job.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:21.790
Andrew, ready?

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.916
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.169
[music playing]

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:44.187
Andrew, that's a
small handle, buddy.

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.855
ANDREW: It is.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:48.983
It's hard to hold on to,
but it's got enough grip to be

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:50.318
able to cut through the bags.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.028
Your blade will cut.
- Thank you.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.363
Good job.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.074
Bladesmiths, I'm
going to quite violently

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:58.451
stab downward into
this heavy-duty

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:01.538
steel drum's lid three times.

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:02.288
Alex, ready?

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.170
[music playing]

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:19.722
Alex, it's a little
bit tough to hold

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:23.768
on to between the thickness
back here and the tip

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.645
and handle being
off-centered from each other.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:28.022
You do have some shine, you
do have some rolled spots.

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:29.607
But it's not the whole edge.

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:31.359
Everything's still tight.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.235
Nicely done.

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.945
Thank you.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:34.863
Mike, you're next.

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:35.905
How you feel?

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.657
A little nervous.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:41.703
Being that this is stabbing a
steel blade into a steel drum,

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:44.831
and I really like my hands,
I'm going to add a blade stop.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.499
Thank you.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.752
But the blade stop's going
to be up above your handle,

00:02:49.752 --> 00:02:52.297
so it can't give any
extra support, which

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.883
would be unfair to
the other contestants.

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:57.010
ALEX: I'm concerned with
the structural integrity

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.261
of my blade.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.431
It's either going
to make or break.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:05.727
[music playing]

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:18.239
- Mike, she held up.
- Wow.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.825
You did pick up
a curve, though.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:23.620
Overall, it'll stab.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.454
Nice job.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:25.955
Thank you.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:28.082
Andrew, you ready but
the elf knife to the test?

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.083
I'm ready.

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:33.421
[music playing]

00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:44.557
Penetrated very well.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:50.563
Your edge-- we've lost pieces of
the edge going into that steel.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.482
The handle wasn't
an issue, as far

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.233
as it would have been nice
to have a little more mass

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.526
to hold on to.

00:03:55.526 --> 00:03:58.363
But it's loose now.

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:01.282
But all in all, good job.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:02.575
All right, gents.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.327
The judges have made
a final decision.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.663
It's time for one of
you to leave the Forge.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.873
The bladesmith
leaving the forge is--

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:12.085
[music playing]

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.503
Andrew.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.380
Your blade did not make the cut.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.173
Jay will explain.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.217
JAY: Andrew you made
a heck of a comeback.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:22.053
But at the end of the day,
there's pieces completely

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.513
missing from the edge.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.640
And then you already
had a warp, but it's

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.809
actually bent even
further from the stress

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.310
of hitting that steel.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.187
Probably a few more whacks
in the strength test,

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.564
we'd have had a folder,
just going the wrong way.

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:35.149
So that's why we're
going to let you go.

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:36.317
All right, Andrew.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.276
Please surrender your weapon.

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:39.112
[music playing]

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.238
ANDREW: I'm a
little disappointed.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.614
Thank you, Andrew.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.241
ANDREW: I wanted
it bad, but just

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.784
got hung up in a few spots.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.244
- Good fight, brother.
- Thanks.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.954
Good fight.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.831
ANDREW: But I feel like this
was a test of a lot of things--

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:53.501
character, skill,
problem solving.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:54.961
First thing I do
when I get home,

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.588
I'm getting right
back to knife-making.
