00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:11.575
The oldest glue in the world 
is over 8,000 years old

00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:14.594
and comes from a cave near the Dead Sea.

00:00:14.594 --> 00:00:16.685
Ancient people used this glue,

00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:20.025
made from a mixture of animal bone 
and plant materials,

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:23.725
to waterproof baskets 
and construct utensils.

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:25.449
And for thousands of years after,

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.815
plants and animals were the glue 
that held human civilization together.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:34.856
Today, we have enough types of tape and
glue to build and repair almost anything.

00:00:34.856 --> 00:00:38.607
But what gives glue 
and tape their stickiness?

00:00:38.607 --> 00:00:41.705
And is one stronger than the other?

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:44.206
Adhesives can be made 
from synthetic molecules

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:47.387
or natural proteins and carbohydrates

00:00:47.387 --> 00:00:49.207
like the vegetable starch dextrin,

00:00:49.207 --> 00:00:51.087
the milk protein casein,

00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:53.936
and the terpenes in tree resin.

00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:59.808
In order to work, glue and tape need 
both adhesive bonds and cohesive bonds.

00:00:59.808 --> 00:01:03.929
Adhesive bonds occur between 
an adhesive’s molecules

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.968
and the molecules 
of whatever it’s sticking to.

00:01:06.968 --> 00:01:11.296
Cohesive bonds happen between 
a glue or tape’s own molecules,

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:13.030
holding it together.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.240
Most glues consist of adhesive polymers 
dissolved in a solvent

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.119
that prevents them from sticking
to the inside of the bottle.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.389
The strong smell of many glues 
comes from the solvent,

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:26.049
which evaporates when exposed to air.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.660
Some glues use water as a solvent,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.528
but others use chemicals 
that can be harmful to inhale.

00:01:32.528 --> 00:01:37.609
Glues with two or more components that
chemically react instead of just drying

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.958
can create stronger bonds.

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.480
Both the adhesive and cohesive bonds 
of glue are strong,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.800
but the drying process 
makes them irreversible.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.989
This is why, if a glued surface 
is broken after it dries,

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:53.720
it can’t be reattached without new glue.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.659
By contrast, 
when tape is applied to a surface,

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.230
it forms weaker, reversible bonds,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.601
so you can peel a piece of tape off 
a surface and use it again.

00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:08.005
These weak bonds, 
called Van der Waals forces,

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:10.720
can occur between any two materials,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.541
but only if they’re 
extremely close together,

00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:15.902
closer than the naked eye can see.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:20.902
Tape usually consists of a backing coated 
with a combination of a rubber

00:02:20.902 --> 00:02:23.592
or rubber-like "stretchy" component,

00:02:23.592 --> 00:02:25.781
and a compound called a tackifier.

00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:29.121
That’s the "sticky" component.

00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:31.071
A tape’s stickiness is determined

00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:34.102
by the proportion of elastic component 
and tackifier,

00:02:34.102 --> 00:02:37.161
the thickness of adhesive spread 
onto the backing,

00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:39.422
and the type of backing material.

00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:43.703
No chemical reaction occurs 
when tape is pressed onto a surface.

00:02:43.703 --> 00:02:49.763
Instead, the soft adhesive flows into 
the cracks and grooves of the surface.

00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:56.513
This ability to slide into cracks and then
stay in place is called viscoelasticity.

00:02:56.513 --> 00:03:01.194
Once the viscoelastic adhesive fills 
these microscopic crevices,

00:03:01.194 --> 00:03:05.144
it is close enough to form 
Van der Waals forces.

00:03:05.144 --> 00:03:08.532
So what’s the world’s strongest adhesive?

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:11.314
Well, there’s no one answer.

00:03:11.314 --> 00:03:14.144
In terms of absolute strength 
of adhesive bonds,

00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:16.485
glue is stronger than tape,

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:20.604
but no single adhesive
works well in all circumstances.

00:03:20.604 --> 00:03:25.054
Of the glues, cyanoacrylates, 
or super glues,

00:03:25.054 --> 00:03:27.715
may form the strongest bonds,

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:32.846
but two-component epoxy glues have much
higher resistance to heat and shearing,

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:36.685
and are compatible 
with a wider range of surfaces.

00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:40.185
So, if you wanted 
to dangle an anvil in the air,

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:42.596
super glue might be your best bet.

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:46.055
But if you’re doing so 
over an active volcano,

00:03:46.055 --> 00:03:48.405
you’d want an epoxy instead.

00:03:48.405 --> 00:03:49.747
And in order to work at all,

00:03:49.747 --> 00:03:52.880
glues need enough real estate 
where surfaces touch.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.245
If for some reason you wanted 
to make a chain of bowling balls,

00:03:56.245 --> 00:03:58.921
duct tape would be better.

00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:03.716
Engineers weigh similar, 
if less absurd, factors all the time.

00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:06.753
Choosing the right glue to withstand 
the heat inside an engine

00:04:06.753 --> 00:04:08.858
is a matter of life and death.

00:04:08.858 --> 00:04:11.716
And though the strength 
of duct tape’s adhesive bonds

00:04:11.716 --> 00:04:14.177
can’t compete with those of epoxy glues,

00:04:14.177 --> 00:04:18.846
tape does have the advantage of 
instantaneous stickiness in an emergency.

00:04:18.846 --> 00:04:22.477
Glue may be necessary 
to get a rocket to space,

00:04:22.477 --> 00:04:25.207
but when it comes 
to extraterrestrial repairs,

00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:30.348
stick to duct tape: 
liquid glues don’t work in zero gravity.
