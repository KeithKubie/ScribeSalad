00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:05.191
- We're in the MoMA stores looking at

00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:09.129
the symbolic representation in 1913

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.243
of industrial progress and technology

00:00:13.243 --> 00:00:15.042
by Ludwig Hohlwein.

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:18.003
Who was based in Munich
and was at the forefront

00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.527
of a movement known as the Plakatstil,

00:00:21.527 --> 00:00:25.920
which gave prominence to
the product being advertised

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.147
using the most economic
of means and colors.

00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:33.255
You can see how he's really exploited

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.922
the tonalities of the
sea and sky to create

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:40.697
this dramatic composition
of interlocking shapes.

00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:43.948
It's a poster lithographically
printed in Munich

00:00:43.948 --> 00:00:48.485
and it advertises the machine
tools produced by Schiess.

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:50.263
Schiess were the main supplier

00:00:50.263 --> 00:00:54.487
for the great government
Navy shipyards in Germany.

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:56.490
And they were based in Dusseldorf,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.009
the industrial heartland.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:03.939
In this image, Hohlwein has concentrated

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.195
on the mysterious and stealthy presence

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.934
of a submarine in the background.

00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:12.261
And in the foreground,

00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:16.098
the machine tools that were
produced by the client.

00:01:17.048 --> 00:01:19.266
With the simplest of means

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:24.266
Hohlwein has communicated
the merger of sky and sea

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.874
and the stealthy power
of this innovative U-boat

00:01:29.874 --> 00:01:34.284
which was to play a key
role in the First World War.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.229
In fact, only two years later,

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.455
in 1915 it was a U-boat

00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:43.754
responsible for sinking the Lusitania,

00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:48.305
that directly provoked the
engagement of the United States

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:50.121
in the First World War.

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:51.715
(gentle music)
