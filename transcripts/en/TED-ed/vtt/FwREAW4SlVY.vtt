00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:09.745
When it was ratified in 1789,

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:14.154
the U.S. Constitution didn't just
institute a government by the people.

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:19.498
It provided a way for the people to alter
the constitution itself.

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:24.490
And yet, of the nearly 11,000 amendments
proposed in the centuries since,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.732
only 27 have succeeded as of 2016.

00:00:28.732 --> 00:00:32.723
So what is it that makes the Constitution
so hard to change?

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:35.166
In short, its creators.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.808
The founders of the United States
were trying to create a unified country

00:00:38.808 --> 00:00:41.254
from thirteen different colonies,

00:00:41.254 --> 00:00:45.927
which needed assurance that their 
agreements couldn't be easily undone.

00:00:45.927 --> 00:00:47.404
So here's what they decided.

00:00:47.404 --> 00:00:50.134
For an amendment to even be proposed,

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:52.939
it must receive 
a two-thirds vote of approval

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:55.514
in both houses of Congress,

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:58.930
or a request from two-thirds 
of state legislatures

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.312
to call a national convention,

00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:03.010
and that's just the first step.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.104
To actually change the Constitution,

00:01:05.104 --> 00:01:09.872
the amendment must be ratified
by three-quarters of all states.

00:01:09.872 --> 00:01:13.930
To do this, each state can either have
its legislature vote on the amendment,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.501
or it can hold a separate 
ratification convention

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:20.101
with delegates elected by voters.

00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:22.003
The result of such high thresholds

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:26.065
is that, today, 
the American Constitution is quite static.

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:29.926
Most other democracies pass amendments
every couple of years.

00:01:29.926 --> 00:01:34.628
The U.S., on the other hand, 
hasn't passed one since 1992.

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:39.004
At this point, you may wonder how any
amendments managed to pass at all.

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.480
The first ten, 
known as the Bill of Rights,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.571
includes some of America's 
most well-known freedoms,

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:46.183
such as the freedom of speech,

00:01:46.183 --> 00:01:48.146
and the right to a fair trial.

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:49.654
These were passed all at once

00:01:49.654 --> 00:01:53.971
to resolve some conflicts from 
the original Constitutional Convention.

00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:57.319
Years later, the Thirteenth Amendment,
which abolished slavery,

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.089
as well as the Fourteenth 
and Fifteenth Amendments,

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:03.309
only passed after a bloody civil war.

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:05.915
Ratifying amendments 
has also become harder

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:09.193
as the country has grown larger
and more diverse.

00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:11.158
The first ever proposed amendment,

00:02:11.158 --> 00:02:13.765
a formula to assign 
congressional representatives,

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:17.181
was on the verge of ratification
in the 1790s.

00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:20.135
However, as more and more states
joined the union,

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:24.414
the number needed to reach 
the three-quarter mark increased as well,

00:02:24.414 --> 00:02:27.187
leaving it unratified to this day.

00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:29.383
Today, there are many 
suggested amendments,

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:31.694
including outlawing 
the burning of the flag,

00:02:31.694 --> 00:02:33.435
limiting congressional terms,

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:35.978
or even repealing the Second Amendment.

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:40.511
While many enjoy strong support,
their likelihood of passing is slim.

00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:45.148
Americans today are the most politically
polarized since the Civil War,

00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:49.012
making it nearly impossible to reach
a broad consensus.

00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:52.302
In fact, the late Supreme Court Justice
Antonin Scalia

00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:56.423
once calculated that due to America's
representative system of government,

00:02:56.423 --> 00:03:02.500
it could take as little as 2% of the total
population to block an amendment.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.200
Of course, the simplest solution would be
to make the Constitution easier to amend

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.351
by lowering the thresholds required
for proposal and ratification.

00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.382
That, however, would require 
its own amendment.

00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:19.140
Instead, historical progress has mainly
come from the U.S. Supreme Court,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.512
which has expanded its interpretation
of existing constitutional laws

00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:25.412
to keep up with the times.

00:03:25.412 --> 00:03:28.345
Considering that Supreme Court justices
are unelected

00:03:28.345 --> 00:03:30.661
and serve for life once appointed,

00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:33.618
this is far from 
the most democratic option.

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:38.389
Interestingly, the founders themselves
may have foreseen this problem early on.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:39.833
In a letter to James Madison,

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:45.122
Thomas Jefferson wrote 
that laws should expire every 19 years

00:03:45.122 --> 00:03:47.855
rather than having to be changed
or repealed

00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:51.166
since every political process 
is full of obstacles

00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:53.418
that distort the will of the people.

00:03:53.418 --> 00:03:54.416
Although he believed

00:03:54.416 --> 00:03:57.224
that the basic principles 
of the Constitution would endure,

00:03:57.224 --> 00:03:59.994
he stressed that the Earth belongs
to the living,

00:03:59.994 --> 00:04:01.398
and not to the dead.
