00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.150
Let's assume that you want to send a message from

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.000
Atlanta to San Francisco. And to make it easier, let's

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.390
assume that we want to send a simple message which

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.380
consists of n coin flips, or the output of ten coin

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.370
flips. Let us construct two messages out of coin flips.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.770
Now, I have two coins, but you see these coins

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.550
are different because this one has a heads and a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.280
tails, it has two different sides, And this one has both

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.450
the sides which are very similar looking. So its a

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.170
biased coin so every time I flip its going have

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.540
the same state. While when I flip this it might

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.278
either end up here, 50% of the time or end

00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:42.050
up here 50% of the time. So we'll construct two

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.860
messages after flipping both of them and recording what their

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.100
state is. So here it is, I did ten coin

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.450
flips with the fair coin I got a few heads,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.030
a few tails, in this particular sequence. The unfair

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.800
coin, I'm calling every state as a head state and

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.890
I basically saw ten heads. All right? If you

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.110
also observe the fair coin I have like five heads

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.620
and five tails. So the probability, so it, so it wa, so it is a fair coin. I got

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.470
five heads and five tails, so it is a

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.990
fair coin. So, if I had to transmit this sequence,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.610
how many bits of message will I require? Let's

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.270
assume that I can represent this sequence using ten

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.390
binary digits. A zero representing heads, one representing tails

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.760
and I can write down this sequence as zeros

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.130
and ones using ten bits. I can also write

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.430
down the same sequence with the, of the unfair

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.140
coin using those ten binary digits. So I'll get

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.874
something like zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, one.

00:01:40.874 --> 00:01:44.650
And here, everything will be zeros. Let's assume I have to transmit

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.410
these two particular sequences from Atlanta to San Francisco. What will be

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.060
the size of each message in case of the fair coin and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.020
the unfair coin? What do you think? Write down your answers here.
