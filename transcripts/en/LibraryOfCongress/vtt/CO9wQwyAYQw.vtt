00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.920
&gt;&gt; Melody Zavala: Thank you
so much, I am really humbled

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.930
to be here today with so many
organizations that we know

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.350
and respect from Indonesia,
Afghanistan, Vietnam, India,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.600
Canada, and the United States
What a fantastic crowd.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.140
And it's really my
privilege to direct the Books

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.740
for Asia program at
the Asia Foundation.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.230
Since our inception in 1954,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.210
our Print Book program
has donated more

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.290
than 50 million books.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.960
These books infuse
students with a love

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.930
of reading essential
for literacy.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.740
And today, our network
of 18 offices

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.420
across Asia reach 9
million people annually

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.460
with half a million brand
new print books and eBooks.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.500
Our goal is to provide books to
children and adults to develop

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.970
to their full potential
to contribute

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.250
to their community
and their country.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.740
So, we were asked to speak
about best practices we use

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.100
to advance literacy, and
I'll try to boil that down.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.520
In terms of best practices, for
us, innovation is really kind

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.710
of a never-ending pursuit to
empower local communities,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.210
or to find the ways that
empower local communities

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.090
to solve root problems.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.120
For sustainability,
we think the secret --

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.180
I'm a little uncoordinated
here, excuse me.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.480
Ah, there we go.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.240
For sustainability, I
really think the secret is

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.100
to reduce the barriers
to participate.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.180
For replicability, our approach
is to reduce barriers to scale.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.180
And beyond this, it's important
to determine which inputs lead

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.020
to which -- solve
which problems,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.000
and to achieve measurable
results.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.930
We really believe it's important
to measure not only data

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.040
and analytics, but
to measure attitudes,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.860
and to continue to adopt.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.120
So, turning back to innovation.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.800
To empower local communities
to solve root problems.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.440
In just over the last
two years, we've created

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.600
and added a program
called Let's Read.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.240
It's a digital initiative that
we've added to our portfolio

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.780
to connect publishers,
readers, and translators

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.930
into a single community.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.480
We invite you to
collaborate with us on this.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.270
As you know, there's not
enough books in languages

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.960
that children speak at home and
in school to inspire reading.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.630
And at the same time,
there's not enough demand

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.300
from school systems and families
to encourage publishers to move

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.190
into children's content.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.250
This is the situation in most
of the countries where we work,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.550
and it's a vicious circle.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.660
Our innovation with Let's
Read is to use community pride

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.910
and technology to engage
the average citizens

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.970
in solving the root problems
of supply and demand for books.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.230
In doing so, we turn them
into literacy advocates

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.320
who promote reading
in their communities.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.520
Let's Read includes
a free to use,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.790
open source digital
library platform with built

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.180
in translation and
mobile reading apps.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.510
These tools combine with
catalyzing workshops,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.600
and most importantly involve
partnerships on the ground,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.090
empower communities to
create their own libraries

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.190
in their own languages.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.000
Local authors, illustrators,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.700
and editors create new
local language content

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.340
with creative commons licensing,
and to date eBook hackathons.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.730
These books get added to
the Let's Read platform.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.410
And bilingual community members,
not professional translators,

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.180
adapt storybooks
already in the platform

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.280
into local languages using
our innovative Crowd Sourcing

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.440
Translation Editing tool.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.310
This rapidly builds up the
local language library.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.220
With Let's Read, books and local
languages get created faster,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.590
cheaper, and more inclusively.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.410
Our secret to sustainability is

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.750
to reduce barriers
to participate.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.370
We design, test, and
adapt interventions

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.270
and collaboration
with end users.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.100
And we use low-cost,
high gain interventions

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.900
that local organizations can
mostly shoulder and maintain.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:42.080
I'll move to the conclusion
and just really say that,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.010
Let's Read has the potential
to reach millions of children

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.390
that wouldn't otherwise
have the opportunity

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.930
to develop the essential
skill of reading.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.120
It's especially designed
to reach children

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.610
who reach minority -- who
speak minority languages,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.670
or those who are out of school
due to civil conflict, gender,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.770
other forms of discrimination,
or poverty.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.170
And it enables them
to access books

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.830
in languages they
understand anytime, anywhere.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.050
We look forward to sharing
content with you, collaborating

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.590
with you all towards our common
goal of nurturing young readers.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.450
And by increasing the quantity
and diversity of books in ways

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.320
that transcends existing
constraints.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.160
Thanks so much.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.830

of the Library of Congress.
