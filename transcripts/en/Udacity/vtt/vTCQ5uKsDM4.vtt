00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.610
The first thing I want to do is figure out what

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.650
the lowest score is. The methods I have available are

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.890
find, low score, and remove. So first I want to find

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.870
what the low score is. I'll call low score and put

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.610
the result into a variable of type double. Then I'll

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.800
find the exact location of that score that I know is

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.560
the lowest. By using the find method, and then once

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.000
I know where it is, I can remove it, using remove.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.540
Now that we've implemented removeLowest, a

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.380
user of the homeworkScores class could

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.980
call removeLowest before calculating the sum or average of the final grade.
