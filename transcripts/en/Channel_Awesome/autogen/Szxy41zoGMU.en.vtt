episode it's just you know naturally I
 

00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
episode it's just you know naturally I
think<00:11:59.479><c> that's</c><00:11:59.629><c> what</c><00:11:59.869><c> the</c><00:12:00.169><c> whole</c><00:12:00.349><c> point</c><00:12:01.129><c> was</c>

00:12:01.599 --> 00:12:01.609 align:start position:0%
think that's what the whole point was
 

00:12:01.609 --> 00:12:05.049 align:start position:0%
think that's what the whole point was
and<00:12:02.439><c> she</c><00:12:03.439><c> started</c><00:12:03.769><c> kind</c><00:12:03.979><c> of</c><00:12:04.129><c> not</c><00:12:04.369><c> it</c><00:12:04.639><c> wasn't</c>

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:05.059 align:start position:0%
and she started kind of not it wasn't
 

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:08.919 align:start position:0%
and she started kind of not it wasn't
working<00:12:05.389><c> so</c><00:12:05.599><c> well</c><00:12:06.309><c> so</c><00:12:07.309><c> I</c><00:12:07.819><c> mean</c><00:12:07.879><c> that's</c><00:12:08.599><c> my</c>

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:08.929 align:start position:0%
working so well so I mean that's my
 

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:10.929 align:start position:0%
working so well so I mean that's my
guess<00:12:09.229><c> of</c><00:12:09.379><c> why</c><00:12:09.619><c> she</c><00:12:09.979><c> was</c><00:12:10.099><c> sabotaging</c><00:12:10.309><c> and</c>

00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:10.939 align:start position:0%
guess of why she was sabotaging and
 

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
guess of why she was sabotaging and
making<00:12:11.209><c> James</c><00:12:11.539><c> look</c><00:12:11.839><c> bad</c><00:12:12.169><c> I</c><00:12:12.979><c> could</c><00:12:13.369><c> be</c>

00:12:13.479 --> 00:12:13.489 align:start position:0%
making James look bad I could be
 

00:12:13.489 --> 00:12:15.129 align:start position:0%
making James look bad I could be
completely<00:12:13.639><c> wrong</c><00:12:14.059><c> they</c><00:12:14.479><c> can</c><00:12:14.629><c> be</c><00:12:14.839><c> completely</c>

00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:15.139 align:start position:0%
completely wrong they can be completely
 

00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:17.859 align:start position:0%
completely wrong they can be completely
off<00:12:15.529><c> base</c><00:12:15.829><c> here</c><00:12:16.249><c> but</c><00:12:17.029><c> it</c><00:12:17.149><c> just</c><00:12:17.359><c> seems</c><00:12:17.629><c> logical</c>

00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:17.869 align:start position:0%
off base here but it just seems logical
 

00:12:17.869 --> 00:12:21.489 align:start position:0%
off base here but it just seems logical
that<00:12:19.029><c> yeah</c><00:12:20.029><c> if</c><00:12:20.509><c> you're</c><00:12:21.049><c> gonna</c><00:12:21.169><c> have</c><00:12:21.319><c> to</c><00:12:21.379><c> get</c>

00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:21.499 align:start position:0%
that yeah if you're gonna have to get
 

00:12:21.499 --> 00:12:22.689 align:start position:0%
that yeah if you're gonna have to get
rid<00:12:21.649><c> of</c><00:12:21.679><c> someone</c><00:12:21.979><c> you</c><00:12:22.129><c> might</c><00:12:22.220><c> as</c><00:12:22.339><c> well</c><00:12:22.459><c> start</c>

00:12:22.689 --> 00:12:22.699 align:start position:0%
rid of someone you might as well start
 

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:24.729 align:start position:0%
rid of someone you might as well start
disliking<00:12:22.909><c> them</c><00:12:23.539><c> so</c><00:12:24.289><c> therefore</c><00:12:24.470><c> the</c>

00:12:24.729 --> 00:12:24.739 align:start position:0%
disliking them so therefore the
 

00:12:24.739 --> 00:12:26.259 align:start position:0%
disliking them so therefore the
disconnect<00:12:25.220><c> is</c><00:12:25.369><c> and</c><00:12:25.549><c> let's</c><00:12:25.909><c> remember</c><00:12:26.089><c> they</c>

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:26.269 align:start position:0%
disconnect is and let's remember they
 

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:29.109 align:start position:0%
disconnect is and let's remember they

00:12:33.809 --> 00:12:33.819 align:start position:0%
stuff that doesn't make sense I
 

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:36.819 align:start position:0%
stuff that doesn't make sense I

00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
say this there's I think where they were
 

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:42.549 align:start position:0%
say this there's I think where they were

00:12:44.499 --> 00:12:44.509 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a bad area necessarily
