00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.380
Where do forces come from?

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.790
All forces arise
from the interaction

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.290
of two objects with each other.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.530
In this example, we have
two objects, One and Two,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.761
interacting with each
other in this case

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:16.219
because their surfaces are in
contact with each other-- one

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.080
sitting on top of the other.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.410
And the interaction
between the two objects

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.770
gives rise to a pair of forces.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.360
I have one force that's acting
from object two down on object

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.860
one, and the other force
that's acting from object one

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.360
back up onto object two.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.890
And these forces, following
Newton's third law,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.220
are equal in magnitude
and opposite in direction.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.040
What if we now push
these blocks horizontally

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.080
in opposite directions?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.070
At their interface, there
is a frictional interaction.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.540
This interaction gives rise
to a pair of frictional forces

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.270
that are parallel
to the interface.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.510
The friction force on the top
block from the bottom block

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.450
is opposite in direction
but equal in magnitude

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.060
to the friction from the bottom
block due to the top block.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.660
Let's look at some of the common
misconceptions about forces.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.450
First of all, motion
is not a force.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.180
If I have a block that's
moving at a constant velocity

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.350
along a frictionless
plane, then there's

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.620
no horizontal force that's
acting on this block.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.890
Because there is no
interaction that would give

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.710
rise to a horizontal force.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.000
The fact that it has a
velocity does not necessarily

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.670
mean that there is a
force acting on it.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.350
Another common mistake
is to think that forces

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.410
transfer through objects.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.539
For example, if I'm pushing
a book against a wall,

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.500
it might seem like
the force from my hand

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.324
is being transferred
to the wall.

00:01:47.324 --> 00:01:49.240
But what is really
happening is that there are

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.610
two independent interactions.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.880
The interaction of my
hand with the book.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.920
And the interaction of
the book with the wall.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.990
And these are
separate interactions.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.790
The forces might happen
to have the same magnitude

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.310
in some cases.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.320
But it's not because
the force from my hand

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.110
is being transferred.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.788
Forces arise between
pairs of objects.

00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:12.936
And those forces can only
act on those two objects.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.329
Let's look more closely
at Newton's third law.

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.030
So Newton's third law says that
when there are two objects that

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.150
are interacting, there
will be two forces that

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.520
arise from that interaction.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.000
And these two forces are always
equal in magnitude and opposite

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.329
in direction.

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.329
These two forces, this Newton's
third law pair of forces,

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.560
never act on the same object.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.640
But instead one force acts
on the first object and one

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.420
on the second.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.510
Because these forces arise
out of the same interaction,

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.870
they have to be the
same type of force.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.550
So they could be gravitational
forces, frictional forces,

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.310
normal forces, et cetera.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.680
Let's look at an example of
a book sitting on a table.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.200
It's being pulled down by
the gravitational force.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.200
And it's being held up
by the normal force.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.451
Are these two forces a
Newton's third law pair?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.300
The book is not accelerating.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.990
So these forces are equal
in magnitude and opposite

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.120
in direction.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.810
But they cannot be a Newton's
third law for two different

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.710
reasons.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.720
First of all, they both act
on the same object-- the book.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.751
And second of all, they arise
from different interactions.

00:03:30.751 --> 00:03:33.250
The normal force on the book
is part of a Newton's third law

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.750
pair that comes
from the interaction

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.010
between the book and the table.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.810
What's the Newton's third law
pair of the gravitational force

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.630
on the book?

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.090
Well, because the
gravitational force

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.600
arises from the interaction
between the book and the earth,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.960
the other force in the
Newton's third law pair

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.579
is actually the force that
the book exerts on the earth.

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.290
You might not think about
the book acting on the earth.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.040
But the force is actually equal
and opposite to the earth's

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.080
force on the book.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.390
It's just that the earth
is so much more massive,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.200
the force has no
detectable influence

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.280
on the Earth's behavior at all.
