00:00:00.394 --> 00:00:03.088
- [Voiceover] So here's
something weird and cool

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:05.537
about English and languages in general.

00:00:05.537 --> 00:00:08.126
It's that they have a sense of number

00:00:08.126 --> 00:00:10.391
kind of encoded into them.

00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:13.046
We call this grammatical number.

00:00:14.446 --> 00:00:17.732
And the way this plays
out is in the difference

00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:21.888
between singular and plural in English.

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.849
The idea of there being one of a thing

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.889
or more than one of a thing.

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:35.729
More than one of a thing.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.423
There we go.

00:00:37.423 --> 00:00:40.152
And this extends throughout the language

00:00:40.152 --> 00:00:42.009
and I want to talk about today,

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.726
the way it applies to pronouns.

00:00:44.726 --> 00:00:49.726
So the singular form of me is me.

00:00:51.112 --> 00:00:52.470
Right, that's the singular form.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.932
The plural form of it, excuse me.

00:00:55.902 --> 00:00:59.646
The plural form of me is us.

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:04.587
Because you know, there are many.

00:01:04.587 --> 00:01:07.224
Assuming, okay, assuming I was cloned.

00:01:07.224 --> 00:01:09.523
There's one of me, fine, that's singular.

00:01:09.523 --> 00:01:13.306
But let's say I walk into like
a cloning machine, you know,

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.500
and it's like, a part of
it has got little bubbles

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.985
and it's full of this
weird, viscous liquid.

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:21.584
It shoots out another David.

00:01:21.584 --> 00:01:22.838
Suddenly there's two David's.

00:01:22.838 --> 00:01:23.965
May the earth tremble.

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:26.463
But how do we refer to ourselves?

00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:29.386
More than one me is us.

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:31.721
The grammatical number increases.

00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:33.729
I'm part of a group now.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.199
Or for a more normal
prosaic, non-cloning example,

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:41.102
let's say my sister and I
are going out for coffee.

00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:43.747
I'd refer to the two of us together as us.

00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:47.572
That's the grammatical
number, it's plural.

00:01:47.572 --> 00:01:49.090
So it's important to remember

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.354
when you are writing or speaking,

00:01:51.354 --> 00:01:54.628
to keep singular and plural straight

00:01:54.628 --> 00:01:56.312
throughout the course of a sentence

00:01:56.312 --> 00:01:58.030
or a paragraph because you don't want

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.597
to mislead people into thinking

00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:01.478
you're talking about something else.

00:02:01.478 --> 00:02:04.392
Let me show you what I mean.

00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:09.392
For example, I would say
I looked at my watch.

00:02:12.252 --> 00:02:13.796
I don't have a watch anymore.

00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:14.632
Do you have watches?

00:02:14.632 --> 00:02:16.072
Do people still have watches?

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:21.072
Now I wouldn't say, I looked at our watch,

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:29.098
unless, I don't know, a
partner and I shared a watch.

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:32.152
Unless my little sister and
I both had the same watch

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:36.958
and we traded it back
and forth each month.

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.153
Which is pretty unlikely
and kind of silly.

00:02:39.153 --> 00:02:41.509
And so what I'm trying to say is that

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:46.509
"our" doesn't agree, doesn't
match up with "I" or "my."

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:51.896
This is plural and this is singular.

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.609
That is a very strange
place to wear a watch.

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:58.994
What is that, at the elbow?

00:02:58.994 --> 00:03:01.351
Alright, so we've got
the dog wagged its tail.

00:03:01.351 --> 00:03:06.351
Dog is singular, its is singular.

00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:12.411
Want to make sure these things match up.

00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:16.850
We made our beds.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.774
This is plural and this is plural.

00:03:20.774 --> 00:03:25.774
As opposed to we made my beds.

00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:29.691
Which, who has multiple beds first of all.

00:03:29.691 --> 00:03:32.257
But it would also sound
like multiple people,

00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:37.257
including me, were assisting
me in making my many beds.

00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:42.995
There are two exceptions to this.

00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:50.145
And they are you and they.

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:56.665
And either one can be singular or plural.

00:04:00.127 --> 00:04:02.527
So there can be a singular
you or a plural you.

00:04:02.527 --> 00:04:06.000
There can be a singular
they or a plural they.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.762
And I'll explain more
about singular they later.

00:04:08.762 --> 00:04:12.662
The important thing is
to be consistent overall.

00:04:16.702 --> 00:04:18.710
So if you establish that
something is singular,

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.033
you need to maintain that singularity

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:24.016
throughout the rest of
talking about that thing.

00:04:24.016 --> 00:04:26.826
So if I'm talking about cantaloupe,

00:04:26.826 --> 00:04:29.567
and here's a test, can I spell cantaloupe

00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:30.971
in real time without looking it up.

00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:32.050
That looks right to me.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.231
The cantaloupe was delicious.

00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:41.231
In the next sentence, I would
say I ate it in one sitting.

00:04:46.772 --> 00:04:48.827
And it's not I ate them, it's I ate it

00:04:48.827 --> 00:04:51.636
because there's only
one cantaloupe, you see?

00:04:51.636 --> 00:04:53.773
That's what I mean
about grammatical number

00:04:53.773 --> 00:04:55.766
and grammatical number agreement.

00:04:55.766 --> 00:04:59.447
You just want to make
sure that this thing,

00:04:59.447 --> 00:05:02.975
which we call an antecedent,
links up with a pronoun.

00:05:02.975 --> 00:05:05.786
So the thing you say
before you use the pronoun

00:05:05.786 --> 00:05:10.411
has to match up in terms of
whether it's singular or plural.

00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:11.612
You get that figured out, you will be

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:13.341
a master of grammatical number.

00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:16.174
You can learn anything.

00:05:16.174 --> 00:05:17.725
David out.
