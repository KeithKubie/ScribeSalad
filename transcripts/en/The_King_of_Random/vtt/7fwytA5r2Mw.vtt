00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.040
For this project, I'm going to show you how
to make Proto-Putty. “Proto-Putty”s a

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.890
cool moldable dough you can press into nearly
any shape, but after 10 minutes, it magically

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.110
turns, to rubber. Bouncy, stretchy rubber.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.950
All your need for this project is a box of
food coloring, a tub of cornstarch, and a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.470
tube of 100% silicone.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.790
It’s extremely important you get silicone
#1, and you’ll be able to confirm that’s

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.790
what it is, by looking at the top of the tube.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.140
While you’re here, double-check your tube
is marked 100% silicone as well, just to be

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.199
sure.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.890
Now to minimize the mess we’re about to
make, it’s going to be helpful to have two

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.309
disposable paper bowls on hand.

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.149
Grab some food coloring and squirt a generous
amount into one of the bowls, remembering

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.039
that the more you use, the richer your “Proto-Putty”
color will become.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.020
The silicone caulking goes in next, so carefully
squeeze a big blob of it directly into the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.730
food coloring, until you feel like you’ve
got enough.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.379
Keep in mind that Silicone #1 releases “acetic
acid” vapors while curing, and smells so

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.660
strongly of vinegar that it’ll make your
nostrils sting. So you might want to think

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.620
about mixing this up outside, or at least
in a well ventilated area.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.489
Use something like a popsicle stick to slowly
fold the silicone and food coloring together,

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.830
and make sure you don’t mix it too quickly
or it might splash out and stain your clothes.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.090
You’ll be able to tell when the two components
are combined, because they blend nicely into

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.299
a solid, and uniform color.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.479
Now it’s important to note that as soon
as the food coloring is mixed the clock is

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.670
ticking, and we’ve only got about 10 minutes
of work time before this all starts hardening

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.760
up. But the problem is, this stuff is ridiculously
sticky and extremely difficult to work with.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.439
But if you drop the blob into a big bowl of
cornstarch, then generously coat the outside

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.259
with powder, the silicone becomes a lot easier
to deal with, because the powder prevents

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.189
it from sticking to anything.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.439
Now if you don’t want to turn your hands
different colors or end up with super sticky

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.579
fingers, now is the time to put on a pair
of disposable gloves.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.920
Of course gloves are optional for anyone feeling
adventurous, but you may regret not using

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.750
them. Just saying.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.171
Flatten the silicone blob down into the cornstarch,
then flip it over a few times, kneading it

00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:54.869
into different shapes, and repeating the process
about ten to fifteen times.

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.140
This will help tame the sticky nature of the
mess and make it a lot more manageable to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.509
work with.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.420
If any part of the silicone starts feeling
sticky again, just coat it with more cornstarch,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.080
and repeat the process until it losses all
of it’s tackiness.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.890
After around two minutes of kneading the cornstarch
in, the color of your silicone putty should

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.420
brighten back up and start feeling a lot like
like Play-doh.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.470
When it’s thoroughly mixed to the point
where it doesn't stick to your hands anymore,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.580
the “Proto-Putty” is finished, and ready
for immediate use.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.290
You can mold it, squish it, or press it into
whatever shape you want.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.811
Just remember, you’ve only got 5 - 10 minutes
of work time before it turns to rubber. So

00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:30.610
whatever you’re doing, make sure you do
it quickly.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.960
I tried making impressions of some stackable
plastic bricks, and you can see that after

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.190
only 15 minutes the rubber is already so stiff
we can pull it out of the mold.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.430
Popping the bricks out, you can see they’ve
left a perfect impression in the putty, and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.940
created a fun little mold that looks remarkably
similar to kind I made in a previous video.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.300
The final product is extremely stretchy, very
rubbery and amazingly durable as well.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.240
Now this idea works because general purpose
silicone, is activated by moisture.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.910
So by blending in a generous amount of food
coloring, the silicone gets triggered, and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.730
instantly begins the curing process.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.490
Just for fun I squished up a ball a left-over
putty, and watched it harden into an interesting

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.280
ergonomic stress ball made just for me.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.600
Perhaps this would be a quick and easy way
to make a custom pair of rubber handle grips.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.260
Now if you want to have even more fun with
your “Proto-Putty”, try mixing a batch

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.030
with “Neon” food coloring instead.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.920
I used “Neon Green” to make a batch, and
pressed it over an acrylic mold I designed

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.020
for a different project, then gently wrapped
the edges up around the sides to let it set.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.680
20 minutes later you can see the rubber has
cured, and we’ve got ourselves a cool little

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.090
mold for making custom bars of soap.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.310
I formed another chunk into a hook shape,
and pressed it onto my wall, to make an improvised

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.110
key hook for hanging car keys.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.470
I made a clip for my workbench to prevent
power cables from pulling out of place.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.920
And I even tried wrapping some around a fork,
to make an ergonomic handle grip, that fits

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.100
the shape of my hand perfectly.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.400
Now I was curious to see what the “Proto-Putty”
would do if we didn’t use any cornstarch

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.330
at all, so I whipped up another big batch
and slopped it straight into the mold.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.230
Surprisingly, it still only took about twenty
minutes to completely set up, into a version

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.670
even stretchier, and perhaps even more durable
and resilient than it was before.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.180
The problem is that without cornstarch, it’s
difficult to work with, and really hard to

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.590
remove air bubbles trapped at the bottom.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.860
Now check this out. If you want to fuse two
of your rubber creations together, all you

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.730
need is a dab of fresh “Proto-Putty” to
bind them.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.040
Press the pieces together, let the putty cure,
and just like that, the two, have become one.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.410
“Proto-Putty” is a fun rubber that’s
surprisingly bouncy, which means you can make

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.510
rubber toys, roll your own bouncy balls, or
make just about anything else you can think

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.510
of.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.040
I tried rolling a piece of yellow putty into
a loop, and turned it into a custom silicone

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.040
wristband.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.440
Then pressed another piece into a taco shape,
which made a custom rubber base for watching

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.450
movies on my smartphone.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.130
This quick and dirty pinch pot is great for
storing paper clips at the office, and I even

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.470
tried making a screw-on lid for Mason jars.
Which is easy to use, and surprisingly watertight

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.600
as well.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.470
“Proto-Putty” is fairly stretchy in general,
but the thicker you make it, the more durable

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.490
it’s going to be.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.850
It works great for impression casting, like
making half-molds of little glass bottles,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.880
but if you’re tempted to use it for making
custom candy molds, you might want to reconsider.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.910
Construction Silicone can be harmful if swallowed,
and can cause serious side effects if it gets

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.090
inside your body.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.530
So rather than using it to make candy molds,
it’s probably better to just make toys,

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.970
crayons, or little rubber erasers instead.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.810
Well now you know how to use a few simple,
and very common materials, to make huge batches

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.290
of “Proto-Putty” on a budget.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.600
So you can channel your power of creation,
and make anything you want.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.140
By the way, there’s a different kind of
“Food Grade” silicone you can use for

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.230
making candies, and I’ll put a link in the
description to where you can find it.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.910
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.910
others.
