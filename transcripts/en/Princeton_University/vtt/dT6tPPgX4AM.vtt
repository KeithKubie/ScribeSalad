00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.610
DAVID DOBKIN: I'm David Dobkin,
and I'm Dean of the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.430
Faculty and a professor
of computer science.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.410
JOE SCANLAN: My name
is Joe Scanlan.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.770
I'm director of the visual arts


00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.720
program here at Princeton.


00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.970
DAVID DOBKIN: The exhibit is
really focused on a lot of

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.170
different kinds of things that
I've collected over time.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.480
JOE SCANLAN: I curated the show
and I thought a show by

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.370
David in conjunction with a
class that would be about the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.800
role or the idea of the amateur
in art would be a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.380
perfect combination.


00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.410
DAVID DOBKIN: I think the first
of the collections in my

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.030
life that's represented here
is snow globe paperweights.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.290
I have a lot of them.


00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.190
This is a snow globe
from Graceland.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.150
This is a birthday
paperweight.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.950
There are thousands of objects
here, and it would be fair to

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.210
say that I remember 99% of
where they came from.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.000
JOE SCANLAN: So the class that
the exhibition is in

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.630
conjunction with is Contemporary
Art and the

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.990
Amateur, and it's offered by the
interdisciplinary doctoral

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.490
program in the humanities.


00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.430
DAVID DOBKIN: There are parts
of it that have a lot of

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.230
computer science--I mean


00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.020
the keyboards, the CDs,
the floppy disks.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.690
I've taken quite a few pictures
in my day, lots of

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.990
pictures of waiters and
waitresses and menus and signs

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.840
that I saw along the way, for
example, signs that say

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.530
employees must wash hands,
signs that say

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.720
please curb your dog.


00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.940
I think if it's a sign and I've
seen it, I've taken a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.930
picture of it.


00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.150
I've written software to
maintain libraries of digital

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.870
pictures, and I did this
before hashtags became

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.960
popular, but I created my own
version of hashtagging.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.510
So they're all identified in a
way that you couldn't hope to

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.690
do without a computer.


00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.210
JOE SCANLAN: It has a
kind of category.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.870
It's known as task-based art,
and it's where the artist has

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.970
discovered that kind of state
that you go into when you're

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.950
doing something that's very
routine or repetitive, and

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.170
it's a kind of bliss.


00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.640
DAVID DOBKIN: So when I get new
pennies, I have to figure

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.320
out the date.


00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.880
So this is 1992.


00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.100
And then I work my way around
and I say, 1995, four, three,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.140
two, and up goes the penny.


00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.460
JOE SCANLAN: I was very happy
that David agreed to do the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.810
show in its own right as a show
by someone who's been

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.940
making work for 20 years,
if not his whole life.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.750
And then I was also very touched
by his willingness to

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.800
be a Guinea pig, really, for the
idea of this class, and to

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.180
be an example, a shining
example, of what it wanted to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.390
talk about.


00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.130
DAVID DOBKIN: A lot the pictures
you see, a lot of

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.640
things you see constructed,
are in and of themselves

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.050
boring but if you step back and
say, well, life is really

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.120
about the details and it's the
details that make life work,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.490
this is filled with life and
it's filled with the details

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.740
that make life work.
