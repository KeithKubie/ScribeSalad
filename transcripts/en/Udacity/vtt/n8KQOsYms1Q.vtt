00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.120
Today, we'll talk about explanation-based learning.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.090
In explanation-based learning, the agent doesn't learn about new concepts.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.218
Instead, it learns about connections among existing concepts.

00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:15.210
We'll use explanation-based learning to introduce the notion of transfer of

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.810
knowledge from an old situation to a new situation. This will help us

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.530
set up infrastructure needed for talking about analogical reasoning next time.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.240
Today, we'll start by talking about a concept space where we will map out all

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.590
the concept and relationships between them. Then we introduce the notion of

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.090
abstraction that helps us do transfer. Finally, we'll use transfer to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.717
build complex explanations that will lead to explanation-based learning.
